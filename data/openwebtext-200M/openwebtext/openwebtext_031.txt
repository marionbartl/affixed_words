We Evil Mad Scientists like Halloween .
A lot .
You might have already seen our old - school Cylon Jack - o - lantern .
Here is another halloween electronics project , hopefully in time for you to make your own :
It ’s a radio - controlled robotic Dalek that can move around and turn its head .
Oh , and did I mention that it ’s a pumpkin ?
Here ’s the victim , a standard size grocery - store pumpkin with a nice thick mottled skin .
You might also see that it tapers down slightly ; it ’s slightly wider at the top than the bottom .
I went to a local junk shop and picked up two heavy rubber wheels , which will be the drive wheels .
The wheels will mount to a couple of standard servo motors , shown for scale .
I also picked up a cheap office - chair caster , which will be the third wheel .
We need a total of three motors ; two drive motors and one to rotate the head .
For each of these applications , I used a standard servo motor , modified for continuous rotation according to these instructions .
The instructions suggest replacing the pot in the servo motor with a pair of fixed resistors .
While I believe that that is ( in principle ) the best way to go , I was unable to make it work in several tries– probably just due to the poor tolerance on my resistors .
So , I replaced the original 5 k pots with minature trimpots like the one shown here .
This is quite nice because you can easily trim the zero - point of your servo motor .
For the platform , I took a large and blank printed circuit board and cut it to shape .
( Big tinsnips work quite well for this ; hardly anything else short of a hydraulic shear works at all . )
I drilled a couple of extra holes for wiring and for cable ties to hold the servo motors in place .
The wheels were glued to the round servo horns on the outputs of the two motors .
This turned out to be the weak point in the whole system , as they had a tendency to fall off .
The problem is this : the pumpkin is really heavy , which had n’t really occurred to me when I built this part .
The servo motors are actually great for this ; they are strong and fast , but in this particular case , they need to turn a shaft , not just the wheel itself .
Here is the radio system .
It ’s a Hitec Focus III single - stick system .
It has a third control channel on the back ( not visible ) .
One of the nice features that it has is servo mixing , intended for use in certain types of model airplanes .
Servo mixing changes the thrust and steering mode from that of a radio - control car ( one motor controls thrust , one controls direction ) to that of a radio - control tank , where both motors are involved in thust and steering control .
( With servo mixing enabled , the left - right and up - down controls are summed and differenced such that pushing the stick in the “ up ” direction causes both servos to move in opposite direction , pushing the robot forward .
Similarly , pushing the control stick left or right causes the robot to turn .
The third channel of the radio control system is not affected by the mixing option . )
The receiver and the three servo motors are powered by four AAA batteries .
For longer run times , you can of course use larger batteries .
The third servo motor controls the rotation of the head of the Dalek .
The actual mechanism is a large plastic bearing with worm - gear mechanism ; it was originally the system to rotate the pen carousel on an old HP drafting plotter .
I adapted the drive shaft to be turned by the third servo motor , which was also modified for continuous rotation .
One of the challenges was how to adapt this device to hold the heavy lid of the pumpkin .
I opted to impale the lid on a few corn holders , so I attached them to the carousel as you see here .
Because of the shape of the pumpkin , we decided to carve it upside down .
The “ head ” of the Dalek that you see here is actually the bottom of the pumpkin .
We took the “ lid ” of the pumpkin , which has the stem , and cut it up like crazy with a melon baller , as you can see on the right .
Here is the most time - consuming stage of the build : Carving the pumpkin .
I cut fourteen flat faces into the lower sides of the pumpkin .
In doing so , I removed much more material from the pumpkin than I did during the stage of removing the seeds !
After getting the shape correct , the punpkin balls ( well , hemispheres ) were attached with toothpicks .
Final touches :
The “ eye ” and two “ ears ” are pieces of carrot .
Instead of the toilet plunger and paint rollers that the originals had , I used a hand - mixer beater paddle and a candy thermometer .
I think that they both work pretty well .
Overall , however , the shape is almost too round to be recognized as a Dalek .
But , we are somewhat constrained by the shape of the pumpkin .
With a bit of work , you could make a pretty good R2D2 by the same method .
I hope someone else does that because I ’m not planning to . =)
Now : Pimp your Dalek !
Add one of those blinky lights that indicates when its talking .
Download some Dalek voices , and put them inside the pumpkin with a speaker .
The possibilities are endless !
We also made a short movie of our Dalek moving around a bit .
You can see that the alignment of the head rotation motor is rather poor , but other than that it seems to work admirably .
Watch it on YouTube .
Finally a few links , as long as we ’re on the subject of Daleks .
Check out the Dalek Jack - o - lantern , Dalek troops , the Snow Dalek , and lots of cool Lego Daleks .
If you do download the Dalek voices from the BBC to put in your pumpkin , note that Daleks prefer iPods .

Biologists at the University of California , San Diego have found that the main color differences among Florida ’s mice — which are darker on the mainland , but lighter on the barrier islands to blend in with the white sand dunes — are largely due to a simple genetic mutation .
Their discovery , detailed in the July 7 issue of the journal Science , is one of the first to demonstrate how a small change in a single nucleotide — the smallest subunit of a gene — can affect the survival and evolutionary fitness of an organism in the wild .
Because the mice differ not only in overall color , but in pigmentation pattern , the study also provides geneticists with a first step toward understanding how color patterns , such as zebra stripes and leopard spots , are generated in animals .
And it raises the possibility that other vertebrates , such as mammoths , also evolved similar color variations using the same genetic mutation .
In a companion paper published in the same issue of Science , researchers in Germany report the discovery of this same mutation within DNA extracted from a 43,000 - year - old bone of a wooly mammoth preserved in the permafrost of Siberia .
Because the variations occur in the same nucleotide used by the Florida beach mice to alter their coat color , the University of Leipzig scientists say , populations of mammoths during the last Ice Age were likely composed of dark - and light - coated individuals .
“ While there is growing evidence that phenotypic differences between organisms , like humans and chimps , are largely controlled by changes in gene regulation , these two studies are striking examples of how amino acid changes in structural proteins can also be important , ” says Hopi Hoekstra , an assistant professor of biology at UC San Diego who headed the team that discovered the genetic roots of the color differences in Florida ’s mice .
The coat pattern and color differences among populations of mice on the mainland and the barrier islands off the Florida Gulf and Atlantic coasts have been studied extensively since the 1920s , first by Francis Sumner of UCSD ’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography .
Sumner used the mice as a textbook example of how small , geographically isolated populations could adapt to their new environments and diverge into distinct subspecies .

Known to scientists as Peromyscus polionotus , mice living on the mainland have dark coats , which help them blend in with the vegetation and avoid their main predators — owls , hawks and herons — that hunt prey by sight .
But on five barrier islands off the Florida Gulf coast and three off Northern Florida ’s Atlantic coast , geographic isolation of the populations has resulted in eight distinct subspecies of beach mice , each with distinctive coat patterns that are lighter in color than their mainland counterpart .
“ We know from geological evidence that the barrier islands are very recent , less than 6,000 years old , ” says Hoekstra .
“ So these color mutations may have evolved rapidly . ”
While scientists have been studying the genetics of complex coat patterns of these mice for nearly a century , few suspected that the simple mutation of a single nucleotide could have such a major impact on their coloration .
“ We were surprised that this one gene could explain up to 36 percent of the variation we see in the mice , ” she says .
“ It ’s a large effect mutation .
And what it says is that adaptation does not always occur gradually , but may happen in these relatively large jumps . ”
Hoekstra and her colleagues — Rachel Hirschmann of UCSD ’s Division of Biological Sciences and Richard Bundey and Paul Insel of UCSD ’s Department of Pharmacology — discovered the single nucleotide mutation in the melanocortin - 1 receptor , a gene which regulates the pigmentation of hair color .

In laboratory mating of the different subspecies to produce genetic crosses , the UCSD scientists report in their paper that the variations of this gene account as much as 36 percent of the color variation in Gulf Coast mice .
Surprisingly , however , this mutation was absent in the two Atlantic Coast subspecies , even though these Atlantic coast beach mice have similarly light colored coats .
The results suggest that beach mice gain their light coloration through different genetic mechanisms .
“ There is apparently more than one way genetically to become a light - colored beach mouse , ” says Hoekstra .
Other genes also contribute to the differences in the coat patterns among the mice .
But , concedes Hoekstra , “ We know very little genetically about how coat patterns are generated in mammals .
This study is a first step toward understanding this complex genetic process . ”
Unfortunately for the scientists , the subjects of their study are disappearing rapidly .
One of the eight original subspecies studied by Sumner has since become extinct and six of the seven remaining subspecies are considered endangered because their habitats are being destroyed by human development .
“ These mice exist on beautiful white - sand beaches , inhabit the sand dunes and feed on sea oats , ” says Hoekstra .
Their pristine habitat is being destroyed by human development coupled with hurricanes .
“ Unfortunately these mice like the same habitat where people want to build beach homes and the two do n’t coexist well together , ” she adds .
“ The mice are now only found in protected areas , and hurricanes become a big threat because these beach mouse populations , which are so wonderfully adapted to their environment , are now small and fragmented . ”

Why Apple Wo n’t Open Source Its Apps
Tim Bray ’s “ Time to Switch ? ” is a nice tangent to my “ And Oranges ” piece from Thursday ; he ’s considering the same Mac OS X - to - Ubuntu route as Mark Pilgrim , and he lists both reasons why he wants to switch , as well as some of the issues that would make it unpleasant .
( His three cited “ hard issues ” that ’d make it difficult to switch more or less boil down to seamless hardware - OS integration ; the “ it just works ” factor that has always been one of the biggest differentiating factors of the Mac : sleep / wake - up for laptops that just works ;
WiFi that just works ; and external display and video projector support that just works . )
Bray also suggests — and this is something he ’s pitched a few times before — that Apple ought to release the source code to several of the applications that come bundled with the OS :
In particular , it ’s bothered me for years that the Apple apps are n’t Open Source ; there are all these irritating little misfeatures and shortcomings that I ’d be willing and maybe able to fix , and there are lots more like me .
Since the apps are joined at the hip to OS X , there ’d be no real downside to Apple .
The real problem , it seems to me ( and I think this bothers Mark more than he says ) , is Apple ’s paranoid communication culture : it is forbidden to say anything except what it ’s compulsory to say .
Apple ’s exterior is polished , shiny ; and entirely opaque .
Personally , I think their success has been about shipping good products , but I think they believe it ’s a consequence of the tightness of the lip .
I ’d rather do business with a company I can talk to .
He does have a good technical case for why Apple might want to do this .
His argument , more or less , is that Apple does n’t need to be protective of the source to these apps ( e.g. Mail , Safari , iCal , iChat ) for competitive reasons , because they ’re inextricably tied to Mac OS X technologies like Cocoa .
If they released the source to iCal , it ’s not like it would be that much of a help in allowing someone to port it or knock it off on Windows or Linux .
It ’d probably be easier to do a rip - off of these apps on another platform by completely re-implementing them rather than using their actual Cocoa source code .
I.e . Bray is addressing the very common managerial reaction to the idea of open sourcing proprietary software — that you ca n’t do it because your software is a competitive advantage , and that giving your competitors the source code to your apps would give away your advantage .
I think Bray is right that this does n’t really apply to the apps Apple bundles with the system — these apps are a valuable asset and a major component of the appeal of Mac OS X , but their strength is in their UI design , not in the code that implements the designs .
Anyone can rip off the best aspects of iCal or Mail just by looking at them .
Bray further argues , correctly , that the source code to these apps would be tremendously valuable as a learning tool for Mac developers .
Many good programmers , if not most , prefer to learn by examining working example code .
Bray even makes it clear that he’d be happy with lowercase open source , meaning that Apple could release the source code under a somewhat restrictive license ( i.e. not an Open Source license ) that would forbid using the source code for software on platforms other than Mac OS X .
These are all good points .
But , unfortunately , Apple still ca n’t do this .
Well , technically , wo n’t do this , but the reasons why they wo n’t are so strong that it might as well be can’t .
( Or , rather , the reasons are so strong from the perspective of Apple ’s executive management , which is really all that matters since that ’s who would need to make the decision . )
Bray is right that releasing the source code to these apps would be unlikely to hurt Apple competitively against Windows or Linux , but he overlooks another form of competition : existing versions of Mac OS X .
The role these apps play is n’t just to make Mac OS X look good compared to Windows or Linux , but also to help make each new version of Mac OS X look better than the previous one ; i.e. to convince Mac users that it ’s worth paying for the latest upgrade .
If the source code to these apps were made available , the best features from new versions of these apps could be ported back to previous versions , lessening the incentive for users to upgrade .
Consider iChat .
It seems quite possible that one of the features planned for the 10.5 version of iChat might be tabbed chat windows , 1 and that this feature would be considered a selling point for the OS .
But if iChat were already open sourced today , it ’s almost a certainty that someone would have already added tabbed windows to it .
Kent Sutherland ’s Chax is an input manager hack that adds tabs ( and a slew of other features ) to iChat .
It ’s a clever hack , and works as advertised , but to me , it very much feels like a hack .
I.e. it does n’t come close to looking or working the way “ tabbed iChat ” would look / work if tabbed chat windows were added to iChat by Apple .
If Sutherland had access to iChat ’s source code , he probably could have added tabs to iChat in a vastly less hacky ( if not altogether unhacky ) way .
That might be great for iChat users , but it would n’t be great for Apple if they were hoping to use tabbed chat windows as a selling point for Mac OS X 10.5 .
Just take a look at the “ new features ” marketing for Tiger ; about half of it revolves around new features in the apps Bray wants to see open sourced .
The problem is that even though Apple does n’t charge for these apps separately ( like they do with the iLife and iWork suites ) , these apps are n’t really gratis .
They ’re parts of the OS — not in the technical sense , but in the product packaging sense .
When you buy a new version of Mac OS X , you do n’t just get the operating system , you get the OS plus a bunch of apps .
It ’s not in Apple ’s interests to add high - profile cool new features to its applications in between major OS releases , and it would n’t be in Apple ’s interests to allow enterprising outside developers to do so , either .
This is one reason why Web Kit , the rendering framework , is open source , but Safari , the application , is not .
The development strategy of unveiling all these new features at once — in both the OS itself and in the bundled apps — has been extraordinarily successful for Apple .
How many software products can you think of that have users lining up around the block for a midnight release party ?
It ’s reasonable to assume that major new releases of Mac OS X would still be successful even if Apple released several of its bundled apps as open source , but would they be as successful ?
Even if you think they would be — that not one sale ’s worth of enthusiasm would be spoiled — you certainly can’t prove it .
And it seems to me extremely hard to make the case that such a strategy would result in a net increase of sales of new versions of Mac OS X .
Worse , I think it ’s easy to make the argument that it would hurt sales .
These bundled apps like Safari , iChat , and iCal are one of the biggest differences between Mac OS X and the classic Mac OS ; back then there was never as much application software that shipped “ for free ” with the OS .
And even the “ free ” browser and email client came from Microsoft , not Apple .
I think these apps are a big reason why new releases of Mac OS X are a much bigger deal , publicity - and enthusiasm - wise , than new releases of the classic Mac OS were .
( There were no midnight release parties for Mac OS 8.6 . )
In short , releasing the source to these apps would be a risk .
Not a risk with a catastrophic downside , but a risk nonetheless .
And the potential upside — the best case scenario from Apple ’s perspective — would n’t result in any additional sales .
So why take a chance ?
Why mess with a strategy that has proven to be lucrative ?
You can argue that this sucks , that it ought to be us , the users , whose interests matter most .
And that you should n’t have to pay $ 130 to upgrade your entire OS if the only new features you ’re interested in are in just one of the bundled applications .
But that ’s not how it works .
Apple is a for - profit corporation , and Mac OS X is one of their most profitable and most successful products .
Perhaps you find it particularly galling that I ’m more or less saying that the reason they ’re not going to do what Bray suggests — despite the fact that following Bray ’s suggestion really would be cool for users and developers in all sorts of ways — is that it might cost them upgrade sales from users who have already paid for previous versions of Mac OS X .
Such gall is one factor that drives people to open source platforms .
But there ’s a flip side to this equation , which is that developing good software takes time and talent , and time and talent cost money .
Some portion of the revenue from sales of Mac OS X goes back into funding development of future versions of Mac OS X .
This is the dichotomy between closed and open source software development .
I ’m right there with Bray regarding the frustration of using an app that ’s very cool and really good but that there ’s just a couple of small things that I ’d rather see done differently or better , but which I ca n’t fix or change other than by petitioning the developer to implement my suggestions .
( Good luck writing “ Dear Apple ” letters asking for tweaks to their software . )
But while open source software is , by definition , eminently tweakable , it also , in general , is less likely to get to the point of being very cool and really good in the first place .
( E.g. where ’s the open source calendar app that ’s as simple and uncluttered as iCal ? )
Of course there are exceptions , like , say , Adium , the open source Mac OS X chat client that a lot of people flat - out prefer to iChat .
It has a most excellent tab implementation and supports a bunch of IM platforms that iChat does n’t , like Yahoo and MSN .
Or Camino , the excellent Mac-native offshoot of the Mozilla project , and which compares pretty well against Safari .
But no one is trying to make a buck by selling licenses or upgrades to Adium or Camino .
Open source software tends to improve in small , steady , frequent increments .
Established commercial software tends to improve less frequently but in large gulps so as to entice users to pay for upgrades .
The fact that Apple ’s Macintosh business still fundamentally revolves around profits from hardware sales does mean that it ’s possible that they could heed Bray ’s suggestion ( I ’d say Safari would be the mostly likely candidate , considering the success of the Web Kit project ) , and if they do , I ’ll be happy to have been wrong .
But do n’t hold your breath .
Like many people in and near Baton Rouge , Mrs. Smallwood , her 1,700 - square - foot house now sheltering 14 people , is trying to balance the need for compassion with the vertigo of a changed city .
And so while she wishes all the evacuees well , she said she feared an influx of people from the housing projects of New Orleans , places , she has heard , where people walk around in T - shirts that read , " Kill the cops . "
" Or so the story has it , " she said .
" Those are n't neighborhoods I go to . "
She was so rattled , she said , she told her daughter she might have to move .
On reflection , she said , there is little chance of that .
Instead , she is hoping for the best .
" People are , what 's the word ?
Not frustrated , not scared , it 's more like their lives are on hold , everything 's changed and we 're trying to figure out what the new normal is going to be , " Mrs. Smallwood said .
Many relief workers and volunteers say the worries over crime reflect more wholesale stereotyping of people fleeing a catastrophe than anything based in fact , but safety is a major issue .
At the height of the post - storm panic last week , people waited in line for three and a half hours at Jim's Firearms , a giant gun and sporting goods store .
Many were people from New Orleans with their own safety issues .
But many were local residents jumpy about the newcomers from New Orleans and stocking up on Glock and Smith & Wesson handguns .
Jim Siegmund , a salesman at Jim 's recently returned from military service in Iraq , said he did not think there was anything to worry about .
Still , holding a cellphone in his hand and comparing it to a 9 - millimeter handgun he said : " When push comes to shove , this wo n't protect you , but a Glock 9 will . "
Joel Phillips , a 38 - year - old contractor , said he had never owned a gun in his life , but after watching an angry argument at a gas station , he stood in line for three hours at Jim's to buy a 9 - millimeter Ruger handgun and then went with a friend to a firing range over the weekend to learn how to use it .
" I have two daughters , I sometimes have to work in bad neighborhoods , " Mr. Phillips said .
" I probably do n't need it , but I 'll feel better knowing that I have some protection . "
What obsessed Angelo Haligiannis was the bracelet .
Every white - collar criminal hates the bracelet .
At home with nothing to do , they ca n’t stop looking at it , fussing with it , trying to wish it away .
It was the same piece of ankle jewelry that Martha Stewart wore , the same one she ’d joked about having learned how to disable on the Internet .
For the fourteen months that Angelo had been under house arrest at his parents ’ place in Manhasset — grounded , essentially , at Mom and Dad ’s , while he awaited sentencing — the electronic monitoring device had emitted a tiny radio signal to record every time he came within 150 feet of a receiver the government had put in the house .
Twice a day , as a condition of his bail , Angelo was required to check in by phone with the federal court ’s Pretrial Services division .
To make sure he was n’t really calling from , say , the French Riviera , the Pretrial Services officer would check the bracelet .
If the signal was received , all was well ; if not , a set of protocols kicked in , starting with calls to friends and relatives and culminating with alerting airports and enlisting federal marshals to start a manhunt .
To someone like Angelo , who at 33 had made it as far as he had in life by mastering the most sophisticated financial game in the history of capitalism , the bracelet must have seemed ridiculously vulnerable — less like the device that tormented Will Smith in Enemy of the State and more like something you ’d pick up for your feisty border collie at Petco .
The bracelet itself was plastic — “ tamper - resistant , ” the government called it , but not tamper - proof .
There was no command center with a phalanx of military personnel staring at a tiny light blipping on a digital screen , tracking his every move ; there was no satellite that tipped off the police if he stepped too far from the front yard .
The real weakness was obvious and therefore never likely far from Angelo ’s thoughts : the absurd length of time it takes for anyone to recognize that a convict has gone missing .
The government , strangely , does n’t monitor its home - confined white - collar felons directly or around - the - clock .
Instead , it depends on a subcontracted private company to use the bracelet ’s signal to draw up reports on every “ program participant , ” noting every early departure or late return home and each failure to return home after an authorized absence .
Those write - ups only come out daily .
Until the following day ’s report , what Angelo did between his breakfast and dinner phone calls was entirely his own business .
Angelo ’s prosecutor had warned the judge about this very loophole a year earlier , in an impassioned , failed request to deny him bail : Anyone can cut the ankle bracelet .
Anyone with a little money can buy a fake passport , slip into Canada or Mexico , then board a plane for who knows where .
Anyone can disappear with an eight - hour head start — gone until dinner before he ’s even missed .
Most do n’t , of course , because in the great cost - benefit analysis of life , the cost of leaving usually outweighs the benefit :
There is the near certainty of more jail time if you ’re caught , for starters , plus bail and the property put up as collateral behind it , not to mention the loved ones you ’re forced to leave behind .
The trick , if you decide to flee , is not minding the consequences — having , perhaps , an unhealthy appetite for risk .
January 10 was supposed to be Angelo ’s last day of freedom , the day before he was expected to be sentenced to at least fifteen years in a federal prison .
That morning , he awoke in Manhasset and made his usual call to the federal monitoring center before eight o’clock .
Shortly after he hung up , he drove with his father , Vasilios , to his father ’s welding and ironworks company in Maspeth , Queens , where the court had allowed him to spend some weekdays .
He was expected home at four - thirty or five .
Not long before noon , Angelo told his father that he needed to drive into Manhattan to see his defense lawyer .
Without fanfare , he hopped in his dad ’s black Grand Cherokee and started toward the city .
But he never made it to his lawyer ’s ; the truth was , he never even had an appointment .
And that night , he did n’t come home .
Pretrial Services called the house shortly after Angelo blew the seven - o’ clock curfew .
Where was he ?
His parents said they did n’t know .
Next came more calls — to his wife , his sister , his in - laws , and to the airports .
The protocols had kicked in .
The judge issued a warrant for Angelo ’s arrest the next day .
Federal marshals took a week to find the Jeep parked on 39th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues .
They had Angelo ’s father open the door and immediately saw a pair of wire cutters on the back seat — and the bracelet in the front , on the floor .
He was gone .
It ’s not easy to make your name among the Ivan Boeskys and Mike Milkens and the other Wall Street white - collar - crime Hall of Famers — but Angelo Haligiannis is doing his best .
Few have risen so far so fast :
He was a college dropout with one year of experience on Wall Street who built an $ 80 million hedge fund out of nothing in just four years .
Few conducted their schemes quite as audaciously : Angelo must be the only con man to have taken money from his sister , his in - laws , and the widow of a firefighter who died on 9/11 .
And once his fund proved to be nothing more than a glorified Ponzi scheme , Angelo joined an even more rarefied club : the select few who , shortly before sentencing , pull a vanishing act .
Wherever he is now — and the manhunt continues — the federal marshals assigned to his case believe he has enough money stowed away to stay there for some time .
What no one knows is what turned a bright kid from Queens into one of Wall Street ’s most notorious grifters .
And why , when he got busted , he risked even more and ran .
Success in the hedge - fund world came easily to Angelo — perhaps too easily .
Born and raised in Flushing ’s Greek - immigrant community , he went to Catholic school , bused tables at a neighborhood restaurant , and had a passion for souping up the engine of his Mustang GTS .
He left NYU in his junior year , telling people that he had graduated early ( in fact , he had dropped out ) , and took a job at Merrill Lynch as a broker ’s assistant .
Friends say he was instantly smitten with the perks of high finance — “ the lifestyle , getting the limo ride home at night , all that , ” says one .
Angelo stayed at Merrill just thirteen months — enough time , he decided , to take what he ’d learned and strike out on his own .
Hanging his own shingle did n’t surprise those who knew him .
“ Even as a waiter , he was a total salesman , ” says a friend .
“ If there was ten bottles of wine sold in a night , he probably sold eight of them .
He had that charm , that charisma .
It was like a little power trip for him . ”
Living out the fantasy of nearly every 23 - year - old Wall Street grunt , Angelo registered his hedge fund , Sterling Watters Group , in Delaware at the end of 1995 .
He opened three brokerage accounts ( at Banc of America Securities and Chase in the States , HSBC in the Cayman Islands ) and rented a desk at Worldco , a day - trading company at 110 Wall Street , where he immediately set about making bold trades in the tech market .
This was the coming - out moment for hedge funds — the time they changed from arcane investment tools for billionaires to the must - have portfolio accessory for anyone hoping to outsmart the market .
Hedge funds are essentially high - risk , high - reward mutual funds , pooling multiple investors ’ money into one enterprise , though compared with mutual funds , hedge funds are almost completely unregulated .
The fund manager , who usually works for 20 percent of the winnings , plus a small management fee , is free to dabble in stocks , bonds , derivatives — anything — without having to disclose exactly what he does and when he does it .
Because of the additional risk , hedge funds are usually open only to investors with a net worth of at least $ 1 million .
Angelo found his own niche — friends and family .
About half of Sterling Watters ’s 80 investors met Angelo through the Greek - American social network in Queens .
Who better to make the market seem safe to these people than a kid who was one of them — especially a kid like Angelo , with the apparent smarts of a Wall Street insider and the hunger and grit of an outsider ?
Angelo understood that even working stiffs in his old neighborhood , if they owned a home , were sitting on a net worth of at least a million dollars .
At first , he advertised a minimum buy - in of $ 500,000 , but he soon started bending the rules for people he knew , like his old boss at a restaurant in Queens , his childhood friends who ’d grown up to become lawyers and doctors , and family members , too , like his sister , Evelyn .
Angelo tapped another pool of clients from Michael Capul , a tall , portly broker whom he ’d worked for at Merrill and who went on to work at Chase Investment Services .
Angelo ’s marketing approach was a blend of technical Wall Street–speak and no-frills , just - us - guys approachability :
In his first brochure , he described the fund as “ a top - down aggressive capital appreciation fund ” that combined “ macroeconomic analysis ” and “ exhaustive quantitative proprietary modeling . ”
With his neighborhood contacts , Angelo employed an aloof , cocky version of the soft sell — never exactly coming out and asking for money , just going on in dizzying detail about how well he was doing .
With interest rates diving , Angelo ’s investors would take out second mortgages and dump the money into Sterling Watters .
When Jerry Drenis , another contact from the Greek social network , started refinancing his family ’s real - estate holdings to invest in Sterling Watters , Angelo offered to find him an attorney to assess the tax consequences of selling .
They had a warm phone relationship that blossomed when they turned up at the same parties .
“ Listen , ” Jerry would say .
“ I have some money on the side , personal money .
I ’m waiting for permits , I ’m building a new house , and there ’s some money , but I need to keep it liquid . ”
“ Jer , give me the money , ” Drenis remembers Angelo saying .
“ I know I have the restrictions where you have to withdraw quarterly , but for you I ’ll make an exception .
It ’s just stupid , your letting the money sit in the bank now .
You ’re earning small returns . ”
Drenis invested more than $ 700,000 in the spring of 2002 , and close to $ 1 million in installments in 2003 — then , in early 2004 , he agreed to invest nearly $ 5 million , funds all from refinancing his family ’s real - estate holdings .
“ It was a no - brainer , ” Drenis says now .
“ He was making 10 percent a quarter . ”
Angelo was actually making more than that .
Within a year , Sterling Watters reported a net annual return on its investments of 53.93 percent , more than doubling the S&P 500 ’s 22.96 percent gain for 1996 .
A year later , the fund nearly tripled the market , claiming a 76.04 percent return .
The year after that , Sterling Watters fell a few points short of the market ’s gains , but in 1999 , Angelo reported that he ’d more than quadrupled the S&P ’s 21 percent , earning a return of 87 percent .
Living well may have been the best advertising for the fund :
His friends and investors did n’t fail to notice his black Porsche 911 Turbo and his $ 10,000 - a- month apartment in the Beekman in the East Fifties .
He set up personal accounts at the Palms , the Bellagio , and the Venetian in Las Vegas , the Tropicana and the Borgata in Atlantic City , and Foxwoods .
As if his parents could be any prouder , he also married a beautiful girl from the old neighborhood : Liz Batalias , a dark - haired , olive - skinned NYU M.B.A. daughter of Greek immigrants .
Liz ’s family was wealthier than Angelo’s .
Her father , Michael Batalias , owns the construction company EMD Contracting in Long Island City , and he reportedly threw the couple a six - figure wedding in Crete ( and invested nearly $ 3 million in Sterling Watters ) .
Liz ’s brother , Louie Batalias , was the best man .
In time , there was a daughter , Christina , born in 2003 .
“ He made no secret that he was living large , ” says Jim Ziosis , a Greek - American investor who owns a home - décor business in Mineola .
“ And he made no secret that because he and his family made so much money with the fund , he was getting them all new cars and that his sister ’s wedding was going to be at Cipriani’s . ”
Many of Angelo ’s investors altered their own lives accordingly .
“ Some people said , ‘ Why am I killing myself working twelve hours a day when we ’re making hundreds of thousands of dollars a quarter with Sterling Watters ? ’ ” says Ziosis .
“ Vacations , home additions , cars .
There was a lot of that .
We all believed we were making a ton of money . ”
Angelo ’s luck started changing at the beginning of 2000 , the year the tech market began correcting itself and the S&P dipped by 9 percent .
That same year , Angelo , who had just moved into a spacious office on the 55th floor of the Citigroup building , published an “ investor kit ” claiming the fund had cumulative returns of 1,073 percent from 1996 to the second quarter of 2000 , and eventually reported that Sterling Watters had posted another dazzling net return ( 41.45 percent ) for all of 2000 .
In reality , the Securities and Exchange Commission says , Angelo ’s fund lost $ 17 million in 2000 .
It was Angelo ’s first losing quarter , and he faced a decision : Report the losses as any manager would do , or fudge the numbers and try to make a quick comeback before anyone caught on .
According to the SEC , this was the first quarter Angelo published false balance statements .
He was never able to turn things around .
As the 2000 tech correction turned into the 2001 nasdaq crash , then into the 9/11 bust and the Iraq War bust , Angelo ’s losses , and his deceptions , grew more and more grandiose .
In 2002 , Angelo said that Sterling Watters had a net return of 17.24 percent when , the SEC now says , it lost $ 5 million .
As the fund continued to dwindle , Angelo needed fresh cash to cover his losses .
Which is why , by early 2004 , he was so eager for Jerry Drenis to invest his $ 5 million .
By the time Drenis scheduled a wire , Angelo had lost his practiced cool , calling him every hour .
“ Where ’s the money ? ” Drenis remembers Angelo asking him .
“ The money did n’t come ! ”
Drenis told Angelo the bank was probably sitting on the money until the end of the day .
“ I ’m telling you , your bank is screwing you ! ” said Angelo , according to Drenis .
“ Today ’s a great day !
The market is positive !
You know how much money you ’re losing ? ! ”
The $ 5 million arrived on February 2 .
Months later , Angelo ’s operation began to show cracks .
To cover the interest payments on the property he ’d refinanced at Angelo ’s insistence , Drenis had arranged for Angelo to pay the mortgages with money from his investments ( allegedly worth $ 9 million or $ 10 million at the time ) .
But Drenis ’s disbursements from Sterling Watters were arriving days and even weeks late , he says , and only after he ’d call Angelo to scream at him about it .
This was supposed to be petty cash for a fund that Angelo claimed was now worth $ 180 million — $ 100,000 checks here and there — but the checks never seemed to be forthcoming without a fight .
Angelo always had an excuse — “ I thought you said May 1st , ” he ’d said in April , according to Drenis .
Then Drenis started calling investors he knew , seeing if they were having problems with Angelo .
He ’d made similar due - diligence calls months earlier , before making his $ 5 million investment , and had n’t heard an unkind word .
This time , though , Gus Karayiannis , Angelo ’s old boss at the Queens restaurant , told him that Angelo ’s check to him for $ 135,000 had recently bounced .
Drenis ’s heart sank :
If you ’re running a $ 180 million hedge fund , Chase does n’t bounce your $ 135,000 check .
“ Let ’s use some strategy for a change , ” a desperate Angelo wrote to a once - reliable source of new investors .
“ I seriously do n’t know what ’s going on lately , bro , but it is n’t this hard to close business . ”
Outwardly , Angelo still appeared to be doing fine .
He ’d bought the $ 2 million beach house for his parents ; his trips to Vegas and Atlantic City continued .
But in truth , Angelo ’s situation was growing dire .
He ’d taken out a second $ 250,000 mortgage on his house to try to reinvest and cover some losses .
More friends were pressing him to disburse millions of dollars that he did n’t have : $ 302,000 to Michael Capul , $ 530,000 to his childhood friend Chris Pavlatos , and more than $ 5 million to Jim Ziosis .
Desperate for new investors , Angelo dashed off a panicky , typo - filled e-mail in April of 2003 to Capul at Chase :
Let ’s use some STRATEGY to try and close some business for a change , instead of this laid back casual shit we ’ve been doing that has gotten us nothing but redemptions .
I seriously do n’t know what ’s going on lately , bro , but it is n’t this hard to close business .
It use to be good that we hitched our carts to eachy others horses , but this shit is getting tired .
I want a strategy in place here on how we ’re goiung to go forward … if we cant then just say so and I ’ll stop hassling you .
By then , the SEC now says , Angelo had stopped trading entirely .
The fund had less than $ 150,000 .
Jerry Drenis knew about none of this , but he did know about a bounced check .
He thought of going to the district attorney , or the SEC , or the FBI , or the police .
Then , just as quickly , he shoved those thoughts aside .
He had $ 8 million sitting with Angelo , at least on paper ; if there was the slightest chance of getting it back , he could n’t say a word .
Others made that same calculation .
As May turned to June , as many as 50 of Angelo ’s 80 investors had asked for their money back and were cooling their heels while Angelo dodged phone calls and buried their redemption orders in paperwork .
Nobody wanted to kill the golden goose .
After weeks of getting the runaround , Drenis was starting to panic .
“ Just prove to me that the money exists , ” he said .
“ Then I ’ll leave you alone . ”
Finally , Angelo appeared to give in .
“ Okay , ” Drenis says Angelo told him , “ I spoke to my private banker at Chase — a girl in Texas .
And she ’s gonna call you . ”
Drenis dialed Chase immediately .
After countless transfers , he found the woman Angelo was referring to .
Drenis says the woman put him on and off hold for an hour , then came back on the line and said , “ Yes , the money ’s in the account . ”
“ I almost pissed in my pants , I was so excited , ” says Drenis , who called his sisters and started celebrating .
He ’d have the wire after lunch .
A few hours passed .
No money .
He called Chase again .
Angelo ’s private banker was in a meeting .
“ Get her out of the freaking meeting ! ”
When the woman finally came to the phone , she sounded as if she ’d been crying .
“ I ’m so sorry , ” she said , according to Drenis .
“ Angelo made me lie . ”
“ What do you mean ? ”
“ When I was on the phone with you , he was on the other line .
He was begging me to tell you the money is there . ”
Drenis says he froze .
“ He was begging you ? ”
“ He was saying that you people were harassing him — and you would n’t leave him alone — and he just needed some time to get the money in .
Now I ’ve been trying to call him , but I ca n’t find him ! ”
( According to a lawyer involved in the matter , the banker denies any wrongdoing . )
Angelo offered another explanation , Drenis says :
The money was offshore , tied up in something less than legal , hard to extract , just be patient .
But Drenis was done .
On Thursday afternoon , July 29 , he walked into the U.S. Attorney ’s Office at St. Andrew ’s Plaza on Centre Street , filled out a complaint form , and left his name and number .
He was a block away when his cell rang .
“ Come back , ” said the voice .
“ We want to talk to you . ”
The next morning , Drenis called Angelo at his office and , to his surprise , found that Angelo was interested in meeting with him .
They agreed to meet at Angelo ’s lawyer ’s office on Park Avenue .
Before leaving , Drenis called the man who had called his cell the previous afternoon : investigator Richard Krause from the U.S. Attorney ’s Office .
Drenis had spent much of the afternoon with Krause and assistant U.S. attorneys , and while he quickly learned that he was n’t the first person to have come to them about Angelo ( that distinction is said to belong to Jim Ziosis ) , he was the first to furnish Krause with reams of documentation to help them make a case .
That morning , he told Krause that if he wanted to arrest Angelo , he knew where he would be inside of an hour .
Krause told Drenis he ’d wait in Angelo ’s lawyer ’s lobby until Drenis called him .
An hour later , sitting in a conference room with Angelo and his attorney , John Harris , Drenis quickly learned what was on Angelo ’s mind .
Harris says he has a dim recollection of this meeting , but Drenis recalls that Angelo said that someone had made a menacing call to his wife , Liz , in Greece , where she and the baby were vacationing .
“ Who threatened my wife ? ” he asked .
Drenis sensed another smoke screen .
“ I can give you names of a lot of people , ” he said .
“ Forget about it , and give us the money back . ”
Then , for the last time , he asked the question he ’d been asking for weeks : “ Do you have the money ? ”
Angelo stalled again .
“ I will , ” Angelo said .
“ Today . ”
Drenis pulled out his cell and dialed Krause .
“ Yeah , Dad ? ” he said .
“ I ’m with Angelo , and he does n’t have the money . ”
Minutes later , Drenis saw them through the conference - room window — Krause and his men , flashing their warrant at the front desk .
Angelo ’s lawyer was summoned , then he came back for Angelo .
“ Come with me , Angelo , ” Harris said .
Angelo walked over and heard what Krause had to say .
He glanced at the paper in Krause ’s hand .
Then he looked back over toward Drenis — shaking his head , not saying a word .
But his lawyer could n’t help himself .
“ Now , ” he said , “ you ’re never gonna get your money back . ”
The SEC and the Justice Department say that Angelo collected roughly $ 80 million from investors , which Angelo claimed he ’d parlayed into the $ 180 million , at least on paper .
Accounts vary , but Angelo is believed to have spent or pocketed between $ 19 million and $ 50 million and lost the rest in the market .
Chief among the victims was the Drenis family , which invested nearly $ 8 million and walked away with $ 732,000 .
The list of aggrieved parties is peppered with childhood friends like Marvin Base ( $ 1 million ) , family members ( his in - laws lost $ 2 million ; his sister , Evelyn , $ 1 million ) , Greek - American connections like Ziosis ( about $ 1 million ) , and even strangers like the Goktekin family , Turkish immigrants who lost almost $ 1 million and could n’t pay their daughter ’s medical - school tuition .
The most poignant victim is Susan Barnes , whose firefighter husband , Matthew , died on 9/11 .
She lost $ 2.35 million — every penny she had invested in Sterling Watters , and most of it straight from the victims - compensation fund .
By all accounts , she had n’t even met Angelo ( Michael Capul was her banker at Chase ) , but Angelo collected the bulk of her investment just a few weeks before his arrest .
( It ’s a painful truth that the last ones to enter a Ponzi scheme are the ones left with nothing at all . )
In Barnes ’s only known communication about the case , a letter to the judge , her attorney explained that the trauma of losing the money felt like losing her husband all over again .
The bilked investors descended like a lynch mob at Angelo ’s November 9 bail hearing , held before Judge Loretta Swain in the federal courthouse downtown .
“ Poor Judge Swain , ” one lawyer says .
“ She ’s so decorous .
She usually says , ‘ Thank you all for coming . ’
Then she looks over the trial well into the audience and says , ‘ Thank you all for coming . ’
Then this time , before she knows it , there ’s a brawl .
This one guy is saying , ‘ You killed my father ! ’ ” On the way out of the courthouse , after another hearing , Angelo ’s lawyer discovered the words BURN IN HELL scrawled in lipstick on his Porsche .
The following September , Angelo pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and one count of investment - adviser fraud .
Four months later came his scheduled sentencing .
Those who were there on January 11 remember the courtroom being unusually quiet , like a church .
After a long wait , a court officer whispered to one lawyer , “ Angelo is in the wind . ”
Instead of sentencing Angelo that day , the judge issued a warrant for his arrest .
Why did he do it ?
Why did n’t he just own up to his losses like any other manager would ?
Perhaps because Angelo was n’t any other manager :
He was a kid in his late twenties who came into the market at a time of historic growth and rode that wave to stratospheric returns .
When the inevitable downturn came , Angelo had no reference point .
He had no way of knowing that the bear market might stick around for a while .
“ There was an element of believing that all he needed was time , ” says a source close to the U.S. Attorney ’s Office .
“ But it ’s not an on - off switch .
And the more you get desperate , the more you do horrible things . ”
( Angelo ’s criminal attorney , Maranda Fritz , wo n’t comment on her client other than to say he was a well - intentioned kid who made a lot of money for a lot of people before getting in over his head . )
Angelo was also in deeper than a lot of money managers because his investors were family and friends .
“ Everyone ’s been coming to you for some time saying you ’re doing great , treating you like a financial wizard and a savior , ” says a source close to the prosecution .
“ It ’s a status thing .
You ’re admitting that you ca n’t beat the markets every time and you ’re not as infallible as you thought you were . ”
Finally , to Angelo , the near - total absence of regulation and oversight of hedge funds must have seemed like a joke .
Or an invitation .
Angelo ’s calculation to run must have looked something like this :
If he stayed , he ’d have to do as many as fifteen years and pay millions in compensation and fines .
He ’d also lose access to whatever money he may have hidden away offshore — and the ability ever to trade again .
Then there was his family .
Liz would probably divorce him ; her family is said to have urged her to leave him , and one source says that by last January she ’d moved out of her in - laws ’ basement , where Angelo was under house arrest .
And Christina would grow up seeing her father behind bars .
“ Angelo would never have tolerated the daughter being brought in to see him , ” a friend says .
One aggrieved investor says Angelo began calling him every hour to make a $ 5 million deposit .
“ Today ’s a great day !
The market is positive !
You know how much money you ’re losing ? ! ”
So he could run .
In that scenario , there was no jail time , assuming he was resourceful enough not to get caught ; the possibility of accessing millions in foreign accounts ; even , perhaps , the ability to do business again , out of reach of the laws of the United States .
Yes , there would be some sacrifices .
His parents had put up a $ 1 million bond for his bail , secured by the house in Flushing where Angelo grew up .
If he left , the home would be lost to the Feds .
He would n’t see Liz or Christina again for years , perhaps ever .
But factor in a fondness for the finer things in life , an excessive comfort with risk , and an almost pathological sense that he could beat just about any system , and Angelo ’s choice probably was n’t much of a choice at all .
Some experts wonder why more white - collar criminals do n’t try to put off prison by fleeing .
“ I think it ’s remarkable that Bernie Ebbers drove himself to jail for twenty years , ” one former white - collar prosecutor says .
“ Why not flee ?
Go to Canada , go to Mexico ?
You ’re starting with people who do n’t have a straight moral compass .
They do a moral calculus where they decide to try life on the run and put this problem off .
Anything can happen before sentencing , but then you go . ”
Most fugitives drop out of sight for months or years before reaching out to loved ones .
Angelo waited just a few days before calling his wife .
Liz told the marshals about a week after his disappearance that he had been calling — telling her he was okay , asking how Christina was doing .
Angelo ’s first call came from his grandmother ’s house in Athens , Liz told the marshals .
But by the time she was talking to them , she said , Angelo had moved on and she did n’t know where he was .
Liz has told the marshals she did n’t know of Angelo ’s plans to flee and is n’t helping him now ( she declined to be interviewed for this story , but her attorney adamantly maintains she ’s done nothing wrong ) .
Living in Manhattan with Christina and working for her father ’s construction company , she has told the marshals she ’s trying to move on with her life .
The marshals believe , however , that Liz knows more than she ’s let on .
From the start , getting even basic information from her has been “ like pulling teeth , ” says the deputy marshal in charge of Angelo ’s case ( it ’s against the agency ’s policy to reveal agents ’ names ) .
All summer , the marshal says , Liz appeared to be feeding him just enough information to keep them from making an obstruction - of - justice case against her .
One day last month , the marshal says , she let it slip that she ’d been sharing snapshots of Christina with Angelo on the Internet .
Since then , he says , she ’s insisted the marshals speak to her through her lawyer .
As recently as last November , the marshal says , Liz and Angelo made several trips to the Greek embassy .
Once , Angelo claimed that he ’d lost his old passport and needed a new one .
Another time , Liz called to ask for their marriage to be registered in Greece , perhaps so that Angelo , who was native - born , might get a Greek passport .
The marshal notes that these were naïve efforts ;
Angelo in no way qualified for dual citizenship , and besides , his name was on a warning letter the U.S. Attorney ’s Office had sent to the Greek authorities .
If Liz is cooperating with Angelo , her motivation , victims suspect , is money .
Even after all the losses and lavish spending , Drenis calculates Angelo could still have millions stashed away .
After all this time , in other words , Angelo still could be the golden goose .
“ I think this was his fail - safe plan , ” says Drenis .
“ Maybe his wife and his kid will meet up with him at some point . ”
The marshals believe Angelo is still in Greece , though he may be visiting other countries using a false I.D.
Their last hard lead came this summer , when a record of his driver ’s license was found in a Greek casino ( I.D. ’s are required to enter casinos in Greece ) .
Other leads have gone nowhere :
They ’ve looked for bank accounts here and offshore but have n’t found any .
They ’ve tried tracing Angelo through the prescription drugs he needs to treat an autoimmune condition called CIDP ( chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ) , but in Greece , it turns out , all medicines are sold over the counter .
“ It ’s like tracking vitamins , ” a marshal says .
The marshals continue to work with the Greek government on locating him — a provisional arrest warrant is already prepared — but for reasons unknown to the marshals , the local authorities have been slow to act .
( The marshals ’ contacts in the U.S. embassy in Greece wo n’t comment on continuing investigations . )
In the end , it seems that unless Liz is helping him and either slips up or turns on him , or Angelo ’s money starts running out , or his illness takes a turn for the worse , or Interpol turns up a new lead , it ’s unlikely that Angelo will be brought home again .
Back in January , after searching all over Manhattan for the Jeep at garages and impound lots , the marshals eventually just called Liz : “ The next time he calls , ” they told her , “ ask him where the car is . ”
Sure enough , Angelo called , Liz asked , and he told her .
When the marshals found the Jeep , they also tracked down a videotape that was shot from a camera mounted on a nearby office building .
There , on the afternoon of January 10 , is the last known sighting of Angelo Haligiannis , shutting the door and strolling down the sidewalk toward Eleventh Avenue — out of the frame and into the unknown , without , it seems , a worry in the world .
AT THE age of two , Terence Tao could already add up and subtract using the magnetic numbers his parents stuck on the fridge .
At eight , he scored better than 99 per cent of 17 - year - old prospective university students on an international aptitude test for mathematics .
The Adelaide - born prodigy was appointed a professor at 24 , and now , at 31 , has become the first Australian to win a Fields Medal , the mathematics equivalent of a Nobel prize .
The award was presented in Madrid yesterday by Spain 's King Juan Carlos I at a congress attended by 4000 international mathematicians .
Professor Tao , of the University of California in Los Angeles , was honoured for being a " supreme problem - solver " who has made breakthroughs in areas including wave motion and prime numbers - which have applications in fibre optics and information security .

Perl , the first postmodern computer language
Perl , the first postmodern computer language
The following is the text of Larry Wall ’s talk at Linux World on Wednesday , March 3 .
He explains why Perl is a fitting language for the postmodern era .
As a member of the audience commented : “ Another mindbender from Larry . ”
Highlights ( Which Should Convince You To Read the Text in its Entirety )
Thank you all for coming .
I was hoping the title of this talk would scare away everyone who should n’t be here .
Obviously I should have made up a scarier title …
Perl meets Godzilla ?
Bambi meets Perl ?
I just did an interview for Feed Magazine .
When I read their intro to it , I was interested to see that they made reference to my ``curious speeches . ”
I ’ll take that as a compliment .
Why I take it as a compliment is the subject of this speech .
That ’s assuming this speech actually has a subject , which is still in doubt .
Hey , at least it has a title .
That ’s something .
By the way , I ’m planning to leave some amount of time at the end for Q and A , so you should start thinking about the Q part while I ’m talking .
When I was invited to talk here , it occurred to me that most of the people here would be more interested in Linux than in Perl , so , in the interests of universal harmonic convergence , I thought I should talk about both Perl and Linux .
To do that , I had to figure out what Perl and Linux have in common .
Besides the obvious , of course .
Obviously , both Perl and Linux owe a lot to Unix culture , but this is well documented .
If I merely pointed out the obvious commonalities , I ’d have to talk the whole time about things you can find out from the manuals .
( Or should I say , things you ought to be able to find out from the manuals ?
Whatever . )
I ’m not here today to teach you how to use Perl or Linux .
I ’m not here to teach you what Perl or Linux are .
I ’m here to talk about why Perl and Linux have both been so successful .
Note that I ’m measuring success here not so much in terms of numbers of users , but in terms of satisfaction of users .
So I started thinking about deeper connections between Perl and Linux , and that led me to think more about the deeper reasons for writing software .
And that led to the subject of this talk .
I ’m going to start off talking by about postmodernism .
After that , I ’ll switch to talking about postmodernism .
And at the conclusion , I ’ll return to the subject of postmodernism .
However , since this talk is itself a postmodern work of art , I ’ll be dragging in all sort of other cool things along the way , so maybe you wo n’t fall asleep .
Nowadays people are actually somewhat jaded by the term ``postmodern ” .
Well , perhaps jaded is an understatement .
Nauseated might be more like it .
But , anyway , I still distinctly remember the first time I heard it back in the ‘ 70s .
I think my jaw fell and bounced off the floor several times .
To me it was utterly inconceivable that anything could follow modern .
Is n’t the very idea of ``modern ” always associated with the ideas ``new ” and ``now ” ?
The idea was so inconceivable to me that it took me at least ten seconds to figure it out .
Or to think I ’d figured it out .
As a musician , the pat answer occurred to me almost immediately .
I was familiar with the periods of music : Baroque , Classical , Romantic , and Modern .
Obviously , if there were to be a period of music following the Modern , it would have to be called something other than Modern .
And postmodern is as good a name as any , especially since it ’s a bit of a joke on the ordinary meaning of modern .
Obviously the Modern period was misnamed .
But , as I said , that was the pat answer .
The Modern period was not misnamed .
True , the ordinary word ``modern ” is associated with ``new ” and ``now ” , but the historical period we call Modern chose to associate itself with the ``new ” and the ``now ” in such a deep way that we actually see the breakdown of the whole notion of periods .
The Modern period is the period that refuses to die .
The world is now an odd mix of the Modern and the postmodern .
Oddly , it ’s not just because the Modern refuses to die , but also because the postmodern refuses to kill the Modern .
But then , the postmodern refuses to kill anything completely .
For example , it ’s been several decades now since a certain set of Bible translations came out , and you ’ll notice a pattern : the New English Bible , the New American Standard Bible , and the New International Version , to name a few .
It ’s really funny .
I suspect we ’ll still be calling them ``new this ” and ``new that ” a hundred years from now .
Much like New College at Oxford .
Do you know when New College was founded .
Any guesses ?
New College was new in 1379 .
A couple of days ago I was discussing all this with my daughter on the way to school .
As usual , I turned on the radio to hear the news , and Heidi immediately started surfing all the music stations .
Since this is one of the perils of fatherhood , I only said , ``I have to talk about postmodernism on Wednesday .
What should I say ? ”
She said , ``Like , it ’s all about how you do n’t have justify everything with a reason anymore .
You can just put in stuff because you like it , you know , because it ’s cool .
With Modern stuff you always had to justify everything . ”
I said , ``I still feel like I have to justify Perl all the time to a lot of people . ”
She settled on a station with some interesting music , and said , `` This is Dave Matthews ’ Band .
The thing that ’s really cool about him is that he , like , went out and found all these different artists who have different styles , and combined them all in ways you ’ve never heard before . ”
I said , ``Is n’t it interesting how postmodernism has become so much a part of our culture that it ’s sort of fading into the woodwork ? ”
Heidi frowned and said , ``Dude , dad , it ’s not like it ’s some kind of a fad .
Postmodernism is deeper than that –it really is the culmination of everything that went before it .
Like , it ’s all about coming full circle .
It ’s not like we ’re going to stop wanting to do that next week . ”
I said , ` `I suspect you ’re right .
After all , the various earlier periods of music were measured in centuries . ”
`` It ’s not just music , ” she said .
`` Well , of course not , ” I replied , ``all these things go together , but some disciplines change at different rates .
The reason I ’m giving this talk on Wednesday is because I think there ’s still a big streak of Modernism running through the middle of computer science , and a lot of people are out of touch with their culture .
On the other hand , I ’m not really out to fight Modernism , since postmodernism includes Modernism as just another valid source of ideas .
In fact , Perl contains lots of modern ideas from computer science .
Along with all the rest of the ideas in there . ”
Heidi said , `` You wanna know something really funny .
In my IMP class , our class slogan is , ‘ There ’s more than one way to do it . “ ’
`` You ’re kidding , ” I said .
[ I should also say that that IMP stands for Interactive Math Program , which is a math curriculum in which you sort of learn everything at once .
In sort of a postmodern way . ]
Anyway , I said , `` You ’re kidding . ”
``No , ” she said , `` That ’s why IMP is better for math students like me–we learn better when we can see the big picture , and how everything fits in .
The old way of learning math never gave you any context ” .
While I was digesting this , and thinking about how it applied to computer science , she went on , ``Well , it ’s like , you know , we have this saying at school , when somebody gets uptight about something , we say : ‘ Tsall good .
If someone is depressed , we say : ‘ Tsall good . “ ’
`` But you do n’t actually think everything is good , do you ? ”
`` No , of course not . ”
`` Are you saying that everything has good elements in it ? ”
`` No , Dad , I think when we say that , we ’re saying that , overall , things are good .
Like , look at the big picture , do n’t just focus in on the two or three bad things that are happening to you right now . ”
I report this conversation to you not just because I think my kids are cute and smart , but also because I think it ’s important that we know where our culture is going , and because it ’s our kids that will shape our culture in the future .
I do n’t think I could have defined postmodernism better than Heidi .
Look at the big picture .
Do n’t focus in on two or three things to the exclusion of other things .
Keep everything in context .
Do n’t go out of your way to justify stuff that ’s obviously cool .
Do n’t ridicule ideas merely because they ’re not the latest and greatest .
Pick your own fashions .
Do n’t let someone else tell you what you should like .
‘ Tsall good .
That ’s all well and good , but I ask you , if it ’s all good , why , in every other breath , does my daughter say `` That sucks . “ ?
There ’s a mystery here , and if we can fathom it , perhaps we ’ll learn a thing or two .
I think that what ’s going on here is that our culture has undergone a basic shift , one that is actually healthy .
It used to be that we evaluated everything and everyone based on reputation or position .
And the basic underlying assumption was that we all had to agree whether something ( or someone ) was good or bad .
Most of us actually used to believe in monoculturalism .
Although even back then , we did n’t really practice it .
And in fact , you could argue that the whole point of Modernism was to break our cultural assumptions .
We could argue all day long about whether postmodernism came about because Modernism succeeded or because it failed .
As a postmodern myself , I take both sides .
To some extent .
This would bother a Modernist , because a Modernist has to decide whether this is true OR that is true .
The Modernist believes in OR more than AND .
Postmodernists believe in AND more than OR .
In the very postmodern Stephen Sondheim musical , _Into the Woods_ , one of the heroines laments , `` Is it always or , and never and ? ”
Of course , at the time , she was trying to rationalize an adulterous relationship , so perhaps we ’d better drop that example .
Well , hey .
At least we can use Perl as an example .
In Perl , AND has higher precedence than OR does .
There you have it .
That proves Perl is a postmodern language .
But back to the monoculturism of Modernism , or rather the assumption of monoculturalism .
Nowadays we ’ve managed to liberate ourselves from that assumption , by and large ( where by and large does n’t yet include parts of the Midwest ) .
This has had the result that we ’re actually free to evaluate things ( and people ) on the basis of what ’s actually good and what ’s actually bad , rather than having to take someone ’s word for it .
More than that , we ’re required to make individual choices , the assumption being that not everyone is going to agree , and that not everyone should be required to agree .
However , in trade for losing our monoculturalism , we are now required to discuss things .
We ’re not required to agree about everything , but we are required to at least agree to disagree .
Since we ’re required to discuss things , this has the effect that we tend to ``deconstruct ” the things we evaluate .
I ’ll talk more about the pros and cons of deconstructionism in a bit , but let me just throw out an example to wake you up .
The most deconstructed man on the planet right now is Bill Clinton .
The public , and later the Senate , chose to evaluate Bill Clinton ’s morality separately from Clinton ’s fitness to govern .
I ’m not going to comment on whether I agree with that decision , but I ’d just like to point out that this could not have happened thirty or forty years ago .
We were not postmoderns back then .
We had to have a whole president , or no president , so hanky panky going on back then as there is now ) .
Everything used to be in black and white , like our TVs .
We kept our presidents looking good until we got one we could n’t make look good , and then everyone switched to making the president look bad for a while .
But we never did deconstruct
Nixon the way we ’ve deconstructed all the presidents since Nixon .
Nixon is still monolithic , even though we ’ve managed to bypass him and deconstruct Kennedy in hindsight .
Perhaps it ’s all related to the saying that ``Beauty is skin deep , but ugly goes right to the bone . ”
If that ’s the case , I pity the person who ’s only skin and bones .
Now you may be wondering what all this has to do with Perl .
So am I .
I ’ll think of something presently .
Time passes …
While I ’m thinking about the next thing to say in my talk , let me say a bit more about deconstructionism .
I do not view deconstructionism as a form of postmodernism so much as I view deconstructionism as the bridge between Modernism and postmodernism .
Modernism , as a form of Classicalism , was always striving for simplicity , and was therefore essentially reductionistic .
That is , it tended to take things to pieces .
That actually has n’t changed much .
It ’s just that Modernism tended to take one of the pieces in isolation and glorify it , while postmodernism tries to show you all the pieces at once , and how they relate to each other .
For instance , this talk .
If this were a Modern talk , I ’d try to have one major point , and drive it into the ground with many arguments , all coherently arranged .
Instead , however , I let you see that there ’s a progression in my own thought process as I ’m writing .
I would pause in my talk at the same point that I paused in my thought process .
If I were a journalist , I ’d spend as much time talking about my angst in covering the story as I ’d spend covering the actual story .
And if I were building a building instead of writing a talk , I ’d let the girders and ductwork show .
These are all forms of deconstructionism .
I ’m still trying to think about how this relates to Perl , by the way .
More time passes …
I first heard about postmodernism in the late ‘ 70s at Seattle Pacific University from my wife ’s Lit Crit professor , Dr. Janet Blumberg .
Postmodernism came early to literature , so it ’s no surprise that we heard it first from a literary critic .
By the way , do n’t think of literary critics like you think of theatre critics .
Literary critics usually know what they ’re talking about .
Even if they ’re wrong .
Anyway , we heard it first from Dr. Blumberg , who was never wrong , so naturally we first thought about in in terms of literature .
In fact , most people still think of postmodernism as a kind of weird literature .
But postmodernism was also coming along in architecture too , as we were soon to find out .
Seattle Pacific was wanting to build a new science and math building , so they decided to recycle an old warehouse down by the ship canal .
Note the first element of postmodernism there –they were reusing something old , taking the good parts , and leaving behind the bad parts , though they probably did n’t say to themselves , `` This rules , ” or `` That sucks . ”
But I ’m sure they thought it .
Anyway , they combined the old with modern ideas about having a large open lab inside , and making the whole building solar heated .
They made it a comfy place at the same time , with a sunken study area containing sofas .
And they made all the girders and ductwork show , because they thought it was cool .
They also did it because it was postmodern , though they did n’t know that yet .
I think I know now how this relates to Perl .
When I started writing Perl , I ’d actually been steeped in enough postmodernism to know that that ’s what I wanted to do .
Or rather , that I wanted to do something that would turn out to be postmodern , because you ca n’t actually do something postmodern , you can only really do something cool that turns out to be postmodern .
Hmm .
Do I really believe that ?
I dunno .
Maybe .
Sometimes .
You may actually find this difficult to believe , but I did n’t actually set out to write a postmodern talk .
I was just going to talk about how Perl is postmodern .
But it just kind of happened .
So you get to see all the ductwork .
Anyway , back to Perl .
When I started designing Perl , I explicitly set out to deconstruct all the computer languages I knew and recombine or reconstruct them in a different way , because there were many things I liked about other languages , and many things I disliked .
I lovingly reused features from many languages .
( I suppose a Modernist would say I stole the features , since Modernists are hung up about originality . )
Whatever the verb you choose , I ’ve done it over the course of the years from C , sh , csh , grep , sed , awk , Fortran , COBOL , PL/I , BASIC - PLUS , SNOBOL , Lisp , Ada , C++ , and Python .
To name a few .
To the extent that Perl rules rather than sucks , it ’s because the various features of these languages ruled rather than sucked .
But note something important here .
I left behind more than I took .
A lot more .
In modern terms , there was a lot of stuff that sucked .
Now , on the feature set issue , Perl is always getting a lot of bad press .
I think people who give bad press to Perl ’s feature set should have more angst about their reporting .
I picked the feature set of Perl because I thought they were cool features .
I left the other ones behind because I thought they sucked .
More than that , I combined these cool features in a way that makes sense to me as a postmodern linguist , not in a way that makes sense to the typical Modernistic computer scientist .
Recall that the essence of Modernism is to take one cool idea and drive it into the ground .
It ’s not difficult to look at computer languages and see which ones are trying to be modern by driving something into the ground .
Think about Lisp , and parentheses .
Think about Forth , and stack code .
Think about Prolog , and backtracking .
Think about Smalltalk , and objects .
( Or if you do n’t want to think about Smalltalk , think about Java , and objects . )
Think about Python , and whitespace .
Hi , Guido .
Or think about shell programming , and reductionism .
How many times have we heard the mantra that a program should do one thing and do it well ?
Well … Perl does one thing , and does it well .
What it does well is to integrate all its features into one language .
More importantly , it does this without making them all look like each other .
Ducts should n’t look like girders , and girders should n’t look like ducts .
Neither of those should look like water pipes , and it ’s really important that water pipes not look like sewer pipes .
Or smell like sewer pipes .
Modernism says that we should make all these things look the same ( and preferably invisible ) .
Postmodernism says it ’s okay for them to stick out , and to look different , because a duct ought to look like a duct , and a sewer pipe ought to look like a sewer pipe , and hammer ought to look like a hammer , and a telephone ought to look like either a telephone , or a Star Trek communicator .
Things that are different should look different .
You ’ve all heard the saying :
If all you have is a hammer , everything starts to look like a nail .
That ’s actually a Modernistic saying .
The postmodern version is :
If all you have is duct tape , everything starts to look like a duct .
Right .
When ’s the last time you used duct tape on a duct ?
The funny thing is , Modernism itself was a kind of hammer , and it made everything look like something to be hammered .
The protest movement of the ‘ 60s was Modernistic : `` If I had a hammer , I ’d hammer all over this land . ”
The focus was always on the nail , or on whatever it was that was getting pounded .
And many things did get hammered in the Modern age .
Architectural beauty , for one .
That one is obvious just by looking at the skyline of any major city .
It ’s easy to tell which buildings were built in the 50’s and 60’s .
They ’re the ones that look like boxes .
When we first saw them , we thought they looked very modern .
Well , they did .
But when the Seattle First National Bank was built in , you guessed it , Seattle , we all made jokes about how it looked like the box the Space Needle came in .
At least the Space Needle was cute , kinda like the Jetsons were cute .
But the Space Needle was n’t really very functional , unless you go in for rotating restaurants .
In fact , at many different levels , Modernism brought us various kinds of dysfunction .
Every cultural institution took a beating .
Government took a beating .
Schools took a beating .
Certainly the family took a beating .
Everyone took a beating , because Modernism was about attacking problems .
Modernism was the hammer .
( I ’d like to make a pun on hammer and sickle here , but I ’m not sure what it would be .
Certainly Russia was more hammered than we were by Modernism , in the cloak of Marxism .
I know what it means to be hammered , but I ’m still trying to figure out what it would mean to be more sickled .
Hmm .
Unless that ’s talking about the Grim Reaper .
Russia has a lot of experience with that too . )
Anyway , back to our talk .
Modernism oversimplifies .
Modernism puts the focus squarely on the hammer and the nail .
In contrast , postmodernism puts the focus back onto the carpenter .
You ’ll note that carpenters are allowed to choose whether or not to use hammers .
They can use saws and tape measures if they choose , too .
They have some amount of free will in the matter .
They ’re allowed to be creative .
Especially if they ’re working on Mrs. Winchester ’s house .
Hey , it ’s right down the road , if you do n’t believe me .
So , to drag the subject back to computers , one of the characteristics of a postmodern computer language is that it puts the focus not so much onto the problem to be solved , but rather onto the person trying to solve the problem .
I claim that Perl does that , and I also claim that , on some level or other , it was the first computer language to do that .
I ’d also like to claim that , in many ways , it ’s still the only language to do that .
How does Perl put the focus onto the creativity of the programmer ?
Very simple .
Perl is humble .
It does n’t try to tell the programmer how to program .
It lets the programmer decide what rules today , and what sucks .
It does n’t have any theoretical axes to grind .
And where it has theoretical axes , it does n’t grind them .
Perl does n’t have any agenda at all , other than to be maximally useful to the maximal number of people .
To be the duct tape of the Internet , and of everything else .
You ’ve heard the joke , I ’m sure .
How is duct tape like the Force ?
It has a light side , and a dark side , and it holds the universe together .
Later in this talk , I intend to define the universe and give three examples .
I have to be honest here .
I ’m with Linus–I personally want to take over the world .
I want to take over the world because I ’m an egomaniac .
A nice sort of egomaniac , an egomaniac moderated by belief in the value of humility , but an egomaniac nonetheless .
Fortunately , I am not Perl .
Perl was my servant before it was anyone else ’s , so I taught Perl to be a better servant than I could ever teach myself to be .
Perl is like the perfect butler .
Whatever you ask Perl to do , it says ``Very good , sir , ” or ``Very good , madam . ”
Only occasionally does
Perl give you a stiff upper lip , or say ``Tsk , tsk . ”
But if you ask Perl its opinion , it will advise you on matters of taste .
``I ’m sorry sir , but bareword ‘ foo ’ is not allowed while ‘ strict subs ’ is in use . ”
Contrast that with the Modern idea of how a computer should behave .
It ’s really rather patronizing : ``I ’m sorry Dave .
I ca n’t allow you to do that . ”
The trouble with having a submissive servant is that it puts the burden back on you to make the decisions .
Come to think of it , that ’s the problem with having a submissive wife too .
My wife is very submissive .
She ’s always saying , ``I submit this problem to you because I do n’t want to decide it . ”
Ah , well .
If the burden of decision making is on the programmer , then it ’s possible for the programmer to make a mess of things .
It ’s possible for Perl programmers to write messy programs .
( In case you had n’t noticed . )
It ’s also possible for Perl programmers to write extremely clean , concise , and beautiful programs .
Let me state my beliefs about this in the strongest possible way .
The very fact that it ’s possible to write messy programs in Perl is also what makes it possible to write programs that are cleaner in Perl than they could ever be in a language that attempts to enforce cleanliness .
The potential for greater good goes right along with the potential for greater evil .
A little baby has little potential for good or evil , at least in the short term .
A President of the United States has tremendous potential for both good and evil .
I do not believe it is wrong to aspire to greatness , if greatness is properly defined .
Greatness does not imply goodness .
The President is not intrisically ``gooder ” than a baby .
He merely has more options for exercising creativity , for good or for ill .
True greatness is measured by how much freedom you give to others , not by how much you can coerce others to do what you want .
I remember praying a prayer when I was very young , not much more than a baby myself .
`` God is great .
God is good .
Let us thank him for our food .
Amen . ”
Well , I ’m here to say amen to that .
God ’s greatness and goodness are measured by the fact that he gives us choices .
He does n’t require us to thank him for our food .
( In case you had n’t noticed . )
God is not a Modernist .
He does n’t view us as nails .
God expects us to behave like carpenters .
Indeed , he gave us a carpenter as an example .
So I think God is postmodern .
He has his own ideas of what rules , and what sucks , and he does n’t expect everyone else to agree with him .
Mind you , he likes it when people agree with him .
I like it when people agree with me about Perl .
But I do n’t expect everyone to agree with me .
Of course , some of my loyal followers expect everyone to agree with me .
I try to think of it as an endearing characteristic .
Personally , I think the Perl slogan , There ’s More Than One Way To Do It , applies outside of Perl as well as inside .
I explicitly give people the freedom not to use Perl , just as God gives people the freedom to go to the devil if they so choose .
As long as we ’re in a demonizing frame of mind , please allow me to demonize Modernism a little more .
True , postmodernism admits Modernism as one source of inspiration , along with Romanticism , Classicalism , and , er , uh , Baroqueism .
Baroqueness ?
I always thinks it ’s a compliment when someone says Perl is baroque .
I just think of J.S. Bach .
He wrote a lot of way cool stuff .
Handel also had his moments .
Anyway , back to Modernism .
Postmodernism does draw some inspiration from Modernism .
And , in fact , postmodernism could not have come about without Modernism before it , because deconstructionism is simultaneously Modern and postmodern , being both reductionistic and holistic .
Be that as it may , Postmodernism has deconstructed Modernism and determined that large parts of it suck .
In religious terms , Modernism can be viewed as a series of cults .
And postmodernism is defined as an escape from those cults .
A kind of deprogramming , if you will .
Perhaps the title of this talk should have been , ``Perl , the first postmodern DEprogramming language ” .
We wo n’t go into the fact that ``Perl culture ” sometimes gets shortened to ``Perl cult ” .
I have to give credit where credit is due here .
And to show my ductwork .
I did n’t think of all this myself .
I was flying up to Seattle with my wife and my daughter ( yes , that one ) because my daughter is thinking about attending Seattle Pacific University , that hotbed of subversive postmodernism .
Surprise , surprise .
So I asked my wife about the differences between Modernism and postmodernism .
After all , one has to talk about something with one ’s spouse .
Especially in front of one ’s daughter .
Before I get into the list of Modernistic cults , though , I just remembered another cute story about Seattle Pacific .
The school had commissioned a Modern Artist to produce a Modern Art , you know the kind , a sculpture , if you can call it that , to be placed on the lawn out in front of student union building , on the corner of campus where anyone driving by could see it .
It was most definitely Modern .
It consisted of two large black surfaces , partly rounded and partly square , leaning against each other .
It was actually rather hideous .
You know the sort .
Well , one day we noticed that the large sculpture had had babies .
There were seven or eight of the cute little beggars , perfect little replicas huddling around their mommy .
It was wonderful .
It was precious .
It was funny .
At least , it was funny until the Modern Artist came storming in and , with no sense of humor at all , removed his work of art , threatening never to have anything to do with Seattle Pacific again .
Good riddance , we thought .
And smiled .
We ’re still smiling .
In case you had n’t noticed .
Anyway , back to cults .
The story I just told is illustrative of several of them .
First of all , we have the Cult of Spareness .
The example of Modern Art I just mentioned was very spare .
It was minimalistic .
It was almost an artless Art. Certainly the emotion it was trying to instill was something akin to hammering .
We felt like nails .
Many modern computer languages aspire to be minimalistic .
They either succeed in being minimalistic , in which case they ’re relatively useless , or they do n’t succeed in being truly minimalistic , in which case you can actually solve real problems with them .
A number of languages give lip service to the idea of minimalism , but merely sweep the complexity of the problem under the carpet of the programmer .
C is a minimalistic language , but only if you do n’t count all the libraries that are necessary to use it usefully .
C++ is obviously not trying to be minimalistic .
Unix is considered by some to be a minimalistic operating system , but the fact of the matter is that if you think of Unix as a programming language , it ’s far richer than even Perl .
Perl is , by and large , a digested and simplified version of Unix .
Perl is the Cliff Notes of Unix .
Unix ( and by extension Linux ) are really simultaneously Modern and postmodern .
Unix philosophy is supposedly reductionistic , and minimalistic .
But instead of being Modernistic , Unix is actually deconstructionistic .
The saving grace of deconstructionism is that it is also reconstructionism .
When you ’ve broken everything down into bits , you ’re required to put them back together again a different way .
In order to solve real problems , Unix requires you not only to be reductionistic , but also holistic .
It ’s no accident that the ductwork shows in shell scripts .
Only we call them pipes .
Postmodernism is n’t afraid of ornamentation , because postmodernism is a retreat from classicalism back to romanticism .
That particular pendulum is quite periodic .
The Classical and Modern periods of art identified beauty with simplicity .
The Baroque and Romantic periods of art identified beauty with complexity .
I think it ’s an interesting synchronicity that , even as our art is becoming more complex again , science is also discovering beauty in complexity theory .
Perhaps it ’s more than a synchronicity .
Just as Modern art had exhausted the possibilities of bigger hammers , so had science .
In short , we ’d been oversimplifying for too long , and hence could n’t see the simplicity within the complexity of a leaf .
I would like to tell you that Perl is simple in its complexity .
But some people wo n’t understand that .
So pretend I did n’t say that , unless you do .
I could go on about simplicity , but let ’s move on to the next cult .
Modernism is also a Cult of Originality .
It did n’t matter if the sculpture was hideous , as long as it was original .
It did n’t matter if there was no music in the music .
Plagiarism was the greatest sin .
To have your work labeled ``pastiche ” was the worst insult .
The only artistic endeavor in the Modern period not to suffer greatly from the Cult of Originality was architecture .
Architecture went in for simplicity and functionalism instead .
With the notable exception of certain buildings that were meant to look like Modern art , usually because they contained Modern art .
Odd how that happens .
The Cult of Originality shows up in computer science as well .
For some reason , many languages that came out of academia suffer from this .
Everything is reinvented from first principles ( or in some cases , zeroeth principles ) , and nothing in the language resembles anything in any other language you ’ve ever seen .
And then the language designer wonders why the language never catches on .
No computer language is an island , either .
In case you had n’t noticed , Perl is not big on originality .
Come to think of it , neither is Linux .
Does this bother you ?
Good , perhaps our culture really is getting to be more postmodern .
The next cult on the hit parade is the Cult of Seriousness .
Recall how seriously our Modern Artist took himself and his art .
He was unable to laugh at himself .
I find that there are a certain number of humorless people who do n’t appreciate , um , humor .
There is a small but steady drizzle of messages into O’Reilly & Associates from people who are offended by the fact that my book , the Camel book , contains jokes .
It ’s really quite funny reading the messages from these people .
It reminds me of the time I was sitting in a theatre in Palo Alto .
It was intermission , and we were in the middle of watching a hilarious play about a dysfunctional family .
You know , kind of like a sitcom , only done right .
The audience just roared throughout the first act .
Anyway , at intermission , this older guy with a deep , gruff voice behind me says to his wife , in all seriousness , ``I do n’t see what ’s so funny .
It ’s just like an ordinary family . ”
I confess , I had to cover my mouth with my hands to keep from guffawing like Tom Christiansen .
That ’s got to be one of the funniest things I ’ve ever heard .
Well , maybe you had to be there .
Postmodernism is not afraid to laugh at itself .
It ’s not afraid of cute , and it ’s not afraid of funky , and it ’s not afraid of what a Modernist would call kitsch .
You know , it ’s actually kind of liberating to be going down the road , and be able to yell , ``New buggie !
Pea soup green . ”
Postmoderns are n’t afraid to be nostalgic about old slug bugs , either .
Sentimentality is cool , if you ’re into that sort of thing .
Retro rules .
Unless it rocks .
I do n’t know if sentimentality rules or rocks , but ’s it ’s definitely cool .
As Heidi would say , ``Dude , I ’m stoked . ”
You ’ll notice I keep talking about my wife and my daughter .
In case you had n’t noticed .
The Modernist would of course explain to you that I was resorting to cheap sentimental tricks to try to establish an emotional bond with my audience .
A postmodernist would , of course , agree .
But the postmodernist will point out that cheap tricks are less expensive than costly tricks .
Showing your ductwork is usually cheaper than hiding it .
Even if it ’s not cheaper , it ’s certainly more entertaining .
I certainly find the Iron Chef entertaining .
That ’s definitely a postmodern show .
There ’s lots of cool stuff on TV these days .
My daughter enjoys Daria , because it ’s so cynical about everything , including itself .
And if you ’d like to see an unashamedly postmodern anime , you should get ahold of Revolutionary Girl Utena .
Well , enough of that .
Let ’s see what ’s next in our talk .
Oh , oh , here comes a biggie .
The Cult of Objectivity .
You know , Modernism tried .
It tried real hard .
It really , really tried .
It tried to get rid of conventions .
It thought it got rid of conventions .
But all it really did was make its conventions invisible .
At least to itself .
Reductionists often feel like they ’re being objective .
But the problem with reductionism is that , once you ’ve split your universe into enough pieces , you ca n’t keep track of them any more .
Psychologists tell us that the human mind can only keep track of about about seven objects , plus or minus two .
That ’s for short - term memory .
It gets both worse and better for long - term memory , but the principle still stands .
If you lose track of something , it ’s because you thought it was less important , and did n’t think about it often enough to remind yourself .
This is what happened to Modernists in literature .
They ’ve forgotten what ’s important about literature .
Note how we still periodically hear the phrase ``serious literature ” .
This is literature that is supposedly about Real Life .
Let me tell you something .
The most serious literature I ’ve ever read is by Lois McMaster Bujold .
Any of you read her ?
It ’s also the funniest literature I ’ve ever read .
It ’s also space opera .
``Genre fiction , ” sneers the Modernist .
Meaning it follows certain conventions .
So what ?
Nobody in the world can mix gravity and levity the way Bujold does in her Vorkosigan books .
It ’s oh so definitely about real life .
So what if it follows space opera conventions .
Sonnets follow certain conventions too , but I do n’t see them getting sneered at much these days .
Certainly they were always called ``serious ” .
How long till Bujold becomes required reading in high school ?
Far too long , in my opinion .
Horrors .
We would n’t want our students actually enjoying what they read .
It ’s not–it ’s not Real Life .
As if the Lord of the Flies is real life .
Feh .
Perl programming is unabashedly genre programming .
It has conventions .
It has culture .
Perl was the first computer language whose culture was designed for diversity right along with the language .
We ’re not objective about Perl , but as postmodernists , we freely admit that we ’re not objective , and we try to compensate for it when we want people to think we ’re objective .
Or when we want to think ourselves objective .
Or , at least , not objectionable .
Or , at least , not object - oriented .
I would like to say one thing here about objectivity , however .
While I despise the Modern Cult of Objectivity , I also despise the quasi- postmodern Cult of Subjectivity .
I call it absolute cultural relativism .
It ’s the notion that everything is as good as everything else , because goodness is only a matter of opinion .
It ’s like claiming that the only thing you can know absolutely is that you ca n’t know anything absolutely .
I think this is really just another form of Modernism , a kind of existentialism really , though unfortunately it ’s come to be associated with postmodernism .
But I think it sucks .
The funny thing is , it ’s almost right .
It ’s very close to what I do , in fact , believe .
I ’d go so far as to call myself a strong postmodernist .
Strong postmodernism says that all truth is created .
But this really is n’t a problem for anyone who believes in a Creator .
All truths are created relative , but some are more relative than others .
A universal truth only has to be true about our particular universe , so to speak .
It does n’t much matter whether the universe itself is true or false , just as long as it makes a good story .
And I think our universe does make a good story .
I happen to like the Author .
I like Lois McMaster Bujold too , so I read her stories .
Same for Tolkien , and C.S. Lewis .
Turning that around , some people use Perl because they like me .
Who am I to argue with them ?
You ’re all totally objective about Linus and Linux , right ?
Uh , huh .
Three cheers for objectivity .
I ’m getting tired of talking about cults , and you ’re probably getting tired of listening to me talk about cults .
However , I want to talk about the open source phenomenon now , and I ’m afraid I ’ll have to drag the cults in occasionally .
But fear not .
I think the open source movement is , actually , a postmodern movement .
Think about it .
We ’ve actually been doing open source for a couple of decades now .
Why is it suddenly taking off now ?
Why not twenty years ago .
Linux could have been written twenty years ago , albeit not by Linus .
Of course there are lots of mundane reasons why Linux was n’t written twenty years ago , not the least of which is that we did n’t really have the ubiquitous , cheap hardware to support it yet .
Nor did we have the networking to support cooperative development .
But since this is a philosophical talk , I ’ll ignore reality and talk about what I think was really going on .
Here ’s where the cults come back in again .
The Cult of Spareness decreed that we should all use the same operating system .
Of course , everyone had their own idea of what that was , but Bill Gates actually had the most success in carrying out the decree .
For which he is now on trial , where he may eventually have to consent to a consent decree .
All in all , it ’s been a bad year to be named Bill .
The wolves are circling , and waiting for further signs of weakness , and everyone ’s hedging their bets by attending LinuxWorld , and making sure the press know it .
Meanwhile , back on the Unix side of the universe , The Cult of Originality decreed that , if you were going to work on something , it had to be something new .
Reimplementing an open source Unix would have been laughable , especially since any university could get the sources to Unix anyway for next to nothing .
When other companies besides Ma Bell figured out that they should have an implementation of Unix , they all had to make it different enough that they could distinguish themselves in the marketplace .
That is , what they wrote had to be original .
The Cult of Seriousness decreed that everyone had to keep their source code hidden , because other people might laugh at how bad our code is , and make us fix it .
Or worse , someone might steal our bad code and make it better .
Then we would be out of business , and Life is Serious Business .
A peek at the source code for Unix is obviously worth $ 100,000 , because we can get that much for it .
Programming for the fun of it ?
Get real !
Finally , the Cult of Objectivity decreed that the way we always did business was obviously the only way to do business .
Our culture is the only possible culture .
There are no social conventions here .
These are n’t the droids you ’re looking for .
Move along .
In short , think about what it takes to put together an open source project such as Linux or Perl .
You need a lot of people who think programming is serious fun .
You need a culture of sharing , which is just the flip side of a culture in which you can borrow things without shame .
You need people who have been hammered into dysfunctionality long enough that they ’re looking for new ways to form communities .
You need people who are willing to be partisan on behalf of their chosen culture , while remaining sufficiently non-partisan to keep in touch with the rest of the world .
It ’s no fun to create a new culture and then cut it off from the rest of humanity .
No , the fun thing is to try to persuade others to share your opinions about what rules and what sucks .
Nothing is more fun than evangelism .
There are two kinds of joiners in the world .
Think of it in terms of anthropology .
There are the kinds of people who join a tribe , and kind of get sucked in , like a black hole .
That ’s the last you hear from them , unless you happen to be in the black hole with them .
And we need people like this in our tribes , if only to be cheerleaders .
But the open source movement is energized by the other sort of joiner .
This sort of person joins many tribes .
These are the people who inhabit the intersections of the Venn diagrams .
They believe in ANDs rather than ORs .
They ’re a member of more than one subset , more than one tribe .
The reason these people are important is , just like merchants who go between real tribes , they carry ideas from one intellectual tribe to another .
I call these people ``glue people ” , because they not only join themselves to a tribe , they join tribes together .
Twenty years ago , you could n’t easily be a glue person , because our culture was not yet sufficiently accepting of diversity .
It was also not accepting of information sharing .
If you got sucked in by Bell Labs , you might get out to the occasional Usenix , but that was about it .
If you got sucked in by the NSA , nobody ever heard from you again .
Come to think of it , that ’s still true .
Still and all , things have improved greatly , and the bridges across the gaps have gotten sturdier .
Now people can send their memes across a wider chasms without getting crucified on one end of the bridge or the other .
And as we started sending these memes across the chasms , what we discovered was that we did n’t have a bunch of separate open source movements , but rather a single big open source movement .
To be sure , it ’s a fuzzy , postmodern sort of movement , with lots of diversity , and a certain amount of turmoil , but it ’s about as good as any movement gets these days .
We all suck at slightly different things , but we ’re in basic agreement that the old way of business sucked a lot worse that whatever it is we ’re doing now .
We ’ve agreed to agree .
Except when we do n’t .
That sounds like it ought to be the end of my talk , but I still have a bunch of things to say , so I ’ll just keep going .
Who knows , maybe it ’ll relate .
The other day , I was talking to a glue person whose name is Sharon Hopkins .
Among other things , she ’s known as the Perl Poet , because she ’s written more poetry in Perl than anyone else .
She also writes a kind of non-Perl poetry that was dubbed by another poet as ``sharonesque ” .
Here ’s a cute example :
I 'd travel to the ends of time For you , my one , my only love .
I 'd force the sun to leave its track ( If you were lost ) to fetch you back .
I 'd suck the juices from a lime , I 'd re-write Moby Dick in rhyme , I 'd happily commit a crime !
For you , my dearest darling dove .
I 'd do it all , and more beside -- Now * would * you take the trash outside ?
Sharon Hopkins Winter , 1989 - 90
I had to write a response to that poem .
Actually , two responses .
I wo n’t inflict the longer one on you , but here ’s the shorter one : I ’ve taken the trash out innumerable times , I ’ve taken the trash out in inclement climes , I ’ve taken the trash out ‘ cuz that ’s what I do , But I wo n’t take the trash out when you tell me to .
Well , anyway , most of Sharon ’s poetry is relational , as befits a postmodern glue person .
As I was saying , we were talking recently .
Oddly , the subject was postmodernism .
Fancy that .
We were discussing how postmodern stuff can have goofy things mixed in with things that matter .
She likes Iron Chef , too .
That ’s a Japanese show where you have some seriously good cooking mixed with an extremely silly race to cook the best meal .
Watching the judges judge the meals is the best part .
We were also talking about Revolutionary Girl Utena , where we have the Absolute Destiny Apocalypse mixed in with octopi falling out of closets .
Both shows are full of arbitrary but endearing conventions .
Anyway , I said something about what I was going to talk about here , and she said an interesting thing : >
Yes , Modernism created a lot of dysfunction –nobody disputes that .
We were encouraged to revolt , deconstruct , cut apart our papers , run away from home and take drugs , not get married , and so on .
Modernism tore a lot of things apart , but especially the family .
The interesting thing to me is that postmodernism is propagating the dysfunction , because it actually finds its meaning in dysfunction .
Postmodernism really is a result of Modernism .
For one thing , notice how you ca n’t rebel by being dysfunctional any more .
It ’s no longer interesting –we ’ve done that already .
But it ’s more than that .
Think of Perl culture as a dysfunctional family .
Or think of the various communities that arise on the net .
Think of our Gen X group at church and their obviously postmodern tastes : night club decor mixed with candles .
But it ’s really about being together .
Nowadays , family is where you find it .
Family is where you create it .
I think Sharon knows what she ’s talking about here .
She actually met her current boyfriend online , but do n’t tell her I said that .
Anyway , I thought she has an interesting perspective on the way the net works nowadays .
Imagine , open source is merely a byproduct of our need for family .
So , look at all of you out there .
You ’re just a big , dysfunctional family trying to create meaning .
Do n’t look so nervous .
I ’m not going to call for a group hug .
Let ’s see , what else can I talk about .
Did you realize how many things can be abbreviated ``pm ” ?
Prime Minister .
Post Meridian .
Post Modern .
Perl Module .
Perl Monger .
Are there any Perl Mongers out there today ?
There you have it –yet another dysfunctional family .
You guys can go out and have a group hug later in the pub .
Okay , let ’s see. ``pm ” is an abbreviation for Perl Module , which is why , of course , we use ``. pm ” is the extension for a Perl module .
It used to be that we used ``.pl ” for Perl code .
People still do use ``.pl ” in Windows , but that ’s because they ’re all still stuck back in the Modern age .
Anyway , there ’s a funny thing about using ``.pl ” for the Perl extension .
People used to argue a lot about what the next language after C would be .
Everone knew that the previous language had been called ` `B ” , after the first letter in BCPL , which came even earlier than B .
The two proposed candidates for the next language were ``D ” , because that ’s what comes after ``C ” in the alphabet , and ``P ” , because that was the next letter in BCPL .
Well , as you can see , it did n’t work out either way .
One of the successors to C was C++ , which is a cute pun on the autoincrement operator , but makes it an absolute pain to try to figure out what the proper extension for a C++ file should be .
.C? .cpp? .cxx ?
I suppose as a postmodern person , I should n’t mind the diversity , but somehow I do .
I suppose a little inconsistency is good for the soul .
Anyway , the other successor to C gobbled up two letters instead of one .
Which is why many Perl scripts have the extension , ``.pl ” , finishing off BCPL .
It ’s a pity , in a way .
Now there can never be a language named ` `L ” .
Perhaps it ’s just as well .
Quite apart from the annual yuletide puns we ’d get on ``noel , noel ” , there ’s also the problem that people would have confused the language with lex , which already uses a ``.l ” extension .
Since lex had already taken it , noel was available .
So to speak .
Sorry .
Anyway .
Is n’t history fascinating ?
Especially postmodern history ?
As Heidi would say : ‘ Tsall good .
Except when it sucks .
Or as Tiny Tim says , God bless us , every one .
If you guys want me to stop talking , you ’d better ask some questions .
Brendan Eich has just mentioned on the es4 - discuss mailing list that we will be using ML as the definition language for the semantics of ECMAScript Edition 4 .
One of the immediate benefits of this approach will be that our definition will also serve as a reference implementation .
LtUers will of course recognize this as the approach of " definitional interpreters " ( discussed on LtU here and countless other times ) .
Our initial intention was to write a custom specification language that would be tailored to our purposes , with just the right core control features and datatypes to serve as an appropriately abstract model of ECMAScript .
But before long , we realized that we were pretty much describing ML .
Rather than specifying , implementing , and documenting another programming language that was 80 % ML , why reinvent the wheel ?
The benefits of this approach are many : a definition in a formal language that itself has a clear and precise definition , the luxury of many robust and high - performance implementations ( we 'll be using OCaml extended with first - class continuations ) , and free " technology transfer " from all the existing ML literature and communities .
And finally , by releasing real software -- written in a direct functional style -- for reading , type - checking , and evaluating ECMAScript programs , we 'll be providing a standard set of tools for static analysis and other research on the ECMAScript language .

The Nazi Blitzkrieg was a revolution in warfare that forced the rest of the world into a wild scramble to figure out how to dam the onslaught .
The German tanks were fast and powerful , and very difficult for the conventional weapons of 1939 to repel .
They rolled over Poland with nary a problem , and soon overran most all of Europe .
But forward - thinking members of the Soviet military had been contemplating the issue of warring with tanks for some time , and they had a plan : they were going to sic dogs on them .
So far as the wars of men go , dogs have always been tossed the short end of the stick .
Nary does a modern movie depict the way the Romans used mastiffs with razored collars in battle , nor the fully armored Death Hounds ( I did n’t make up the name ) that the medieval knights would loose on a field to snap at the legs of opponents and dispatch the wounded that littered the ground .
In fact , dogs have fought alongside their masters through most of recorded history .
At the eve of World War II , the Soviets had a assembled a fully operational four - legged fighter division .
A dog with a bomb is a potent foe .
The Soviets were unable to address the looming tank problem with any new technologies right away , thus they were forced to contemplate tackling the issue with the means at hand .
Landmines were a viable option , but because one could n’t count on the Nazis seeking out the stationary mines , they had to figure a way to make the mines seek the tanks .
The answer laid in the dog division .
The trainers would starve the dogs , then train them to look for food underneath a tank .
The dogs quickly learned that being released from their pens meant to run out to where the training tank was parked , where they would find a feast of vittles .
Once trained , the dogs were fitted with a dog - sized backpack bombs , and let loose in a field of oncoming German Panzers .
The idea was that each dog would clamber underneath an enemy tank⁠ — where there was no protective armor⁠ — where the bomb would detonate and gut the enemy vehicle .
Realization of that plan was a little less successful .
The dogs had been trained to look under a Soviet tank for food , and would sometimes be loosed into a battle just to turn around and find a friendly tank to climb under .
Sometimes the dogs would spook at the rumble of a running diesel engine and simply run away from the battle .
Sometimes the dogs just decided they did n’t want to go anywhere , and cowered in their pens .
Despite these problems , the Anti-tank dogs were successful at disabling a reported 300 Nazi tanks throughout the war .
It was enough of a problem to the Nazi advance that the Germans were compelled to attempt measures at stopping them .
The top mounted machine gun proved ineffective due to the relatively small size and high speed of the targets , the fact that there were low to the ground and hard to spot , and that dogs just do n’t want to die when they think they ’re close to food .
Orders were dispatched that commanded every German soldier to shoot any dogs on sight for fear they might be rabid .
Eventually the Germans began using flame - throwers on the tanks to ward the dogs away , and these were much more successful at dissuading the attacks ⁠— but some hungry dogs would stop for neither fear of the fire nor actually being burned .
However , in 1942 one use of the Anti-tank dogs went seriously awry when a large contingent of anti-tank dogs scattered and ran amok upon being released , thus endangering everyone in the battle , and forcing the retreat of the entire Soviet tank division .
Soon afterward the Anti-tank dogs were pulled from service .
The animals were n’t altogether out of the war , however .
By the end , various canine soldiers were credited with having 61,000 fighting at the front lines , the delivery of 2,000 dispatches , the laying of 7,883 kilometers of telephone cable , and the rescue of 680 wounded soldiers .
If only voting could be as much fun as playing the lottery
If voting were as much fun as playing the lottery , a lot more people would probably vote .
Some folks in Arizona are trying to do something to make voting more like the lottery .
There is an initiative on the ballot ( you need to scroll down that page to see it ) that reads as follows :
“ This law will establish a voter reward random drawing every two years with a first prize of one million dollars or more .
The purpose is to increase voter participation .
Voters who cast ballots in primary or general elections will be eligible to win .
The money will come from the Arizona Lottery and private donations . ”
Given that there were 2 million voters in Arizona in the last presidential election , the expected payout per vote is only 50 cents .
But , as we said in our column on voting back in November , one of the main benefits to voting is being able to fantasize about affecting the election .
The chances of winning this lottery are about as large as one Arizona voter affecting an important election , and I bet most voters would rather have a million bucks than affect an election .
( Thanks to Adam Doverspike for pointing me to this initiative . )
Dem judiciary leader seeks torture documents Brian Beutler
Published : Friday November 17 , 2006 Print This Email This
In a letter addressed to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , chairman - to - be of the Senate Judiciary Committee Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) has requested the release of documents that outline the Bush Administration 's interrogation policies .
If the request is not met , the Democratically - controlled Judiciary Committee will have the option to subpoena when the new Congress begins in January .
The documents , the subject of months of speculation by observers and critics of America 's national security policies , were confirmed to exist by the ACLU as the result of a still - pending Freedom of Information Act lawsuit .
One of those documents is believed to be a companion piece to the now - infamous August 2002 memorandum which redefined torture and , as a result , broadened the range of interrogation tactics permitted in the field .
The companion document , the so - called  Yoo Two document ( named after legal counsel John Yoo ) is believed to contain a list of actual techniques that have been approved by the Department of Justice and which are therefore legally protected interrogation methods used by intelligence operatives against suspected terrorists .
A press release issued today contends that Leahy " had previously requested all documents relating to the treatment of detainees from the Department of Justice , the FBI , the CIA and the Department of Defense . "
Those requests have turned up numerous controversial memos and reports detailing the handling of so - called enemy combatants by U.S. soldiers and intelligence officials , but the now - uncovered documents were never included .
That omission , says a source close to the Judiciary Committee , has angered the senator .
 The American people and their representatives in Congress , " Leahy insists , " are entitled to know the truth about the Bush Administrations interrogation policies and practices that have engendered criticism at home , contributed so negatively to the image of the United States around the world and served to undercut our efforts against terrorism ,  According to the ACLU , the documents specify interrogation methods that the CIA may use against top al - Qaeda members . 
Last November , a news report surfaced , detailing six so - called enhanced interrogation techniques .
What remains unclear , and what the documents requested by Leahy might reveal , is which of these techniques are legal in the eyes of the justice department .
The full text of the letter , as obtained by RAW STORY , appears below .
# November 16 , 2006 The Honorable Alberto Gonzales Attorney General United States Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue , NW Washington , D.C. 20530 Dear Attorney General Gonzales : Recent press accounts indicate that , after years of denials , the Central Intelligence Agency has acknowledged the existence of additional documents detailing the Bush Administrations interrogation and detention policy for terrorism suspects .
According to press reports , the CIA recently disclosed the existence of two interrogation - related documents  a presidential directive regarding the CIAs interrogation methods and detention facilities located outside of the United States , and an August 2002 Department of Justice Memorandum to the CIA General Counsel regarding CIA interrogation methods ( the  2nd Bybee memo )  in connection with an ongoing FOIA lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union .
As you know , for more than two years , I have repeatedly sought answers from the Department of Justice , the FBI , the CIA , and the Department of Defense regarding reported and , in some instances , documented cases of the abuse of detainees in U.S. custody .
The photographs and reports of prisoner abuse in Iraq , Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere that have emerged during the past two years depict an interrogation and detention system operating contrary to U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions .
Prisoner abuse is one aspect of a broader problem , which includes the use of so - called extraordinary renditions  to send people to other countries where they will be subject to torture .
We diminish our own values as a Nation  and lose credibility as an advocate of human rights around the world  by engaging in , or outsourcing , torture .
The American people deserve to have detailed and accurate information about the role of the Bush Administration in developing the interrogation policies and practices that have engendered such deep criticism and concern at home and around the world .
I ask that you promptly respond to the following questions and document requests .
Please produce any and all directives , memoranda , and / or orders , including any and all attachments to such documents , regarding CIA interrogation methods or policies for the treatment of detainees , including but not limited to the directive signed by President Bush governing CIA interrogation methods , or allowing the CIA to set up detention centers located outside of the United States .
Please produce any and all Department of Justice directives , memoranda , and / or guidance , including any and all attachments to such documents , regarding CIA detention and / or interrogation methods , including but not limited to the August 2002 Memorandum from the Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel to the CIA General Counsel regarding CIA interrogation methods ( the  2nd Bybee memo ) .
Please produce any and all documents in the custody of the Department of Justice regarding the legality of specific interrogation tactics and / or federal criminal prohibitions on torture and abuse that were used in the preparation of the 2nd Bybee memo referenced above .
Please state whether the 2nd Bybee memo was withdrawn , replaced , or modified after the Administration withdrew the Office of Legal Counsels memorandum regarding U.S. obligations under anti-torture law , dated August 2002 ( the 1st Bybee Memo ) in December 2004 .
If so , please produce any and all revisions , or modifications of the 2nd Bybee memo .
Please produce any and all Department of Justice documents that interpret , or advise on , the scope of interrogation practices permitted and prohibited by the Detainee Treatment Act or the Military Commissions Act .
Please produce an index of any and all documents relating to investigations and / or reviews conducted by the Department of Justice into detainee abuse by U.S. military or civilian personnel in Guantanamo Bay , Abu Ghraib prison , or elsewhere .
I look forward to comprehensive responses to the above questions and document requests .
Sincerely , PATRICK LEAHY United States Senator cc : General Michael V. Hayden , USAF Director Central Intelligence Agency Room Number 7D56 OHB Washington , D.C. 20505
Maybe it 's a $ 3 - a - month charge from Verizon Wireless for Roadside Assistance that you do n't remember requesting .
Maybe it's an $ 18 " upgrade fee " that Cingular Wireless neglected to mention when you bought that snazzy new Motorola Razr phone .
Or maybe you 're just peeved about dropped calls .
Whatever the cause , if you 've had it with your cell phone company , you 're not alone .
Consumers are mad , and the lawsuits are flying .
Driving Discontent
According to the Better Business Bureau , cell phone companies drew 30,483 consumer complaints last year to become the top - ranked industry for grievances .
The most common complaints : inaccurate bills , inadequate customer service , and deceptive contract terms .
Cell phone companies were the subject of more complaints than such perennially unpopular businesses as car dealerships , hotels , retail outlets , and insurance companies , BBB statistics show .
Experts attribute the rise in customer dissatisfaction to fallout from mergers and acquisitions in the wireless industry , including the Cingular - AT&T Wireless and Sprint - Nextel mergers .
Kirk Parsons , senior director of wireless services for J.D. Power and Associates , says a study by the famed market research firm found that consumer satisfaction with wireless phone service providers in 2005 was down 10 percent from 2004 levels .
Below are details about some of the most common cell phone complaints , as lodged in recent lawsuits and filings to the Federal Communications Commission and the Better Business Bureau .
Roadside Assistance Rage
At least two federal class - action lawsuits have been filed over Roadside Assistance charges of $ 2 or $ 3 a month on Cingular and Verizon Wireless bills .
In separate lawsuits , customers of both carriers say they never ordered the optional service , which Cingular and Verizon say will provide emergency service to auto drivers who get stranded on the side of the road .
Cingular 's Roadside Assistance is an emergency insurance program for motorists that Cingular markets on behalf of Asurion Insurance Services .
Should a subscriber have a flat , get locked out of their car , or run out of gas , they can call a special number on their Cingular handset and someone will come to their assistance , free of charge .
Michael Gellis sued Verizon in Oakland , California , Circuit Court , while Cingular Wireless customer Margaret Moffatt filed suit against the firm in Wayne County , Michigan , Circuit Court .
Both customers say that for more than two years , without their consent , the carriers had added charges for Roadside Assistance to their monthly bills .
Both suits allege violation of state consumer protection laws , breach of contract , and " unjust enrichment . "
Both suits were eventually transferred to U.S. District Court in Detroit , where attorney Peter Macuga of Macuga and Liddle is representing both plaintiffs .
Cingular declined to comment on the two pending cases .
However , its representatives said Cingular typically offers a free 60 - day trial of the Roadside Assistance program to customers when they upgrade or change their plan .
If the customer does n't cancel the service after the trial period ends , Cingular begins adding the charges to their monthly bill .
Cingular says it never initiates the free Roadside Assistance trial without the customer 's consent , whether in writing at one of the carrier 's stores , verbally over the phone , or by clicking to accept a terms - of - service agreement online .
" If folks have had that on their bill , and they did n't order it , obviously there is a mistake somewhere and we can correct it , " says Cingular spokesperson Mark Siegel .
A Verizon Wireless press contact also said that the company does n't add services to a customer 's calling plan without consent , adding that Verizon would work to resolve disputes related to any charges .
Verizon also declined to comment on the lawsuits .
Singularly Aggravating
Cingular is facing additional complaints stemming from its merger with AT&T Wireless in October 2004 .
One group of customers -- people with older phones that use AT&T or Cingular analog or TDMA networks -- is complaining about Cingular 's announced intention to charge them $ 5 per month for continued service .
Another group -- former AT&T
Wireless customers who still use that company 's TDMA network -- is angry about what they describe as deteriorating network quality in the wake of the merger .
Both groups say Cingular is trying to force them to upgrade to more expensive phones and rate plans on the company 's newer GSM / GPRS network .
Cingular says the $ 5 monthly fee is needed to recoup costs associated with maintaining the older networks .
Currently , 4.7 million subscribers , about 8 percent of Cingular 's total , use Cingular 's TDMA or analog networks , Siegel says .
Cingular had no comment about the alleged deterioration of service on the old AT&T TDMA network .
Forced to Switch
Yet another group of angry Cingular customers are former AT&T Wireless customers who did switch to Cingular 's GSM service following the merger -- and found that they not only had to buy a new phone , but had to pay an $ 18 transfer fee that Cingular charged them simply for switching to Cingular 's GSM network .
Those customers also had to pay $ 18 for the SIM chip that contains the phone number and other user information that is required by GSM handsets .
And switching wireless carriers to protest against Cingular was not an attractive option : People who tried to leave Cingular with time remaining on their AT&T contract were subject to an early - termination fee of $ 175 .
In response to these complaints , Cingular in July 2005 began waiving the transfer fee for former AT&T Wireless customers who migrate to a Cingular plan .
Cingular subsequently also waived the charge for its own customers who buy new phones to switch from older networks to GSM service .
However , these concessions came too late to pacify some customers .
Several consumer advocacy groups headed by the Santa Monica , California - based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights filed a federal suit in Seattle , alleging that following its acquisition of AT&T Wireless , Cingular intentionally degraded service on legacy AT&T networks in hopes of driving AT&T 's customers to Cingular 's GSM network .
The suit also accuses Cingular of charging AT&T customers unfair fees to make the switch .
One State 's Fee Fine
Meanwhile , Cingular 's business practices in California have drawn the ire of state authorities .
In July , a state appeals court upheld a $ 12.1 million fine imposed on the carrier in 2004 by the California Public Utilities Commission .
The judges agreed with CPUC regulators who said Cingular knowingly signed up more customers than its network could handle , while at the same time charging early - termination fees -- sometimes amounting to hundreds of dollars -- to customers who cancelled their service .
The CPUC also said Cingular failed to provide customers with an adequate trial period and ordered Cingular to refund early termination fees charged to customers who cancelled their contracts between January 2000 and May 2002 , refunds that could cost the company millions of dollars .
Cingular has since extended its trial period from 15 days to 30 days .
Consumer organizations such as the U.S. Public Interest Research Group have applauded California 's efforts to combat unreasonable early termination fees .
" Early termination fees make it easy for companies to deliver bad service , " says Ed Mierzwinski , USPIRG 's consumer program director .
Such fees give customers little recourse if service deteriorates midway through a contract , he explains .
Fees for Phone Upgrades
Cingular 's transfer fees are n't the only ancillary charges frustrating wireless customers .
Leading carriers routinely charge an upgrade fee simply for switching to a new phone .
Sprint Nextel charges customers $ 18 when they upgrade to a different handset .
Cingular charges a similar upgrade fee of $ 18 .
Verizon Wireless customers who buy new handsets within 22 months of signing up for service ( or of a previous handset upgrade ) are subject to an upgrade fee of $ 20 .
In posts on gripe sites such as My3Cents.com and Planet Feedback , some customers say they were never told about these fees at the time of purchase and were surprised to see them on their phone bill , typically two months after purchase .
By then , the window for cancellation of the purchase without termination fees had expired .
People are particularly aggravated to see the fee after purchasing a phone that the carrier had marketed as being " free " after rebate , or during an " instant savings " promotion that 's supposed to refund the cost of the phone .
These promotions are common with all the major carriers .
Sprint and Cingular officials say these fees cover service and administrative costs associated with upgrading customers to a new handset .
The officials also say their sales representatives and Web sites make all fees clear to customers when they purchase a new phone .
The Biggest Gripe
Wireless industry experts including J.D. Power and Associates ' Parsons say that much of the frustration experienced by Cingular , AT&T Wireless , Sprint , and Nextel customers stems from the complexities involved in merging the technologies and billing processes of huge networks .
Parsons adds that consumer expectations have risen as the cell phone industry has matured .
" Today 's cell phone users have zero tolerance for dropped calls , " Parsons says .
However , dropped calls do n't top the list of cell phone gripes .
Instead , billing issues account for three times as many complaints as service quality , according to the FCC's May 2006 Quarterly Report on Informal Consumer Inquiries and Complaints .
Billing issues have prompted several state - level initiatives by consumer groups attempting to change the way wireless carriers do business .
In New York state , the AARP and other consumer groups are backing legislation that would force cell phone companies to make their bills easier to understand and allow customers to cancel service contracts without penalties .
Similar initiatives are in the works in California and Minnesota .
Who Should Regulate ?
These state - level campaigns underscore a larger battle over whether the federal government or the states should have the authority to regulate the cell phone industry .
Wireless carriers would rather be regulated by a single federal agency ( the FCC ) than by the states , which are trying to gain more control over cell phone services to their residents .
In August , the cell phone industry suffered a setback when a federal court of appeals in Atlanta ruled that the FCC overstepped its authority by telling state regulators they could n't require or prohibit line items on bills for wireless services .
The ruling means that states will be able to dictate how cell phone bills are presented to customers .
The CTIA , a wireless telecommunications industry trade association , has complained that the ruling will force wireless providers to establish a different process for each state .
" Complying with disparate regulatory regimes will only increase consumer costs and slow innovation , " CTIA president and chief executive Steve Largent said in a statement .
But the U.S. Public Interest Group 's Mierzwinski says the ruling is good news for consumers because it will give state regulators the muscle to ban deceptive cell phone billing practices .
" The states are doing a much better job these days to protect consumers than the FCC [ is ] , " Mierzwinski says .
Nevertheless , for any cell phone customer , it pays to remember that your best strategy is not to depend on government agencies , but to police your own bill .
Watch it like a hawk , read the fine print , and ask lots of questions .
In a two - page note that accompanied the Ozzie memo , Mr. Gates compared it to one he wrote in 1995 , " The Internet Tidal Wave , " which assessed the Internet challenge of a decade ago .
Microsoft , he wrote in the introduction to the Ozzie memo , was at similar crossroads .
" This coming ' services wave ' will be very disruptive , " Mr. Gates wrote , and later emphasized , " The next sea change is upon us . "
The Ozzie memo analyzes the Internet services trend , the competition and Microsoft 's strengths and shortcomings , and it suggests how the company must change .
The document is also a call to action : " It 's clear that if we fail to do so , our business as we know it is at risk , " Mr. Ozzie wrote .
" We must respond quickly and decisively . "
The memo is peppered with technical acronyms , and rivals are named .
While Microsoft is progressing on several fronts , Mr. Ozzie wrote , " a set of very strong and determined competitors is laser - focused on Internet services and service - enabled software . "
" Google is obviously the most visible here , " he added .
There is an implicit critique of Microsoft 's software - building practice of relying so much on product cycles measured in years .
The last major release of Windows -- XP -- was in 2001 , while the next one , Vista , has been scheduled for next year after repeated delays .
The memo chastises no product by name , but it extols the virtues of speed and simplicity in software design .
" Complexity kills , " Mr. Ozzie wrote .
" It sucks the life out of developers , it makes products difficult to plan , build and test , it introduces security challenges , and it causes end - user and administrator frustration . "
HIS comments all but echo those of some estranged engineers who have left Microsoft recently .
Mark Lucovsky , a former senior engineer at Microsoft who joined Google , wrote in his blog earlier this year , " Microsoft used to know how to ship software , but the world has changed . "
The companies to watch , Mr. Lucovsky wrote , have " embraced the network , deeply understand the concept of ' software as a service ' and know how to deliver incredible value to their customers efficiently and quickly . "
Mr. Ozzie is understandably careful in what he writes and says ; his role at Microsoft is mainly to lead and encourage rather than to criticize .
He emphasizes the importance of Microsoft 's big desktop products like Windows and Office , and he says that Internet services should be seen primarily as a way to continually update and improve its offerings .
Those updates and improvements , he said , should make Microsoft software teams happier by moving their work into the marketplace faster .
MOTHERS -IN -LAW are the butt of many jokes .
There may , though , be a sinister reality behind the humour .
A report in this month 's Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology , by Jan Beise of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock and Eckart Voland of Giessen University , both in Germany , suggests that , in the past at least , a mother - in - law may have had a fatal effect on her daughter - in - law 's children .
Dr Beise and Dr Voland drew their data from church registers in the Krummhorn region of Germany .
They studied the records of more than 23,000 families who lived there between 1720 , when the records became comprehensive , and 1874 , when the job of keeping them was taken away from the church .
They found that the chance of a child dying within a month of birth doubled if the child 's paternal grandmother was alive .
The effect did not depend on whether the grandmother was living in the same household as the child .
Maternal grandmothers , by contrast , made no difference during the first month , and made a significant improvement to a child 's prospects later on .
The odds of a child who reached the age of six months going on to celebrate a first birthday were 60 % higher if the child 's maternal grandmother was still alive .
This second result makes perfect evolutionary sense .
The first , though , does not .
After all , a paternal grandmother has as much genetic interest in the success of her son's children as a maternal one does in her daughter's .
But only , of course , if they really are her son 's children .
The maternal grandmother is the only grandparent who can be sure she is really related to her grandchildren .
The paternal grandmother shares , in an evolutionary sense , her son's risk that he might have been cuckolded .
So the best explanation that the two researchers can come up with is that women are in some way harassed by their mothers - in - law to discourage adulterous matings .
Such harassment might well have an adverse effect on a woman 's fetus if she happened to be pregnant , and that effect would probably show up early in a child 's life .
And , witness the jokes , harassment is widely perceived to take place .
But there is not much evolutionary point in “ guarding ” a pregnant woman against such matings , since she cannot become pregnant again .
So the mother - in - law effect remains a bit of a mystery .
For anyone tethered to a lawnmower , the Holy Grail of horticultural accomplishment would be grass that never grows but is always green .
Now , that vision of suburban bliss — and more — seems plausible as scientists have mapped a critical hormone signaling pathway that regulates the stature of plants .
In addition to lawns that rarely require mowing , the finding could also enable the development of sturdier , more fruitful crop plants such as rice , wheat , soybeans , and corn .
In a paper published in the May 4 , 2006 , issue of the journal Nature , Howard Hughes Medical Institute scientists report they have deciphered the signaling pathway for a key class of steroid hormones that regulates growth and development in plants .
" By manipulating the steroid pathway …we think we can regulate plant stature and yield , " said Joanne Chory , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies , and the senior author of the new report .
Manipulation of plant stature has been a longstanding goal in horticulture , agronomy , and forestry .
The ability to precisely control plant size would have broad implications for everything from urban forestry to crop and garden plant development .
Beyond perpetually short grass , trees could be made more compact for better growth in crowded cities , and berry bushes could be made taller for ease of harvesting .
To chart the pathway , Chory and colleague Grégory Vert of the Salk Institute 's Plant Biology Laboratory examined the molecular influence of a family of plant hormones known as brassinosteroids .
Scientists have found brassinosteroids in all plants where they have looked for them .
As critical chemical messengers of plant development , they are found in low levels in virtually all plant cells , including seeds , flowers , roots , leaves , stems , pollen , and young vegetative tissue .
" Without them , plants are tiny dwarves , with reduced vasculature and roots , and are infertile , " Chory explained .
" They also regulate senescence or aging .
Since brassinosteroids mainly regulate cell expansion , though , they are one of the most important hormones that regulate stature . "
Knowing the molecular chain of command -- how the hormone acts to influence genetic events that govern development at the cellular level - - gives scientists a way to reshape the steroid pathway to develop plants that grow in specified ways .
We might be able to dwarf grass and keep it green by limiting brassinosteroids or increase the yield of rice by having more brassinosteroids in seeds .
Joanne Chory
" We might be able to dwarf grass and keep it green by limiting brassinosteroids or increase the yield of rice by having more brassinosteroids in seeds , " Chory said .
Another recent study by Makoto Matsuoka 's group in Japan , she said , showed that limiting brassinosteroids in rice affected leaf angle and improved yield in densely planted fields .
Vert and Chory 's work helps trace a molecular pathway that is ancient -- perhaps more than a billion years old -- in both plants and animals .
" Remarkably , steroid biosynthetic enzymes are highly conserved from plants to metazoans ( animals ) , suggesting that the use of steroids as hormones preceded the plant - animal split over a billion years ago , " Chory explained .
In animals , the route steroid hormones use to exert their influence in the nucleus of a cell , where gene expression is regulated , is direct , through the use of nuclear receptors .
Plants , said Chory , do n't have nuclear receptors , which would provide more direct access to the nucleus .
Rather , plant steroids are perceived outside the cell by the extracellular domain of a cell surface receptor .
Perception then regulates genetic events in the nucleus in a more roundabout way , similar to a well - studied pathway in animals known as the Wnt signaling pathway .
Wnt is a secreted molecule that influences the nucleus of a cell through cell surface receptors to regulate cell - to - cell interactions and many of the events of embryogenesis in metazoans .
" Because one of the brassinosteroid signaling components was similar to a protein found in the Wnt signaling pathway , we thought that the logic for brassinosteroid signaling ( in plants ) would be very much like the Wnt pathway , " said Chory .
" We were wrong . "
Instead , brassinosteroid perception leads to a cascade of biochemical events that alter the ability of key proteins to dimerize and activate gene expression within a cell 's nucleus .
In plants , there are scores of genes involved in growth and development that can be influenced by brassinosteroids , Chory noted .
" Many of these genes are predicted to be involved in growth , like cell wall metabolism .
Their up - expression would be predicted to promote cell expansion , " according to Chory .
The work of other groups , she noted , has shown that brassinosteroids can negatively regulate their own expression as part of a feedback loop that , ultimately , determines the size of a plant .
In nature , that feedback loop has served plants well , helping them adjust their height and size to fit the growing conditions of any environmental niche .
Through traditional methods of plant breeding , humans have been manipulating plant stature for thousands of years .
In recent years , through the methods of genetic engineering , more precise methods for altering industrial plant strains have come into play .
But access to a pathway used by plant hormones to dictate size promises broader influence over the many genes involved in the process of growth .
Levers that could be used to alter a hormone pathway to influence plant development and stature , according to Chory , include modifying the levels of the hormone , manipulating the chemical structures of hormones , and recoding the signals sent along the pathway .

En esta nota , te contamos la verdad detrás de la fricción entre Chemo Del Solar y Juan Manuel ...
In an original Truthdig interview , Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) , the potential next chair of the Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security , Emerging Threats , and International Relations , calls for congressional hearings into how and why America invaded Iraq , and demands “ accountability ” for those who led America into a “ war based on lies . ”
( Disclosure : Interviewer Scheer worked as an entry - level staffer on Kucinich ’s state Senate campaign , and was later a summer associate in his congressional office . )
TRUTHDIG :
Do you have a plan that could get us out of Iraq ?
KUCINICH : I ’ve had a plan to get us out of Iraq from the minute we got there .
I ’ve had it on my website for three years — elements of which are still very viable .
It calls for the U.S. to give up its control of the oil assets to move towards soliciting U.N. involvement .
TRUTHDIG :
Do you think the neocons are done , or do they have life left in them yet ?
KUCINICH : Rumsfeld may no longer be secretary of defense , but he made decisions based on lies that took people to their deaths .
He has to be held accountable — secretary or not .
KUCINICH :
I think they ’re going to have to answer for the direction that they took this country .
I do n’t think this election , in and of itself , ends the questions about those who led us into a war based on lies .
As a matter of fact , the only hope they have is to do a reversal and lead the way out of Iraq .
Because even at this moment a number of their top adherents are continuing to insist on an active U.S. presence in Iraq .
Even now there are people who were urging President Bush to go to war who are staying that wrongful course .
And people have to be held accountable .
You ca n’t lead this country into a war that has lost thousands of U.S. troops and perhaps hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis , [ and that has ] cost the American taxpayers $ 400 billion — and maybe up to $ 2 trillion — and leave it with some kind of blithe apology .
There has to be accountability .
When the people elected Democrats , they also voted for accountability .
The American people are relying on us — not just to take a new direction , which I believe is out of Iraq , but they ’re insisting on accountability for those who led us wrongly into Iraq .
TRUTHDIG : Are you planning investigations ?
KUCINICH :
It ’s imperative for there to be accountability .
How that accountability is enforced is going to be the subject of a lot of debate .
But that there should be accountability is absolutely imperative .
TRUTHDIG : [ Rep. Nancy ]
Pelosi said she was going to go across the aisle and work with a lot of the Republicans who voted for the war … .
KUCINICH :
This is n’t about whether or not someone voted for the war as a member of Congress .
Members of Congress have to be free to be able to choose again based on new information .
So , it ’s OK if somebody was once for the war , and they looked at it again — that ’s OK .
The problem is the attempt to cover up what was obviously a war based on lies .
That ’s the problem .
TRUTHDIG :
So how are you going to expose that coverup ?
We may never get out of Iraq if we do n’t tell the truth .
KUCINICH :
We need to have hearings on Iraq again .
We need to go over again why we went there .
We need to review the statements and all the errors that were made , and from that we bring the country together to take a new direction .
It ’s all fact - based .
And then we start to heal our nation .
But we cannot heal America if we continue with policies that are based on lies .
We ’ll never be able to bring closure to this Iraq matter unless we tell the truth about what happened .
So America needs a new approach of truth and reconciliation .
This is n’t a Democratic or Republican matter .
This is a matter that relates to the conscience of this country .
This is a matter of the heart — the heart of democracy itself .
This is a matter of whether we ’re going to a sober reflection about the events that have transpired since 9/11 , with respect to Iraq .
And until we do this , we will be trapped not only physically in Iraq , we ’ll be trapped emotionally and spiritually in Iraq .
We may never get out of Iraq if we do n’t tell the truth .
There should n’t be any partisan direction on this .
We should all be together .
America wants a new direction in Iraq ; it stated it loud and clear .
It wants a Congress that ’s going to question the president , not a rubber - stamp Congress .
This is a time to tell the truth and to heal our nation .
And the time for Congress to function as a co-equal branch of government and for the government to function as it was intended to function .
We must never forget that the people have asked for a new direction , and now it ’s up to us to help them achieve that .
TRUTHDIG :
So you ’re calling for hearings right now ?
KUCINICH :
We definitely should have hearings , but the actual decision about whether or not to convene them will be up to the Democratic leadership .
TRUTHDIG :
What do you make of Bush ’s getting rid of Rumsfeld ?
KUCINICH : Listen , Rumsfeld may no longer be secretary of defense , but he made decisions based on lies that took people to their deaths .
He has to be held accountable — secretary or not .
And the rest of the people who were involved with the decision - making process have to be held accountable .
TRUTHDIG :
You ’re OK with the social conservatives coming to the [ Democratic ]
Party ?
KUCINICH : The Democratic Party is a big tent .
And we have to remain a big tent .
TRUTHDIG :
And what about the people who basically only ran on the issue of being antiwar ?
KUCINICH :
Whether people specifically were elected in opposition to the war is almost beside the point .
The American people voted in a new Congress because of the war .
We have to recognize that .
We have to recognize that the American people demand a new direction .
So then the question is going to be : How do we , as Democrats , keep faith with the people , in assuring that there is accountability ?
That ’s what the people want .
They want to make sure that all these people that brought us into war have to answer for their decisions .
And so far , you know what ?
They have n’t had to answer .
We ’re going to have to go back over the territory :
How did we get into Iraq ?
You can not talk about an exit plan unless you know how you got in .
And once people understand very clearly how we got in , then it becomes more imperative to get out .

The findings , published today in the online edition of the journal Brain , used sophisticated scanning technology and computer software to measure how brain volume , form and function changed over six to seven weeks of abstinence from alcohol in 15 alcohol dependent patients ( ten men , five women ) .
The researchers from Germany , the UK , Switzerland and Italy measured the patients ’ brain volume at the beginning of the study and again after about 38 days of sobriety , and they found that it had increased by an average of nearly two per cent during this time .
In addition , levels of two chemicals , which are indicators for how well the brain ’s nerve cells and nerve sheaths are constituted , rose significantly .
The increase of the nerve cell marker correlated with the patients performing better in a test of attention and concentration .
Only one patient seemed to continue to lose some brain volume , and this was also the patient who had been an alcoholic for the longest time .
The leader of the research , Dr Andreas Bartsch from the University of Wuerzburg , Germany , said : " The core message from this study is that , for alcoholics , abstinence pays off and enables the brain to regain some substance and to perform better .
However , our research also provides evidence that the longer you drink excessively , the more you risk losing this capacity for regeneration .
Therefore , alcoholics must not put off the time when they decide to seek help and stop drinking ; the sooner they do it , the better . "
Dr Bartsch , who is senior neuroradiology resident and head of the structural and functional MR - imaging laboratory of the Department of Neuroradiology at the University of Wuerzburg , said the study was one of the first to be able to integrate data that showed how the brain regained volume and function early on , once alcoholics , who had no complicating factors , had stopped drinking alcohol .
It was carried out in collaboration with colleagues from the University of Oxford ’s Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain ( FMRIB ) and from the University of Siena ’s Institute of Neurological and Behavioural Sciences .
The patients ’ brains were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and proton MR - spectroscopy upon admission and after short - term sobriety .
Only the patients that managed to abstain from alcohol without receiving any psychotherapeutic medication were included in the study , and those with secondary alcohol - induced disorders , as well as heavy cigarette smokers ( more than 10 cigarettes a day ) , were excluded .
Ten healthy volunteers ( six men , four women ) , matched for age and gender , were recruited as controls for the study .
The data were analysed and evaluated using FSL , a sophisticated software package developed at the Oxford FMRIB Centre , and LCModel ( a computer program that analyses spectroscopy data ) to give estimates of changes to brain volume , form ( morphology ) , metabolism and function .
The technology enabled the researchers to superimpose the images of the patients ’ brains upon follow - up on to the images of the brains at the start of the study so that they could see any morphological changes .
They also measured how levels of various chemicals , including N - acetylaspartate ( NAA ) and choline , changed between the two time points .
NAA can indicate how intact the brain ’s nerve cells are ( i.e. it is a metabolic marker of neuronal integrity ) , while choline provides hints at how cell membranes are being broken down and repaired .
In addition , the neuropsychological performance of the patients was tested at the beginning and end of the study , using a specific test ( the d2 - test ) that primarily measures attention and concentration .
Dr Bartsch said : " After short - term sobriety of less than two months , we found that brain volume had increased by an average of nearly two per cent ( 1.82 % ) , with a range of - 0.19 to 4.32 % .
Only the one patient with the longest history of alcohol dependence ( 25 years ) had a slightly reduced brain volume ( - 0.19 % ) , but that value is within the margin of measurement error .
Volumetric brain recovery was signified by the patients ’ brains expanding beyond their previous limits , with an outward brain edge shift for the outer regions and an inward shift for the inner ones .
" In addition , on average across all the patients , cerebellar choline levels increased by about 20 % , while levels of NAA in the cerebellar and frontal region of the brain and frontal choline significantly increased by about 10 % .
Brain volume regeneration correlated with the percentages increase in choline , indicating that volume regain is driven primarily by rising choline levels , while the more the NAA recovered , the better the patients performed on the d2 - test . "
There were no significant changes in the controls .
Dr Bartsch and his colleagues were confident that the increase in brain volume and form was not simply due to rehydration of the brain , as concentrations of choline and NAA increased even when water levels and other metabolites did not change significantly .
" Our results indicate that early brain recovery through abstinence does not simply reflect rehydration .
Instead , the adult human brain , and particularly its white matter , seems to possess genuine capabilities for re-growth .
Our findings show the ways that the brain can recover from the toxic insults of chronic alcoholism and substantiate the early measurable benefits of therapeutic sobriety .
However , they also suggest that prolonged dependence on alcohol may limit rapid recovery from white matter brain injury .
" Modern neuroimaging enables us to monitor morphological , metabolic and other functional brain changes .
Usually this has been applied to evaluate the degree and speed of brain degeneration in illnesses such as Alzheimer ’s disease or multiple sclerosis .
Here , we show that neuroimaging can also demonstrate and quantify brain regeneration in substance and function .
Data analysis is crucial to these endeavours , and modern software such as the tools delivered by the Image Analysis Group at the FMRIB centre in Oxford provides us with the utilities necessary for such studies .
For instance , I am able to inform a specific patient how much exactly his or her brain has benefited from sobriety and , as a clinician , I believe this may be a very supportive part of their treatment , " he concluded .
In an accompanying commentary , Professor Graeme Mason , wrote that the study was important not just because it unified several previously separate lines of research but because it might give doctors the tools to motivate their alcohol - dependent patients to stay sober .
" Doctors treating or studying alcoholism should be made aware of the research of Dr Bartsch because it may provide a motivational tool that is a broad set of concrete , tangible , and rapid benefits of sobriety : cognition , chemistry and brain volume , " wrote the associate professor of diagnostic radiology and psychiatry at Yale University .
Prof Mason believed this was a particularly valuable contribution of the study because " patients often become discouraged from the physical and cognitive difficulties of achieving and maintaining sobriety . "

Proteus bacteria ( in green )
Biological warfare is nothing new to the human race .
Attempts to use disease to bring down enemies date as far back as we have detailed histories of warfare .
Even when the mechanisms for the spread of disease were poorly understood , biological warfare was popular .
Dropping cadavers into an enemy ’s water supply was common .
Some inventive Tartars even tried catapulting victims of bubonic plague over the walls of the city of Kaffa ( modern day Feodesia ) during a siege .
More recently , several European nations spread smallpox⁠ — inadvertently and otherwise⁠ — among Native Americans , and later attempted to use biological warfare to their advantage during the first World War .
Only after World War I did the 1925 Geneva Protocol attempt to limit biological warfare , with mixed success .
In all this time however , every attempt at biological warfare has been essentially offensive .
The idea has always been to incapacitate or kill the enemy .
Except once , in Poland , during World War II , where a pair of quick - thinking doctors used a little - known organism to keep the Nazis at bay .
The microorganism is Proteus OX19 .
In most ways it ’s an entirely ordinary little bacterium .
Its one remarkable feature is that human antibodies for Proteus OX19 cross-react with the antibodies for Ricksettia – the bacterium responsible for the deadly disease typhus .
Blood from a patient infected with Proteus Ox19 will give a false - positive in the most common typhus screening method , the Weil - Felix test .
Woodcut of plague victims
Enter the Nazis into Poland .
Two physicians , Drs. Lazowski and Watulewicz , were living in Poland in 1939 when the Nazis invaded and began deporting the population into concentration camps .
When a young man condemned to slave labor in Germany appealed to them for help , the two doctors tried a unique deception .
They injected him with Proteus and then sent a blood sample back to Germany for testing .
The Weil - Felix test came back positive for typhus , and the young man was spared .
Encouraged by this success , the good doctors went on to try their ruse on a larger scale .
Germany was rightfully alarmed at the idea of typhus .
An epidemic originating in a camp could easily spread into the general German population .
So Nazi officials started requesting broader blood tests , and they sent a medical team into the “ afflicted ” areas of Poland – the towns of Rozvadow and Zbydniowie , and several surrounding villages .
While the Polish doctors could , and did , inject a number of other people with Proteus to induce positive Weil - Felix results , an on - site Nazi medical team could well have proved their undoing .
Fortunately , ingenuity and a good dose of hospitality and alcohol prevented them from being uncovered .
From the British Medical Journal :
Nazi deputation consisting of an elderly doctor and two younger assistants was sent to investigate the results sent by Drs. Watulewicz and Lazowski .
They were cordially received and in the traditional Polish manner given - food and vodka .
The senior doctor did not personally inspect any of the village , but remained to be entertained , dispatching his Juniors .
They made a cursory examination of the buildings but , being aware of the risks of infection , were easily dissuaded from closer inspection .
An old man dying of pneumonia was brought in for the senior doctor and with much drama shown to be severely ill with , it was claimed , typhus fever .
- As Goethe said , ‘ We see what we know . ’
They saw , were convinced and left .
With the medical team convinced , the Nazis left both towns and their surrounding villages alone , sparing them the ravages of the purges that killed a fifth of Poland ’s population by the end of the war .
It was a tremendous triumph for the Polish doctors and , whether they realized it or not , their inventive tactic was unique in the annals of biological warfare .
Correction Appended
MOVIES based on the lives of popular musicians constitute a durable genre in Hollywood , and also a fairly safe one .
While not many of them rise to the level of greatness -- " Coal Miner 's Daughter , " Michael Apted 's life of Loretta Lynn , comes closer than most -- there are very few that manage to be completely unwatchable , though " De - Lovely " certainly tried .
" Walk the Line , " James Mangold 's movie about Johnny Cash , settles down in the fat middle of the bell curve , providing , if nothing else , an excuse to go out and buy some CD's .
Well cast , competently written ( by Mr. Mangold and Gill Dennis ) and carefully costumed , it adheres to a familiar " Behind the Music " formula , following its subject through childhood trauma , marriage and divorce , alternating off - stage melodrama with recreated performances that remind us why we should care about this guy in the first place .
Comparisons with Taylor Hackford 's " Ray , " which opened around this time last year , are inevitable .
Both pictures place on the shoulders of their relatively young stars -- Jamie Foxx and , in this case , Joaquin Phoenix -- the burden of impersonating characters whose real voices , faces and mannerisms could hardly be better known .
( For good measure , " Walk the Line " also gives us brief glimpses of actors playing Elvis Presley , Roy Orbison , Waylon Jennings and Jerry Lee Lewis . )
There are , moreover , some striking biographical similarities between Johnny Cash and Ray Charles , both of whom worked with the filmmakers telling their stories , though neither lived to see the final product .
Like " Ray , " " Walk the Line " tells the tale of a poor Southerner , born in the early years of the Great Depression , whose childhood was marked by the death of a beloved brother .
Between the humble beginnings and the eventual immortality come events that seem almost interchangeable , more like stock situations than lived experiences .
Vintage tour buses rumble down nighttime back roads .
Drug habits are acquired -- heroin for Charles , prescription pills for Cash -- leading to trouble with the law and painful scenes of withdrawal .
The houses and the record labels get bigger ( Charles moved from Atlantic to ABC , Cash from Sun to Columbia ) , the groupies come and go , and the long - suffering wives and girlfriends occasionally burst into angry tears .

Hello all ,
Sorry for the nudity tag but it is needed .
I will be posting lots of images of the model and need some very honest and heavy C & C from anybody and everybody .
Anyway about the model , its a revamped mesh with heavy texture work done in Maxons BodyPaint 3d 2 , which is amazing by the way .
Some texturing in ZBRUSH 2 ( For displacment maps ) and the rest is all done in Lightwave 8.5 , using FPRIME 2 to render .
oh and FPRIME RULES !!!
used G2 for skin shading .
Please tear the work apart I want to improve the model to a better standard , until its flawless and very realistic .
Anyway sorry for the long post and look forward to the C & C !
I can post any G2 settings ( lightwave settings also ) or anything like that if wanted .
cheers

I 've been playing a lot of Advance Wars lately .
It is a perfect little gem of a game , and I 'd like to use it to make some points about good game design .
Good game design increases richness , but eliminates complexity .
Good game design emphasizes content over form .
And , all things being equal , good game design favors mainstream technology over the cutting edge .
I actually travelled back in a time a bit , and played the very first of the series , Famicom Wars for the original Nintendo Entertainment System .
It 's an instructive comparison .
Since that game was introduced in the late 1980s the game mechanics have not changed at all .
Nearly everything about the game , except the graphics , is the same .
And yet the Advanced Wars games are noticeably more fun than Famicom Wars .
Why ?
The answer is simple : the latter games are better because they became simpler .
Richness is Good , Complexity is Bad
If you 've ever been involved in designing and implementing software , you 've participated in the following conversation .
Two engineers will disagree about some aspect of how the product should work .
Implementing either behavior is easy .
Both engineers will present their arguments , and are convinced of the rightness of their position .
Neither can convince the other .
Eventually — perhaps to avoid further conflict , perhaps just to get the issue behind them — someone will suggest " I 've got an idea .
How about we just put a knob on the product , and let the user decide which behavior they get . "
This is almost always the wrong decision .
But often , if all of the engineers are young and inexperienced , and there 's no one around to issue a smackdown , knobs like this make it into the final product .
The product is made uglier and more complex , the end user is presented with choices that she does n't care about , and you sell fewer units .
A game is rich when it presents you with a lot of interesting choices to make .
A game is complex when it presents you with choices that you do n't care about , or when the mechanics of making those choices are intrusive .
When designing a game , it 's apparently easy to confuse complexity with richness .
Richness is a valuable trait in a game .
Complexity is the enemy of fun .
The ideal game provides a maximum amount of richness with a minimum amount of complexity .
Ernest Adams has written about this in some detail .
My favorite recent example of complexity in action would be a game I recently reviewed , Commandos 2 .
Let 's review my description of the UI from that game :
For example , A readies an attack , unless you want to use your fists , in which case you press Q .
In the example I gave earlier , the Sapper would use the I key to cut the wires , D to detect mines , click on the mines to retrieve them , and then P to place mines .
If the Sapper wanted to place a satchel charge , he uses the B key , but to throw a grenade , he'd hit G ( but if his friend the Driver wanted to throw a molotov cocktail , he'd hit S ) .
It 's clear that when develping this title , a large number of tragiocomically poor UI decisions were made .
This is a common syndrome in PC games ; my working theory is that the developers assign keys to functions early in the production cycle .
Then , due to time pressure or thoughtlessness , they never return to ask the question " How should these choices be presented to the user to make the game playable ? "
Compare this to the UI in Advance Wars .
In that game , to attack with a tank you hit the " A " button .
To assault a city with infantry , however , you hit the " A " button .
To launch an air assault against enemy bombers , you hit the " A " button , but contrariwise to use your own bomber to bombard enemy troops , you hit the " A " button .
The odd man out here is shelling with artillery .
I always keep a cheat sheet handy for that one ; you have to remember to hit the " A " button .
One reason that Advance Wars has a better UI is that the constraints of the console require it : there 's simply a limit to the amount of user interface inanity one can have when you 've got only 4 buttons , a joypad , and a few triggers .
This is n't to say that all console games are better than all PC games , or that PC games can't have a good UI ( in fact , the core mechanics of Panzer General are very similar to those of Advance Wars ) .
It 's just that since PC - based games can have needlessly baroque UIs , the realities of schedules and software development tell us that they sometimes will .
The take - away lesson for software developers , I think , is this : in terms of user interaction design , unless you have a damn good reason to do otherwise , design your game as if it will be targeted at a Gameboy Advance .
Protect richness , but destroy , annihilate , and eliminate complexity as if you are Genghis Khan .
You provide richness in a game by increasing the number of interesting choices the player has to make .
Complexity , on the other hand , is created by making it harder to make those choices , or by hiding the interesting choices in a sea of boring ones .
Richness is a virtue .
Complexity is just retarded .
Content Trumps Form
Returning to Advance Wars for a moment , the difference between it and its predecessors is clear : the maps are smaller .
The battles are smaller .
Concepts are introduced a few at a time .
Yes , there are a few " systemic " improvements , such as the introduction of fog of war , but those improvements are n't used on every map .
In other words , the main difference between the earlier and later games is not that the latter games have better mechanics , but that the latter games have better content .
The importance of this can't be overstated .
Let 's look at one of my favorite genres , the RPG , specifically the Baldur 's Gate series .
When Bioware ( and later Black Isle ) poured time and energy into improving the content , they ended up with Baldur 's Gate II and Planescape : Torment , two of the most emotionally engaging and memorable RPGs of their era .
When Bioware poured the same amount of time and energy into the " system , " they ended up with Neverwinter Nights , which for all of its bells and whistles is fundamentally , a scriptable multiplayer 3D mechanism for delivering hollow and empty experiences to players .
There are things I like about Neverwinter .
But an hour of Torment is better than 100 hours of Neverwinter Nights .
Conversely , the NWN engine only became usable with Knights of the Old Republic , a game that focused on content to the exclusion of everything else , and which took much of the user - visible flexibility of the NWN engine and tossed it out the window , strictly limiting what the user could do ( for example , restricting the extent to which the user could reposition the camera ) .
We can see the same dichotomy in the Diablo family of games .
Blizzard delivered Diablo II , which was more or less the exact same game as the first Diablo but with more plot and more items , and created one of the best selling games of all time .
Microsoft delivered Dungeon Siege , emphasizing all of the improved features of their engine , and nobody — except , ironically , modders — cared .
There are groups of users — hardcore gamers , and modders — who care about the details of your game engine .
But the average player just wants to be entertained .
It 's great that I can buy a DVD with a director 's commentary on it talking about what camera , film stock , and lighting was used to make a certain shot .
But we'd think any studio that put a discussion of that on a poster was unwise .
If you find that you can't explain to the public why your game is worth playing without resorting to talking about the underlying technology , then you have lost .
The Cutting Edge is for Bleeders
Diablo II was the top - selling game of its era .
When you look at the other games that were released in 2000 that did n't make enough money for their creators to roll around naked on huge piles of gold , an interesting observation can be made : from a purely technological standpoint , Diablo II was primitive .
No true 3D rendering , for example .
The fact that Diablo was " primitive " and the fact that it sold 8 hojillion copies are related : it meant that anyone , even people with a somewhat out - of - date computer , could buy it and play it .
Furthermore , Diablo II had longevity : as people realized that it played well , it continued to sell like hotcakes over the life of the product .
This is atypical ; your typical " best seller " game , like a hot movie , sells well when it is released and then declines over time .
If you , as a game designer , are absolutely convinced that you have to design a turn - based strategy game that requires an eight - CPU system with a thousand - dollar videocard to play well , I can't stop you .
But the lesson of Diablo II should n't be missed .
Sometimes , it 's true , being on the cutting edge can make the difference between selling a game and not selling it ; World of Warcraft is a great example of a game where the content and technology combine to create something greater than the sum of its parts .
But the cutting edge , as they say , is also the bleeding edge , and being on it has two important side - effects : it reduces the size of the market you are selling to , and it increases the risk that you will ship garbage , or not ship at all .
If your game does n't require cutting edge features , then you 're assuming risk in your schedule for an uncertain payoff .
As a hardcore PC gamer , I have a soft spot in my heart for the bleeding edge .
Many of us remember the first time we saw Doom , and we instinctively want to root for companies that push the edge of the envelope .
But for every game that pushes the envelope and succeeds , there are 10 painful , timewasting flops .
Do n't be one of those : unless you have an absolutely compelling product requirement to not run well on 90 % of your customers ' machines , use mature , well - tested technology for your game .
The Payoff
These are what I see as the main problems facing modern PC games : first , too much complexity , particularly in user interfaces .
Next , there is too much design focus on form , and not enough on content .
Lastly , games often use cutting edge technology for no sensible reason .
In discussing them , I 've sometimes phrased the payoff for developers and publishers in terms of sales .
But that 's just a crude approximation of the real issue : I 'm a PC gamer .
I want to play your games .
I can't play your games if they suck .
There is too much competition from too many other forms of entertainment for me to waste my life downloading the latest " Detonator " drivers to try to eke out another 1.5 % framerate improvement in your product .
I want to spend my brain power figuring out how to circumvallate Vercingetorix at Alesia , not trying to understand why in the world the developer thought I needed to use one keyboard command to move my Hastatii and a completely different one to move my Principes .
One final note , in closing .
I 've been using Advance Wars as my example throughout because it is a Game Boy Advance game .
This handheld console , which has sold about 100 million units , is essentially a repackaged Super Nintendo system .
In other words , the best turn - based strategy game on the market was created with technology that dates from 1990 .
Keep that in mind when sitting down to create the product requirements for your next game .
Not every game is a strategy game , but every game has to maintain a balance between richness and complexity .
If your game is n't as good as it should be , maybe you should n't be asking yourself what you can add .
Maybe you should be asking yourself what you can cut .
Thanks to Peter Su and Nat Lanza for their suggestions on this article .
The title was inspired by Donald Norman 's book The Design of Everyday Things .
Keep in mind , I 've run Tomdispatch.com for only a few years , but I 've been a book editor in mainstream publishing for over 30 years .
Sometime last spring , I was on the phone with former federal prosecutor Elizabeth de la Vega talking about books she might someday write , when she suddenly said to me , " You know what I 'd like to do ? "
When I asked what , she replied , " What I 've done all my life . "
" What 's that , " I wondered innocently enough .
" I 'd like to draft an indictment of President Bush and his senior aides , and present the case for prewar intelligence fraud to a grand jury , just as if it were an actual case of mine , using the evidence we already have in the public record .
That 's the book I 'd like to do . "
With those three decades of publishing experience , I never doubted that this was an idea whose time should come -- and now it has .
De la Vega has drawn up that indictment -- a " hypothetical " one , she hastens to add -- convened that grand jury , and held seven days of testimony .
Yes , it 's a grand jury directly out of her fertile brain and the federal agents who testify are fictional , but all the facts are true .
She understands the case against the Bush administration down to the last detail ; and she 's produced , to my mind , the book of the post- election , investigative season : United States v. George W. Bush et al .
It 's a Tomdispatch.com book project , produced in conjunction with Seven Stories Press , a superb independent publisher , and officially published on December 1st .
I think it 's simply sensational .
It makes a " slam dunk " case for the way we were defrauded into war ; despite the grim subject matter , it 's a beautifully designed little book , a pleasure to hold in your hand ; and , because de la Vega is a natural as a writer , it 's also thoroughly enjoyable reading .
With genuine pride , I 'll be turning the Tomdispatch.com website over to excerpts from the book this week , beginning with the posting of De la Vega 's introduction on the Enronization of American foreign policy today .
The actual " indictment " will be posted on Wednesday ; the first day of grand jury testimony on Thursday .
I assure you , this is must - read event ; no less important , this is a must - buy book that must be given over the holiday season to friends , relatives , those who politically disagree with you , and even perhaps sent to Congressional representatives .
Please get the investigative ball rolling by purchasing the book at Amazon.com or , if you want to give all involved a few extra cents , directly at the Seven Stories website .
Today , United States v. George W. Bush et al remains in the realm of fiction , but tomorrow , if you lend a hand who knows ?
Tom
Elizabeth de la Vega , appearing on behalf of the United States .
That is a phrase I 've uttered hundreds of times in twenty years as a federal prosecutor .
I retired two years ago .
So , obviously , I do not now speak for any U.S. Attorney 's Office , nor do I represent the federal government .
This should be apparent from the fact that I am proposing a hypothetical indictment of the President and his senior advisers -- not a smart move for any federal employee who wishes to remain employed .
Lest anyone miss the import of this paragraph , let me emphasize that it is a DISCLAIMER : I am writing as a private citizen .
Obviously , as a private citizen , I cannot simply draft and file an indictment .
Nor can I convene a grand jury .
Instead , in the following pages I intend to present a hypothetical indictment to a hypothetical grand jury .
The defendants are President George W. Bush , Vice President Richard Cheney , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , and former Secretary of State Colin Powell .
The crime is tricking the nation into war -- in legal terms , conspiracy to defraud the United States .
And all of you are invited to join the grand jury .
We will meet for seven days .
On day one , I 'll present the indictment in the morning and in the afternoon I will explain the applicable law .
On days two through seven , we 'll have witness testimony , presented in transcript form , with exhibits .
As is the practice in most grand jury presentations , the evidence will be presented in summary form , by federal agents -- except that these agents are hypothetical .
( Any relationship to actual federal agents , living or deceased , is purely coincidental . )
On day seven , when the testimony is complete , I 'll leave the room to allow the grand jury to vote .
If the indictment and grand jury are hypothetical , the evidence is not .
I 've prepared for this case , just as I would have done for any other case in my years as a prosecutor , by reviewing all of the available relevant information .
In this case , such information consists of witness accounts , the defendants ' speeches , public remarks , White House press briefings , interviews , congressional testimony , official documents , all public intelligence reports , and various summaries of intelligence , such as in the reports of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the 9/11 Commission .
I 've discarded any evidence , however compelling , that is uncorroborated .
Then , using a sophisticated system of documents piled on every surface in my dining room , I 've organized and analyzed the reliable information chronologically , by topic , and by defendant .
I 've compared what the President and his advisers have said publicly to what they knew and said behind the scenes .
Finally , I 've presented the case through testimony that will , I hope , make sense and keep everybody awake .
After analyzing this evidence in light of the applicable law , I 've determined that we already have more than enough information to allow a reasonable person to conclude that the President conducted a wide - ranging effort to deceive the American people and Congress into supporting a war against Iraq .
In other words , in legal terms , there is probable cause to believe that Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Rice , and Powell violated Title 18 , United States Code , Section 371 , which prohibits conspiracies to defraud the United States .
Probable cause is the standard of proof required for a grand jury to return an indictment .
Consequently , we have more than sufficient evidence to warrant indictment of the President and his advisers .
Do I expect someone to promptly indict the President and his aides ?
No .
I am aware of the political impediments and constitutional issues relating to the indictment of a sitting president .
Do those impediments make this merely an empty exercise ?
Absolutely not .
I believe this presentation adds a singular perspective to the debate about the President 's use of prewar intelligence : that of an experienced federal prosecutor .
Certainly , scholars and experts such as Barbara Olshansky , David Lindorff , Michael Ratner , John Dean , and Elizabeth Holtzman have written brilliantly about the legal grounds for impeachment that arise from the President 's misrepresentations about the grounds for an unprovoked invasion of Iraq .
But for most Americans , the debate about White House officials ' responsibility for false preinvasion statements remains fixed on , and polarized around , the wrong question : Did the President and his team lie about the grounds for war ?
For many , the suggestion that the President lied is heresy , more shocking than a Baptist minister announcing during vespers that he 's a cross -dresser .
For many others -- indeed , now the majority of Americans -- that the President lied to get his war is a given , although no less shocking .
So my goals are threefold .
First , I want to explain that under the law that governs charges of conspiracy to defraud , the legal question is not whether the President lied .
The question is not whether the President subjectively believed there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
The legal question that must be answered is far more comprehensive : Did the President and his team defraud the country ?
After swearing to uphold the law of the land , did our highest government officials employ the universal techniques of fraudsters -- deliberate concealment , misrepresentations , false pretenses , half - truths -- to deceive Congress and the American people ?
My second goal is to supplement the scholarly analyses already written , by moving beyond exposition , beyond theory , to the inside of the courtroom , or more precisely , the grand jury room .
By presenting the President 's conspiracy to defraud just as a prosecutor would present any fraud conspiracy , I hope to enable readers to consider the case in an uncharged atmosphere , applying criminal law to the evidence that they believe has been proved to the standard of probable cause , just as grand jurors would in any other case .
Why is it important to do this ?
Because whether the President and his senior officials conspired to defraud the United States about the grounds for war is , at least on one level , a legal question , but , without a shift in political will , there will never be any reasoned consideration of it as such .
The President will not be held accountable for misrepresenting the prewar intelligence unless and until Congress conducts hearings similar to the Watergate hearings .
As yet , however , we seem painfully incapable of reaching that point .
We are like inept tennis partners , collectively letting the ball slip by in the no-man 's - land between the service line and the baseline , or in this case , between the legal and the political .
Perhaps more important , however , is that , although the evidence of wrongdoing is overwhelming , the facts are so complicated -- far more so than those that prompted the Watergate hearings -- that it 's impossible to have a productive debate about them in the political sphere .
Indeed , modern - day spin has vanquished substance so thoroughly that even the most well - grounded charge of deliberate deception is often considered more despicable than the deception itself .
One forum where that 's not true is the courtroom .
The court system is far from perfect , but there we at least expect that people will not substitute personal attacks for argument .
We expect a reasoned exploration of fact versus fiction , honest mistake versus deliberate fraud .
We also expect , and the law requires , that people hear all the evidence before deciding , thereby avoiding the rapid volley of sound bites that so regularly masquerades for debate on television .
Hence , this hypothetical grand jury presentation : it is a vehicle to deliver a message .
My third goal is to send the message home -- to whomever will listen .
And this is it :
The President has committed fraud .
It is a crime in the legal , not merely the colloquial , sense .
It is far worse than Enron .
It is not a victimless crime .
We cannot shrug our shoulders and walk away .
Why ?
Because We Are All Kitty Genovese 's Neighbors
As an Assistant U. S. Attorney in Minneapolis , a member of the Organized Crime Strike Force in San Jose , and Chief of the San Jose Branch U.S. Attorney 's Office , I prosecuted all manner of criminal cases .
There were bank embezzlements , government frauds , violent takeover robberies , piloting a commercial passenger flight while under the influence -- the pilot had had twenty rum and ( diet ) Cokes and four hours ' sleep before takeoff -- and investment frauds , to name a few .
Most were interesting ; some downright loopy .
One hapless fellow , for example , stole a truck filled with frozen turkeys and drove it across state lines to Wisconsin , thereby landing himself in federal prison rather than in county jail .
For good measure , the following week -- before he'd been apprehended for the frozen - turkey heist -- he stole a truck filled with packaged frozen broccoli and drove it to Iowa .
Unquestionably , though , the most compelling cases were those that involved victims -- of violent crimes , robberies , or fraud .
So I was not surprised to hear the lead Enron prosecutor 's comment after the jury convicted former Enron CEOs Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling : " What inspired me , " John Hueston said , " was just that , that I had spoken to so many employees , so many victims who lost their savings , people who pleaded with me and the other prosecutors to see justice done . "
Thanks to Hueston and his team , the victims of the Enron fraud -- a $ 68 billion dollar crime that left 20,000 people without jobs , pensions , and life 's savings -- have obtained some measure of justice .
They will never be made whole , but at least the CEOs who orchestrated the fraud have been held accountable .
In the case of the largest corporate fraud ever prosecuted in the United States , the system has worked , albeit imperfectly .
Thus far , however , in the case of the vastly broader and more devastating Iraq war fraud orchestrated by the CEO of the United States and his management team , the system has failed .
And we are all victims of this fraud .
George W. Bush exploited the vulnerability of an entire populace reeling from the September 11 , 2001 , attacks to manipulate them into supporting a war based on false pretenses .
If the financial cost of the President 's fraud is astronomical -- $ 340 billion in direct war costs alone as of August 2006 -- the human cost is incalculable , and far more profound : over 2,500 American soldiers killed and 19,000 wounded ; possibly many more than 50,000 Iraqis killed ; untold numbers of grieving Iraqi and American family members ; hundreds of thousands of Iraqis homeless ; and a million soldiers who have been sent to this war and will never be the same .
While we are all victims of the President 's crime , we are also all bystanders .
The crime is ongoing , happening right before our eyes , and we are all onlookers ; we are all , in a sense , Kitty Genovese 's neighbors .
As Malcolm Gladwell recounts in his book The Tipping Point , Kitty Genovese was viciously assaulted , stabbed three times , and finally killed , on the way to her Queens , New York , home one night in 1964 .
Thirty - eight neighbors heard or watched her ordeal , but no one called the police until the attack was essentially over .
The murder was universally seen as a horrifying example of modern - day indifference to the plight of others .
But , Gladwell explains , psychologists Bibb Latane and John Darley conducted experiments that led to a far different explanation : " When people are in a group . . . responsibility for acting is diffused .
They assume that someone else will make the call , or they assume that because no one else is acting , the apparent problem . . . is not really a problem . "
Ironically , then , it was not that no one called to help Kitty Genovese " despite the fact that thirty - eight people heard her scream ; it 's that no one called because thirty - eight people heard her scream . "
For over a year now , polls have shown that the majority of Americans believe President Bush deliberately misrepresented prewar intelligence .
Executive branch officials who deliberately mislead Congress and the public intending to influence congressional action have committed a federal crime .
That means that roughly 100 million Americans believe Bush has committed a crime , yet most , like Kitty Genovese 's neighbors , are just passive bystanders -- although not , I believe , due to indifference .
Indeed , many of us are just watching it happen because we feel powerless to stop it .
Hundreds of thousands of people have , in effect , called 911 , but not even Democrats in Congress have been willing to answer the phone .
It is not that they do n't have enough information ; it is , our Democratic representatives say , because it is not good political strategy .
The proposition that it is not good political strategy to insist that government officials obey the law is highly debatable .
More important , strategizing in the face of an ongoing crime is wrong .
Ask any legislator whether he would strategize about possible political fallout before intervening to stop a crime that was occurring in front of his eyes and the response would be , " Of course not . "
But that is exactly what 's happening right now .
So , consider this my 911 call .
I 'm calling on Democrats and Republicans to do the right thing .
And I 'm calling on everyone else to do whatever you can to convince Congress to do the right thing .
I am not talking about bringing people to justice in the vengeful sense that President Bush employs .
I am talking about effecting justice .
I am talking , finally , about holding our highest government officials accountable for a complex and calculated program of false pretense , misleading statements , and material omissions -- a criminal betrayal of trust that is strikingly similar to , yet far worse than , the fraud committed by Enron 's top officials .
Enron : Misleading Statements and Material Omissions
In July of 2002 , President Bush stood before a snappy blue - and - white banner marked " Corporate Responsibility " and announced that he was opposed to fraud .
With the enactment of the new Corporate Corruption Act , the President declared , there would " not be a different ethical standard for corporate America than the standard that applies to everyone else .
The honesty you expect in your small businesses , or in your workplace . . . will be expected and enforced in every corporate suite in this country . "
CEOs would now have to personally vouch for the truth of their public statements .
Bush 's speech announcing a higher standard for CEOs was itself misleading .
Hearing it , one might easily conclude that if the President had n't pushed for this new law , corporate officers would be legally entitled to lie , cheat , and steal .
Not true , of course .
The new law , also called the Sarbanes - Oxley Act , did not suddenly , for the first time in United States history , require corporate officials to be truthful , forthright , and fair with the public .
Such obligations have been inherent in criminal fraud and other statutes for years .
Indeed , the Enron prosecution did not involve the Sarbanes - Oxley Act at all .
The main charge was conspiracy to defraud : that is , conspiring to deceive investors by manipulating financial data , making false and misleading statements , and deliberately omitting important facts , in violation of Title 18 , United States Code , Section 371 .
Manipulation of data , false and misleading statements , and material omissions -- sound familiar ?
At trial , former Enron CEOs Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling claimed they were not responsible for the deception because they had no idea what their underlings were doing .
As the jury was instructed , however , anyone who makes representations intending that the public will rely on them , has an affirmative obligation to make sure that they are true and accurate .
Representations made with reckless indifference to their truth are as false as outright lies .
After four months of complex testimony , the jury reached a simple conclusion : Lay and Skilling were responsible for what went on in their company .
As school principal Freddie Delgado put it : " I can't say that I do n't know what my teachers were doing in the classroom .
I am still responsible if a child gets lost . "
In other words , the Enron jurors concluded that , legally , the desks of CEOs Lay and Skilling were the final repositories of the proverbial buck .
Those jurors were average Americans -- office workers , educators , engineers , a nurse -- and they knew , even without the Sarbanes - Oxley Act , that CEOs should be held to the same standards of honesty and accountability that they would apply to themselves in their own lives .
Faced with evidence that Lay and Skilling had repeatedly made public statements that were seriously undermined , if not flatly contradicted , by information and warnings they had received behind the scenes , the jury refused to allow them to avoid responsibility by blaming their subordinates .
Iraq : Misleading Statements and Material Omissions
The techniques of deception used by George W. Bush and his aides are identical to those used by Lay and Skilling .
In his July 2002 speech announcing the signing of the Corporate Corruption Bill , the President said , " The only fair risks are [ those ] based on honest information . "
The President and his top advisers were acutely aware of the solemn risks posed by an invasion of Iraq , but instead of debating those risks honestly , they developed slogans , including the familiar " risks of inaction are greater than the risks of action " that simultaneously usurped and deflected counterarguments while providing no information whatsoever , honest or otherwise .
Such propaganda , cynical and craven as it is , might not qualify as criminal fraud , but the propaganda alone was insufficient to convince Congress and the American people to invest in the plan for war .
To remedy this deficiency and close the deal , the President and his top aides made hundreds of representations , both general and specific , that were carefully crafted to manipulate public opinion .
As we now know , many of those assertions were false and misleading .
More important , we also now know that President Bush and his advisers had notice and direct knowledge that their representations were seriously undermined and in some key instances , disproved by information that was available to them .
Consistently , the President and his aides knowingly conveyed false impressions , concealed important information , made deliberate misrepresentations , and professed certainty about facts that were speculative at best .
Such is the definition of criminal fraud -- whether committed by the President of the United States or the CEO of a major corporation .
The only difference between the fraud committed by the Enron officers and the fraud committed by the President is that the latter was far more comprehensive and far more calculated .
Even as President Bush stood center stage endorsing honesty that July four years ago , he and his company were setting the stage for another show .
If the " only fair risks " speech was a perky Frank Capra clip , the White House 's next production would be twenty - first - century H.G. Wells .
As of July 30 , 2002 , Bush had directed the creation of the White House Iraq Group , a public - relations operation whose sole purpose was to market the war .
This team , collectively called WHIG , was co-chaired by the President 's closest aides and long - term political consultants , Senior Adviser Karl Rove -- whom Bush has described as " the architect " of his 2004 reelection campaign -- and former Counselor to the President Karen Hughes .
By July 30 , 2002 , the White House Iraq Group had already begun fabricating an ominous scenario that blurred together the September 11 tragedy , mushroom clouds rising over American cities , and terrorists releasing strains of smallpox , interspersed with the shadowy face of a mad Iraqi dictator spring - loaded to attack the United States .
They were collecting props -- anthrax vials and undated photos showing centrifuge components and unidentifiable buildings where something ominous might be happening , but we can't afford to wait to find out .
They were writing the script : power phrases like " Grave and gathering danger " and " We can't afford to let the smoking gun be a mushroom cloud , " designed less to inform than to inflame .
And , finally , Rove , Hughes , and company were scheduling appearances for the President 's War Council members that would begin just a month later , in early September 2002 .
It was to be a bravura performance by the President , the Vice President , the Secretary of Defense , the Secretary of State , the National Security Adviser , and many supporting cast members .
The production was so well done , in fact , that , like the radio audience terrified into hysteria by the infamous " War of the Worlds " broadcast of 1938 , most of us were fooled .
Admittedly , we resisted buying the duct tape and plastic sheeting ; we may not have wrapped our heads in wet towels to ward off Martian gas like the 1938 radio audience .
What happened , however , was much worse : because of Bush 's fiction , we agreed to bomb people 8,000 miles away whose only " crime " was that they were oppressed by a violent and cruel dictator .
Undoubtedly , Americans were panicked by H. G. Wells 's radio play in part because they were exhausted and nervous in those tough Depression years .
But Orson Welles ' breathless report of a Martian invasion was never intended to cause panic , nor was it ultimately harmful .
The President 's elaborate production was , and still remains , an entirely different story .
It was a deliberate effort to create a permanent state of fear in America .
And to say it was harmful is like saying that it hurts to get hit by a Mack truck .
Federal sentencing guidelines recognize that one who defrauds a vulnerable victim , such as a salesman who falsely represents the curative benefits of an elixir to a cancer patient , has committed an even more serious crime than one who defrauds a person who is not so " particularly susceptible . "
The President knew that Americans were " particularly susceptible " in 2002 .
We were exhausted , and justifiably terrified , not only because of September 11 but also because of the anthrax murders and the random Washington , DC , sniper killings that coincided with the Bush - Cheney administration 's push for war .
President Bush and his White House Iraq Group did not merely exploit this fear ; they magnified it .
Worse yet , the President was the very person upon whom the public relied to protect it from danger and , one would hope , from omnipresent fear itself .
Having used the authority of the Oval Office to make people more afraid , having created an even darker backdrop of fear , our highest officials exploited that reliance and the trust they enjoyed by virtue of their positions to sell something they knew the American public would not otherwise have bought .
It was as if the cancer victim 's trusted personal physician had convinced him that his disease was more advanced than it really was , and then used the same fraudulently heightened fear to manipulate him into buying a bogus cure - all .
In the language of criminal law , the President and his senior advisers have abused a position of trust to defraud the most vulnerable of victims .
How would such a case be presented for prosecution ?

Amendment I
" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; " U.S. law is based on English common law , which was based on Roman law .
Note that the two concepts in the Constitution that could be called religiously based are the acceptance of slavery and the treatment of women as second class citizens .
The Declaration of Independence mentions Nature 's God , not the Christian God .
It is also not the basis for the U.S. government , the Constitution is .
The U.S. is no more a Christian nation than it is a white nation .
In 1961 , the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed that federal law prohibits states from requiring any kind of religious test to serve in office when it ruled in favor of a Maryland atheist seeking appointment as a notary public .

Britney Spears will hold a press conference on Thursday ( 04May06 ) , but even her closest aides have no idea what she 's going to announce .
The Toxic superstar has invited selected media representatives , journalists and record industry executives to the Los Angeles Convention Center .
The 24 - year - old has not revealed what the subject matter of the press conference will be , but it is widely anticipated she will officially announce her second pregnancy with husband Kevin Federline .
Sony executive Karen Phillips says , " Britney has n't held a press conference in so long that we know it 's something big - pregnancy , a split , we 're not sure .
" Spears and Federline wed in September 2004 after a whirlwind romance and have eight - month - old son Sean Preston together .
The couple have been plagued by persistent rumours of relationship problems and have not been seen together in the past few weeks .
Jive Records and Spears ' management team are reportedly planning to release her fifth album in November ( 06 ) , and a world tour is tentatively scheduled for 2007 .
Spears was also due to perform at numerous award shows this year ( 06 ) , but has since cancelled the commitments without explanation .

BTFS Now in Alpha !
A new program is available in the btslave distribution : btmount .
This program uses the FUSE module to allow you to mount a torrent as a file system .
Check out the Sourceforge page for downloads .
Download Faster BTSlave builds on the brilliance of BitTorrent , enabling faster downloading of large files .
BTSlave allows you to upload files when it is convenient for you , but when you need it , it 's there to help you download fast .
Many users should see their download rates increase by 4 x or more , especially when “ flash crowds ” hit .
So when that new popular file gets released , BTSlave can save you days .
How it Works BTSlave does not replace your current BitTorrent client .
Feel free to continue using Azureus , BitTornado , etc. BTSlave simply helps your BitTorrent client download faster .
An extended BitTorrent peer protocol allows BTSlave to make friends , and help them download over time , When you need faster downloads , BTSlave asks it 's friends to come help .
BTSlave is a “ slave repeater ” .
A BitTorrent repeater is a client that only downloads data when no one is interested in the data it already has .
Repeaters can achieve very high upload / download ratios , and they help the other peers in a torrent download faster .
The “ slave ” part means that the repeater has as it's main goal helping out it's “ master ” -- your usual BitTorrent client .
Feel free to check out the current version of the proposed BitTorrent friends protocol .
The Problem Down - loaders of big files typically leave their torrents after downloading .
This leads to an average upload / download ratio of around 1/1 .
This limits many of us to download rates of about 40 K bytes / second , instead of the 250 K or better that our cable - modems / DSL can support .
BTSlave aims to solve this problem .
A good analysis of the BitTorrent protocol can be found at : http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/12/18/bittorrent_measurements_analysis/
One very interesting conclusion : " We believe that all current implementations of the BitTorrent protocol
exhibit a fundamental design flaw .
Currently peers are punished for
seeding , as their Internet connections are then used at maximum capacity
to the significant benefit of other ( downloading ) peers .
Instead of
punishing seeders , peers should be given an incentive to seed , possibly
at a bandwidth of their own choosing . "
BTSlave provides exactly this kind of incentive .
You leave it running until it 's collected enough IOUs , and later , you cash them in for help downloading files .
The rest of this web page describes the basic ideas .
BitTorrent Free Repeaters
More of us would be willing to leave our BT clients running with lots of torrents open , except that :-
It uses too much disk space to remain in lots of torrents -
It is difficult joining and managing lots of torrents
For example , I just upgraded to Linux FC3 , and downloaded 2.3G of data .
I burned the DVD , and had to remove the data to save disk space .
I might be willing to donate upload time to another torrent with smaller files , but which one ?
I cannot simply look at a list of web links and predict the torrent that would benefit the most .
Both of these problems can be solved .
In particular , a modified client could do the job without modifying the BT protocol .
In effect , I 'm writing a BT repeater in a multi-cast system .
I call the modified client a BitTorrent free repeater .
Here 's how I imagine the repeater will work : - The repeater will automatically download all . torrent files from a list of user - supplied . torrent file servers .
-
The repeater will enter the torrent that needed additional bandwidth the most .
-
To limit space on the hard - drive , only a user - specified sized cache will be used for writing pieces of files .
A typical cache might be from a few MB to a few hundred MB . -
The repeater will download only enough pieces to insure the repeater 's upload bandwidth is fully used .
This leads to a very high upload / download ratio , thus increasing the torrent 's overall download rate .
-
The repeater will exit the torrent once it 's cache fills up , flush it 's cache , and then repeat this process .
BitTorrent Slave Repeaters
Most people leave torrents once they 've finished downloading .
Simply offering the world free repeaters probably wont accomplish much , since many of us would need to run them before any of us saw a significant download bandwidth improvement .
We need a more selfish reason for people run their repeaters , or it probably wont ever happen .
The answer is slave repeaters .
To write a slave repeater , I 'll first finish writing the free repeater , then I 'll then modify the free repeater client to become a slave repeater .
Rather than have it fairly choose peers to transfer file pieces with , the slave repeater will immediately forward new pieces it gets to it's " master peer " -- the user 's normal BT client .
If the repeater has no piece the master wants , it will try to obtain one by only being interested in connecting with peers that have pieces the master is missing .
This algorithm should not hurt the torrent in any way , since the repeater will forward as much data to the torrent as it gets just like any normal BT client .
However , the additional upload bandwidth it brings to the torrent will be split evenly between servicing the torrent and feeding it 's master .
And , when there is no piece that the master is currently interested in , the slave repeater will act as a free repeater , thus helping the torrent 's performance overall .
Assuming that I use 40 KB / s as a max upload speed on all my BT clients ( master and slave repeaters ) , every slave repeater I set up ( at other sites - not on my own cable modem ) should increase my master download speed by about 20 KB / s. Slave Friends Chances are that any brownie points accrued by a slave repeater once it 's master is no longer interested will be wasted .
In other words , a slave repeater does the master no good once the master completes his download by simply contributing download bandwidth to the torrent .
However , BitTorrent clients publish the version of the client running , so a slave repeater will be able to see all the other slaves in a torrent , and could strike up a conversation with them .
If any of the other slaves could use help transferring pieces to their masters , an idle slave will help them before helping the torrent in general .
A slave will expect future help from slaves that it helps .
A tit - for - tat algorithm will be used to insure that this happens ( if you do n't help my master , I wont help yours ) .
This algorithm creates a high incentive for masters to leave their slaves working around the clock .
I hope to be able to host a torrent of only slave repeaters to help them get to know each other .

Ease - of - use should not mean neuter - the - software
Is our heart in the right place but our execution flawed when we neuter a product in the name of newbie - friendliness ?
In the push to make programs " so simple even your [ mom / kid / dog ] could use it " , there are a lot of dumb products out there .
Or rather , dumbed - down products .
It 's like we 're throwing the power baby out with the poor UI bathwater .
But if we want passionate users , ease - of - use should NOT be the Big Design Goal .
Good usability is the enabler for what we ( users ) really want -- more superpowers .
We want to do things .
Cooler things .
Advanced things .
More creative things .
We do n't want to be better at using the tool , we want to be better at doing whatever it is the tool supports !
Usually when we talk about this it 's - not - about - being - better - at - the - tool thing , we 're coming from the perspective of what and how we teach our users .
This post , however , is about the software , product , web site , service , itself .
Take a look at this chart , and ask yourself how you 'd describe the two boxes with question marks .
We know the bottom right quadrant is awesome , and in the top left , there be dragons .
But what of the top right ?
What of the bottom left ?
Think about it for a moment before you continue ( or before you , as most of you will do , skip to the next graphic ; )
It 's great that so many are putting the " user " back in " user interface " , but using a brain - dead - simple tool does NOT necessarily mean an " I Rule ! " experience .
Maybe we need to spend more time thinking about providing superpowers and a little less time on simplifying .
The last thing we want is to build the Tic - Tac - Toe equivalent of software , when the user ultimately wants to play Chess .
( Note : I said " when " the user wants to play Chess .
Sometimes the ultra - beginner - only product is exactly what 's needed , and might be extremely successful , but it does mean that users will outgrow it before they ever become passionate .
This post is about the products that do NOT want to be newbie - only . )
Without challenge , there can be no growth and no flow state .
And wherever you find real passion , you always find challenges .
Alan Kay once said something like , " We do a great job of helping people practice being beginners .
We help them get really good at being beginners .
What we need are ways to help people start at an intermediate level so they can start doing something rewarding right away . "
Of course usability is absolutely crucial , and it's a prereq for pretty much everything .
A UI that gets in the way of the thing the user is trying to do is a deal - killer ( or at least a flow - killer ) .
But there 's a difference between " Good UI " and " Ease - of - use " !
If I 'm doing something complex , by choice , then focusing on making it easier might not be the right move .
Assuming the power is there , the main goal should be to keep the UI the hell out of the way of what I 'm trying to do .
You may not have made it technically an easier product to use , but you 've made it a product that supports more time in flow , doing the thing I want to do ( which is NOT " use the software " , but rather " edit video " or " write a letter " or " mix audio " ) .
Perhaps I need a qualifier for the word " easy " , because while the thing I 'm doing with the tool may be quite difficult , it 's true that I want the how - I - communicate - with - the - program to be as easy as possible .
I do want it to be extremely easy to figure out how to tell the software what to do , but I do NOT want the software to pat me on the head and say , " do n't worry your little head ...
I 'll take care of it all for you with this nicey - wicey wizard and this fuzzy - wuzzy dialog box and all the helpful things I can do for you like capitalize words ( since you 're too stupid and lazy to do it yourself ) " .
And I do NOT want the software to simply strip out all the functionality that 's too complex to simplify .
So I guess there 's at least two different forms of easy : easy - as - in - natural - usability and easy - as - in - dumbed - down .
But what about Featuritis ?
" Featuritis " comes from adding horizontal ( broad ) capabilities , rather than adding vertical ( deep ) capabilities .
Rather than add 25 new ways to do the same shallow things , add 5 new advanced capabilities .
I do n't want to do more things , I want to be more advanced .
Photoshop , for example , would be adding horizontal features if they added new painting tools , or yet more ways to configure your tool bars , etc .
But adding new capability to their color correction and RAW tools , for example , would be adding vertical features .
One leads to featuritis , the other leads to more powerful users .
Featuritis is not so much about feature quantity ... it 's about feature shallowness .
By all means , please give me more features .
But they must be the right features , and to figure out " right " , we have to know our users , we have to narrow down the domain in which they use our products ( e.g. is Photoshop about photography or digital painting ? ) and make some assumptions about their goals , motivation , and background .
1 ) Adding power through different products or product editions
When we add features , they should be the next natural things an advanced user wants to do , but the new superpowers do n't necessarily need to be in the same product ...
Apple provides a dumbed - down ( but still wonderful ) free music making tool in Garageband .
It 's extremely easy to get started ( which is great ) , and ridiculously simple to use , but even a non-musician who really gets into Garageband starts to bump into Garageband 's limitations pretty quickly .
And as if by magic , Apple 's non-free product Logic Express just coincidentally happens to have the features you find yourself wanting after you 've started to max out Garageband .
( And the same thing repeats when you bump into Logic Express limitations , there 's always the much more expensive full - featured Logic .
Apple uses the same thing 3 - tier / first - one - is - free - crack - model with their video editing tools as well ) .
2 ) Adding power through user - created extensions
Many excellent , successful products take the approach of , " Sure , we could keep piling more and more features on after listening to all the requests , but each added feature would just annoy everyone except the one person who asked for that particular feature ... so instead , we 'll let YOU add new features . "
IBM once had an Expert System tool called TIRS , and when users wanted to do more , rather than continuing to add to their API , they opened up the system so that you could embed your own C functions in a rule .
Allowing plug-ins , extensions , macros , third - party modules , etc. is ( sometimes ) a great way to add far more vertical / deep power than you could ever come up with when YOU are both the developer and , well , the decider of what should be there .
3 ) Adding power through " advanced modes "
Yeah , yeah , yeah I know that this is controversial , and I have virtually no credibility in developing a product with different user modes , but ... it can work .
4 ) Adding power through a willingness to sacrifice newbies
We can't be all things to all people .
The cliche of " catering to the lowest common denominator " is one we all consider negative , yet we still do it .
It can be a form of greediness !
If we can only do one thing well , then we have to choose carefully .
And if can't find a clear way to add advanced capability while hiding the complexity from the newbie , then some of us must choose to leave the newbies to someone else .
( Yes , there are a million implicit qualifiers , conditions , disclaimers , exceptions , etc. )
Being the one who nails it for the newbies is a very successful strategy for a lot of products and services .
But again , once those newbies leave the nest , they have to look elsewhere .
And the better we are at inspiring enthusiasm and loyalty in beginners , the more they want to continue with us ( " I trusted you this far , and you really came through ... now help me get to the next level " ) .
5 ) Adding power by truly knowing ( and not underestimating ) your users
Recently someone showed me a very early alpha of a start - up web app he 's working on .
The target audience is " regular people " ( i.e. not programmers or other hard - core geeks ) .
I was horrified when he showed me what amounted to a command - line style of input .
Command - line ?!
But then he reminded me that most people who are n't right in front of their computers write things down .
Most adults are not just comfortable but experts at writing on paper .
When I write someone 's phone number on a piece of paper , I do n't have a separate little piece of paper for [ first name ] [ last name ] [ area code ] [ phone ] [ cellphone ] and on and on .
I just write the damn thing down as a string of characters .
So ... why not allow ( or even encourage ) users to simply type things in rather than forcing them to go through complex wizards and dialog boxes .
This particular example is fraught with UI landmines including the problem of users needing to memorize the exact order and syntax they have to type things in .
And yes , that could render the whole thing virtually unusable .
But if the software had some very intelligent , clever parsing and could just look at the text and figure it out ( or at least make a high - probability smart guess ) , then you 've got a way to enable a ton of power without having to add endless dialog boxes and windows and choices and other get - in - the - way features .
The point is , that while it looked DRASTICALLY counter - intuitive to me to have " regular users " essentially work in a command - line interface ( fortunately it looked and felt like a simple text edit window as opposed to , say , a DOS prompt ) , when the guy showing it to me framed it as , " Writing things as text is the most natural thing there is " I felt my brain shift a little .
And then I began to consider all the software that babies us , insults us , and ultimately gets in our way ... something Jason talked about when he delivered Opening Remarks at SXSW ( classic example : " I can capitalize words mySELF thank you very much ... " ) .
[ Here 's a podcast / mp3 recording of the talk .
Incidentally , I am the scared s*** less lucky one delivering the Opening Remarks for the next SXSW Interactive in March .
I 'm hoping Jason will give me some tips ; he gave a wonderful talk ]
So ... as always , now it 's your turn .
This is a tricky topic , and everyone has something to add to the story .
Are too many of us dumbing down our products ?
What are other ways we can help our beginners without leaving them stuck in that lower left quadrant ?
Remember , an " I Rule ! " does n't come from success ... it comes from doing something challenging .

If we just make it look simpler , people will use it more .
Simplicity is the current trend in Web interfaces , going back to the Google homepage and forward to Web 2.0 [ Read More ]

I 'd like to note that sometimes you can have a very easy and very simple tool , but with lots of use cases .
In that case I think you should keep the tool simple , but make sure that the documentation gets more " power " .
To give a simple example .
A ball is a very simple toy .
Yet it is stilly very flexible .
You can play soccer with it , you can play volley , basket , dodge , ..
In this case you do n't want to make the ball some high - tech masterpiece full of features .
You might add a nice little book that describes a whole bunch of fun games you can play with it .

Great article , good to see something different from the usual ( Make everything as simple and easy to use as possible . )
The idea of making things advanced / powerful and not too newbie - friendly would be a good one for MMORPGs ( multiplayer roleplaying games ) as people are , by choice , looking for a challenge over there .
But for traditional , desktop / web based software , making things simple is the way to go .
Like Jason from 37 signals says , " You always have more people not using your software than people already using it " , so sacrificing the simplicity just to give more advanced features to the power users and sacrificing the newbies is not a very good investment .
Besides , we have to keep in mind that introducing these features probably means more development effort as well compared to the easy - to - use / simple stuff .
Although capitalizing words is sometimes annoying and an interruption .
May be if you gave us actual examples of software which is ' too easy ' then we 'll figure this out better , as right now it just sounds like a urban tale to me :)

Kathy , the article is just terrific .
I was thinking along the same lines .
May be Jason is advocating ' simple is beautiful ' , but Einstein said ' Make things as simple as possible , but not simpler ' which
I like more .
37signal 's voice was much needed in a time when feature creep was killing lots of software .
But people take the ' simple ' side
way too literally .
Many apps are created so simple that their authors just can't charge any money .
Once the initial excitement
of the release of the next web 2.0 app is gone , people go to the next ' simple ' app .
What is the number one graphics app for professionals ?
Adobe Photoshop .
What is the number one graphics app for home use , yet powerful ?
Adobe Photoshop Elements .
What is the number one graphics app for very very beginners ?
Whatever software came with your PC or your camera .
People will invest time to learn to use a product , if it is rewarding them with ' kick - ass ' results .

Borris ,
I do n't know much about the history of Photoshop , but my gut feeling says a major factor of its success could be that it was the only option for people who need to graphic designing in the early days of the internet .
By the time other players appeared in the market , people did n't want to convert to them .
Lets take my product for an example .
I 'm building a simple web 2.0 app which lets you track your time , and later shows you reports based on how you spend your time .
( See my website for more info about this ) .
Sticking to the principal of keeping things simple , there are going to be just 2 or 3 items in my menu .
" My Day , Reports , and Categories . "
I can add a ton of bloat , such as project management , employee time tracking , calenders , bla bla bla .. but I do n't think any one would ever use them .
And there 's already many products in the market with all these features .
But I want to stick to doing only one thing : tracking / managing your personal time .
So thats just what I 'm going to do and people will appreciate it .
IMO , you can't make your software too simple to use .
That 's just a paradox .
Can anyone give any example of something that failed / is n't that successful because its " too easy to use ? "
Posted by : Ali | Sep 26 , 2006 12:43:42 AM
This very much resonates with our line of thinking when we built TagLoops and the web movies Authoring tool .
We wanted something that would be powerful and versatile and at the same time tried hard to keep it simple in its use ( not simple in the things it can do ) .
So here 's a piece of online software that your mum cannot use : http://www.tagloops.com
In cases like this it is essential to provide documentation and help .
We do this on our wiki pages .
One user commented ( when stuck somewhere ) that " he figured out what to do when he read the documentation ; but who reads documentation on web apps ? "
So I guess there is a whole trend for toy apps on the web , made for casual users that will never value them enough to pay for .
As the notion of web apps mature we should be moving away from that .

Have you ever seen the episode of the Simpsons where Homer finds out he has an older half - brother ?
Herb is the enormously successful owner of a car manufacturing company .
In order to create the ideal car for the average Joe , he gets Homer to design the car of his dreams .
Homer is the target audience , so how could it fail ?
Featuritis .
That 's how .
The final product is a hideous mishmash of every feature imaginable and the price tag ( $ 82 K if I remember rightly ) puts it beyond the reach of even the wealthiest American .
In total contravention of copyright , I keep a picture of that car on my desk to remind me to design learning products ( substitute the name of your own product ) that will do the job , engage the user , appeal to the eye and be affordable .
You can't have everything in one product , and you should n't want to !
See the entry on wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vehicles_in_The_Simpsons#The_Homer

A restricted set of features is just as much of a flow breaker as a poorly constructed user interface .
I guess the thing that I look for in a great product is that whenever I think " I wonder if I can do _this_ " , the answer is always " yes "
There are two points to that - the first ( obviously ) is that the feature set has to be broad enough that it covers all bases .
The second , more subtle , point is that the user should n't need to be aware of the more powerful features until they need them .
They should be there but should n't get in your way .
Posted by : omni | Sep 26 , 2006 3:54:18 AM
I want to focus on your idea of " user modes " .
This I have seen attempted but never really successfully .
A few years back I was leading a project to develop a trading system for portfolio managers .
We realized that there was a tremendous diversity in the tech - savvy gene in the user community .
My lead developer came to an approach to adding " power - user " features ( think depth ) .
Each of these features had to be " enabled " in order for the user to see the menu option / toolbar button .
They were implemented such that they did not change the basic flow ( that the simple case users had learned and mastered ) but allowed the power users ( more adventurous feature seeking - macro writing gear heads ) to totally kick ass !
We built a user preferences capability where features could be turned on , but did not alter the initial delivery state .
We also offered power users " top secret " training sessions ( power users love to feel special ) and only offered these training to users who gave us suggestions for new features ...
We eventually gave the power users the ability to alter the basic flow and configure the UI to a great degree .
Interestingly , we earned a ton of respect from our user community , but not from senior management ( think project sponsors ) .
Oh well , the risks of development for captive audience in the enterprise space .
Very different from shrink - wrap space .
Thanks again Kathy for your excellent and inspirational writing .

The two question mark boxes in the lower - left and upper right can be explained quite succinctly by yet another Alan Kay quote : " Simple things should be simple , complex things should be possible . "
The lower left box is where simple thing are done simply .
The upper right box is where advanced users can use their knowledge of the software to do complex things .
Most applications will need both of those boxes .
Simple things that a newbie would need should be close at hand and intuitive .
More advanced thing can be tucked away in a third nested menu of a right - click , or wrapped in a wizard that prompts for and verifies 17 parameters before it lets you begin .
Deciding on the complexity of a feature before trying to add it is important .
Incomplete requirements can be a ticking time bomb here .
" Print a report " would seem to be a straight - forward task , until you dig deeper with questions like " Who is the report for " and " What will they do with it ? "
Also be careful about including too much functionality in a single feature .
A multi-step process might be multi-step because the steps can be done in a different order to accomplish a different goal .
Watch for features that can be broken down this way , and allow the user to assemble the steps in the order they desire , like Legos .
I call these " open-ended " features , and I have been surprised by my own users combining features in ways I did not foresee .
Kathy 's ball example illustrates this well .

My real - life example .
About 3 years ago I bought a video camera ( new baby and all ) .
I have tried several times to figure out the maze of how to get it off the tape and onto the computer in a format that pleases me .
I assume the tools I am using will do the job well enough , I just do n't understand the jargon or the process .
I have tried google searches but no where can I find a simple explanation of the hows and WHYs of each step .
Frustration sets in .( Unfortunately I use a PC and not a MAC ) .
It seems to me that if someone could just explain the proces in simple terms I could manage the UI .
As a result I have quit using the expensive video camera and just take video clips on my digital camera ...

One of the things we need to consider is that the technology that we create is a reflection of the environment that it was created in .
Yes , your information architecture is culture .
If people are not appreciated and treated in a pedantic manner , is it any surprise that the products they create have the same worldview ( remember Bob ) .
If they are ignored and reshuffled along with the changing of the wind then it will be difficult for them to build things that stand out and are valuable over the long term ( see Windows in general ) .

Knowing your user is so important .
When I got to my current job they were finishing up a release for a specific customer .
The software team spent weeks getting some editing functions for meteorological reports working .
Each field had a box with limit checking .
When I polled the actual weather observers here they wanted to have one field with the full message so they could just edit the message .
This is way simpler for them ; it would be way more difficult for someone who was n't a trained observer .
In trying to make it simpler for them , we had made it more difficult , time consuming and annoying .

MAYA Design has built an entire business on the concept of " taming complexity " rather than eliminating it .
They have a quad chart similar to yours on their website :

Google Calendar uses a simple text input box with an intelligent parser for quick entry of appointments .
I 'm not sure how clever you can get with the input since I usually go to the more advanced screen when I have repeating items , but it shows some of the possibilities and it works well for one - off items ( " Meet Chris at 10 am on Friday " ) .
Posted by : Andrew J | Sep 26 , 2006 4:46:04 PM
I usually love your posts , Kathy , but this one had me grinding my teeth a little .
Not all of us usability specialists are looking to dumb down the world !
Julie has it absolutely right : KNOW YOUR USERS !
Some interfaces do have to be designed to suit the Department of the Bleedingly Obvious .
Others can be more complex depending on the skill levels of the target audience and frequency of use .
If you only use it once a year for a very complex task ( say , online tax returns ) , then it has to be ridiculously simple .
Lots of " nicey - wicey wizards and fuzzy - wuzzy dialog boxes " .
If you use it all day , every day for very complex tasks , then the interface can be , and should be , simpler .
I think you 're using a bit of a broad brush on this one .
As any good consultant knows , the answer is ' It depends ' .
Understand what your users are trying to do and their context of use and you 'll understand how the interface needs to be put together .

Nice post , thanks again :-)
Yes , the majority of users do n't use my / your software , so starting to use it shall be easy .
But a simple - simple apps will never be used IMHO .
Usually , I first want to get done something ( =hard constraints ) and then look for software to help me .
Often enough , I have to try a bunch of programs as most turn out to be " too dumb " , even for a rather simple task , or forcing me to fiddle too much instead of just getting things done .
Both is a no - no , both keeps me ( newbie ) from ever using the software .
Example : Will I use a feed reader that is so " easy to use " that I can not override display options ?
Hell , no , dark grey on black background is not readable , so I NEED to change it !
( but do n't force me to do a whole style sheet )
And if a feed is invalid , tell me ( reading is not too difficult for me ) and for god 's sake display that ONE SINGLE character in a wrong way -- but do n't refuse completely to load the feed at all !
You 're a feed reader , so read it !
A program has to meet a need with all common requirements , elsewise it will never be used , independend of how easy to use it is .
What in turn means , ( @Ali ) you can make your software too simple / limited / dumb to use -- think of the feed readers or MS Windows Paint .
This ( @Jan ) does not eliminate simple tools - I love those " tiny apps " , but they have to be good at the task I need them for ( eg time snapper , unstoppable copier , MS snipping tool ) .
Moreover , I personally like to get hints of what MORE I could do even in " dumb mode " .
Always hiding the advanced features is bad , as I never learn " Woh , I can also do THIS ?
Cool !
Just what I need so often ! " .
But showing all features at once is confusing as it's overwhelming and not prioritized .
I love programs that show me medium doses of new stuff -- related to what I already use -- but without breaking my tasks .
Example : Servant Salamander ( a norton commander clone ) offers a narrow set of icons ( top ) and functions ( bottom ) , so newbies keep relaxed & have overview ( so the downside of 4 . is IMHO not applying ) .
Still , the cool features are shown in the menus ( top ) , in the bottom when modifier keys are pressed ( =only a limited number at once ) , and on right - clicking status infos - related features stand next to each other , so while using what I already know ( eg invert selection ) , I may have a look and discover new stuff ( eg go to next selected name ) but I 'm not forced to interrupt my flow .
This way , I learned a lot of really advanced stuff , so I perform common file managing tasks with Salamander so efficient that people ask me " whoa , that unimposing app is able to do so great ??
What 's it 's name ?
I wanna give it a try ! " .
And as a passionate user I offer them assistence and mail them the URL and " enjoy " :-)
So : Give Salamander a try .
It might save you several hours a week .
And be an inspiration .

I totally agree .
I was just thinking about this the other day .
Some of the interfaces these days make me feel like I 'm working with Duplo instead of Lego Technics .
Posted by : Jens | Sep 29 , 2006 5:02:10 PM
Excellent comments you guys , as always !
I wanted to clear something up that I was a little vague on , and it was comments from Ali and Theresa who made me realize it ...
Theresa , the reason I said " ease - of - use " police and not " usability police " in the picture is precisely because I think that it is true usability pros who appreciate the difference between software that stays out of your way because of good design vs. software that is n't in your way because there 's so little to get in the way OF .
So , when I say , " ease - of - use police " I really do mean people who probably are not usability / UI professionals and have the right attitude ( make it easier for users ) coupled with the wrong implementation ( keep the functionality really simple ) .
The rare and special people who can give us advanced capability while making the software still be easy are the folks who should be paid a TON ; )
So let me make the distinction again between the two different kinds of easy , Ali , because I completely agree that no software failed because it was too easy , but you have to qualify the word " easy " as in " the tool itself was easy to use " .
Any product could indeed fail for being too easy if you define " easy " as " easy because it does n't do much . "
Tic tac toe is a failure ( as a game one plays beyond the age of 7 ) because it IS too easy .
But a chess application should be ridiculously easy .
I should be thinking about my next move , NOT how to tell the software what my next move is .
Thinking about the move should NOT be easy , using the tool to do it SHOULD be .
I hope that helps make my intentions a little more clear .
I really love this discussion and what y'all have added to it ( Karyn , love the Simpson 's example ! ) , and the real - world examples you 've mentioned here .
I 'm sure we 'll continue this in other posts very soon ...
And switching contexts ... if you have n't heard back from me yet on your comment on the " Help with the blog " post , you will .
I 'm still catching up on previous things , but getting close now .
Thanks for being so patient with me .

Now how do we convert the remaining 6.2 billion ?
Posted by : Penguin Pete | Sep 29 , 2006 8:52:47 PM
This actually reminds of something I learned in marketing : Segmentation .
Different sets of users have different needs and a software must make it seem that it can cater to all of those needs by segmenting users to their proficiency .
What I mean is aplications should be easier to introduce , but has enough room for casual users to move up to power users .
Posted by : Regnard Kreisler C. Raquedan | Sep 30 , 2006 1:42:32 AM
Kathy ,
I do n't disagree with any of your theoretical points .
However I 'm just not convinced this theory is in any way relevant to the real world .
I simply do not encounter products that remove or choose not to implement deep functionality in the name of ease of use .
Perhaps if you named more names , it would help ; but I think that products with this flaw are extremely rare .
What I do see are products that run the gamut of the power scale from 1 to 100 , but have uniformly atrocious ease - of - use .
You 're right that ease - of - use is a separate concern from power ; but I 've simply never heard anyone claim that they have to remove power to improve ease - of - use .
I constantly hear programmers claim the reverse : they must remove ease - of - use to provide power .
I am afraid this article will be cited to justify that flawed belief . :-(
Posted by : Elliotte Rusty Harold | Sep 30 , 2006 7:21:17 AM
Great article followed by some cogent points .
There are many layers to this - if " ease of use " be the problem .
Or the design of systems in themselves complex , but need global understanding for " everyone at home " access and useability .
In my world its about the compression of what we call " Pointless Complexity " done by keeping " primary purpose " on the surface .
The problem I find with many designs of many systems - the engineers loose sight of Primary purpose by getting " lost in the fog " of secondary functionality and innovation .
As an example exercise - Imagine had I have been at Microsoft as layout director , when they were setting the design parameters for Windows 98 , and dictated the age group terms to design to ... to be set at between 5 yrs to 105 years old .... and not just the " Geek " years ( 14yrs to 35yrs )
I bet they couldnt do it .
I bet the design team would have crumbled under the weight of that one .
A project example like that would take ergonomic science to a stretch .
I mean - just think of some of the " Ultra - human " characteristics needed in the design parameters .
There is a design system called " Trinity " , if followed with discipline , can make the " ease - of - use " character easier to design even in the most complex of systems .
In any user space there are only EVER three possible actions for the user to consider - Turn left - Turn Right - or step back .
This can divide the most complex systems up into tiny manageable parts , which when converted to a topographical map , shows the creation of " Userspace " rather than " Techy space " .
Problem is with technology -- its generally created by the highly technical .

The comments to this entry are closed .
In the face of vast poverty and exploitation , the Chinese government is about to enact a labor law that would strengthen the role of unions and protections for workers .
But American corporations , eager to maintain their fiefdoms in the middle kingdom , have lobbied fiercely against the proposed legislation .
A group called the American Chamber of Commerce has led the charge against the humanitarian reforms , representing companies that include Dell , Ford , General Electric , Microsoft and Nike .
Here is a computer mouse made of stone by Russian designer Neko .
In June , NASA chief Michael Griffin ordered the space shuttle to launch in early July as planned , overruling the agency 's chief engineer and top safety officer -- both of whom argued that the shuttle was still vulnerable to damage .
A storm of criticism ensued , much of it focused on the charge that Griffin , an experienced aerospace engineer who holds six advanced degrees , was placing timetables ahead of safety .
But I think the protests were rooted in something else : the fact that Griffin made the decision on his own , casting aside the consensus of other expert decision makers .
Imagine if it had been Griffin alone who believed that the shuttle might not be safe enough to fly , and the top safety and engineering people had come to the opposite conclusion .
Would it have been anywhere near as controversial if Griffin had bowed to them and let the launch proceed ?
I doubt it .
Even though it would have been the same decision , it would have come from a team of experts , rather than a high - handed boss .
Is there anyone more loathed in office culture than the autocratic decision maker who ignores the opinion of the group ?
It 's Business 101 : Get lots of input , put your heads together , reach a consensus .
The primacy of groups and teamwork is so ingrained that we seldom stop to think about it anymore .
Now in the age of instant messaging , wikis , social networking sites , and videoconferencing on cell phones , collaboration and consensus are gaining yet more currency .
We can , and often do , get everyone to weigh in , all the time , whether it's by cell phone , e-mail , or instant message .
As James Surowiecki nicely puts it in the title of his best - selling book , it 's " the wisdom of crowds , " and it 's a glorious thing .
Or it would be , if it were n't for just one little problem :
The effectiveness of groups , teamwork , collaboration , and consensus is largely a myth .
In many cases , individuals do much better on their own .
Our bias toward groups is counterproductive .
And the technology of ubiquitous connectedness is making the problem worse .
I 'll understand if you demand to see the study on that one .
But it 's silly to quote a single study on the failure of groups because there are so many -- dozens of them , going back decades -- that there 's no good way to pick one out .
Our bias toward groups is counterproductive .
And technology is making the problem worse .
As far back as 1972 , in his now classic book , Victims of Groupthink , Yale psychology researcher Irving Janis theorizes that groups often breed a false confidence that leads to unsound decisions none of the individuals in the group would have made on their own .
In the 1990s , research by Purdue psychology researcher Kip Williams shed light on " social loafing " -- that is , the tendency of people in groups simply to not try as hard as individuals .
In fact , the notion that individuals outthink and outdecide groups is so well established among experts that they do n't bother to study it anymore .
Instead , the hot question among psychologists and organizational behaviorists is why the rest of us persist in keeping this wrong - headed notion alive .
" We 've been trying to find out what seduces us into thinking teams are so wonderful , " says Natalie Allen , a psychologist at the University of Western Ontario who has studied what she calls " the romance of teams . "
So what about the wisdom of crowds ?
Did Surowiecki really get it wrong ?
Not necessarily .
He simply focused on the sorts of situations in which large groups of people can in fact work pretty well .
A group of investors will usually outperform a single expert ; the bad opinions in the crowd tend to cancel out , so that the average is " wise . "
Google can tap a sea of websites to provide useful answers , and crowds have done a great job creating Linux , because in these cases useful contributions from the crowd can be leveraged while noncontributors stay harmlessly out of the way .
And to his credit , Surowiecki does note that crowds often are not very wise at all .
What he glosses over , however , is the often spectacular way groups fail in the context of organizations .
Consider that paragon of group magic , the brainstorming session .
Bernard Nijstad , a psychologist at the University of Amsterdam , explains that if you take a group of 12 people and have half brainstorm together on a topic while the other six go it alone , all 12 will usually agree that the group experience was more productive -- even though those working alone almost always end up with more good ideas .
Nijstad believes it 's because people in groups spend most of their time listening to others rather than thinking on their own , while lone brainstormers are forced to stew in productive but unpleasant silence .
" When you 're alone , it 's painfully clear when you 're not producing .
In a group you can just sit there and not notice you 're not contributing , " Nijstad says .
No wonder we love to work in groups .
Things only get worse when a team is charged with actually making a decision .
One of the biggest problems is that it 's easy for a few members of a group who think the same way -- but who may be flat - out wrong -- to sway the opinions of others .
Consensus steadily grows until a majority is reached , at which point even people who have confidence in their dissenting , higher - quality opinion are likely to bow to the group .
If you 've ever wondered how Enron 's managers could have convinced themselves they were running a good company , or how a jury could have found O.J. Simpson innocent , now you know .
Of course , you could bring independent thinkers to your groups -- but then you 'll run into the problem of deadlock .
" About half of all groups do n't reach any conclusion at all , " says Nijstad .
New technology only amplifies the problem .
For starters , the tools that connect us to our colleagues make it all the easier to form brainstorming sessions wherever we are , at any time -- essentially turning all decisions into group decisions .
What 's more , these electronic group decisions can be even more brain - dead than in - person meetings .
The biggest problem : the fear of dissenting is magnified in a Web , e-mail , or instant messaging exchange , because participants know their comments can be saved and widely distributed .
Instead of briefly offending six people at a meeting , you have the chance to enrage thousands .
As for the Internet and our newfound ability to tap into the masses , a more subtle form of havoc arises .
Simply put , when you make it easy for everyone to put in his two cents , with little filtering or accountability , the scum tends to rise to the top .
Look at it this way :
How much time have you taken to post movie reviews , rate products , or help a group of strangers with a project ?
Not a lot , I 'll bet .
But malicious adolescents , really grumpy people with a lot of time on their hands , and sleazy marketers just love plastering the Internet with their rants , gripes , and plugs .
For all the excitement generated by social networking sites like Facebook , how many people are actually making valuable contacts on these sites , compared with the amount of time wasted browsing through the sea of goofy material out there ?
( If you 're the parent of a teenager and you have n't seen your kid's Facebook listing yet , let me suggest you 're better off leaving things that way . )
And if you use Wikipedia , you might want to double - check the facts .
According to a recent article in The Guardian , every three seconds a Wikipedia page is rendered inaccurate -- or more inaccurate than it was to begin with -- by a hoaxer , ignoramus , or malcontent .
Does forming groups and tapping the masses ever make any sense ?
Of course , but only in certain well - defined circumstances , say the experts .
In some cases , it 's more important to achieve buy - in to a decision than it is to get the best possible decision .
Or when you need to get as many ideas on the table as possible without regard for how many of them are terrible .
In such cases , electronic collaborative and input - gathering tools can be put to good use .

The Enigma machine vexed Allied codebreakers for years
The codes resisted the best efforts of the celebrated Allied cryptographers based at Bletchley Park during the war .
Now one has been solved by running code - breaking software on a " grid " of internet - linked home computers .
The complex ciphers were encoded in 1942 by a new version of the German Enigma machine , and led to regular hits on Allied vessels by German U - boats .
Allied experts initially failed to deal with the German adoption in 1942 of a complex new cipher system , brought in at the same time as a newly upgraded Enigma machine .
The advancement in German encryption techniques led to significant Allied losses in the North Atlantic throughout 1942 .
Forced to submerge during attack .
Depth charges .
I am following the enemy
Kapt Hartwig Looks
25 November 1942
Although assumed to have little historical significance , they are thought to be among just a handful of German naval ciphers in existence still to be decoded .
Exponential growth
The latest attempt to crack the codes was kick - started by Stefan Krah , a German - born violinist with an interest in cryptography and open - source software .
Mr Krah told the BBC News website that " basic human curiosity " had motivated him to crack the codes , but stressed the debt he owed to veteran codebreaking enthusiasts who have spent years researching Enigma .
UNSOLVED CIPHER #1 HCEY ZTCS OPUP PZDI UQRD LWXX FACT TJMB HDVC JJMM ZRPY IKHZ AWGL YXWT MJPQ UEFS ZBCT VRLA LZXW VXTS LFFF AUDQ FBWR RYAP SBOW JMKL DUYU PFUQ DOWV HAHC DWAU ARSW TXCF VOYF PUFH VZFD GGPO OVGR MBPX XZCA NKMO NFHX PCKH JZBU MXJW XKAU OD?Z UCVC XPFT
Mr Krah named the project M4 , in honour of the M4 Enigma machine that originally encoded the ciphers .
There are now some 2,500 separate terminals contributing to the project , Mr Krah said .
" The most amazing thing about the project is the exponential growth of participants .
All I did myself was to announce it in two news groups and on one mailing list . "
Nevertheless , in little over a month an apparently random combination of letters had been decoded into a real wartime communication .
In its encrypted form the cipher makes no sense at all , reading as follows :
Bletchley Park was thought to cut WWII by two years
Unencrypted and translated into English , the message suddenly comes to life :
" Forced to submerge during attack .
Depth charges .
Last enemy position 0830h AJ 9863 , [ course ] 220 degrees , [ speed ] 8 knots .
[ I am ] following [ the enemy ] .
[ barometer ] falls 14 mb , [ wind ] nor - nor - east , [ force ] 4 , visibility 10 [ nautical miles ] . "
A check against existing records confirmed that the message was sent by Kapitanleutnant Hartwig Looks , commander of the German navy 's U264 submarine , on 25 November 1942 .
Sophisticated
During the war , teams of codebreakers based at Bletchley Park , in the UK , scrambled to unravel German communications in an attempt both to undermine the German war machine and to save the lives of soldiers and seamen .
Frantic codebreaking work was carried out in plain - looking huts
German messages were encoded using the fearsome Enigma machine , which used a series of rotors , often augmented by a so - called " plugboard " , to scramble transmissions not meant for Allied eyes .
The machines used ever - changing rotor wheel combinations and electrical currents to produce unique coded messages .
Plugboards further complicated matters by swapping pairs of letters over during the encoding process , greatly increasing the numbers of possible encryptions .
UNSOLVED CIPHER #2 TMKF NWZX FFII YXUT IHWM DHXI FZEQ VKDV MQSW BQND YOZF TIWM JHXH YRPA CZUG RREM VPAN WXGT KTHN RLVH KZPG MNMV SECV CKHO INPL HHPV PXKM BHOK CCPD PEVX VVHO ZZQB IYIE OUSE ZNHJ KWHY DAGT XDJD JKJP KCSD SUZT QCXJ DVLP AMGQ KKSH PHVK SVPC BUWZ FIZP FUUP
Stefan Krah 's computerised codebreaking software uses a combination of " brute force " and algorithmic attempts to get at the truth .
The combined approach increases the chances of stumbling across a match by recreating possible combinations of plugboard swaps while methodically working through combinations of rotor settings .
Proud milestone
Bletchley Park and its codebreakers have been immortalised on television , in film and in best - selling novels .
Now a museum , staff at the site are not attempting to close the book on World War II by solving any remaining ciphers .
That they leave to the enthusiasts .
But a spokeswoman said that Bletchley Park followed the M4 project with interest , describing Mr Krah 's work as a " great tribute " to the achievements of the wartime codebreakers .
Ralph Erskine , who submitted the original intercepts to the journal Cryptologia in December 1995 , told the BBC News website that cracking the German codes after more than 63 years would be an important milestone for amateur cryptologists .
" I think there is more satisfaction for people engaged in the project to know that they have been able to do something that Bletchley Park could n't do , " he said .
Seymour Papert , a computer scientist and educator who is an adviser to the project , has argued that if young people are given computers and allowed to explore , they will “ learn how to learn . ”
That , Mr. Papert argues , is a more valuable skill than traditional teaching strategies that focus on memorization and testing .
The idea is also that children can take on much of the responsibility for maintaining the systems , rather than relying on or creating bureaucracies to do so .
“ We believe you have to leverage the kids themselves , ” Ms. Jepsen said .
“ They ’re learning machines . ”
As an example , she pointed to the backlight used by the laptop .
Although it is designed to last five years , if it fails it can be replaced as simply as batteries are replaced in a flashlight .
It is something a child can do , she said .
That philosophy , at the heart of the project ’s world view , has stirred criticism for its focus on getting equipment to students rather than issues like teacher training and curriculum .
“ I think it ’s wonderful that the machines can be put in the hands of children and parents , and it will have an impact on their lives if they have access to electricity , ” Larry Cuban , a Stanford University education professor , said in an interview .
“ However , if part of their rationale is that it will revolutionize education in various countries , I do n’t think it will happen , and they are naïve and innocent about the reality of formal schooling . ”
The debate is certain to enter a new phase when the machines go into full - scale production by Taiwan - based Quanta Computer , the world ’s second - largest laptop maker .
( The manufacturer , unlike the project itself , will make a profit . )
Overnight , even though it will not be available to consumers , the laptop could become the best - selling portable computer in the world .
I ’ve had it with Java , too much technology to learn with Unit testing , ORM , IoC , AOP , and SOA , not to mention static typing and waiting to compile .
That ’s why as of right now I ’m a converted .
BAT programmer and here ’s why :
1. .BAT is already installed on 90 + % of the computers in the world
2. .BAT supports dynamic typing ( set FOO=x , set FOO=1 )
3. .BAT is interpreted , no build ( and waiting ) necessary to run my code
4. .BAT is modular and extendable ( FOO.BAT can call BAR .
BAT )
5. .BAT supports a variable number of arguments to other .BAT modules ( BAR.
BAT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 )
6. .BAT has more IDE ’s than any other language ( although my favorite is Notepad )
7 . The OS has built in refactoring support allowing me to move and rename my .BAT modules without starting up my favoriate IDE ( Notepad )
8. .BAT is cross-platform ( DOS , Windows 3.1 , Windows 95 , Windows 98 , ME , 2000 , XP , 2003 )
9. .BAT supports running from a GUI by double clicking on it or using it from the command line
10 . .BAT makes accessing environment variables easy so I can move most configuration out of my .BAT module
11 . .BAT has built in debugging and logging with PAUSE and ECHO
Things I ’m hoping to see in the next release of .
BAT ( shipping with Longhorn )
1. Improved ODBC driver support in .BAT
2. Improved regular expression support ( although their * and ?
filesystem regex support is already the best in the business )
I only wish I ’d seen the light sooner before I wasted the better part of a decade on Java !
Die US - Blogosphäre kannte in den vergangenen Wochen fast nur ein Thema : Den Aufkauf der Vier - Mann - Firma Upstartle durch den Suchmaschinengiganten Google .
Upstartle produziert Writely , eine trendige Web - basierte Textverarbeitung – und genau das könnte als erstes Zeichen gedeutet werden , dass Google einen Online - Konkurrenten für Microsofts Büropaket Office plant .
Writely wurde erst im November 2005 gestartet und hat seither gut 150.000 User einsammeln können .
Umsätze macht Upstartle mit diesen noch nicht - das Angebot ist kostenlos .
Die Nutzerzahl dürfte Google also kaum interessiert haben – die Suchmaschine denkt in ganz anderen Dimensionen .
Industriebeobachter meinen nun aber , dass Writely Google dabei helfen könnte , mit Hilfe moderner " Web 2.0 " - Technologien Microsoft vom Thron zu stürzen .
Derlei Technologien , vor allem die Browser - Technik Ajax ( " asynchrones JavaScript + XML " ) , machen es möglich , Web - Anwendungen zu schreiben , die mit einer ähnlichen Geschwindigkeit wie Desktop - Programme ablaufen und sich vor allem ähnlich anfühlen .
Doch wie realistisch ist die Idee , Google werde Microsofts Bürosuite angreifen , überhaupt ?
Writely an sich kann nicht als ernsthafter Wettbewerber für Office gelten , schließlich hat das traditionsreiche Microsoft - Büropaket jetzt schon zahlreiche Konkurrenten und kontrolliert dennoch 95 Prozent des Marktes .
Ein Ersatz - Word ist Writely ebenso wenig – das Programm ist mehr als Werkzeug zur Online - Zusammenarbeit gedacht , denn als vollständige Schreib - Suite .
Es erinnert daher eher an Microsofts kostenlosen Dienst " SharePoint " .
Die Macher hinter Writely haben selbst immer betont , dass ihr Produkt kein Konkurrent für Word sei , sondern es ergänzen solle .
Writely wurde sogar mit Microsofts eigener " . NET " - Umgebung entwickelt , mit der sich verschiedene Anwendungen über Plattformen hinweg integrieren lassen .
Zudem hat Google bislang nie ein Sterbenswörtchen dazu verlauten lassen , man werde sich mit einer Kollektion an Online - Werkzeugen mit Office messen .
Mary Jo Foley , Herausgeberin des unabhängigen Newsletters " Microsoft Watch " , glaubt ebenfalls nicht an ein Google Office .
Das Problem sei , dass die Nutzer gar nicht wollten , dass ihre Büroprogramme vollständig online abliefen .
Microsoft selbst habe bereits Online - Versionen von Office getestet – mit wenig erfreulichen Resultaten .
Google selbst verweist bei allen Anfragen zum Thema allein auf einen Eintrag von Upstartle - Teammitglied Jen Mazzon im offiziellen Google Weblog .
Darin schreibt der Entwickler , dass sein Unternehmen froh darüber sei , nun Teil der Suchmaschine zu sein : " Alle haben uns erzählt , dass wir verrückt seien , den Usern von überall her Zugriff auf ihre Dokumente zu geben – von der direkten Weitergabe von Dokumenten oder dem gemeinsamen Editieren von Texten im Browser ganz zu schweigen .
Aber genau das haben wir gemacht . "
Ganz fertig ist das Writely - Team damit allerdings noch nicht – die Software ist immer noch in einer Beta - Phase und kann derzeit gar nicht verwendet werden , weil sie erst auf die Google - Server - Infrastruktur umzieht .
Der Writely - Aufkauf dürfte also kurzfristig eher geringe Reaktionen seitens Microsoft hervorrufen .
" Ich denke , dass Google Writely erst als einfache Textverarbeitung anbieten wird , später dann vielleicht als HTML - Editor innerhalb seines Blogger - Dienstes " , meint T.J. Kang , Chef der Softwarefirma ThinkFree , die ebenfalls eine Bürosuite anbietet , die sich sowohl auf dem Desktop als auch online nutzen lässt .
Kang glaubt allerdings auch , dass sich Google alle Optionen offen hält .
Schließlich hat das Unternehmen beispielsweise mit Gmail bereits einen Online - E- Mail - Client , der Microsofts Outlook Konkurrenz machen könnte ; zudem gibt es seit langem Gerüchte über eine Terminkalender - Anwendung und eine Online - Festplatte namens Gdrive .
Auch Foley von " Microsoft Watch " glaubt , dass eine werbefinanzierte Office - Alternative mit freier Wahl des Speicherorts durchaus den ein oder anderen Nutzer dazu bewegen könnte , über die hohen Ausgaben für das Microsoft - Paket nachzudenken , die aktuell zwischen 150 und 500 Dollar liegen .
" Microsoft hat hier eine Flanke offen " , sekundiert Industriebeobachter Rob Enderle .
Der Chefanalyst der Enderle Group aus San Jose glaubt , dass der Web 2.0 - Trend Microsofts traditionelle Retail - und Direktverkaufs - Modelle angreifen könnte .
Microsoft kenne dieses Problem allerdings bereits , weshalb das Unternehmen in letzter Zeit seine neuen " Live " - Anwendungen ( Windows Live , Office Live ... ) betont .
Allerdings ergänzen diese Web - Service - Angebote derzeit Windows und Office nur , ersetzt werden sie nicht .
Enderle glaubt , dass weitere Google - Aufkäufe im Stile von Writely Microsoft dazu zwingen könnten , sein Office - Verkaufsmodell zu überdenken : " Die Frage ist , ob Google es vorher schafft , den Schritt zu gehen , den Office selbst gehen müsste . "
Nutzer von Writely , ThinkFree und anderen ähnlichen Online - Anwendungen werde schnell klar , dass sie den riesigen Funktionsumfang in Office gar nicht bräuchten , meint ThinkFree - Mann Kang : " Im SOHO - Bereich sind die Tage von Microsoft Office gezählt .
Google könnte diesen Prozess beschleunigen . "
Kang freut sich derweil über zunehmendes Interesse an seiner Firma seit dem Writely - Aufkauf durch Google : " Ich habe in dieser Woche allein zwei Termine in den USA und in der nächsten Woche in Asien .
Wir sprechen mit großen Portalen und Providern , die sich auf dem Gebiet betätigen wollen . "
Analyst Enderle gibt indes zu bedenken , dass es Firmen , die Microsofts Kerngeschäft attackierten , bislang nie besonders gut erging .
Sowohl Novell ( Desktop - Anwendungen ) als auch Netscape ( Web - Dienste ) hätten versucht , Microsoft anzugreifen , beide hätten sich letztlich ablenken lassen .
Auch Google steht unter diesem Verdacht – so kaufte das Unternehmen in der vergangenen Woche den 3D - Spezialisten @ Last Software ( " SketchUp " ) , dessen Produkte nicht so recht zur Suchmaschine passten .
" Es wirkt ein bisschen so , als sei Google ruderlos " , meint Enderle .

Reasons For Changes
MaxMind has always been committed to an individual ’s right to privacy on the internet .
We welcome the burgeoning privacy regulations , such as GDPR and CCPA , for the benefit they can provide to internet citizens .
However , these new legislative measures place restrictions that impact our ability to continue distributing our GeoLite2 databases on a public page under the Creative Commons Attribution - ShareAlike 4.0 International License .
We recognize the impact of these changes on the open source community and we do not take these decisions lightly .
We want to communicate these changes with transparency and ensure we are balancing your business needs with the privacy needs of individuals .
The California Consumer Privacy Act ( CCPA ) mandates that businesses honor valid “ Do Not Sell ” requests from California residents .
In this context , complying with a valid request involves MaxMind removing IP addresses from the GeoLite2 data and communicating to GeoLite2 users that the IP addresses in question should ( immediately ) not be utilized for uses covered under the CCPA .
Serving GeoLite2 database downloads on a public page simply does not allow us to communicate and honor valid “ Do Not Sell ” requests we receive from individuals .
The solution we have chosen is to introduce a new end - user license agreement containing the relevant data processing provisions that both we , as the business providing data , and you , as the third party user of the data , need to comply with applicable data privacy regulations .
Additionally , by requiring a MaxMind account and contact information from you , we will be able to communicate all valid “ Do Not Sell ” requests to you as we receive them .
With this approach , we can continue to offer GeoLite2 databases , without charge , while remaining responsible stewards of data that improves the experience of countless users across the internet .

It began when Dr Rashad Khalil , an expert on Islamic law from al - Azhar university in Cairo warned that being completely naked during intercourse invalidates a marriage .
His ruling was promptly dismissed by other scholars , including one who argued that " anything that can bring spouses closer to each other " should be permitted .
Another religious scholar suggested it was OK for married couples to see each other naked as long as they do n't look at the genitals .
To avoid problems in that area , he recommended having sex under a blanket .
It 's not entirely clear whether Dr Khalil has considered the full implications of his edict .
Does n't the prospect of all those virile baton - wielding Egyptian riot policemen ( for example ) doing it in their boots and black uniforms sound just a little bit kinky ?
But we 'll let that pass .
Unlike Christianity , which tends to be squeamish about sex , Islam has a long tradition of talking about it openly .
Up to a point , this is much more healthy .
While Catholic priests are enjoined to remain celibate , Muslim clerics are expected to marry and indulge heartily with their wives in the pleasures of the flesh .
In many parts of the Muslim world , especially where folk are poor and uneducated , the local imam is the person many turn to for guidance on matters relating to sex and marriage .
Over the last few years , hundreds of Islamic " fatwa " websites have also sprung up on which clerics - often with uncertain qualifications - answer all manner of questions that have been sent to them by email , including questions about sex .
Some of their answers about what " good Muslims " should or should n't do in bed are very explicit , so readers under 18 should stop here .
While some of the advice is sensible , a lot of it is completely daft , so remaining readers over the age of 18 may wish to get a second opinion before putting it into practice .
Actually , it had never occurred to me that Muslims might be required to keep their clothes on during their most intimate moments until a few months ago when I was browsing through IslamOnline , the website supervised by the prominent ( and controversial ) Qatar - based cleric , Yusuf al - Qaradawi .
Delivering a fatwa on oral sex , 79 - year - old Dr Qaradawi describes it as a disgusting western practice , resulting from westerners ' habit of " stripping naked during sexual intercourse " .
But he continues : " Muslim jurists are of the opinion that it is lawful for the husband to perform cunnilingus on his wife , or a wife to perform the similar act for her husband ( fellatio ) and there is no wrong in doing so .
But if sucking leads to releasing semen , then it is makruh ( blameworthy ) , but there is no decisive evidence ( to forbid it ) ... especially if the wife agrees with it or achieves orgasm by practising it . "
On this issue , Dr Qaradawi 's views are more permissive than those of several other clerics on the internet .
One states that oral sex is definitely forbidden , adding that " this hideous practice will draw the anger of Allah " .
Another , asked if oral sex is permitted , replies : " I do n't know what is oral sex , please define it . "
Masturbation is generally frowned upon by Islamic scholars , though they disagree about how sinful it is .
The Inter - Islam website describes it as an indecent practice that has " crept into the youngsters of today " .
Masturbation has become prevalent , the website says , because of the modern tendency for young people to marry later ( contrary to the advice of the Prophet ) .
As a result , they feel a need " to fulfil their carnal desires but ... can not do so in the normal way , ie sexual intercourse " .
Islamic Voice describes masturbation as an " abominable and wicked act " which is forbidden in Islam .
" Its harms are great and it has disastrous consequences as established by doctors . "
The " proven " medical effects of masturbation - which , of course , include damage to the eyesight - were once listed by Abd al - Aziz bin Baz , the late Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia , and his list is reproduced on numerous Islamic websites .
According to bin Baz , masturbation causes disruption of the digestive system , inflammation of the testicles , damage to the spine ( " the place from which sperm originates " ) , and " trembling and instability in some parts of the body like the feet " .
In addition , there is a weakening of the " cerebral glands " leading to decreased intellect and even " mental disorders and insanity " .
Furthermore , " due to constant ejaculation , the sperm no more remains thick and dense as it normally occurs in males " .
This results in sperm which is not " mighty enough " to make a woman pregnant or produces children who are " more prone to disease and illness " .
Other scholars argue that masturbation is basically forbidden but may be permitted if the person is unmarried or masturbates in order to avoid a more serious sin such as adultery , or if the masturbation is to release " sexual tension " rather than to fulfil " sexual desire " .
In a fatwa for IslamOnline , Sheikh Mustafa al - Zarqa says : " I conclude that the general principles of sharia [ Islamic law ] go against this habit , because it is not the normal way of fulfilling sexual desire ... it is a deviation - and that is enough to condemn it , even though this act does not fall under the category of absolute prohibition . "
There is generally more consensus among scholars on the question of kissing .
Males and females should not kiss unless they are related by blood or marriage .
Same - sex kissing , on the other hand , is allowed as long as it is done without " lust " and avoids the person 's mouth .
Hands and cheeks are the preferred places to kiss .
The forehead is also good because the Prophet reportedly once gave a man a smacker between the eyes .
In this context , the ethics of kiss - of - life resuscitation are considered by IslamOnline .
The website quotes Dr Ahmad Muhammad Kan'an , head of the infectious diseases department at the Primary Medical Care Administration in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia : " The kiss of life is legally permissible because it is a means of resuscitation , if Allah wills .
Yet , it goes without saying that it is impermissible unless necessary .
So , if it is certain that the victim has already died , mouth - to - mouth resuscitation becomes impermissible , for there is no necessity in such a case . "
While administering the kiss of life , IslamOnline adds , rescuers should be careful to do it with " neither lust nor pleasure " .
There is much disagreement on Islamic websites about anal sex between men and women .
Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , the highest - ranking Shia cleric in Iraq , says it is " strongly undesirable " , but permissible if the wife agrees .
This seems to be quite a common view , though many Sunni clerics maintain that consent is irrelevant .
" Anal sex is a grave sin and is completely forbidden , regardless of whether the wife agrees to it or not , " one says .
The most common religious objection to anal sex is that it frustrates the main purpose of marriage - to produce children - and the same objection is applied to masturbation .
" Islam strictly forbids the waste of seminal fluid , " one website says .
It is precisely to avoid having too many children that some Muslims practice anal sex .
One man , writing to the Islamic Q&A website , says that his wife does n't have any problem with it .
" I think this is the best way of family planning instead of using condoms , " the man writes , though he adds that many of his friends have told him otherwise .
" People are confusing me so please tell me what to do . "
Mufti Ebrahim Desai replies :
" The futile excuse of it being better than a contraceptive does n't carry any weight .
If you are justified in using a contraceptive , then there are many different options on the market which could be adopted , instead of this hideous practice . "
Although Muslim scholars regard pregnancy as the primary goal of sex and marriage , they are generally more pragmatic than the Roman Catholic church about family planning .
Contraception is allowed , though the rules can be rather complicated .
Shia clerics often seem to be more flexible in sexual matters than Sunnis .
For example , " temporary marriage " is a Shia tradition which in effect legalises prostitution .
Sunni clerics , especially those influenced by Saudi Wahhabism , like to assert their authority by forbidding anything that might be remotely pleasurable .
Much of the discussion is sadly reminiscent of the old Christian debate about the number of angels that can dance on a pinhead , but sex is only one part of the problem .
The current fashion for online fatwas has created an amazingly legalistic approach to Islam as scholars - some of whom have only a tenuous grip on reality - seek to regulate all aspects of life according to their own interpretation of the scriptures .
It is much harder to find any discussion on Muslim websites of matters that some would say form the basic substance of religion , such as the nature of love and spiritual experiences .
Do n't get me wrong .
I like oxygen .
I breathe in my share every day .
Nevertheless I remain skeptical of new products designed to put more oxygen into my body .
Marketers of oxygenated bottled water and oxygen bars are breathing down my neck .
Actor and noted hemp enthusiast Woody Harrelson opened an oxygen bar in Hollywood a few years ago , where you pay a premium to breathe in the good stuff .
I know what you 're thinking : " Woody Harrelson !
I loved him as a bald - headed mass - murderer in ' Natural Born Killers . '
Surely he knows a thing or two about my respiratory system . "
Well , believe it or not , Woody might be a little off this time .
Ludicrous idea
The notion that we need extra oxygen is ludicrous .
The human body has adapted quite well to this lower atmosphere of ours that is roughly 21 percent oxygen , 78 percent nitrogen and 1 percent trace gases .
Blood cells , on exiting the lungs , are nearly saturated with about 97 percent oxygen bound molecularly to hemoglobin .
Getting more oxygen serves no purpose .
In fact , it 's a bad thing .
Deep in the lungs , tiny and fragile sacs called alveoli are the site where inhaled oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide leaves to be exhaled .
With a surplus of oxygen in the lungs , the carbon dioxide can't leave the body .
Worse , the build up of oxygen in the lungs can collapse the alveoli and cause permanent lung damage .
Adults with emphysema , chronic asthma or chronic bronchitis , in particular , will stop breathing if they inhale pure oxygen for too long .
Premature babies , given extra oxygen because their lungs are n't sufficiently mature to transfer oxygen into the blood , can go blind if the concentration gets too high , a malady called retinopathy of prematurity ; that 's likely what happened to Stevie Wonder .
Also , oxygen may be what ultimately kills you , rusting your body from the inside in a process called oxidation and free - radical production .
Breathing pure oxygen creates an abundance of free radicals .
Unfortunately the world of alternative medicine has painted a scenario in which the human body is oxygen - deprived .
More oxygen will remove toxins and even cure cancer , many in this community argue .
This is a persuasive argument in this age of industrial pollution , but this goes against basic biology .
Oxygen does n't cure ; and we are n't lacking any .
Mall science
Oxygen bars are now popping up in shopping malls .
For the past five years they have been common in trendy clubs in big cities that attract young people hoping to throw away money as quickly as possible .
For a few dollars per minute , you can breathe in pure oxygen through a mask or tubes , for that oh - so - sexy emphysema - sufferer look .
Sometimes the oxygen is flavored .
O 2 enthusiasts report clearer thoughts , more energy and other subjective stuff that you can't measure .
Then they get drunk .
Oxygenated water , available in bottled water aisles everywhere , is cheaper but equally as dumb .
Aside from the O part in H 2 O , ordinary water has about 0.5 percent dissolved oxygen gas .
This is what fish filter through their gills .
Oxygenated water can carry as much as 5 percent oxygen .
Now , if we assume that humans absorb oxygen efficiently through their gut , which they do n't , and if the dissolved oxygen in the oxygenated water does n't bubble into the air when you open the bottle and expose it to standard pressure , which it does , how much O 2 are you getting ?
The math is straightforward .
Most oxygenated drinks contain no more than 125 mg / liter ; air contains about 250 mg / liter .
( Although air is about 20 percent oxygen and the oxygenated water is 5 percent dissolved oxygen , the density is different , so this is n't quite 4:1. )
Each minute we inhale about 12 times and breathe in about 4 liters of air .
So you need to drink two liters of oxygenated water ( at 125 mg /l ) just to keep up with three good breaths ( about a liter of air ) .
At a dollar a bottle , you might want to reconsider drinking your oxygen .
After all , the air is free ... well , except at Woody 's place .

Aufgrund seiner Einfachheit und Flexibilität hat der kostenlose Voice - over - IP - Dienst Skype recht weite Verbreitung gefunden – nicht zuletzt , weil Skype - Clients auch ohne Umkonfiguration der Firewall von außen erreichbar sind .
Sicherheitsspezialisten stellen sich ob solcher Fähigkeiten allerdings die Nackenhaare auf .
Da der Hersteller das proprietäre Skype - Protokoll und die genaue Funktionsweise des Clients nicht offengelegt hat , bleibt die Frage , was Skype sonst noch so alles kann und welche Risiken der Einsatz etwa im Unternehmensfeld birgt .
Insbesondere wird gerne darüber spekuliert , ob Skype irgendeine Backdoor enthält .
Seit längerem gibt es Versuche , die Arbeitsweise von Skype zu analysieren und zu dokumentieren .
Erste Ergebnisse ( PDF - Datei ) lieferte bereits 2004 die Universität Columbia , die aber hauptsächlich den Netzwerkverkehr untersuchte .
Philippe Biondi und Fabrice Desclaux von EADS haben kürzlich auf der Black - Hat - Konferenz nachgelegt und die genauere Arbeitsweise des Clients veröffentlicht .
Sie fanden heraus , dass der Hersteller immensen Aufwand betreibt , um das Reverse Engineering seiner Software zu verhindern .
So erkennt der Client beispielsweise , ob er in einem Debugger ( etwa SoftIce ) läuft und ändert sein Laufzeitverhalten , indem er andere Register und Speicherbereiche nutzt .
Teile des Codes sind sogar verschlüsselt und werden erst zur Laufzeit ausgepackt .
Die Präsentation " Silver Needle in the Skype " der beiden EADS - Wissenschaftler zeigt aber , wie man Skype austricksen kann , um es trotzdem zu analysieren .
Darüber hinaus ist es den beiden Forschern gelungen , die Art der Datenverschlüsselung , die Berechung des Schlüssels sowie die Authentifizierung von Skype herauszufinden .
Ein Teil ihres Vortrags zeigt sogar die prinzipielle Möglichkeit auf , manipulierte Supernodes ins Netz zu bringen , um VoIP - Verkehr umzuleiten und zu belauschen .
Eine abschließende Bewertung geben Biondi und Desclaux nicht ab .
Bedenklich sei aber , dass man Skype nicht gut vor Attacken schützen könne , da der Verkehr verschlüsselt ist .
Zudem würde jedem Skype - Gesprächspartner eine Vertrauensstellung zugebilligt , die so nicht immer sinnvoll sei .
Immerhin loben sie das clevere Design und die gute Implementierung der kryptographischen Funktionen .
Ob Skype eine Backdoor enthält , konnten sie allerdings auch nicht beantworten .

God on the Brain - programme summary
Rudi Affolter and Gwen Tighe have both experienced strong religious visions .
He is an atheist ; she a Christian .
He thought he had died ; she thought she had given birth to Jesus .
Both have temporal lobe epilepsy .
Like other forms of epilepsy , the condition causes fitting but it is also associated with religious hallucinations .
Research into why people like Rudi and Gwen saw what they did has opened up a whole field of brain science : neurotheology .
The connection between the temporal lobes of the brain and religious feeling has led one Canadian scientist to try stimulating them .
( They are near your ears . ) 80 % of Dr Michael Persinger 's experimental subjects report that an artificial magnetic field focused on those brain areas gives them a feeling of ' not being alone ' .
Some of them describe it as a religious sensation .
" ... a high probability [ Ellen White ] had temporal lobe epilepsy "
His work raises the prospect that we are programmed to believe in god , that faith is a mental ability humans have developed or been given .
And temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE ) could help unlock the mystery .
Religious leaders
History is full of charismatic religious figures .
Could any of them have been epileptics ?
The visions seen by Bible characters like Moses or Saint Paul are consistent with Rudi's and Gwen's , but there is no way to diagnose TLE in people who lived so long ago .
There are , though , more recent examples , like one of the founders of the Seventh Day Adventist Movement , Ellen White .
Born in 1827 , she suffered a brain injury aged 9 that totally changed her personality .
She also began to have powerful religious visions .
Representatives of the Movement doubt that Ellen White suffered from TLE , saying her injury and visions are inconsistent with the condition , but neurologist Gregory Holmes believes this explains her condition .
" These patients are more prone to religious belief "
Better than sex
The first clinical evidence to link the temporal lobes with religious sensations came from monitoring how TLE patients responded to sets of words .
In an experiment where people were shown either neutral words ( table ) , erotic words ( sex ) or religious words ( god ) , the control group was most excited by the sexually loaded words .
This was picked up as a sweat response on the skin .
People with temporal lobe epilepsy did not share this apparent sense of priorities .
For them , religious words generated the greatest reaction .
Sexual words were less exciting than neutral ones .
Make believe
If the abnormal brain activity of TLE patients alters their response to religious concepts , could altering brain patterns artificially do the same for people with no such medical condition ?
This is the question that Michael Persinger set out to explore , using a wired - up helmet designed to concentrate magnetic fields on the temporal lobes of the wearer .
" Feeling something beyond yourself , bigger in space and time , can be stimulated "
His subjects were not told the precise purpose of the test ; just that the experiment looked into relaxation .
80 % of participants reported feeling something when the magnetic fields were applied .
Persinger calls one of the common sensations a ' sensed presence ' , as if someone else is in the room with you , when there is none .
Horizon introduced Dr Persinger to one of Britain 's most renowned atheists , Prof Richard Dawkins .
He agreed to try his techniques on Dawkins to see if he could give him a moment of religious feeling .
During a session that lasted 40 minutes , Dawkins found that the magnetic fields around his temporal lobes affected his breathing and his limbs .
He did not find god .
" A talent for religion ... some people have and other people do n't "
Persinger was not disheartened by Dawkins ' immunity to the helmet 's magnetic powers .
He believes that the sensitivity of our temporal lobes to magnetism varies from person to person .
People with TLE may be especially sensitive to magnetic fields ; Prof Dawkins is well below average , it seems .
It 's a concept that clerics like Bishop Stephen Sykes give some credence as well : could there be such a thing as a talent for religion ?
Brain imaging
Sykes does , though , see a great difference between a ' sensed presence ' and a genuine religious experience .
Scientists like Andrew Newberg want to see just what does happen during moments of faith .
He worked with Buddhist , Michael Baime , to study the brain during meditation .
By injecting radioactive tracers into Michael 's bloodstream as he reached the height of a meditative trance , Newberg could use a brain scanner to image the brain at a religious climax .
" People meditating describe a loss of sense of self "
The bloodflow patterns showed that the temporal lobes were certainly involved but also that the brain 's parietal lobes appeared almost completely to shut down .
The parietal lobes give us our sense of time and place .
Without them , we may lose our sense of self .
Adherants to many of the world 's faiths regard a sense of personal insignificance and oneness with a deity as something to strive for .
Newberg 's work suggests a neurological basis for what religion tries to generate .
Religious evolution
If brain function offers insight into how we experience religion , does it say anything about why we do ?
There is evidence that people with religious faith have longer , healthier lives .
This hints at a survival benefit for religious people .
Could we have evolved religious belief ?
Prof Dawkins ( who subscribes to evolution to explain human development ) thinks there could be an evolutionary advantage , not to believing in god , but to having a brain with the capacity to believe in god .
That such faith exists is a by - product of enhanced intelligence .
Prof Ramachandran denies that finding out how the brain reacts to religion negates the value of belief .
He feels that brain circuitry like that Persinger and Newberg have identified , could amount to an antenna to make us receptive to god .
Bishop
Sykes meanwhile , thinks religion has nothing to fear from this neuroscience .
Science is about seeking to explain the world around us .
For him at least , it can co-exist with faith .
Eddie 's Lounge room sonar project .
This project is dorment while I play with other stuff .
This page will be a bit basic for some but hopefully most people wanting to play with sonar will get something from it .
Almost every PC has a sound card and many also have a microphone but I 've never heard of anyone using them to build a sonar system .
Most people associate sonar with ultra- sound – even though the " Red October " ping was clearly audible .
Echo-localing bats mostly use ultra - sound as does most marine sonar and sonar range finders .
There are also sonars which use lower frequencies .
Lower frequencies are useful for penetrating deeper and are largely used for " looking " thru the ocean floor for tens of meter or more .
The PC program I am writing uses a sweep frequency chirp and some very basic signal processing to detect echos off complex targets .
I think the performance I 've achieved from a $ 30 ( second hand ) sound card and a $ 13 mic is amazing .
This photo shows my test setup .
The multi-media speaker is clearly visible to the right of the mouse .
Less obvious is the mic which is near the front of the box and in some yellow - tack .
The white broom stick laying on top of the monitor is one of my test targets .
The Chirp .
Simple sonars use a single frequency pulse but we can better than that .
The optimal chirp will depend on the application but for the " in house " stuff I 've been playing with - this has been my favorite – it sweeps from 5 to 20 kHz and is about 4.5 Milli - seconds long .
I use a correlation procedure to find the echoes among to jumble of sounds which are recorded by the mic .
The correlator works by multiplying the recorded sound with the original chirp .
Ideally we want a sharp spike whenever our chirp echo is found .
Repetitive waveforms such as single frequency sine waves are really bad for this – a chirp is fairly good .
Auto - correlation .
To see what a perfect echo would look like after correlation we correlate the chirp with itself .
This image uses " screen " co-ordinates so down is positive .
I 'll fix it one day .
You can see a sharp spike but also some other lumps and bumps .
This is a chirp and echo off my ceiling .
The top trace shows the waveform recorded by the PC mic .
It is plotted in with two scales because the dynamic range is too high to display the both the large and small signals with one trace .
On the left you can see the direct wave – straight from speaker to mic .
Just after this ends the reflection arrives .
For close targets the direct and reflected chirps overlap .
This is n't a problem in current setup but is a limitation if the same transducer is used as both a speaker and mic .
It is somewhat difficult to interpret the raw signal by eye .
For such a simple target you can see what 's happening but any subtle echo would be lost .
The lower trace in the image above shows the signal after its been processed by the correlation routine .
The direct wave is a bit funny because the mic is beside the speaker and not in front of it .
The echo shows a nice spike plus some secondary peaks .
We expect some secondary peaks because the auto - correlation has them .
This suggests that they are not real or at least are larger than they should be .
The next stage of processing is about finding a " trigger " to give a consistent reference when we process a series of chirps ( such as in the sounder image below ) .
My current method is the look for a correlation that is ( for example ) greater than 1/5 the largest value in the entire data set and then search ( for example ) the next 100 samples looking for the peak largest peak in this region .
This is what the " trig gate " setting is about .
I also do a crude gain adjustment to boost the distant echos and reduce the close ones .
The is just a linear gain adjustment at the moment – it proably should be a square function but there are also reasons for keeping it linear which I may get into later .
By the way these images are of different chirps – same type but different instances .
Knowing what the auto - correlation function looks like lets me do some more ( crude but effective ) processing .
I simply look for the largest peak and subtract the auto - correction function from the data at that region and replace it with a single spike – then repeat the process till I 'd done them all ( its faster than you might expect ) .
This is what the " sharpen " feature does .
Here is the the proof of the pudding .
This is a " depth sounder " type screen .
The time axis runs from left to right and the distance axis runs top to bottom .
The maximum range here is a meter or so but the system does works over much longer distances .
On the left you can see where I turned off the " sharpen " function so you can see the difference .
The wiggly line is the echo off a broomstick ( the same one that is in the top photo ) .
I moved the this up and down and it has left a very bright trace and some dim ghosts .
The next fun thing to do will be to try some synthetic aperture processing .
The basic gist is take lots of recordings from different positions to try to work out what the targets look like .
To give some feel for what the raw data will look like I set up two targets ( call them broom sticks ) and slowly moved the mic / speaker combo to take 150 or so recordings .
I was only pushing the combo by hand so the speed varied a bit .
You can see the classic parabolic arcs which are trivial to decode by eye .
The point of the parabola is the location of the target .
However with some smart software you could possibly see the shape of the target and see them amongst clutter ( useful in my house ) .

Scientists have paved the way for the first permanently manned base on the Moon by developing a way to ' squeeze ' oxygen out of lunar soil .
Nasa experts say the technique will allow astronauts of the future to create their own supplies of the gas instead of transporting it all from Earth .
The space agency plans to take its extraction system to the Moon in 2011 as part of its Robotic Lunar Exploration Program , which will test a range of equipment designed to support human life .
If the technique is successful , it could lead to a permanent station like Moon - base Alpha from the popular Seventies series Space : 1999 .
To extract oxygen from lunar soil , scientists used a lens - like structure to focus sunlight on to it , heating it to 2,500C .
In Nasa 's latest tests , a 12 ft - wide dish was used to concentrate the sun 's rays on to 100g of a substance similar to Moon soil .
After a few hours , one fifth of the substance had turned into oxygen .
The soil is kept in a vacuum during the process to help suck out the oxygen .
Lunar soil brought back to Earth is in short supply and highly prized , so Nasa researchers have been using matter with the same composition for its tests .
The soil contains about 45 per cent oxygen by weight , but it is mostly ' trapped ' in the form of silcon dioxide .
Nasa plans to repeat the same processs on the Moon to produce oxygen , which could support life and be used to help fuel rockets setting out on deep - space missions .
At the moment , all oxygen supplies would have to be brought from Earth , which is so expensive and energy - inefficient that it effectively rules out a permanent Moon base .
Dr Eric Cardiff , an engineer at Nasa 's Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland , explained : ' Part of the advantage of the technique is that we 're using the resources that are present on the Moon .
We 're living off the land , as it were . '
He added : ' You can breathe pure oxygen .
There are some trace gases mixed with the oxygen we produced but they 're in very small amounts .
There is nothing dangerous . '
The next step for scientists will be to reduce the temperature needed to extract oxygen .
Carrying out the method on the Moon would involve a mining operation to collect soil and feed it into a reactor , where the oxygen could be drawn off .
It will be easier to lift the soil than it would be on Earth because the Moon has a lower gravity .
Alternative methods to extract oxygen from Moon soil are also under investigation , including melting the rocks into a liquid and freeing oxygen with an electric current .
To recover files , victims are asked to buy drugs online
Poor programming has allowed anti-virus companies to discover the password to retrieve the hijacked data inside a virus that has claimed at least one UK victim .
The Archiveus virus caught out British nurse Helen Barrow and swapped her data with a password - protected file .
The virus is the latest example of so - called " ransomware " that tries to extort cash from victims .
Code breaker
Analysis of Archiveus has revealed that the password to unlock the file containing all the hijacked files is contained within the code of the virus itself .
When I realised what had happened , I just felt sick to the core
Helen Barrow
The 30 - digit password locking the files is " mf2lro8sw03ufvnsq034jfowr18f3cszc20vmw " .
Using the password should restore all the hijacked files .
" Now the password has been uncovered , there should be no reason for anyone hit by this ransomware attack to have to make any payments to the criminals behind it , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant for security firm Sophos .
Archiveus was discovered on 6
May but it took the rest of the month for the first victim , Rochdale nurse Helen Barrow , to emerge .
Ms Barrow is thought to have fallen victim when she responded to an on - screen message warning her that her computer had contracted another unnamed virus .
The virus asks those it infects to buy drugs on one of three websites to get their files back .
" When I realised what had happened , I just felt sick to the core , " said Ms Barrow about the incident .
The Archiveus virus is only the latest in a series of malicious programs used by extortionists to extract cash from victims .
Archiveus seems to use some parts of another ransoming virus called Cryzip that was circulating in March 2006 .
Am I the only one that thinks that Sun has completely lost its mind and jumped the shark ?
Is Graham Hamilton still making these decisions ?
First they stick a JavaScript interpreter inside the VM and then they add an http server on top of that and now they want to stick a database inside the VM – WTF ?
Why do n’t we stick a whole IDE in there ?
Oh wait .
They do that already .
Try to download the JDK and if you ’re not paying attention , you ’re likely to get NetBeans rammed down your throat .
Nothing against NetBeans as it really has improved with stiff competition from Eclipse but I just want the f***ing JDK and NOT Glassfish , NetBeans , Derby , Rhino and any other piece of crap they can shove in there before Mustang goes GA .
And then people are wondering why people are running to Ruby and PHP and other languages ?
Give me a break .
I though Jonathan Schwartz would finally take the company in the right direction after they jettisoned that moron Scott McNealy but seems like nothing has really changed at Sun .
As always , these are just my opinions and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else .

The Intergenerational Effect of Worker Displacement
by Philip Oreopoulos , Marianne Page , Ann Huff Stevens
Abstract :
This paper uses variation induced by firm closures to explore the intergenerational effects of worker displacement .
Using a Canadian panel of administrative data that follows almost 60,000 father - child pairs from 1978 to 1999 and includes detailed information about the firms at which the father worked , we construct narrow treatment and control groups whose fathers had the same level of permanent income prior to 1982 when some of the fathers were displaced .
We demonstrate that job loss leads to large permanent reductions in family income .
Comparing outcomes among individuals whose fathers experienced an employment shock to outcomes among individuals whose fathers did not , we find that children whose fathers were displaced have annual earnings about 9 % lower than similar children whose fathers did not experience an employment shock .
They are also more likely to receive unemployment insurance and social assistance .
The estimates are driven by the experiences of children whose family income was at the bottom of the income distribution , and are robust to a number of specification checks .

No More Road Socialism
by Doug French by Doug French
Whenever I engage anyone in a discussion about getting rid of government , the first question I ’m posed with is : " what about the roads ? "
" How would that work ?
I mean , if private enterprise owned the roads , then the road owners would jack up the price to point where we could n’t leave our homes . "
As if that ’s what private firms do : raise prices to the point where no one can afford their products .
Private firms must provide products that people want to buy ; at a price consumers are willing to pay .
Otherwise , these firms go out of business .
Government , the current owner of most roads does not go out of business , no matter how crummy a product or service it produces .
Thus , I had to smile when I picked up the May 8th edition of Barron ’s , with it ’s cover story entitled , " Paying Up ! "
It seems that state and city governments around the country are selling their toll roads to raise cash .
And it ’s foreign companies that are buying these roads .
The Chicago Skyway toll road was just sold for $ 1.8 billion , while the Indian Toll Road just went for $ 3.8 billion .
Both sales were in excess of 40 times trailing annual earnings , rich valuations that has greedy politicians salivating .
The Pocahontas Parkway sold for 60 times revenue , or $ 611 Million .
And the Pocahontas is only nine miles long .
" Ironically , " wrote Andrew Bary , " the largest private toll outfits are from Western Europe — hardly a bastion of free - market capitalism — while virtually all major toll roads in the U.S. are publicly owned . "
Bary points out that in addition to existing road sales , new toll roads are being built by private enterprise .
A Spanish company , Cintra will lead a group to build a 316 - mile toll road between San Antonio and Dallas .
Drivers will receive better service from private toll road operators .
Many government operated toll roads do not even have electronic toll - collection systems in place .
" Private enterprise can do amazing things with an asset that has been poorly managed by the public sector , " according Peter Samuel , publisher of TollRoadsNews .
Samuel told Barron ’s that the new owners of the Chicago Skyway have increased traffic five percent and toll revenue 33 percent .
" Toll authorities often are inefficient because profit maximization generally is n’t a top priority , " Bary explains .
In fact state toll road departments are ripe with patronage and corruption .
" It used to be that whoever was the governor ’s top fundraiser got to run the tollway , " Illinois state senator Jeff Schoenberg told Bary .
Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels asked his state agency once to estimate the cost to collect a 15 - cent toll .
" This being government , nobody knew , and they finally got back to me and said it was 34 cents , " says Daniels .
" My response was that we ’d be better off on the honor system . "
Unfortunately , none of the governments are getting out of the road business completely .
But , it is interesting that these toll roads are being sold to finance other infrastructure needs .
This infrastructure evidently can’t be financed with the current tax structure ; or , perhaps , the proper incentives are not in place .
If all roads were privately held , the firms would have a financial incentive to make improvements and provide additional capacity when needed .
Can you imagine if I - 15 was privately held ?
Given the demand and financial incentives for people to come and go from Las Vegas to Southern California , if I - 15 were owned by I - 15 LLC , there would likely be four lanes coming and three leaving Vegas .
Instead , government I - 15 has motorists spending hours waiting in traffic and deadly accidents are frequent .
If MGM Mirage can spend $ 7 billion on CityCenter and Boyd can spend $ 4 billion on Echelon , these two could finance the purchase and widening of I - 15 in a heartbeat .
The cost of that 316 - mile stretch in Texas is $ 6 billion .
LA to Vegas is 275 miles .
If a consortium of gaming companies purchased I - 15 , it ’s likely they would n’t even charge a toll , especially for their customers , potential customers or vendors .
Does the idea sound crazy ?
Remember , the state of California is up to its neck in debt .
If Gary Loveman , Terry Lanni and some other strip honchos would get together and dangle a few billion in front of Arnold , that never - gonna - happen idea for a bullet train can be mothballed once and for all , and a few more ribbons of blacktop will start materializing .
And instead of burning up gas stranded in traffic , those Californians will be dropping money in slot machines like they want to be .

教育基本法の改正について、様々な批判がなされている。それらの批判の多くは、やや乱暴に言ってしまえば、「愛国心や伝統といった恣意的な価値観を教育の主眼とすることは、民主制度の社会が多様な価値観によって担保されている事実から考えるならば、首肯することはできない」という、ごくごく当り前の前提に立っている。
ところで現在、成立が間近、もしくは今後審議入りする可能性があり、且つ、社会に対して重大な影響を与える可能性の高い法案は、教育基本法の改正だけにとどまらない。そして、それらの法案は、たとえば障害者自立支援法に代表されるように、それらを不正であると感じる人々が声の限りに抗議をおこなったとしても、そのような抗議は無いかのように（今国会では成立しなかったとしても、いずれは）成立する、現況はそのような流れにあると言ってもおそらく間違いではない*1。そしてそのような状況にある以上、なぜ、そういった抗議が（少なくとも表面上）このように無力であるのか、もしくは、なぜ広範な支持が得られないのか、という疑問が当然湧いてくる。
この、素朴な疑問に関連すると思われるエントリをqushanxinさんが書いている。
様々な抗議活動が世間的に認知されず実を結ばないという状況と、この「不思議」はリンクしているようにも思える*2。このqushanxinさんのエントリに対して、swan_slabさんははてなブックマークで、次のエントリを参照するようコメントしている。
このエントリの内容を僕なりに要約するならば、若者たちが反抗しなくなったということは、単に、多様な選択肢が増大したことによって、パブリックな空間に自己実現の方途を見出さなくとも自足できる、そのような社会状況が成立したからだ、ということになるのだろう。そしてこの見解に従うのであれば、swan_slabさんのこのエントリからリンクされている次の文章の中で、10代後半の若者たちが「自分が悪いんだから」と言っていることも、ある程度理解できるようにも感じる。
若者たちが（後述するが、実際は若者に限らない）こういった「自己責任」言説に流れてしまうのも、パブリックな空間と自身とを切り離したことによる、当然の帰結だとも言える。つまり、個人の力の及ぶ範囲は自身の生活空間に限定されると見做されているし、また、各々の力の及ぶ範囲はそのように限定されているのだから、自身が困窮した時に、助けてもらえるということを期待しない、そのような認識が言外に語られているように僕には思える。
これらの見解がどこまで妥当であるのかについては、即断はできない。ただ、少なくとも僕自身の経験上の知見とはそれなりに一致するようにも思える。そして、その経験から言えば、このような傾向は別段若者に限った話ではない。日本の一般的な職場においては、たいてい、政治的な活動どころか、政治的な事柄を話題にすることすら忌避される。そのような傾向は多くの人が知るところだろう。政治的な活動や話題は、一般的には、迷惑なものとして扱われる。そして、なぜそれらの行為が迷惑なものとして扱われるのかについて、やや安易に考えるならば、次のように言えるのかもしれない。
プライベートな空間に退避することと、プライベートな要素が排除されたパブリックな空間とは、循環している、と言える。パブリックな空間において一定程度プライベートな心情や信条を排除することによって、われわれは各々の社会的な位置を同定し、維持することができる。そして、われわれはプライベートな空間を保持するための糧を、パブリックな空間に依存する形で得ている。そのような循環が成立しているため、パブリックな空間においてプライベートな心情や信条を吐露することは、それらの暗黙裡のルールを阻害する行為であり、そのことによってプライベートな空間の維持すらも阻害されかねない。だから、それらは相手に迷惑をかける行為だと見做されるし、実際に、迷惑に感じる人々が多数を占めている。
--- この、相当に安易な見立ても含めた、これらの見解が、ある程度の妥当性と普遍性を持っていると見做すならば、そこに示されている事柄は、さらに次のように敷衍できるだろう。
現代の日本社会においては、他者の生活空間を侵犯しないことこそが、マジョリティの属性である。つまり、自身の生活空間のみに注力している限りは、他者の生活空間を侵犯することもなく、迷惑な存在と見做されることもない。そのことによって、自身を社会の多数の側に安住させることができる。そして、自身の生活空間のみに注力している限りにおいては、誰か他人の生活がおびやかされようと、尊厳が踏みにじられようと、それらは、自身の力が及ぶべきもない、自身の生活空間上から切り離されて存在している事柄である、と見做し続けることができる。
--- この、「ぶつ切りになっている社会」、この無残な社会は、一旦その多数から落伍した場合、どこにも寄る辺がない社会でもある。社会的な抗議活動をおこなっている主体の多くが、社会に寄る辺の見出すことのできない当事者たちの共同体であるという事実、そして、それらの抗議が広汎な支持を得られないという事実は、このような無残な社会の有り様を端的に示している。その意味では、多様な価値観の代わりに愛国心や道徳といったアナクロな価値規範を要請する動きがあるのも、このような社会状況に対する安易な回答、という側面もあるとは言えなくもない。（とは言え、もちろんこれらの動きには、それ以前のもっと下衆な動機があるだろう。）多様な価値観を保証するということは、民主制度の社会において必須の条件であることは論を待たない。しかし、多様な価値観の保証、ただそれだけでは、（少なくとも短期的には）「公正さ」は担保されない。そのようなあられもない事実を、ここに見出すことができる。*3
社会上の不正へのカウンターに広汎な人々を動員しようとする動きは、いままでも幾度も試みられてきた。最近でもたとえば、「パレード」と言い代えられたデモ活動、ホワイトバンドに代表されるようなファッションに偽装した運動、などが思い出される。それらは全て、参加の際の心理的な障壁を下げる試みだと言えるが、しかし、継続的な成果をもたらしたとは言い難い。何より、現実に、世間は微動だにしていない。それらの手法は
--- 反発を恐れずに言えば --- まったく子供だましであるし、先にあげたような社会の有り様そのものを問うような誠実さもまた、回避されてしまっているように僕には思える。*4
恣意的な規範に回収されることなく、そして子供だましの戦略に堕することもなく、このぶつ切りとなった社会に共通の基盤を形成する
--- それは、果たして不可能なことなのだろうか。正直に言えば、僕にはまったくわからない。しかし、今は認知されていない何らかの価値観が、普遍妥当なものと見做され、われわれの基盤の一つとして加わる、、そのような日が来ることを僕は夢想するし、何よりも、考え続けていきたい。
Sometime around the beginning of July I rewrote our internal jukebox in Erlang .
It ’s taken me four months to get a round tuit , but new stock has just arrived : here ’s the code for our AJAX jukebox
web - application , as a tarball .
( There ’s also a mercurial repository :
hg clone http://hg.opensource.lshift.net/erlang-jukebox/ . )
Click on the image for a screenshot .
To run it , you will need Erlang , Yaws ( the Erlang webserver ) , a modern browser , mpg123 , ogg123 ( from
vorbis - tools ) , and some MP3 or OGG files to listen to .
I ’ve made a start on a bit of documentation and design rationale .
Here are a few highlights for the curious :
* You point the jukebox at one or more root URLs , which it then spiders , collecting URLs for MP3 and OGG files , which it puts into a simple flat - file database .
Just expose , say , your iTunes folder via Apache , point the Jukebox at it , and you ’re away .
* It relies on mpg123 and ogg123 ’s support for playing HTTP - streamed MP3 and OGG files , respectively , rather than retrieving or playing the media itself .
* The user interface is completely written in HTML + Javascript , using prototype for its event binding and XMLHttpRequest support .
* The server side of the application communicates with the user interface solely via JSON - RPC .
* Erlang made a great platform for the server side of the application .
Its support for clean , simple concurrency let me design the program in a very natural way .
As part of the development of the program , I built a few stand - alone modules that others might be interested in reusing :
* the execdaemon
and its associated Erlang controller
module is a filthy hack I threw together to get better than the built - in support for POSIX process control and signalling from Erlang .
* jsonrpc.js
is a tiny , simple layer atop json.js
and prototype that supports basic parsing of Simple Method Description ( SMD ) files , generating Javascript client proxy objects for each JSON - RPC service described by an SMD .
[ Update : fixed an issue with json.js , tweaked the use of screen real - estate , and now seems to work with Safari , IE6 , and Opera .
I ’ve changed the tarball link above to point to the new version . ]
[ Update : fixed a couple of links that had broken over time as the darcs repository evolved . ]
[ Update : moved from darcs to mercurial , and altered the links to reflect the change . ]

A Brief Look at C++0x
Summary Bjarne offers a sneak peek at the next version of standard C++ ( " C++0x " ) which should be complete by 2009 .
Bjarne offers a sneak peek at the next version of standard C++ ( " C++0x " ) which should be complete by 2009 .
The work on C++0 x has entered a decisive phase .
The ISO C++ committee aims for C++0 x to become C++09 .
It follows that the standard must be complete for ratification by the ISO member nations in 2008 .
The set of facilities offered will be chosen from those currently being considered .
To finish in time , the committee has stopped looking for new proposals and concentrates on the ones already being considered .
This paper briefly outlines the guiding principles of the work on C++0x , presents a few examples of likely language extensions , and lists some proposed new standard libraries .
[ Note : This paper was first presented to the " Modern C++ Design & Programming " conference in Shanghai , November 18 , 2005 ]
Guiding Principles
is a better C
supports data abstraction
supports object - oriented programming
supports generic programming
C++ is a general - purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that :
By " systems programming " , I mean programming the kind of tasks traditionally associated with the operating system and fundamental tools .
This includes the operating system kernel , device drivers , system utilities , networking , word processing tools , compilers , some kinds of graphics and GUI , database systems , games engines , CAD / CAM , telecommunications systems , etc .
This kind of work is strongly represented among current C++ users .
For example , see my " applications " page : http://www.research.att.com/~bs/applications.html.
The aim of C++0x is for that characterization above to remain true .
It is not an aim to eliminate one of those styles ( or " paradigms " ; e.g. to make C++ less compatible with C ) or to add a radically new paradigm .
The most effective styles of programming use a combination of these techniques .
Using these techniques in concert is often called " multi- paradigm programming , " so we can say that we want to improve C++ as a multi- paradigm programming language .
The high level aims for the language part of C++0 x are to :
Make C++ a better language for systems programming and library building Rather than providing specialized facilities for a particular sub-community ( e.g. , numeric computation or Windows - style application development )
Make C++ easier to teach and learn
Through increased uniformity , stronger guarantees , and facilities supportive of novices
In other words , C++0 x should be better than C++98 where C++98 is already strong — and maybe in a few more areas that are natural generalizations of what C++98 supports .
When it comes to supporting specialized application areas , such as numeric computation , Windows - style application development , and embedded systems programming , C++0 x will rely on libraries .
The efficiency of the basic language features ( such as , stack - allocated objects and pointers ) plus the generality and flexibility of its abstraction mechanisms ( such as classes and templates ) make the use of libraries attractive in an incredibly broad set of application areas and reduce the need for new language features .
We cannot make the language simpler to teach and learn by removing features .
Stability and compatibility are major concerns , so eliminating anything of importance ( in any way ) is not an option ( and eliminating something of no importance would not be a help ) .
This leaves us with the options of generalizing rules and adding easier - to - use features .
We aim at both , but the latter is easier .
For example , better library facilities , such as containers and algorithms , save users from some of the problems associated with lower - level facilities like arrays and pointers .
Language facilities that simplify the definition and use of libraries ( such as concepts and generalized initializer lists — see below ) will therefore contribute to the ease of use of C++0 x .
Some people object : " Do n't dumb - down C++ for novices — there are languages enough for those " , or " The sooner novices become experts the better ! "
These people have a point , but there will always be more novices than experts .
Many C++ users quite reasonably do n't want to become C++ experts — they are experts in their own fields ( e.g. , physicists , graphics specialists , or hardware engineers ) who use C++.
In my opinion , C++ has become too " expert friendly " and it will cost us little to provide much better support for " novices " .
It will cost us nothing in terms of performance ( the zero - overhead principle still holds ) , in flexibility ( we do n't propose to prohibit anything ) , or in terseness of code .
On the contrary , we aim to simplify expression of ideas .
Finally , C++ is so large , is used in so many application areas , and there are so many useful C++ design techniques , that we are all " novices " much of the time .
The C++0 x improvements should be done in such a way that the resulting language is easier to learn and use .
Among the rules of thumb for the committee are :
Provide stability and compatibility ( with C++98 , and , if possible , with C )
Prefer standard library facilities to language extensions
Make only changes that change the way people think
Prefer generality to specialization
Support both experts and novices
Increase type safety ( by providing safe alternatives to currently unsafe facilities )
Improve performance and ability to work directly with hardware
Fit into the real world
Naturally , applying these ideals and rules is an art rather than a science and people can ( and do ) disagree on what is a natural development of C++ and what would be a new paradigm .
C++0 x will most likely support optional garbage collection and it will support concurrency in the form of a machine model plus standard library facilities supporting threads ( and maybe more ) .
Some would consider that radical , but I don�t ; people have used garbage collection with C++ for years ( where that makes sense ) and just about everybody uses threads sometime .
In these cases , the issue is simply to standardize current practice .
We try to focus on extensions that " change the way people think " because that way we gain the greatest benefits for our efforts .
Every change has a cost in terms of implementation , learning , etc. , and the cost of a change does not always directly relate to its benefits .
The major advances / benefits do not come from improving the way a programmer writes an individual line of code , but from improving the way a programmer solves problems and organizes programs .
Object - oriented programming and generic programming have changed the way many people think — and that was the purpose of the C++ language facilities supporting those styles .
Thus , the best use of our time as language and library designers is to work on facilities and techniques that help change the way people think .
Please note the last rule , " Fit into the real world " .
As usual for C++ , the aim is not to create the most beautiful language — though we all prefer elegance when we can get it — but to provide the most useful language .
This implies that compatibility , performance , ease of learning , and interoperability with other systems and languages are serious interrelated concerns .
Language Features
template < class T> using Vec = vector<T , My_alloc <T >>; Vec < double > v = { 2.3 , 1.2 , 6.7 , 4.5 } ; sort( v ) ; for ( auto p = v.begin ( ) ; p!=v.end ( ) ; ++p ) cout << * p << endl ;
template < class T> using Vec = vector <T , My_alloc <T >>;
Vec<T >
vector <T , My_alloc<T >>
Vec
vector
My_alloc
typedef
using
template < class T> using Vec = vector< T , My_alloc<T > >;
Let�s see how code using new C++0 x features might look :
Each line except the last is illegal in C++98 , and in C++98 we�d have to write more ( error - prone ) code to get the work done .
I hope you can guess the meaning of this code without explanation , but let�s look each line individually .
Here , we defineto be an alias of .
That is , we define a vector calledthat works exactly likeexcept that it uses my allocator ( ) rather than the default allocator .
The ability to define such aliases and to bind some but not all parameters of a template has been missing from C ++.
It has traditionally been referred to as a " template typedefs " becauseis what we typically use for defining type aliases , but for technical reasons , we preferred .
One advantage of this syntax is that it introduces the name being defined where it is easy for the human reader to spot .
Note also another detail .
I didn�t writeIt will no longer be necessary to add that space between the terminating >'s .
These two extensions have already been accepted in principle .
Next we define and initialize a Vec :
Vec<double > v = { 2.3 , 1.2 , 6.7 , 4.5 } ;
vector < double , My_allocator < double >>
struct
vector
sort ( v ) ;
sort
template < Container C> // sort container using < void sort ( C& c ) ; template < Container C , Predicate Cmp > // sort container using Cmp where Can_call_with < Cmp , typename C::value_type > void sort ( C& c , Cmp less ) ; template < Random_access_iterator Ran > // sort sequence using < void sort ( Ran first , Ran last ) ; template < Random_access_iterator Ran , Predicate Cmp > // sort sequence using Cmp where Can_call_with < Cmp , typename Ran:: value_type > void sort ( Ran first , Ran last , Cmp less ) ;
Container
sort
where
sort( v , Case_insensitive_less ( ) ) ; // container and predicate
sort ( v.begin( ) , v.end ( ) ) ; // two random access iterators
Initializing a user - defined container ( ) with an initializer list is new .
In C++98 , we can only use such initializer lists for aggregates ( arrays and classics ) .
Exactly how this extension will be achieved is still being discussed , but the solution will most likely involve a new kind of constructor — a " sequence constructor " .
Allowing the above implies that C++ better meets one of its fundamental design criteria : support user - defined and built - in types equally well .
In C++98 arrays have a notational advantage overs .
In C++0x , that will no longer be the case .
To do that within the framework of the STL we must overloadfor containers and for iterators .
For example : This illustrates the most significant proposed C++0 x language extension that is likely to be accepted : concepts .
Basically , a concept is the type of a type ; it specifies the properties required of a type .
In this case , the conceptis used to specify that the two first versions ofneed an argument that meets the standard library container requirements .
The - clauses are used to specify the required relationship between the template arguments : that the predicates can be applied to the containers ' element types .
Given concepts we can provide far better error messages than is currently possible and distinguish between templates taking the same number of arguments , such asand
The difficulty in the design of �concept� is to maintain the flexibility of templates so that we don�t require template arguments to fit into class hierarchies or require all operations to be accessed through virtual functions ( as for Java and C# generics ) .
In �generics� , an argument must be of a class derived from an interface ( the C++ equivalent to �interface� is �abstract class� ) specified in the definition of the generic .
That means that all generic argument types must fit into a hierarchy .
That imposes unnecessary constraints on designs requires unreasonable foresight on the part of developers .
For example , if you write a generic and I define a class , people can't use my class as an argument to your generic unless I knew about the interface you specified and had derived my class from it .
That 's rigid .
There are workarounds , of course , but they complicate code .
Another problem is that you cannot use built - in types directly with generics , because built - in types , such as int , are not classes and do n't have the functions required by interfaces specified by a generic — you then have to make wrapper classes for holding built - in types and access elements indirectly through pointers .
Also , the typical operation on a generic is implemented as a virtual function call .
That can be very expensive ( compared to just using a simple built - in operation , such as + or <) .
Implemented that way , generics are simply syntactic sugar for abstract classes .
Given " concepts " , templates will retain their flexibility and performance .
There is still much work left before the committee can accept a specific and detailed concept design .
However , concepts are a most likely extension because they promise significantly better type checking , much better error messages , and greater expressive power .
That should lead to significantly better library interfaces , starting with the current standard containers , iterators , and algorithms .
Finally , consider the last line that outputs the elements of our vector :
for ( auto p = v.begin ( ) ; p!=v.end ( ) ; ++p ) cout << * p << endl ;
auto
auto
for ( vector < double , My_alloc < double > >::const_iterator p = v.begin( ) ; p!=v.end ( ) ; ++p ) cout << * p << endl ;

Reference Wrapper
Uniform Method for Computing Function Object Return Types

The difference from C++98 here is that we don�t have to mention the type of the iterator : means �deduce the type of the declared variable from the initializer� .
Such uses ofare far less verbose and also less error - prone than current alternatives , such as :
The new language features mentioned here are all aimed at simplifying generic programming .
The reason is that generic programming has become so popular that it is seriously strains the language facilities .
Many �modern� generic programming techniques border on �write only � techniques and threaten to isolate its users .
To make generic programming mainstream , as object - oriented programming was made mainstream , we must make template code easier to read , write , and use .
Many current uses are too clever for their own good .
Good code is simple ( relative to what it is trying to do ) , easy to check , and easy to optimize ( i.e. , efficient ) .
This implies that a wide range of simple ideas can be expressed simply in C++0 x and that the resulting code is uncompromisingly efficient .
The former is not the case in C++98 — at least not for a sufficiently large range of techniques relying on templates .
Better type checking and more extensive use of type information to shorten code will make code shorter and clearer , and easier to maintain , as well as more likely to be correct .
Ideally , we�d leave the C++ language mostly unchanged and focus on adding standard libraries .
However , libraries that are sufficiently general to be standard are not easy to design and the standards committee is — as usual — short of resources .
We are a relatively small group of volunteers and all have �day jobs� .
This puts unfortunate limits on how adventurous we can be with new libraries .
On the other hand , the committee started early and a technical report on libraries ( " The Library TR " ) was recently approved by vote .
It provides several facilities that are directly useful to programmers : I particularly appreciate having standard versions of regular expression matching and hash tables ( calleds ) available .
In addition , the Library TR provides extensive facilities for builders of generic libraries building on the STL : This is not the place to go into details about these libraries or into the further facilities that the committee would like to provide .
If you are interested , I suggest you look at the proposals on the WG21 site ( see �information sources� below ) , the libraries �wish list� ( on my home pages ) , and the BOOST libraries ( www.boost.org).
I personally would like to see more libraries that are immediately useful to applications builders , such as Beman Dawes� library for manipulating files and directories ( currently a BOOST library ) and a socket library .
The list of proposals is still quite modest and not anywhere as ambitious as I�d like .
However , more proposals from the committee 's large backlog of suggestions are being considered and more libraries will appear either as part of the C++0 x standard itself or as further committee technical reports .
Unfortunately , lack of resources ( time , money , skills , people , etc. ) will continue to limit progress in this direction .
Sadly , I cannot offer hope for the most frequently wished for new standard library : a standard GUI library .
A GUI library is simply too large a task for the volunteers of the C++ standards committee to handle and too difficult a task given the many ( non-standard but huge , useful , and supported ) GUI libraries available .
Please notice that even though they are not standard , the major C++ GUIs have more users than most programming languages and are often better supported .
In addition to these general - purpose libraries , the committee presented a library interface to the most basic level of hardware in its � Performance TR� .

� Drawing all shapes in an array� is a classical example of object - oriented programming ( going back to the early Simula days ) .
Using generic programming , we can generalize that to drawing each element of any container holding ( pointers to ) shapes :
In C++0x , we hope to haveas a standard concept andas a standard predicate .
Thealgorithm is already in C++98 , but the version that takes a container ( rather than a pair of iterators ) will have to wait for concepts in C++0 x .
The - clause is a mechanism through which an algorithm can express requirements on its arguments .
Here , requires ( obviously ) that the elements of the container must be usable as ( implicitly convertible to ) .
In this case , the where - clause gives us a degree of flexibility / generality not offered by simply requiring a container of's .
In addition to any container of 's , we can use any container with elements that can be used as 's , such as a( whereis a likely C++0 x standard library class ) or a container of pointers to a class derived from , such as
Assuming that we have points p1 , p2 , and p3 , we can test draw_all ( ) like this
vector < Shape *> v = { new Circle ( p1,20 ) , new Triangle ( p1, p2,p3 ) , new Rectangle ( p3,30,20 ) } ; draw_all( v ) ; list < shared_ptr < Shape * >> v2 = { new Circle ( p1,20 ) , new Triangle ( p1, p2,p3 ) , new Rectangle ( p3,30,20 ) } ; draw_all ( v2 ) ;
mem_fun ( )
mem_fun ( )
The " draw all shapes " example is important because when you can do that well , you can do much of what�s key to object - oriented programming .
As written here , the example demonstrates the power of multi-paradigm programming by also employing generic programming ( concepts and templates ) , conventional programming ( e.g. the free - standing standard - library function ) , and simple data abstraction ( the function object returned by ) .
Thus , this simple example opens the door to a host of elegant and efficient programming techniques .
I hope that after looking a bit at this example , your reaction will be " How simple ! " rather than " How clever !
How advanced ! "
In my opinion , many people are trying too hard to be clever and advanced .
The real aim of design and programming is to produce the simplest solution that does the job and express it in the clearest possible way .
The aim of the C++0 x design is to better support such simple solutions .

As part of an SAP - wide initiative to reduce the number of contact points between SAP and interested parties , we must say good - by to the SAP Design Guild website .
From the time of its launch in April 2000 , the SAP Design Guild was SAP`s go - to site about design and user experience .
Initiated by Peer Hilgers from SAP ’s Product Design Center and supported from the outset by SAP ’s founder Hasso Plattner , the site provided the public with SAP ’s UI design resources as well as editorial content on a wide range of design topics .
When talking about the SAP Design Guild , it is impossible to not also mention Gerd Waloszek .
Part of the original team that was put together to design and launch the site , Gerd quickly also became its “ all - in - one manager , ” sometimes also fondly referred to as “ Mr. Design Guild . ”
In the beginning
At the start , the website ’s main purpose was to make SAP ’s user interface design guidelines available to the public .
The guidelines were accompanied by a collection of articles under the label “ innovation . ”
These were meant to capture the momentum of the Enjoy initiative that SAP had started in 1998 , which revolutionized the design of business applications .
Over the years , however , the site ’s focus shifted and new content was added to accommodate the changes and to broaden the information the site offered .
Soon after the launch , the team realized that a website is a “ living thing ” that cannot be based exclusively on relatively stable content such as guidelines .
Gerd therefore expanded the site over the years with new types of content .
Then 3 things happened …
The model of the SAP Design Guild was editorial - driven in nature .
In an amazing display of professional expertise and personal dedication , Gerd not only coordinated the content on the site written by various authors but was also penned the lion ’s share of the content himself .
As social networking began to take the internet by storm , SAP decided to take a community approach to the design and user experience topic .
And so the SAP User Experience Community , the site you are on right now , was born .
That launch was at Sapphire NOW in Madrid in 2012 .
In November 2013 , Gerd took his well - deserved retirement from SAP .
With “ Mr. Design Guild ” no longer keeping existing guidelines and articles up - to - date or writing new content , the decision to retire the site was at hand .
The third and final reason for shutting down the site was the company - wide initiative called One Digital Experience ( 1DX ) which started in early 2014 as part of SAP ’s “ Run Simple ” program .
The scope of 1DX encompasses all of SAP ’s digital experiences , with a focus on simplification and giving our audiences what they need , when they need it .
The SAP User Experience Community team has migrated much of the popular information from the SAP Design Guild to the SAP User Experience Community .

And so it is with some sadness that we say good - bye to this great resource , but also with hope that readers will find a wealth of useful and interesting information on the SAP User Experience Community .
With this new approach , we hope to move forward together with you on the topic of design and user experience in a collaborative way .
Source code to Diebold Election Systems voting machines has been leaked once again .
Last week , former Maryland state legislator Cheryl C. Kagan was anonymously given disks containing source code to Diebold 's BallotStation and Global Election Management System ( GEMS ) tabulation software used in the 2004 elections .
Kagan , a well - known critic of electronic voting , is Executive Director of the Carl M. Freeman Foundation , a philanthropic organization based in Olney , Maryland .
The disks were created and distributed by two federal voting machine testing labs run by Ciber and Wyle Laboratories .
They had been testing systems on behalf of the state of Maryland , Diebold said in a statement .
Earlier Breech
This is not the first time that Diebold source code has been leaked .
In early 2003 , Diebold critic Bev Harris uncovered similar source code while conducting research using Google 's search engine .
Soon after , researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Rice University published a damning critique of Diebold 's products , based on an analysis of the software .
They found , for example , that it would be easy to program a counterfeit voting card to work with the machines and then use it to cast multiple votes inside the voting booth .
Diebold says it has since introduced security enhancements to its products , but the fact that the company 's sensitive source code has again leaked out is not a good sign , according to Avi Rubin , a computer science professor with Johns Hopkins and one of the authors of the 2003 report .
The first leak should have taught Diebold a lesson on securing its source code , he said .
" You would think that given the amount of embarrassment that caused them , they would do a better job of protecting it . "
Evaluating Criticism
Rubin , who was shown the latest source code by a reporter at the Washington Post , said that it appeared to be " just another version " of the code that was published in 2003 .
The disks came with a letter that was highly critical of Maryland State Administrator of Elections Linda Lamone , Rubin said .
" It read like it was from somebody with a very , very serious axe to grind , " he said .
" It was one of the more outlandish things I 've read . "
The researcher commented further on the source code leak on his blog .
Rubin believes the disks were given to Kagan because of her past criticism of electronic voting machines .
" I guess whoever did this knew she would pursue it doggedly , which she did . "
Diebold said the source code was for BallotStation 4.3.15C , which is no longer being used in the U.S. , and for GEMS 1.18.19 , which is being used in a " limited number of jurisdictions . "
The FBI is investigating the leak , Diebold said .
Ready for Election
The leak comes with just three weeks before elections in the U.S. , but Maryland Board of Elections Deputy Administrator Ross Goldstein expressed confidence in the Diebold voting machines .
The leaked code was " not software that 's in use in this election , " he said .
" The software now is different and has many more security features . "
Diebold echoed Goldstein 's comments .
" Voters and election officials can be confident that on Election Day , votes and vote totals will be safe , secure and accurate , " the company said .
Kagan , however , was n't so sure , saying that the security of the source code raised concerns .
" The idea that it could be that readily available and could be delivered to me and who - knows - who - else around the state [ is disturbing ] , " she said .
" Who know what any other people may be doing with it ? "
African Union troops are overstretched in Darfur
The AU said the ground and air offensive was a flagrant violation of security agreements .
It said there had been a heavy toll on a civilian population .
Rebels in the area said 70 people had died .
Earlier , Sudan welcomed the UN 's support for AU peacekeepers in Darfur but denied the UN will take command .
The AU said in a statement that Birmaza , a much fought over village in Darfur , had been subject to ground and aerial assault .
I met ... women [ in Darfur ] who were pleading for security , who said we are abused , we are raped , we are attacked and nobody seems to want to protect us
Jan Egeland
UN humanitarian chief
The statement said there had been heavy casualties among the civilian population , but gave no figures .
Rebels in the area said the government troops and Arab militia were continuing on Saturday to burn villages and loot cattle .
So far there has been no official reaction from the government in Khartoum .
' No UN troops '
The AU statement comes only days after the Sudanese government welcomed the UN 's support to strengthen the AU peacekeeping mission in Darfur .
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said on Thursday after talks on Darfur in Ethiopia 's capital , Addis Ababa , that a compromise had been reached for a hybrid UN - AU force in Sudan 's western region .
But Sudanese Foreign Minister Lam Akol said shortly afterwards that " there should be no talk about a mixed force " and that there would be no UN troops in Darfur .
Mr Akol said that the UN would simply provide technical support .
Khartoum has always rejected plans to replace the AU force with a larger , stronger UN mission .
Violence has intensified despite a peace deal in May between the government and one of the Darfur rebel groups .
UN humanitarian chief Jan Egeland has cut short his trip to Darfur after Sudan 's government told him it would be too dangerous for him to travel outside the region 's major towns .
Mr Egeland said on Saturday the international community should not drag its heals over implementing the Darfur deal , warning that more people would die in the region .
He said that leaders " from all over the world ... swore to protect civilian populations .
We have a responsibility to protect .
We are not living up to that responsibility in Darfur today .
" I met ... yesterday women [ in Darfur ] who were pleading for security , who said we are abused , we are raped , we are attacked and nobody seems to want to protect us , " Mr Egeland said .
Violence spreads
A further possible area of disagreement on the peacekeeping mission is the size of the new force .
The UN also wants a force of 17,000 troops , while Sudan says 12,000 would be enough .
The conflict has killed or displaced hundreds of thousands of people
There are currently some 7,000 AU troops in Darfur .
Sudan has always said that the problems in Darfur are being exaggerated for political reasons .
It denies backing Arab Janjaweed militias , which are accused of genocide against Darfur 's black African population .
Sudan says the militias are being disarmed but reports from Darfur say the army is working with the Janjaweed to destroy villages .
More than 200,000 people have died in three years of conflict in the region .
About three million have fled their homes .

Microsoft set out to adopt a formal and rigid support lifecycle in 2002 , back at a time when most analysts were expecting to see Windows Vista ( then , " Longhorn " ) within a couple of years .
My own point of view was that this lifecycle business had a lot to do with Microsoft 's then - new volume licensing scheme , which among other things is oriented towards selling software subscriptions .
If you 're buying a subscription for software , you can see how lifecycle plans become important .
However , delays in Windows Vista coupled with a questionable approach to " consumer " products means that 2007 will carry a few surprises unless policy changes are made at Redmond .
XP Professional and Home are divided into two general product categories for Microsoft , namely business and consumer products .
XP Professional , as a business product , will receive mainstream support for two additional years after the release of Windows Vista ( whenever that may be ) .
After that , Professional will have an additional five years of extended service ( minimum ) , though this could be lengthened considerably if the OS update after Windows Vista does not ship within three years of Vista 's debut .
Mainstream and Extended support are virtually identical , with both carrying security updates , service packs , online support , and the availability of paid support .
However , the transition to the Extended Support phase means that hotfixes that are not security related will be made available by a ( paid ) commercial contract , warranty claims can no longer be made , and Microsoft will not entertain adding any new features or design elements to the OS .
Based on the current timeline and our own expectations for the launch of Windows Vista , we estimate Windows XP Professional Mainstream Support ending in late December 2008 , with Extended Support ending in December of 2013 .
It could stretch out longer , but we do n't expect the window to be more than two to three additional years .
After the Extended Support phase is finished , online support ( knowledge base , FAQ , etc. ) will continue for 10 years .
Windows XP
Home coming up short
Windows XP
Home is another story .
As a consumer product , it suffers from two policy deficiencies .
First , consumer products do not qualify for Extended Support , but instead move directly into the online support phase after Mainstream Support ends .
Second , whereas business products are guaranteed Mainstream Support for two years beyond the release of the next subsequent version of a product ( in this case , Windows Vista ) , consumer products do not get this built - in transitional period .
The end result is that Windows XP Home will leave Mainstream Support and enter online support on January 1 , 2007  in less than a year .
When that day comes , XP Home users may feel left out in the cold , because they will no longer qualify for security updates , and will not be able to purchase support from Microsoft .
Finding this situation somewhat alarming , I contacted Microsoft 's representation to clarify the matter .
A Microsoft spokesman relayed the following to me :
" For consumer products , security updates will be available through the end of the mainstream phase .
For Windows XP
Home Edition , there will be no security updates after 12/31/06 . "
Regarding paid support for problems unrelated to security patches , I was told that " Users who want to continue to receive support after the Microsoft assisted and paid support offerings have ended may visit the Retired Product Support Options Web site . "
I urge Microsoft to reconsider this stance .
There should be considerably more overlap in support for their consumer OS .
While five years of support for XP
Home may have seemed reasonable when it was expected that there would be little more than three years between major OS updates , the time it has taken to bake Windows Vista has thrown this out entirely .
If Vista launches in October , it would give users a mere two months to move to the OS , or risk being unsupported .
I suspect that Microsoft will grant a stay of execution for Windows XP Home , because the alternative is to create a PR nightmare that would also leave customers fuming .
Citing emerging markets in the past , Microsoft extended support for Windows 98 and ME by more than two years , and this decision was made long after Windows XP was released .
Microsoft should extend support for Windows XP Home well into 2008 .
Otherwise users will have to hope that updates to XP Professional meet their needs , but it remains unclear if Windows Update will point XP Home users to updates to XP Professional .
Update : Support has been quietly extended .
The United States government said it could not find the men that Guantánamo detainee Abdullah Mujahid believes could help set him free .
The Guardian found them in three days .
Two years ago the American military invited Mr Mujahid , a former Afghan police commander accused of plotting against the US , to prove his innocence before a special military tribunal .
As was his right , Mr Mujahid called four witnesses from Afghanistan .
But months later the tribunal president returned with bad news : the witnesses could not be found .
Mr Mujahid 's hopes sank and he was returned to the wire - mesh cell where he remains today .
The Guardian 's search for Mr Mujahid 's witnesses proved successful within three days .
One was working for President Hamid Karzai , another was teaching at a leading American college and the third was living in Kabul .
The fourth was dead .
Each witness said he had never been approached by the Americans to testify in Mr Mujahid 's hearing .
The case illustrates the flaws that have discredited Guantánamo - style justice and which led the US supreme court to declare such trials illegal on Thursday in a major rebuke to the Bush administration .
Mr Mujahid is one of 380 Guantánamo detainees whose cases were reviewed at " combatant - status review tribunals " in 2004 and 2005 .
The tribunals were hastily set up following a court ruling that the prisoners , having been denied all normal legal rights , should be allowed to prove their innocence .
Ten of the hearings proceeded to full trials , including that of Osama bin Laden 's aide , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , who brought the successful supreme court appeal .
But by the time the review tribunals ended last year the US government had located just a handful of the requested witnesses .
None was brought from overseas to testify .
The military lawyers simply said they were " non-contactable " .
That was not entirely true .
Abdullah Mujahid was originally identified by Washington - based reporters from the Boston Globe after trawling through pages of testimony from the military trials .
American forces arrested Mr Mujahid in the southern Afghan city of Gardez in mid-2003 , claiming that he had been fired as police chief on suspicion of " collusion with anti-government forces " , according to official documents .
Later , they alleged , he attacked US forces in retaliation .
In the military tribunal Mr Mujahid protested his innocence .
He enjoyed good relations with American soldiers and had been promoted , not fired , he said .
The three living witnesses he requested were easily located with a telephone , an internet connection and a few days ' work .
Shahzada Massoud was at the presidential palace , where he advises Mr Karzai on tribal affairs .
Gul Haider , a former defence ministry official , was found through the local government in Gardez .
The interior ministry gave an email address for the former minister , Ahmed Ali Jalali , although he could as easily have been found on the internet - he teaches at the National Defence University in Washington DC .
The witnesses corroborated Mr Mujahid 's story with some qualifications .
Mr Jalali , the former interior minister , said Mr Mujahid had been fired over allegations of corruption and bullying - not for attacking the government .
Mr Haider , the former defence official , said Mr Mujahid had contributed 30 soldiers to a major operation against al - Qaida in March 2002 .
" He is completely innocent , " he said .
In Gardez , Haji Muhammad Hasan , 65 , keeps a stack of Red Cross letters as the only proof of his son's whereabouts .
" I feel completely helpless , " he said in despair .
Beside him the detainee 's shy sons - aged three , four and five - waited for news of a father they could hardly recall .
The move could have implications for the oil market
In a widely expected move , Tehran said it would use the euro for all future commercial transactions overseas .
The US , which accuses Tehran of supporting terrorism and trying to obtain nuclear weapons , has sought to limit the flow of dollars into Iran .
It wants the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on Iran .
Dollar squeeze
Analysts said Tehran had been steadily shifting its foreign - held assets out of dollars since 2003 and that Monday 's announcement was unlikely to affect the value of the dollar , which has weakened significantly in recent months .
There will be no reliance on dollars
Gholam - Hussein Elham , Iranian spokesman
An Iranian spokesman said all its foreign exchange transactions would be conducted in euros and its national budget would also be calculated in euros as well as its own currency .
" There will be no reliance on dollars , " said Gholam - Hussein Elham .
" This change is already being made in the currency reserves abroad . "
The currency move will apply to oil sales although it is expected that Iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , will still accept oil payments in dollars .
Nuclear trigger
Washington has sought to exert financial pressure on Iran , which it accuses of flouting international law by trying to acquire nuclear weapons .
Tehran denies this , saying its nuclear research is for purely geared towards civilian uses .
Most international banks have stopped dollar transactions with Iran and some firms have ceased trading with Iran altogether in anticipation of possible future sanctions .
The dollar slipped slightly against the euro in New York trading although analysts said they did not expect the reaction to be too severe .
" It is something they have been saying they are going to do for quite a long time now , so I would n't expect any market reaction , " said Ian Stannard , an economist with BNP Paribas .
The BBC's Tehran correspondent Frances Harrison said Iranian businessmen were complaining about delays in securing letters of credit and saw current conditions as a prelude to the imposition of sanctions .
Tehran has urged Iranian businesses to open letters of credit in euros in the future .
The Flashsort1 Algorithm
Dr. Dobb's Journal February 1998
By Karl - Dietrich Neubert
Many programmers are familiar with the theoretical result that " no sorting algorithm can be faster than O( n log n ) on average . "
But this result assumes that you only have limited information ; it assumes you only know how to compare two items .
However , what if your keys are the integers from 0 to 100 ?
In that case , you can simply place each item directly into the correct location -- no comparisons are necessary .
There are many other situations where you can guess the final position of each item .
This month , Karl shows how this basic idea can be used to fashion an O ( n ) sorting algorithm .
-- Tim Kientzle
Most discussions of sorting algorithms are based on comparing elements .
Although it 's faster to classify elements , algorithms based on classification suffer because they require considerable auxiliary memory .
The Flashsort1 algorithm I present here addresses this problem .
It sorts in O ( n ) time and requires less than 0.1n auxiliary memory to sort n elements .
I achieve this by using classification to do the long - range ordering with in - place permutation , then use a simple comparison method for the final short - range ordering of each class .
I assume here that the elements are approximately evenly distributed real numbers , although the algorithm can be adapted to other types of data .
The algorithm ( see Listing One ) consists of three logical blocks : classification , permutation , and straight insertion .
Classification determines the size of each class of elements .
Permutation does long - range reordering to collect elements of each class together , and straight insertion does the final short - range ordering .
Classification
The whole idea of a classification sort is simple : Assuming the elements A ( i ) are about evenly distributed , you can compute the approximate final position directly from the element value , with no comparisons .
If the maximal element is Amax and the minimal element is Amin , you can compute :
K( A(i ) ) =1+INT ( ( m - 1 ) ( A( i ) - Amin ) / ( Amax - Amin ) )
The result will be a value from 1 to m , which I 'll call the class of A ( i ) .
Note that , on average , you have approximately n/m elements in each class .
( In fact , the class K=m only has elements equal to Amax , and the remaining classes are slightly larger . )
Since the main part of the algorithm relies on it , I start by computing the actual number of elements in each class .
This requires simply scanning the data and counting the total number of elements .
Since I know the size of each class , I can predict where each class will appear in the final array .
The vector L is used to track this information .
Initially , each L( K ) indicates the upper end of the section that will contain the elements in class K .
In particular , L( 1 ) is simply the number of elements in class 1 , and the final L( m ) is equal to n .
As I rearrange things , each L( K ) is updated .
The first part of the classification is O ( n ) , since it requires scanning the input to find the size of each class .
Then there 's an O( m ) part , which adds up the class sizes to determine the initial L ( K ) values .
Permutation
The next step is to move elements into the correct class .
Obviously , whenever I move one element into its new location , I have to move the old element from that location .
My code uses a single temporary variable to hold the evicted element .
I can then compute its new location and continue until I 'm forced to stop .
The first problem is determining where to put each element .
Rather than try to place an element A ( i ) exactly into its final location , I simply compute its class index K and place it into the location indicated by L ( K ) .
I then decrement L ( K ) .
As I move elements into their appropriate classes , these class pointers grow downward .
This process ends when the first class has been filled up .
At that time , there are generally still elements that need to be moved because permutations usually consist of several cycles .
Therefore , the second problem arises :
How do you find those elements that are cycle leaders ?
Fortunately , it 's easy to find such elements , since they 're located in the wrong class .
I keep a variable j in my implementation and use j to search through the array to find the next item that satisfies the condition j < L ( K ( A ( j ) ) ) .
The corresponding item A ( j ) serves as the new cycle leader .
Each item is moved exactly once .
I can simply count the total number of moves and stop when I 've moved every element .
( In fact , I can stop before that ; if there 's only one element unmoved , it must already be in the right place . )
This process is all O( n ) .
Each item is moved once , and j scans through the entire array at most once .
Short - Range Ordering
Once the permutation step has moved everything into approximately the correct place , you have a partially sorted array to work with .
Following Robert Sedgewick ( see " Implementing Quicksort Programs , " Communications of the ACM 21 , 1978 ) , I use a straight - insertion sort over the entire array .
Assuming the classes are about the same size , this requires O ( ( n / m ) 2 ) time for each class .
Minimizing Run Time
By adjusting the number of classes , you can fine tune the overall running time of the algorithm .
If you decrease the number of classes , the classification time decreases , but the time for the straight - insertion sort increases .
To estimate the optimal number of classes , I start by estimating the total time of the algorithm :
The permutation step is O( n ) , as is part of the classification .
This contributes a 1 n to the total time .
, as is part of the classification .
This contributes 1 to the total time .
The rest of the classification is O ( m ) , contributing a 2 m to the total .
, contributing 2 to the total .
The straight - insertion sort contributes a 3 m ( n / m ) 2 .
Here , a1 , a2 , and a3 are some numbers that I 'll determine later .
I can use simple calculus to determine the optimum value .
From differentiating t=a1 n+a2 m+a3 m ( n / m ) 2 , I get dt/dm=a2-a3(n/m)2=0 .
Solving for m , I have m/n= ( a3/ a2 ) .
In particular , I do n't need to estimate a1 .
By assuming shifts were twice as expensive as comparisons , Nicolas Wirth ( " Algorithm and Datenstrukturen , " B.G. Teubner , 1983 ) arrived at a 3=3/8 ( using some arbitrary unit of time ) for the time constant of straight - insertion sorting .
Following his lead , I estimated a2=2 , which gives an optimal m of 0.43n .
Figure 1 shows experimental values for the time of the various procedures as a function of m /n .
As expected , the permutation part takes the same amount of time , regardless of m .
Between about m=0.2n and m=0.5n , there is a broad minimum of the overall time .
For larger classes , the straight insertion becomes excessive ; and for smaller classes , it takes longer to perform the initial classification .
In particular , if m>n , then many classes are empty , and straight insertion gains you no additional time .
Figure 2 shows the experimental frequency distribution of the run time for the different procedures at fixed n and fixed m/n .
The time needed for classification is , of course , constant .
The permutation time varies because of the varying time required to locate the next cycle leader .
The straight - insertion sort varies depending on the size of each class .
The distribution for the total run time reflects the combination of these two distributions .
The total time for Flashsort1 does not depend on the original order ; partially ordered or reverse ordered elements are sorted just as fast as randomly ordered ones .
However , if the values are not evenly distributed , the run time can increase unpredictably .
One way to address this may be to use another classification and permutation step to sort large classes before the final straight insertion .
Comparison to Other Sorts
Figure 3 shows some experimental results on the relative run times .
The separate curves indicate the running time of Flashsort1 , Heapsort , and Quickersort using sequences of uniform random numbers as test numbers .
As expected , the run time of Flashsort1 increases linearly with n .
For m=0.1n , Flashsort1 is always faster than Heapsort , and is faster than Quickersort if n>80 .
For n=10000 , Flashsort1 is approximately twice as fast as Quickersort .
For m=0.2n , Flashsort1 is about 15 percent faster than for m=0.1n ; for m=0.05n , it is about 30 percent slower , but if n>200 , it is still significantly faster than Quickersort .
Discussion
Flashsort1 sorts by permutation in - situ in O ( n ) time with only a short auxiliary pointer vector .
In " Mathematical Analysis of Algorithms , " Donald Knuth remarked " ... that research on computational complexity is an interesting way to sharpen our tools for the more routine problems we face from day to day . "
As he points out , time effective in - situ permutation is inherently connected with the problem of finding the cycle leaders , and in - situ permutation could easily be performed in O ( n ) time if we were allowed to manipulate n extra " tag " bits specifying how much of the permutation has been carried out at any time .
Without such tag bits , he concludes " it seems reasonable to conjecture that every algorithm for in - situ permutation will require at least n log n steps on the average . "
In this article , I showed how n elements can be put into m property classes with m being only a small fraction of n .
Instead of n tag bits , I need only an auxiliary vector of length m to sort the elements into m classes .
As a final step , small numbers of partially distinguishable elements are sorted locally within their classes by a conventional sort algorithm .

Are your users stuck in " P " mode ?
How many things do you own where you can't use more than 10 % of what they can actually can do ?
The home stereo you play CDs on but gave up on Surround Sound .
The cell phone that can fry eggs , but you still can't get it to vibrate .
The software app where half the menus might as well be Latin .
So what are we doing to make sure this does n't happen to our users ?
Several weeks ' back I took a one - night Digital SLR class , and at the beginning the teacher asked us each to say why we were there .
All 18 of us said the same thing , one after the other : " I know I have an SLR that can do so many things , but I 'm still stuck in " P " -- Program Mode -- and I do n't know how to use anything else . "
In other words , we were all using our pricey bazillion - megapixel cameras like point - and - shoot disposables .
Here we are with all this power and flexibility , and we can't get past AUTOMATIC .
Why ?
It 's tempting to just write it off as a usability flaw .
But that 's not the case with my camera -- the Nikon D200 is dead easy to adjust .
For most of us , the problem was NOT that we could n't learn how to use anything but automatic " P " mode .
The problem was that we did n't know why or when to use anything else .
It was n't simply a camera problem -- it was a photography problem .
The camera manuals describe precisely how to turn the dials and push the buttons , but never tell us why we'd want to .
They focus on the tool rather than the thing the tool enables ( taking pictures ) .
What good does it do to master a tool if we have n't understood ( let alone mastered ) the thing we 're using the tool for ?
As we 've talked about a zillion times on this blog -- where there is passion , there is always a user kicking ass .
If users are stuck in permanent beginner mode , and can't really do anything interesting or cool with a thing ( product , service , etc. ) , they 're not likely to become passionate .
They grow bored or frustrated and then that " tool " turns to shelfware .
[ Note : I 'm not talking about a scenario where the green circle is just too damn big because they 've added too damn many features .
This is about where the user is stuck not being able to do any of the good stuff .
Remember , this is the " passionate users " blog ... ]
What 's your product or service equivalent of " P " mode ?
Are your users stuck with a small purple circle of capability within a huge green circle of possibilities ?
We have to keep asking ourselves :
1 ) Are we focusing too much on the tool ( e.g. camera ) rather than the thing our users are trying to do with the tool ( e.g. photography ) ?
And by " focusing " , I mean that your documentation , support , training , marketing , and possibly product design are all about the tool rather than whatever the tool enables .
If we want passionate users , we have to help them do something cool ... fast .
And " do something cool " does NOT mean , " learn to use the interface . "
( Keep in mind that " cool " is in the eye of the beholder ... one man 's " really cool pivot tables " is another man 's " lame Excel tricks " )
2 ) Is the product just too damn hard to use even if a user does know what they want to do with it ?
3 ) Do we encourage / support a user community that emphasizes mastery of the thing the tool is for ?
In other words , does your product / service have the equivalent of a FlickR community ... to help give users the motivation for pushing past the " P " ?
4 ) Do we train our users to become better at the thing they use the tool for , in a way that helps make the need for all those other features seem obvious ?
If our users are stuck in " P " , they 'll never get into the flow state .
They 'll never have that hi-resolution experience .
They 'll never become passionate .
Soooooo ... let 's assume we do all that -- we help our users get past " P " and into the good stuff .
The challenging stuff .
They learn , they practice , they master the tool .
Then what ?
What is the implication of a user who does master the tool ?
On the surface , simply increasing the size of the user 's purple circle relative to the product 's big-ass green circle seems like the right thing to do .
But is it ?
Is there a limit ?
Should there always be a little buffer zone of green just beyond the user 's capabilities ?
And capabilities for what ?
How would you label the purple and green circles ?
Would you include the capabilities of the tool AND the potential things the tool could let you do ?
I 'd love to hear your thoughts about :
* why users ( of some things ) are so often stuck in " P "
* how this applies to things other than tools
* what we can do to help push users out of that little comfort / automatic zone and into the more interesting things
* what does it mean when the purple circle starts to fill the green circle , and how we might relabel / rethink these circles as the product and / or user capability matures
* anything else ( heard any good jokes lately ? )

I think that the learning experience is a marketing experience too .
Consumers get passionate in the act of learn , because it returns a highly value experience .

As far as relative size of purple / green circles ...
I think it 's cool when the purple circle gets bigger than the green circle and the user starts figuring out how to do things with the product that the creator has n't even thought about yet .
Think about it ... duct tape has a pretty small green circle initially ... throw in some farmer engineering and bailing wire ... the purple circle is much greater ... thus expanding the green circle ... without a redesign or upgrade !

I 'm one of those with an expensive camera that does n't get out of " P " mode very much .
I thought I 'd mention why .
I shoot mostly my kids , and a bit for clients .
I bought this particular camera ( Canon Digital Rebel XT , $ 700 ) to get away from some annoying " features " of the mid-range point - and - shoot model I graduated from .
Slow start - up time , for instance .
And 4 seconds between shots .
And no manual focus .
And slow autofocusing .
And poor low - light focusing .
And a poorly designed battery compartment cover ( $ 47 ) that broke twice despite careful handling .
And a poorly - designed UI that buries the adjustments I make most often .
And . . . and . . . and . . .
The Canon solved all those problems , and gave me a 4 megapixel boost besides .
After three months , I 'm thrilled with it , and I do n't regret my investment even if I never take it out of " P " mode .
I 'm not sure what wider lesson can be learned from this , except the obvious : " You get what you pay for . "
Also , I remember thinking several times when I read the Canon manual : " They do a good job of explaining how to use the feature .
They do n't even attempt to explain why I would want to use it . "

Sticking with the photography illustration for a bit , my introduction to real photography featured a pair of second - hand Olympus SLRs with manual focus and not much in the way of automation ( the OM2 Spot Program was out of a bin , and only the manual bits worked ) .
So when I moved to digital ( a Minolta DiMAGE A1 " prosumer " ) , it went straight to " M " because that 's what I knew .
I think my point here is that when users seek out a tool to do something they want and know about , the circles will tend not to be too different .
However , when they start using a tool because it 's cool , or they 're trying to learn something , that 's when the problems arise .
The UNIX philosophy of lots of discrete tools each with a narrow scope is a good metaphor .
It 's pretty easy to match circle sizes for a tool like 'ls ' , whereas something like MS Office takes a lot more work to do so .
The complexity in UNIX arises from the combination of simple tools , and can be achieved a step at a time .
Usually there is an understanding of what 's going on , because you 're just trying to connect two known points .
Er ...
I do n't really have a startling conclusion , sorry ...

As an aside , as a happy user of Wordpress , I noticed it fits perfectly your criteria of a tool that helps users kick ass .
1 ) The focus is on writing , writing and writing great content .
2 ) It 's damn easy to use .
3 ) There 's a large pool of helpful and enthusiastic users who help and support each other .
4 ) Train our users ?
I do n't know , but there are loads of other users out there writing ' how to streamline your WP for dummies ' type posts out there that are insanely great .
Posted by : Alvin | Aug 9 , 2006 12:17:21 AM
As for the green / purple circles : I think it depends on the tool , and in particular the extent to which it has a specific , narrow purpose .
The smaller the green circle , the greater percentage that should overlap with purple .
A lightbulb is n't good for much beyond providing light .
Out of ten customers buying lightbulbs , it 's a pretty fair bet that they 're all using the product for something similar .
But that 's not the case with something like Excel .
Here , the possibility space is huge .
Some people use Excel just to make grocery lists .
They may be very passionate about using Excel to make their lists ( as opposed to , say , Word or Access ) but at the end of the day Excel is capable of all KINDS of things that these people do n't know about ... and do n't need to , because it would n't help them anyway !
Here , the purple circle is tiny , and that 's perfectly okay .
Of course , for someone who uses Excel to make twelve - dimensional financial models , their purple circle is by necessity going to be much bigger , but even then there are parts of the green circle that the user simply does n't need to know ( like , say , scripting macros in VB ) .
But then someone comes along and implements Pac - Man in Excel using VB ... and you can bet that person 's purple circle is huge too , yet they have absolutely no need or desire to master some esoteric financial formulas that come standard with Excel .
Back to your camera example , the needs of someone who wants to take portraits and the needs of a nature photographer do n't have all that much overlap , even though both may be using the same SLR .
They 're just using a different set of features .
I think the standard rule of thumb for productivity software is something like 80/20 -- 80 % of your users use the same core 20 % of the functionality .
For game software the rules are entirely different again , particularly for those with highly linear plotlines where every user is going to have pretty much the same experience .
( And yet , games are one of those things that tend to really create passionate users .
Hmm . )

I have an idea for getting out of P mode :
You know those " Tip of the Day " boxes that annoyingly pop -up everytime you start certain programs ?
They often refer to advanced ( or atleast not novice - level ) features and not a lot of people bother reading them .
I think that the " Tip of the Day " box could easily be replaced .
For example , a Photoshop - style program :
You could show an image of something neat that was done with the program , name the feature , and then have a link underneath to a tutorial on how to do that .
An animated demo would be even better .
And now , for a joke :

I wold re-label the green circle to " Things we think our product can do " .
Or maybe to " Things our product was designed to do " .
As some have already put forward : Almost all things can be used in more ways than we as product creator would ever think of .

I work in education , trying to get more teachers in Scotland to see the benefits of using web 2.0 tools to improve their attainment .
Often teachers will adopt a tool for their own personal purpose but not take it into the classroom .
We often write this off as " playing with the new toy " , expecting that one day the teacher will be comfortable enough with it to get 30 kids using the tool .
But 9 times out of 10 this does n't happen .
They remain in a small purple circle of use and shudder at the thought of moving out their comfort zone .
Maybe this is what it is : someone buys a product which gives them the option to become more ' expert ' but without the intention of ever becoming that expert .
The comfort of having the tool do what they did before keeps them happy while the hope of learning something new gives them the high ground and , in turn , motivation to keep using the product .
Just my tuppence worth .

We 've recently completed a web application that mirrors the complex business processes that one of our clients has .
For training , we started off small , letting them use it in very well defined and restricted ways .
Then , we they asked about how can I do ' X ' , we told them and showed them .
That way they learn how to use all of the features without being overwhelmed by it all .
This grows the ' purple circle ' .
We 've found that the greatest way to grow the circle is to answer the 'ahh , but I want to ...' question with the 'yes , it can do this too .. and here 's how ' answer .
This increases the passion that our client has with their web application .

P mode is good , and it's the silver bullet that allows a complex task to be executed without a full knowledge .
While a passionate user can do something great with the entire purple circle , not all the users may be passionate , despite the best efforts .
For non passionate users , a good P mode is the most important feature .

Kathy
I recently graduated from an ancient and extensively used but still fully functioning SLR ( bought when a student over 20 years ago ) to a Cannon 20D .
Faced with a plethora of photographic possibilities , the first thing I did was to sit down and read the short manual .
Then I went out a few times in interesting light conditions specifically to learn how to do the things I could do with the old SLR and a few newer things that would have required special film , filters or lots of wasted film .
But I will never use all the features of the camera and many of them only rarely .
And there is the whole Adobe Photoshop area which I will have to explore too .
The 20D and Photoshop are different things but I now see them as two parts of a single whole .
So my purple circle is smaller than the 20D 's green circle .
But with the addition of Photoshop , the purple circle might move partly outside the green circle .
Will it make my photography better .
Maybe .
Is it Canon 's responsibility to do so .
No way , it 's mine .
That 's why I still look through Ansel Adams books to get inspiration to go out their and take better photos .

It might also be worth thinking about what the circles look like when the product prevents you from doing what you can clearly imagine .
Like your purple circle wants to be really big but it 's being held back by the green circle .
It 's hard to be passionate about a tool when you perceive that the tool is the main thing holding you back .
Tragically , sometimes the tool itself was the source of the inspiration .
E.g. , are n't you annoyed by the fact that the WiFi module for the D200 still is n't available ?
How about the fact that the geotagging via GPS receiver is so clunky ?
A fellow inspired , but disappointed D200 owner .

Are we perhaps just too damn busy to get beyond the P mode ?
I know about aperture and shutter speed settings , even why I might want to use them under certain conditions .
But I almost never do .
Just too busy , and P does a pretty good job for my purposes .
No doubt if I were a pro photog , I 'd expand my purple circle .
I guess this is the same point just made by Sevenoaks .

The P mode is the greated comfort zone known to man but it does have its uses .
For any press work I do I do n't really have the time to get settings sorted out so I 'll stick the camera in P mode so I know I will get the shot .
The first day I got my Nikon I pushed it to manual ( M ) mode straight away but I 've had knowledge of what to do for over 20 years .
Spending time with the camera in the early days is important , I 've known folk to give up within a month .
All the usual learning rules apply , learn from your mistakes and make lots of notes .

I am in the P mode on a lot of things I own .
Is it good or bad .
Well depends .
For a lot of people , the small purple circles you have shown is all that they want .
The sum of all of those purple circles of different users is the sigma of the products purple circle , which could be larger than its green circle .
How to get more out of it ?
Well , for one there is a manual , which really , is an old fashioned textbooks filled with " hows " and few " whys " .
And there are user groups which help you extract a little more juice out of the product .
So , thats how you extract more purple out of green .
Could the manual be better , theres no doubt about it .
Posted by : neelakantan | Aug 9 , 2006 2:43:21 AM
My bigger question that occurred to me as I wrote this is that perhaps we are in the " P " mode when it comes to our brain as well - the auto zone - the zone of comfort .
Shudder !
Posted by : neelakantan | Aug 9 , 2006 2:44:15 AM
I guess it is all about creating the need .
It can help to get people out from P mode into other more creative and demanding modes .
Your post made me think about 3G telephony - it struggles with very serious problem across the world .
Comapanies are spending millions on marketing , but there are no satisfying results .
Why ?
It is simple , the users do n't know why they should use all the features .
I guess the big role here should play experiential marketing that could show people how their communication can change by using 3G telephony .
Maybe they should made 3G classes , like SLR classes :-)
And talking about manuals - I hate them , as they are n't written for the regular people .
I have never run across any reasonable manual that I 'd read .
I prefer to explore myself .
I do believe it would be a great move for companies to rethink the manuals structure and start the conversation with the consumers just there .

Have you heard the one about the circles ?
Well there 's a green circle and a purple circle and they 're looking to escape the giant P? Hilarious antics ensue !
One answer is to reduce the size of the green circle until it approximates the purple one , which is not so much about what people CAN do but what they reasonably WANT to do .
Super techies can go play with themselves because they are not the main user and I figure they 're used to doing so .
The fastest growing hotel chain in the States apparently is one that has stripped out a lot of expensive extras that visitors did n't want and replaced them with useful things - the analogy fits any business by the way .
They 've shrunk the green circle .
This of course does n't mean that the purple circle can't expand if people want it to - but if you hide that supra- functionality , then the average user will not be intimidated and the techie can go search it out ( or in the hotel analogy , extra functions can be paid for by those few people who want them ) .
The other answer is that the purple circle could be expanded if technology marketing was any good ( and yes I will respond to your demand to blog on this tomorrow ) .
Marketing is not just about promotion , it also includes explaining what the thing does .
Once a user is shown properly then they realise that the task is actually quite simple and not intimidating .
It 's just the technology industry that makes it so because that makes the incumbents feel good about themselves .
Posted by : John Dodds | Aug 9 , 2006 3:48:09 AM
I think there is actually another circle and that is the circle inside the purple one which describes what the user actually does , they are capable of doing more , but get stuck doing the same old things rather than being creative .
P mode even does more than this , but they do n't branch out into it .
One of the main reasons for this is that the circle they are working in is the old P mode , what P mode used to be able to do 3,4,5 even 10 years ago .
Posted by : Graham Chastney | Aug 9 , 2006 4:56:06 AM
Something that I see designers doing in response to posts like these is finding the loophole in the logic so that they avoid hard work .
Rather than improving documentation , encouraging community , or promoting ingenious uses of a product , it is sometimes deemed wise to reduce the overall features of the product so that the user uses a higher percentage of the features offered .
Essentially , the green circle is shrunk so that the purple circle looks bigger - and that seems wrong .
Talking about creating products for users does not imply that you give users only the features that they need , but that you also provide a comfortable - but not overlarge - padding between their purple and green circles so that they want more ; more of what you offer , as opposed to what your competitors offer .
This leads to another point about relative feature sets of product offerings .
Comparing the green circles of two products in the same vertical , the one with the larger circle is not just more capable , but more likely to have users with comparatively larger purple circles .
If you 're not giving users features that they might use , then yes , they are n't going to use those features .
And finally , I agree with the sentiment of a few other commenters in that many times , excellent products do not bind their users within the limits of their feature offerings .
People can find uses for products that were not intended in the products ' design .
Products can be designed with the intention of such abuse .
Software with a good API is as good an example as duct tape .
Posted by : Owen | Aug 9 , 2006 6:48:45 AM
If the solution does n't look like the problem , few non-enthusiast users will recognize it .
Mapping from your problem to a perfectly available but differently organized solution is a lot of mental work .
You have to be in a lot of pain or be very curious to do work like that .
Once the blue gets outside the green you 've " violated the warranty " .
It 's great for a product to " never say never " but you can't optimize a design around such a goal .

I suppose I can think of 2 aspects for the issue .
First I would say the green circle has to be bigger so that advanced users can still have fun and push a bit the envelope .
From a product development perspective , if you can feedback from such users , you have a way of knowing what and how to improve your product over time .
I remember reading a post before about advanced users and keeping them interested with advanced features and all ( I hope I do n't mis-represent it ) .
I suppose the opposite issue would be if the purple circle is what the user would like to be able to do with the product / tool , you 'd hope it would not be much bigger than the green one .
The other aspect I suppose has to do with product maturity .
For a newly created product , if you were to draw 3 circles ( want , use , features ) , you are hoping they would be about the same size .
It would mean you are addressing a need in a friendly sort of way and you did not spend too much time on something that nobody uses .
The question is , what do you do next ?
Are we bound to keep increasing the features to keep existing users interested in changing and having new users buying new versions / models ?
Making the product work better more efficiently can only take you so far .
As far as I can tell , you can only do one of two things .
- add new features to stay on top of competition until it gets so complicated ( Excel ) that only a small portion gets used .
- create a suite of products that address very specific needs in a very targetted / efficient manner .

Hi Kathy - first time commenter here ( I think ! ) and I 'm just speaking instinctively since I do n't have much training in usability .
Lots of other commenters seem to be pointing out the possible inaccuracy of the circles as you 've chosen to draw them , and I think that 's the area I 'm most curious about , too .
First of all , the gap between what a user can do and what the product can do looks mightly intimidating in all of its white - backgrounded glory .
But there are other circles in there .
The most important one is the circle that intersects with or surrounds what the user can do : " what the user actually cares to do . "
The space outside of this magic circle is completely unimportant to this user - even if it 's big .
Another phenomenon that helps to fill the gaps is the " what the user 's allies can do . "
This might be a * little * bit artificial in thinking , but I think it 's a point worth throwing out there , because it helps to fill that intimidating void .
If a user 's allies can accomplish different things with the product , then the usefulness of the product is satisfied without the user 's circle having to get any bigger .
This concept is exemplified by the automobile .
The circle of things that the car can do includes things like " spray computer data at a sensor for evaluation . "
It 's a * good thing * that this is n't made super easy .
Even though it 's a * feature * of the car , it 's more or less hidden from the user .
In a weird way , it 's " outside of P mode . "
Another example that springs to mind is a lawn mower .
If an elderly man with
little strength buys a push lawn mower , you might say the " can do " circles completely miss each other .
There 's nothing this user can do with the lawn mower , but his mere ownership of the product combined with his allies ( the teenager next door ? ) see to it that his lawn stays mowed .
Without the lawn mower , he'd be out of luck .
Finally , even for power users of most products , the visual should not consist of a single circle representing the features the product can fulfill .
It 's more like a series of personalized circles for the user with the same terminology as yours , but with the words " right now " appended to the end .
For most users , P mode on this camera probably fulfills 99 % of what the user wants to do ... " right now . "
When the user is sitting on a picnic table with a stack of paper and a light breeze .
The circle of what the camera can do right now becomes " is it heavy enough to hold down a stack of papers . "
And if the user figures this out , the circles align and the product has 100 % satisfied its purpose .

Everybody ’s been saying lots of things about the Google .
be case , especially that the Belgian newspapers should have used robots .
txt to tell Google what not to index .
And that the fact they did not use robots .
txt clearly show all they were interested is in getting money from Google …
Well , friends , I ’m no lawyer or legal expert of any kind , but I ’m French … and that lets me read and “ almost ” understand the terms of the ruling …
I guess …
I think the ruling makes it pretty clear what the Belgian newspapers want , and I think this has been mistunderstood :
The papers welcome Google to index and display their news as part of Google News !
( or at least they do n’t care )
The papers ’ particular online business model is that news are free , but access to archives require payments .
Example here .
require payments .
Example here .
Once an article falls out of the news category and into the archives category , it should not be freely accessible any more .
Google , via its world ( in ) famous Google Cache , often makes the content available forever , or at least for a very long time after is has gone off the official site ’s free area .
I guess that ’s it : what the Beligian paper really want is a way to get the content out of Google News once it is no news any more .
Now , I ’m no robots .
txt or Googlebot expert either , but from what I understand there was no convenient way for the papers to tell Google that it is okay to index some content for , let ’s say 2 months , but not keep it in cache after that delay .
Goggle made some general comments on the case on their blog , but :
They are not allowed to comment specifically on the ruling , so it ’s not that useful ;
They failed to show up at the trial , which is quite unbelievable … but would make it almost believable they fail to understand the real issue that has been raised … : roll :
Note : again , I ’m no legal expert .
Just trying to make a little sense of all this noise …
Be social : digg this ! ;)
Bloat is a function of time , people , and money Jason 21 comments Latest by Josh Ferguson
Why does most software get bloated ?
Time , people and money .
TIME .
Time is an especially effective bloat catalyst .
Just as evolution generally produces more complex organisms over time , the same thing happens to software .
More features , more features , more features .
Sometimes more features are the right features .
And that ’s good .
But often software does n’t stop at a little more and it ends up with a lot more .
And that ’s where time is n’t on your side .
PEOPLE .
The more people a company has working on a product the more opportunity there is for bloat to take hold .
People need to stay busy .
Even when there ’s nothing to do there ’s something to do .
And that something often ends up being extra stuff that is n’t really needed .
Extra features , new science projects , more complexity .
More people + more time can be a dangerous combination in the wrong hands .
This is one of the advantages of having less people on your team : you simply ca n’t do more than you should .
There ’s a physical limit , a constraint , that helps you stay simple .
Forcing simple is better than forcing complexity .
One is better bedrock .
MONEY .
This is more of an issue for traditional software than web - based subscription software .
In the world of traditional software ( read : Office , Photoshop , Quark , etc ) the only way for the software vendor to get more money out of you is to add more stuff to their product .
They have to add more so they can up the version number and wring more dollars out of you .
Certainly the more can be the more you want , but that ’s often true at the beginning of a product cycle and not at the end .
There ’s a point that more just ends up being more .
Products with version numbers past 10 , or products that used to have version numbers but now have years or letters , are great examples of too much software .
Be smart with your time , people , and money .
The combination of these things do n’t need to lead to bloat .
They can actually lead to wonderful products .
But the odds are against you .
So stay smart and know the limits of your time , people , and money .

I got a little nervous when she confessed she would n’t be able to actually deliver the letter herself .
She had a business commitment that kept her tied up the next morning .
But she promised to find some other people to make the delivery .
I may be naive , but I ’m not a fool .
That scared me .
I would n’t be able to meet the other people who’d be helping me out .
How would I know whether they were as honest as she seemed to be ?
Maybe I could at least talk to them on the phone ?
No dice , she said , but not to worry .
She ’d make sure they were good people like her — people who would n’t open my envelope .
People who would n’t steal my credit card numbers off the receipts .
People who would n’t throw the package away just to avoid the hassle of delivering it .
Really , it would turn out fine .
Besides , she was n’t sure in advance who would be available to help so I would just have to hope for the best .
It seemed nuts , but by now it was getting late .
I had to trust her .
There was no other way to get the job done .
I did n’t have any other options .
I gave her some money .
She did n’t object .
Maybe she had done this before .
I slept like a rock that night .
I ’ve always thought people are basically good .
How about you ?
How would you have felt that night , knowing that your crucial package was in the hands of strangers , strangers you would never see and whose honesty and unreliability were unknowable ?
Maybe I should have worried more .
How much did I give her ?
A lot less than it would have cost to get the package there myself — 19 bucks .
That ’s all she asked for .
Besides , if she pulled it off and got the package to my accountant , I ’d have a story I could tell for the rest of my life .
Truth is , I never gave it a second thought .
I trusted that strange woman at the airport .
I ’d never seen her before in my life , and I ’d never see her again .
But I felt somehow she ’d come through for me .
And she did .
I called my accountant the next day , and sure enough , he had received my letter a few minutes before 10 o’clock .
A miracle ?
A lucky break for me ?
Or maybe a dangerous lesson that might cause me to rely naively on strangers in the future ?
None of the above .
My trust was n’t a miracle or a lucky break .
And I ’m a little less naive than you might think .
That stranger I entrusted with my financial secrets was standing behind a FedEx counter wearing a FedEx uniform .
It changes everything does n’t it ?
You go into a FedEx , give a stranger $ 19 , and you can walk out without a worry in the world , knowing that your package is going to get there by 10 the next morning .
I never worried that the woman behind the counter might open the package after I left the office to see what I was sending or enjoy its contents .
I did n’t worry that the man or woman who would touch the package next might open the package to see what was in it .
I did n’t worry that the myriad of people who might come into contact with my package would check it out to see if there was anything in it worth stealing .
I also never worried for an instant that one of the people who would come into contact with my package might just decide it was too much trouble to deal with and throw it away .
Total strangers I would never see .
What word best describes my lack of worry ?
Was it trust ?
Faith ?
Confidence ?
And what was the source of my contentment as I left my package behind ?
It was n’t trust .
The chain of people who interacted with my package was long , and there was no way to interview each of them to explore if they were reliable .
So how could I trust them ?
Never saw them .
Never would .
The woman behind the counter seemed like a decent enough soul .
I trusted her in some sense .
But it ’s certainly the wrong word to describe her coworkers who brought my package safely to St. Louis .
I ca n’t say I trusted them .
I knew nothing about them .
Faith ?
Seems too open - ended .
Faith comes from having used FedEx before and knowing that it always gets the job done .
There ’s a little of that .
But I was n’t even worried the first time I used FedEx .
Confidence seems like the right word .
Confidence born of an understanding of how the division of labor works in a modern economy .
What Hayek called the extended order of human cooperation .
You can see the miracle of the modern economy if you contrast FedEx with a different system , one where I actually find a real stranger , who seems honest , down at the gate at the airport on the way to St. Louis .
Here , I say .
Take this money and this package .
And do n’t worry if you need some help taking the package the last few miles .
Take it part of the way , and give the package and some of the money to the next person on the promise that each person will keep the chain unbroken .
Who could be confident that such a gambit would succeed ?
So what ’s different about FedEx ?
On the surface , there ’s no difference .
I ’m expecting somehow that a lot of strangers are going to come through for me and keep their promises .
Yet everything is different .
When I use FedEx there are consequences of failure if the strangers let me down .
There are feedback loops that reward excellence and punish dishonesty or failure .
These feedback loops create accountability .
FedEx tries to hire honest , pleasant people who smile when you talk to them .
They fire rude people who consistently lose packages or steal them .
It honors and rewards people who do their job well .
And why does FedEx try so hard ?
Part of the answer is reputation .
But why does FedEx try so hard to keep its reputation intact ?
Competition is part of the answer .
But there is more to it as well .
Even those feedback loops that keep the FedEx employees honest work best when people feel guilty about being thieves and slugs .
Does capitalism work best when people are basically honest , or does capitalism help create the virtues that make it work well ?
Probably both .
The system works so well that we hardly notice it or appreciate the marvel of it .
The smiling FedEx employee is always behind the desk waiting to take my package onto St. Louis .
A stranger delivers my paper every morning to my driveway .
I do n’t even know what he or she looks like .
Strangers built my car , wove my clothes , and filled the prescription for the antibiotic that cured my wife ’s pneumonia this past winter .
A myriad of strangers working together in some research lab in a location unknown to me discovered that antibiotic .
We think nothing of it .
It has become natural to us to rely on those we do not see and cannot examine for their honesty , reliability , or excellence .
Yet , most of the time , this extended order of human cooperation fulfills our expectations that the products and services we want will be waiting for us when we want them .
We understand the role of competition in sustaining this system .
Having alternatives helps create accountability and raises the costs of failing to meet our expectations .
But we often fail to understand or notice the resulting cooperation among strangers whose coordinated actions within and across companies serve us .
Surprisingly , relying on strangers beats relying on friends .
We do n’t have enough of the latter if we want to enjoy the standard of living with all of its material and nonmaterial satisfactions .
Relying on friends or relying only on our family would lower our standard of living back to the level of subsistence .
Self - sufficiency is the road to poverty .
Relying on strangers also frees up our friends to specialize in being friends and do what friends do best .
I do n’t want to buy a shoulder to cry on from the low - cost seller behind a counter .
I want friends and families to give that out of love .
But my friends and family have more time for comfort and delight because the extended order of human cooperation out in the marketplace means I ’m not expecting them to sew my clothes or forge a car for me .
Relying on strangers creates the extraordinary web of cooperation that is the modern economy .
A world where the division of labor and specialization — the fruits of trade and trust enforced by the feedback loops of price , profit , and competition — can let me send a package from Washington to St. Louis for about an hour ’s worth of work for the average American worker .
What a lot of confidence can be bought for only $ 19 .
And this marvel of cooperation works even though most of us are oblivious to it and know not how it works .
But appreciating the marvel may help us remember the value of the system of prices and profits that holds it together .

The US Population just passed an important demographic marker this year .
It finally reached 300 million .
The reactions to the news were predictable .
Many on the Left celebrated the growing diversity of the population , while many on the Right came to the defense of rising population for fear that the news would be spun in favor of social policies with which they disagree .
Environmentalists like Vicky Markham of the Center for Environment and Population regretted that all these people are wreaking havoc on the environment .
If by " wreaking havoc " she means transforming it to the good of the human population , this is a point that might be made about Adam and Eve .
But there were two considerations that were not addressed , and they are the most fundamental ones .
First , what kind of economy is necessary to support this level of population ?
After all , whether a rising population is good or bad depends on the capacity of the economic structures to support the people 's well - being .
Second , why should it be necessary that all these people should have to live under the same central government ?
Let us address the first question .
A population of 300 million is about 5 percent of the world 's population today but it was the whole of the world 's population 1,000 years ago .
The dramatic emergence of complex capital structures in the late middle ages and the Industrial Revolution led to the most explosively large increases in human well - being ever recorded .
No pharaoh or Caesar lived as well as the poor live today in the United States .
The vital statistics tell a similar story , as each generation since the development of complex capital structures has lived better than the previous one .
The free market is the most pro-life policy there is .
If we could somehow transport the whole population of today back to a millennium ago , with the level of technology and capital present at the time , what would be the results ?
Nothing short of mass starvation .
While it is true that people are a resource , even the ultimate resource , people still must be fed , clothed , and housed .
This would not be possible with the present level of population with the existing state of economic development 1,000 years ago .
There are many people today who long for a system of economics that prevailed in the Middle Ages .
On the Left , we have the neo-Rousseauians who imagine that modern technology has a hopelessly corrupting effect , while many on the Right dream of a guild - dominated system of small craftsmen and home - based production .
But these fantasies are not only unworkable ; in reality , they are nothing short of lethal .
Most of the world 's population would die immediately if such a system were imposed .
There is only one system that can support a national and world population on this scale , and it is not socialism , primitivism , or any other than capitalism .
Moreover , no form of government can create wealth .
So we need not credit the Constitution except to the extent that it has justified the curbing of government 's reach .
Nor can we credit any political leader .
So let 's not hear about the glories of our great presidents .
It is capitalism alone that has supported this level of population growth and keeps it contributing to the common good .
And by naming capitalism as the benefactor of mankind , I also intend to include the many millions of entrepreneurs , workers , savers , and investors who push forward economic growth .
Now , someone might quickly respond that the welfare state does its share of the work , but keep in mind that the welfare state produces nothing .
Redistribution of wealth does not create wealth .
It only shuffles it around from its most economically suitable uses toward purposes that serve the needs of the political class .
If any property is forcibly made to serve anything other than its first most suitable purpose , its value is reduced .
When it is channeled into purposes that serve the interest of the state , it is done at the cost of freedom as well .
And yet in all the discussion of this landmark of population , I did n't hear a word about the critical question of how it is that all these people can be supported .
Indeed , the very source of wealth in society gets hardly any press at all .
People act as if the given level of prosperity is like good weather : it just appears and disappears in a manner that is largely beyond human control .
This is precisely what good economic education seeks to correct .
It must draw attention to both the question and the answer .
This is what good economists have done since the 14th century .
And then as now , the press that capitalism does get is usually of a negative nature .
We hear about businessmen going to jail , about food manufacturers trying to poison our kids , about fraudulent and unlicensed professionals , about rapacity and greed .
Partly because of this propaganda , capitalism today is hamstrung , taxed , regulated , regimented , distorted and twisted in a hundred million ways .
And yet it remains the one and only source of wealth that serves to feed , clothe , and house the growing multitudes of the American population .
A hundred years ago , when the US population passed the 100 million mark , there was much talk about many subjects concerning the growth , but one subject was not raised , and this is the very subject that dominated the headlines this year : the environment .
There seems to be some kind of consensus , one that is not open to dispute , that a growing population is a disaster for the environment .
Now , when speaking of this question of the environment , it is good to clarify our terms .
If by the environment we mean , for example , clean air , I can promise you that there is no surer way to clean the air than air conditioning .
And this is distinctly a product of the human population .
The same can be said of water : a rising population engaged in the capitalist project of bottling water to sell is the great path to clean water .
Nature left to its own devices is cruel and dirty .
But many people do n't see it this way .
For them , the best environment is the one that is utterly uninhabited .
This dream provides a strangely perverse justification for socialist policies , the end result of which is finally poverty and death .
The New Scientist , for example , has published an article oddly titled " Imagine earth without humans . "
" Humans are undoubtedly the most dominant species the Earth has ever known , " the article begins .
" In just a few thousand years we have swallowed up more than a third of the planet 's land for our cities , farmland and pastures .
By some estimates , we now commandeer 40 per cent of all its productivity .
And we 're leaving quite a mess behind : ploughed - up prairies , razed forests , drained aquifers , nuclear waste , chemical pollution , invasive species , mass extinctions and now the looming specter of climate change .
If they could , the other species we share Earth with would surely vote us off the planet . "
" Now just suppose they got their wish , " the article continues .
" Imagine that all the people on Earth — all 6.5 billion of us and counting — could be spirited away tomorrow , transported to a re-education camp in a far - off galaxy .
…
Left once more to its own devices , Nature would begin to reclaim the planet , as fields and pastures reverted to prairies and forest , the air and water cleansed themselves of pollutants , and roads and cities crumbled back to dust . "
Of course no article that seems to long for the end of humanity would be complete without a quotation from an expert scientist .
So here it is : " The sad truth is , once the humans get out of the picture , the outlook starts to get a lot better , " says John Orrock , a conservation biologist at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara , California .
We can gather from this statement that there is at least one form of extinction that some environmentalists would not entirely regret .
The irony is that the policies of the environmentalists have moved far beyond the early conservation movement that saw merit in the wonders of the Grand Canyon and California Redwoods .
It has become an all - encompassing political ideology that argues against the well - being of people and on behalf of anything non-human .
In its reductio ad absurdum , it aspires to the extinction of the human race , and , in its politics , it works to kill off the source of prosperity , and therefore works toward extinction in bits and pieces .
The truth is that this country has entirely too much unused nature , as is obvious when you take a coast - to - coast flight in the United States .
From a bird 's eye view , this country is hardly overcrowded , a fact that is also underscored in , detailed maps .
Indeed , most of the landmass of the United States is empty .
Our population density is far lower than the rest of the world , especially that of Asia , Latin America , and Europe .
And yet you can't make that kind of statement in American politics and expect any kind of assent .
Yet the issue of immigration has become a hotbed .
People are increasingly angry about all that they associate with immigration .
But a consideration that sheds light on the issue is that all the problems we associate with immigration stem not from the presence of people but from the institutional arrangements in which people interact .
Immigration of some types forces on the domestic population new requirements for public infrastructure .
Schools must be built and funded , and new public - sector employees hired .
The demands on the public purse grow .
New immigrants can receive public assistance .
They coalesce based on language and ethnicity and gain control of local governments , through which they then coerce others .
They have national voting interests , and their votes are up for grabs by parties representing special interests , which means both parties .
Whereas people will suffer through incredible abuses when imposed by people who share their nationality , they will not tolerate the same from those whom they regard as alien .
The result is social and political upheaval .
And what is the source ?
Not capitalism .
Not immigration as such .
Rather the core problem is the state , which enables some people to rob others on their own behalf .
All other concerns are a distraction from the key issue .
The best immigration reform is one that would provide neither impediments toward work for anyone nor subsidies of any sort .
Eliminating the subsidies alone would also help alleviate the resentment that comes with immigration .
It would also stop the subsidies that cause people to immigrate for the wrong reasons .
In any case , it is pointless and dangerous to pursue the method of using government power to round up illegals and throw them out — a power that is used to the detriment of commercial freedom — when the law still encourages demographic upheaval through subsidies and special rights .
And let us recall that the federal government has no real incentive to stabilize and control immigration in any sense that would be beneficial to American citizens .
Whatever the government does , it ends up conspiring against private property owners .
In areas of Arizona where private lands bumped up to the border , for example , the government actually restricts the ability of landowners to control trespassing .
Let us ask a fundamental question : can there be such a thing as overpopulation ?
The Left seems to say that population growth is always a problem .
The Right seems to believe that there can be no such thing as overpopulation .
The libertarian - Austrian view is a third position entirely .
It argues that every population is optimal provided it reflects the free choice of individuals within a society in which production and exchange — the means of support for all people — are also permitted to reflect the choices of people .
A capitalistic society leaves the issue of population to the people .
Under socialism , says Mises , there can be no toleration towards a laissez - faire population policy .
Indeed , writes Mises , " Without coercive regulation of the growth of population , a socialist community is inconceivable .
A socialist community must be in a position to prevent the size of the population from mounting above or falling below certain definite limits .
It must attempt to maintain the population always at that optimal number which allows the maximum production per head ….
it is certain that even if a socialist community may bring ' free love , ' it can in no way bring free birth . "
Population only becomes a problem when government enters the picture .
Here is where we need to address the second question with which I began .
Why should these 300 million people be forced to live under the same central government ?
The independent Greek cities , out of which came Western civilization , had populations of 15,000 or so , smaller than Auburn , Alabama , today .
If we followed the Greek model , we would not have one central government but fully 20,000 small communities , each with political autonomy .
They would compete for citizens and capital .
Those that taxed and regulated their citizens and their property would lose , and those who let people alone would gain .
They would be economically unviable on their own , and so they would be driven to permit free trade , not only between the cities but also with the rest of the world .
This would not lead to isolationism but rather the very opposite : a heightened economic and cultural internationalism , even as the structures of government would be close at home and easier to control .
And as the politically independent Greeks were still all Greeks , we would still be all Americans .
But the forces of competition would work to improve the governments under which we live and bring them in line with the old liberal ideal .
If raising the idea of breaking the US into 20,000 autonomous entities sounds completely crazy to you , I look at it this way : if the New Scientist can talk about how healthy the world would be if six billion people were zapped away by aliens , I can talk about the far more realistic and responsible vision of turning fifty United States into 20,000 free and disunited cities .
Moreover , we should reflect on the reality that self - governing communities were precisely the experience of Colonial America .
The colonies traded with each other and with the rest of the world .
Citizens moved to locations based on the relative liberality of laws .
Our colonial ancestors were widely read .
They learned from the experience of Rome that republican government can only coexist with liberty when both the territory and the population size are small .
Otherwise , they degenerate into despotic and unworkable schemes for central planning .
The knowledge of this reality is what led to the revolt against their masters overseas .
School kids are taught that the basis of the American Revolution was the desire of the colonies not to be ruled by a King .
But this is a superficial view .
It is also misleading to say that the colonists were driven to revolution by taxes or trade monopolies .
These were both symptoms of a larger reality that had begun to dawn on them , namely that they were capable of self - government and that therefore the empire was imposing a wholly unnecessary despotism on them .
They did n't need to be ruled by some far - flung government on the other side of the world .
They could rule themselves , and they had every right to assert that truth , which is what they did in the Declaration of Independence .
The revolutionary generation spoke of the high debts of the British government , of its patronage and corruption , of the cruelty of its colonial administrators , of its arrogance and pride , of its departure from its historic principles of liberty — and all of these were seen as the inevitable consequence of empire , which is nothing more than the attempt to rule too many people over too large a territory under rules and laws that favor interest groups in league with the imperial state .
The colonists spoke aggressively about liberating the colonies from the grip of the British Empire .
They spoke of how a revolution against the empire would ultimately prove to be beneficial to Britain itself , because it would help to return it to its first principles .
They spoke of how the world would rejoice to see the British Empire humiliated in defeat .
Mercy Otis Warren writes in her history of the revolution that the Americans felt a sense of solidarity with many nations around the world who had been cruelly treated by the British Empire .
Their identity began to be shaped around themselves as resistors to empire , and it even affected historiography at the time , as every group that had ever longed to throw off the yoke of Britain came to have new luster in their eyes .
Had the taxes and depredations occurred domestically , the level of tolerance would have been much higher , as is always the case .
The decisive force in the Revolution was that despotism was being imposed at so remote a distance by a government that knew nothing and understood nothing about the distinctive American cultural and political identity that had been shaped over the previous 100 years and more .
It was this that gave rise to such rhetoric as is found in the sermon of Pastor Jonathan Mayhew in 1750 : " For a nation thus abused to arise unanimously , and to resist their prince , even to the dethroning him , is not criminal ; but a reasonable way of indicating their liberties and just rights ; it is making use of the means , and the only means , which God has put into their power , for mutual and self - defense .
And it would be highly criminal in them , not to make use of this means . "
It was the successful overthrowing of an empire that inspired the first code of government after the Revolution : the Articles of Confederation .
The United States was to be an assembly of republics .
We must understand that the word republic in those days was synonymous with small .
The territory would be small .
Monarchies could be larger , but even they had to divide as their populations grew .
This view toward the size of republics was due to the influence of Montesquieu , who argued the point in great detail .
In his view , large republics were necessarily corrupt and contained the seeds of their own destruction .
Montesquieu was the favorite thinker of the intellectuals and activists who opposed the creation of the US Constitution on precisely the grounds that such a big state would constitute an empire .
Robert Yates , writing under the name Brutus , said against the Constitution :
" History furnishes no example of a free republic , anything like the extent of the United States .
The Grecian republics were of small extent ; so also was that of the Romans .
Both of these , it is true , in process of time , extended their conquests over large territories of country ; and the consequence was , that their governments were changed from free to the most tyrannical that ever existed in the world . "
Patrick Henry , as usual , was more eloquent than anyone :
" If we admit this consolidated government , it will be because we like a great , splendid one .
Some way or other we must be a great and mighty empire ; we must have an army , and a navy , and a number of things .
When the American spirit was in its youth , the language of America was different : liberty , sir , was then the primary object . …
But now , sir , the American spirit , assisted by the ropes and chains of consolidation , is about to convert this country into a powerful and mighty empire .
If you make the citizens of this country agree to become the subjects of one great , consolidated empire of America , your government will not have sufficient energy to keep them together .
Such a government is incompatible with the genius of republicanism .
There will be no checks , no real balances , in this government . "
So powerful was this argument that Alexander Hamilton was forced to reply in the Federalist Papers : " the opponents of the plan proposed have , with great assiduity , cited and circulated the observations of Montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government . …
When Montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics , the standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of almost every one of these States .
Neither Virginia , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , New York , North Carolina , nor Georgia can by any means be compared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms of his description apply . "
Do you see the sleight of hand here ?
He is citing the case of the states as not being empires .
But what was at issue was not the states — they were already sovereign — but the creation of the national government .
That was what the antifederalists feared .
The federalists ( who were of course misnamed ) promised that the states would retain political autonomy , but that begged the question of why there was a need for a federal government at all .
All such questions must be considered in context .
Might Hamilton have reversed his judgment had he lived to see the federal government trample on the legal rights of the states , or seen the states expand from 13 to 50 , or seen the empire spread from the Northeast and all the way to Hawaii and Alaska ?
Might he have eaten his words if he could have seen the dreadful results of the attempt of the US empire to even impose its rule in a long series of wars ?
It is difficult to say , but this much we do know : the antifederalists were precisely right that the creation of the new federal government would create too many temptations to empire .
I 'm particularly intrigued by Patrick Henry 's comments .
He says that a free people do not speak of imperial greatness but of liberty itself .
They do not seek to be feared by the world but appreciated , admired , and emulated .
In the same spirit , a free people do not rule by tanks and guns and bombers ; they win converts to their cause through peaceful cooperation and good example to the world .
This is the ideal of Patrick Henry .
He fought to immunize the American people against the great error that has bamboozled the producers from the ancient world to our own time : the myth that imperial greatness can be achieved without the expense of freedom .
All nations that aspire to imperial greatness lose their liberty and learn , but always at a date too late .
In the early part of the 20th century , following World War I , Europe faced a similar crossroad .
Would it choose the path of liberty or would it attempt to shore up the old imperial states that existed in the 19th century ?
A new democratic age had dawned , and monarchies had been overthrown .
Mises was the new Montesquieu , warning against large states and urging radical devolution of government as the only path to peace and prosperity .
The book in question is called Nation , State , and Economy .
It was Mises 's first book on politics .
His explicit purpose was to map out a plan for Europe to avoid future war .
To Mises , that meant turning the nationalist impulse toward a productive use in the creation of much smaller states , and avoiding the error of empire .
He wrote that the princely states strive for expansion of territory and for unlimited increases in the number of subjects , with which the prince can expect higher tax revenues .
The state believes that its survival depends on its size .
The more mighty and expansive , the more it assures its preservation and prosperity .
But the idea of classical liberalism introduced a revolutionary idea into history .
It saw that prosperity depends not on the size of the state but on its economic structure .
In fact , an expansive state requires high taxes and inflation and these institutions actually war against prosperity .
Moreover , it saw that small states are actually more stable and long - lasting because they avoid the expense of war and refrain from cultivating enemies that seek their destruction .
Their governments are more likely to remain small and limited .
The old liberal position , then , turned ancient wisdom on its head .
It is not through empire that a nation ( which is different from a state ) achieves prosperity and longevity , but through free markets , free trade , small and localized forms of government , and an international policy of peace .
This was the only way forward for Europe , if another war was to be prevented .
There is another point : small government resolves the civil strife that comes when too many people within a diverse population live under a unitary state .
The struggle to gain power and impose one group 's will on another will always be present .
But devolved government keeps people out of each other 's hair , and allows all people to interact by means of human choice rather than force .
If we understand this point , we can begin to make sense not only of America 's immigration problems but also why the war in Iraq has so far proven such an abysmal failure .
" Liberalism knows no conquests , " Mises wrote , " no annexations … .
It forces no one against his will into the structure of the state .
Whoever wants to emigrate is not held back .
When a part of the people of the state wants to drop out of the union , liberalism does not hinder it from doing so .
Colonies that want to become independent need only do so .
The nation as an organic entity can be neither increased nor reduced by changes in states … . "
Mises was very shrewd in turning the idea of democracy , which was then heralded by all as the great leap forward out of monarchical states , toward a literal rendering of the idea .
To Mises , democracy meant that people consent to a government of their choosing .
If people want to leave that government and form a new one , they are following the democratic impulse .
Such is usually the case in territories .
To prevent people from leaving would be to assert the rights of empire over democracy .
" Democracy , " he wrote " is self - determination , self - government , self - rule . "
The connection with his advocacy of free markets is clear .
Just as in political life , people must always consent to the way in which they are ruled , in economics , people should not be ruled without their consent in their exchanges , business enterprises , or choices of any kind .
So long as people are not forced against their will in economics or politics , they are free , and it is this free condition that leads to peace and prosperity .
So Mises 's idea of democracy had nothing to do with democracy today , in which an unwilling majority is ruled by special interest groups under ever - increasing power relations .
While we might not agree with Mises in believing that democracy could work so long as government is in charge , we can commend his attempt to reconcile the idea of law with freedom .
This ideal depended heavily on governmental structures that are close to the people and can be influenced by them .
There can be no compromise between the liberal idea and the imperial idea , and no special considerations justify replacing the former with the latter .
" The idea of liberalism starts with the freedom of the individual , " he wrote .
" It rejects all rule of some persons over others ; it knows no master peoples and no subject peoples , just as within the nation itself it distinguishes between no masters and no serfs .
For fully developed imperialism , the individual no longer has value .
He is valuable to it only as a member of the whole , as a soldier of an army . "
Imperialism , wrote Mises , " strives for the numerical greatness of the nation .
To make conquests and hold them , one must have the upper hand militarily , and military importance always depends on the number of combatants at one 's disposal .
Attaining and maintaining a large population thus becomes a special goal of policy … .
The imperialist wants a state as large as possible ; he does not care whether that corresponds to the desire of the peoples . "
In contrast , Mises favored a globalism in economic relations and a localism in political relations .
To achieve these required an ideological change that set aside grudges in favor of a future of liberal individualism .
Such was the Misesian vision in 1919 .
It was not to come to pass .
World War I had ended with many resentments stewing and the old longing for empire had not entirely gone away .
Germany in particular was ripe for bamboozlement by a leader who could tap into the resentment concerning lost territories .
The leader would convince the people that the urge for justice can only be satisfied by re-creating an empire , and only the strongest possible leader could manage to accomplish this against all odds .
Mises wrote with an impassioned desire to stop the course of events .
" It would be the most terrible misfortune for Germany and for all humanity if the idea of revenge should dominate the German policy of the future , " he wrote .
" To become free of the fetters that have been forced upon German development by the peace of Versailles , to free our fellow nationals from servitude and need , that alone should be the goal of the new German policy .
To retaliate for wrong suffered , to take revenge and to punish , does satisfy lower instincts , but in politics the avenger harms himself no less than the enemy .
What would he gain from quenching his thirst for revenge at the cost of his own welfare ? "
There is only one problem with the Misesian analysis .
While it is true that the people of a nation do not and cannot gain anything from a policy of revenge , government leaders do gain what they always and everywhere seek above all else : power and money .
It then becomes the task of the leaders to convince the mass of people that everyone benefits when the leaders benefit .
In short , the people must be bamboozled into accepting some ideological rationale for government to expand and become an imperial power that rules as much as possible .
And what kinds of rationales are there available ?
Almost any idea alive in the culture is open to being co-opted .
If people are religious , the rulers can claim that empire is necessary for religious reasons .
If they have a fear of some ghastly ideology like fascism or communism , the leaders can say that they are staving off such systems .
If they believe that their economic well - being is being threatened from abroad , an economic nationalism can be advanced .
There are many other available rationales .
In the interwar period , for example , race theory became very popular among the educated elite of all Western nations , and this theory was often linked with a socialist plan for using eugenic policies to bring about some purported ideal .
Nazism did not invent all this ; it only used what was alive in the culture as a way of justifying its power .
These ideas were no less popular in Britain and the United States .
Americans have a deep - rooted attachment to the ideal of liberty , which is a glorious thing .
But it is also why American leaders have always justified foreign wars in the name of liberating the oppressed people of the world .
The mistake is thinking that freedom can be achieved by means of force .
The Cold War originated with the idea that the US should do whatever was necessary to roll back the very Soviet client states that the US worked to establish at the end of World War II .
Then the US pursued a series of wars in far - flung places that cost lives and liberty and did nothing to stop the spread of communism .
Murray Rothbard saw what was happening in the late 1940s , and emerged as the last - surviving member of the Old Right that united love of free markets with an anti-imperial foreign policy .
This eventually became known as libertarianism , which , in its best form , is as much opposed to imperial warmongering as anyone on the Left .
His strength as a writer and commentator on public affairs was that he saw through the official lies of the state , particularly in wartime .
The more implausible the imperial war , the more a variety of rationales becomes necessary .
Iraq has been justified on grounds of security , safety , religion , vengeance , and economics , each rationale carefully tailored to appeal to a certain demographic group .
All that is necessary is that the state convinces a slight majority , however temporarily .
Hardly a day goes by when I do n't receive emails from advocates of war explaining why the wars of the Bush administration are actually wonderful and just and great for us .
They all have a different tenor .
Some are about security .
Some emphasize the need to overthrow foreign dictators .
Some are religious in nature and express great fear about the old religion of Islam , with which the West has had peaceful and productive relations provided we have not been working to overthrow their governments and invade their lands .
But a theme that emerges from all these emails is the one that we need to be most on guard against : raw enthusiasm for the state as the appointed representative of American interests .
In fact , I would say that this attitude is un-American in the most profound sense .
What must a person forget in order to believe in the unity of interest between US foreign policy and the American people ?
They must forget that the United States was born in revolt against not only the British Empire but also the very idea of empire itself .
They must forget that the only way the US Constitution was adopted was the promise that it would not act imperialistically at home or abroad .
They must forget the warnings of George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and many other leaders of the 18th and 19th centuries .
They must forget about the history of failure of our own imperial wars in the 20th century , in which guerilla armies have consistently beat back our regular troops .
Every American is right to be mighty angry at the Bush administration .
Bush originally campaigned against the big government of Clinton and called for humility in foreign policy .
And what did the Republicans do with their political capital ?
They squandered every last bit of it on an imperial adventure .
In so doing , they further discredited other causes with which the Republicans are linked in the public mind , including the cause of free markets .
War is all they have to show for themselves , and it's a disgrace .
And at this late stage in the Iraq conflict , the Bush - run state is asking us to forget even how the Iraq war began .
Recall that the idea was to bomb Baghdad , create shock and awe , decapitate the head of state , and then watch as the rest of the country celebrated their liberation from Saddam .
Today , Iraq is a country in ruins .
Death and violence are everywhere .
The reconstruction is going nowhere .
Almost 10 % of the population has fled .
The only immigrants coming in are those swearing to kill .
And yet I read the headline of the New York Times , which quotes what is passed on as some sort of revelation from the military commanders in Iraq .
They have decided that the future of Iraq depends heavily on taking Baghdad , cleaning out its rebels and dissidents , and enforcing this through massive violence .
Folks , this is how this war began .
And it is how this war is ending .
But let me say something in defense of the US military commanders in Iraq who concocted this latest scheme .
There is something intuitively plausible and honest about the statement that if a government can't control its own capital , it cannot control the rest of the country .
In fact , I propose that the same approach be used domestically .
Before the federal government makes any more attempts to bring their proposed utopia to the rest of the country , let them eliminate poverty , crime , gang war , hate , despair , abuse , corruption , and injustice in Washington , D.C.
Once that city is cleared of all such vice , we can talk about moving on to other parts of the country .
I think we can safely predict a quagmire .
The United States has no business attempting to run a government in Iraq , halfway across the world .
A policy maker who claims to be surprised by the resistance is feigning ignorance of the heritage of the US .
We are all rebels in our hearts .
Anyone who longs for freedom must be .
The same can be said of the entire United States .
It is an utterly unviable project to attempt to rule 300 million people under a single central government .
The experience of all of mankind teaches us that .
For that reason a consistent anti-imperialist stance today must not only oppose the US war in Iraq and its attempts to manage governments anywhere in the world , but also favor a complete rollback of the US empire at home on grounds that it is contrary to liberty and contrary to our heritage .
And if we understand something about economics , we must also see that a consistent stance against imperialism must also favor a completely free market , not only within the territory of the state but also with the entire world .
A people who live in small independent cities can be the most prosperous in history provided they keep the markets free of any impediments , maintain a sound currency , and not interfere with the right of free association .
The old liberal vision is as valid today as it was before 1776 , before 1787 , and in 1919 .
There is a unity in the idea of a free economy at home and abroad , and a reduced and devolved form of government .
We must reclaim that spirit that Patrick Henry said was alive in America 's youth .
Why is it then that the Mises Institute is nearly alone in championing such a policy ?
After all , it is part of the conventional apparatus of received opinion in this country that people who love free enterprise also love war , while those who love peace are also friendly to socialism and people - impoverishing ideologies like environmentalism .
Why is it that the Mises Institute position on this is so rare ?
Well , we can observe that this position was rare in Mises 's day too .
When Rothbard took up the cause after World War II , he was nearly alone .
And today we stand out among institutions for upholding this ideal .
And yes , this opinion is still rare .
But it need not stay that way .
The cause of anti-imperialism and freedom triumphed in 1776 and it can triumph again , provided we have the courage to continue to speak the truth .
Never has the work of the Mises Institute been more essential .
This country and this world need a voice that addresses the questions that others not only fail to answer , but also fail to ask .
The cause of liberty itself needs the Mises Institute .
It needs all our student programs to thrive .
It needs our publishing to be even more aggressive and prolific .
It needs our web presence to be ever more spectacular .
Academia is in desperate need of thinkers who understand what liberty means .
The human population needs liberty in order to continue to grow in numbers and well - being , and liberty needs champions to make it so .
This is what is needed for social peace and economic prosperity .
And above all , the Mises Institute needs you , your fighting spirit that inspires our work , and the confidence you give us to forge ahead and say what few others are willing to say .
Thank you for all you have done to give voice to the wisdom of the ages , and for enabling us to point to a future in which the idea of liberty rises above all the ideologies that seek to kill the human spirit .
Der von Microsoft und Intel auf der CeBIT vorgestellte Ultra Mobile PC , der unter dem Codenamen " Origami " geführt wurde , ist vom Marktforschungsunternehmen Gartner mit Skepsis aufgenommen worden .
Obwohl es sich grundsätzlich um eine vielversprechende Geräte - Kategorie handele , werde der Ultra Mobile PC in seiner heutigen Form zunächst keinen breiten Erfolg haben , urteilten Gartner - Experten in einer Analyse .
Die kurze Laufzeit der Batterien , der hohe Preis und ein anderes Betriebssystem als das kommende Windows Vista würden wahrscheinlich der Akzeptanz auf dem Markt beim Start schaden ; dies könne auch die späteren Erfolgssaussichten verschlechtern .
Für einen Durchbruch müssten unter anderem die Batterielaufzeit bei acht Stunden und der Preis unter 400 Dollar liegen , prognostizierten die Gartner - Analysten .
Beides sei mindestens zwei Jahre entfernt .
Außerdem müsse statt der aktuellen für so genannte Tablet - PCs optimierten Version von Windows XP eine spezielle Vista - Variante zum Einsatz kommen .
Auf lange Sicht habe der neue Typ aber durchaus eine Chance als Lifestyle - Gerät .
Microsoft hatte die neue kleine Geräteklasse mit weniger als einem Kilogramm Gewicht und einem berührungsempfindlichen Display mit knapp 18 Zentimetern Diagonale auf der Computermesse CeBIT in Hannover präsentiert .
Geräte mehrerer Hersteller sollen im zweiten Quartal zu einem Preis um 1000 Euro in den Handel kommen .

The discussion generated by the original HOLY SHIT LIST has been far more interesting than the first post .
Of particular obvious note , people ’s lists varied based on their relative age .
GO FIGURE .
Whereas one person found Doom to be of particular significance , another would point at Ultima Online as being the seminal gaming event in their life .
What is interesting to me is n’t that the lists are different based on a person ’s age , it ’s how a HOLY SHIT such as Doom becomes assumed or maybe perceived as irrelevant because it occurred outside the scope of a person ’s life .
Your HOLY SHIT list is a lot like your Amazon wish list .
It is an indirect way of explaining who you are relative to what you care or cared about WITH LESS 1 - CLICK OFFERINGS .
o o o
The second pass on my list :
Macintosh :
One rule about anything on this list is that you must distinctly remember the moment when you first saw the thing in question .
The Mac is easy , I was a punk kid who liked to get my jollies walking to computer stores and writing dumb programs in Basic on Apple ] [s .
10 PRINT “ BALLS ” ;
20 GOTO 10
One day I went into the shop and there was a Mac sitting there in the middle of the store .
No one was using it .
I walked up and stared at the mouse …
WHAT THE HELL .
A quick nudge of the mouse and there was the HOLY SHIT .
Two dimensional control over the desktop .
MacPaint was open .
I clicked on a circle , selected one of the horrible fills on the original Mac , and clicked ’n’dragged my first circle .
HOLY SHIT .
I do n’t remember the tiny little screen , I do n’t remember the lack of applications , and I certainly do n’t remember the price tag .
What I remember was that my IBM PC felt like a clumsy piece of junk and I did n’t come close to forgetting that feeling until Windows 95 .
Windows 95 : The years between the arrival of the Mac and Windows 95 were painful ones .
As my community of friends were PC users ( including the Dad ) , we were constantly engaged in a useless conversation about when the PC was going to catch - up with the Mac user interface .
We deluded ourselves into thinking that Windows / 386 was actually useful , but we mostly used it because Ami Pro was the only decent graphical word processor out there .
We praised the day that Windows 3.0 showed up , but were mostly just happy that we no longer had to stare at Windows / 386 .
I was working at Borland the day I first installed a beta of Windows 95 .
I ’d read rumors they ’d made progress on the user interface , but when I finished the EIGHT DISK INSTALL I arrived at the HOLY SHIT .
No longer was I trapped in the program manager , no longer was I forced to stare at a horribly conceived user interface …
Finally , Windows was an operating system that outwardly appeared to slightly care about the user experience .
As I ’ve been writing this , I ’ve been wrangling with whether or not to leave Windows 95 on the list .
As I compare its impact relative to the other items on the list , it feels like a second class citizen because , face it , it was an operating system simply trying to keep up with the Macintosh experience .
“ Me too ” products probably do n’t belong in my HOLY SHIT experience .
Telnet :
This should really read “ Unix ” , but as I ’m a Windows dork , I ’m going to leave it as telnet .
In college , we needed to submit our programs via shell accounts on University servers where they ’d be compiled and graded .
During this process , I quickly learned there was a bevy of programs on these servers .
It was here I was introduced to various multi-player games as well as the wonders of VI .
A friend mentioned I should telnet to another server to check out a MUD and he might as well have been speaking Swahili .
Obediently , I typed telnet some .
other .server.com , logged in , leaned over to my friend and said , “ What ’s the big deal ? ”
“ You ’re on that server . ”
“ And ? ”
“ And it ’s in the U.K . ”
I stared at the screen , typed return a few times , and then the HOLY SHIT that would become the Internet dawned on me .
Mosaic / Netscape Navigator 3.0 : Many years after my telnet epiphany , a co-worker at Borland dropped my desk .
He said , “ Hey , you want to get on the web ? ” Again , sensing that I was missing something crucial , I nodded my head and he went to work on my network preferences .
A few minutes later , Mosaic was on my desktop .
He pointed me at his personal site , smiled , and said “ Oh , and you can order pizza , too . ”
I do n’t remember what sites I traveled to in that first day , but I ’m guessing it was the primal Netscape site along with SGI ’s which was viewed as cutting edge at the time .
The HOLY SHIT was of a similar nature to the TELNET HOLY SHIT in that the technology suddenly , violently made the world feel overwhelmingly accessible .
Netscape 2.0 gets honorable mention here because of the sheer amount of paradigm shift it packed into a single release .
Frames , Java , and Javascript .
Now , I ’ve learned to hate frames in my later years … but at the time the combination of the three was a clear signal that it was n’t a browser … it was an application framework .
Napster : Atandt gets props for pointing me at Napster many years back .
I was searching for an MP3 on the Net and was growing increasingly frustrated with the distinct lack of an organizational system to easily find what I needed .
“ Try Napster ”
“ Napwho ? ”
A quick search pointed me at an innocuous little site .
I downloaded and installed the program , typed in my query , and sixty copies of the song I was looking for showed up in the list .
HOW IN THE ?
Knowing nothing about peer - to - peer file sharing , I spent the morning figuring out the technical details of P2P while downloading my first gigabyte of music .
I called everyone in my family that night .
I stumbled over my words as I tried to explain that YOU COULD GET ANY MUSIC YOU WANTED INSIDE OF FIVE MINUTES .
YES , ANY MUSIC .
DON ’T BELIEVE ME ?
TRY ME .
EBay : I was way late on EBay .
Sure , I got the basic idea , but the only way to truly experience a HOLY SHIT is from personal experience and I waited a good many months before I dove into EBay to find it was the Napster of Random Crap You Could Buy .
My HOLY SHIT was at Thanksgiving several years back .
I knew EBay was stocked with stuff , but I had n’t tested it .
I asked everyone at the dinner table to think of an antique or hard - to - find item and write it down .
I took the list of ten items to EBAY and searched for antique Jane Austin books , random electrical engineering gadgets , some type of strange microscope I ’d never heard of , and the rest which I ’ve since forgotten .
EBay had multiple listings for every item .
I printed them out , brought them to the table , and HOLY SHITTED my way through turkey and mashed potatoes .
EBay is a HOLY SHIT which keeps on giving because I later discovered that it not only represents a great place to buy , but it ’s also a place to sell .
Being gadget oriented , I ’ve spent thousands of dollars on Palms , routers , and other useless crap that I use for three months before I throw it in a box to rot in favor of next version .
While it ’s not painfully convenient , EBay allows me to recoup at least some of the countless discretionary dollars I ’ve thrown out the window .
Doom : Probably my favorite HOLY SHIT because I like to think I saw it coming .
Set the way back machine for the early 80s .
A friend and I had just spent hours playing some low resolution dungeon game .
By low resolution , I mean that the dragon was a single green square .
A troll was a single purple square .
Yes , this was the peak of entertainment in the early 80s .
That and the Dukes of Hazzard .
In our post - game - haze , we dreamt of new version of the game .
You were literally walking down a hallway with a first person perspective , picking up gold , battling creatures building from more than a single pixel .
It was this moment that I remember when I friend showed me Doom .
He moved the mouse left and the character looked left , right … right … and up … well , he looked up , too .
( Incidentally , UP is the reason I ’m not listing Castle Wolfenstein … I do n’t remember being able to look up and , for some strange personal reason , up made all the difference in Doom ) .
o o o
The beauty of the HOLY SHIT list is that it represents truth .
An honest HOLY SHIT is one which completely penetrates the PR , the BUZZ , the marketing .
It ’s the moment when you clearly see the value of a technology and how it will permanently alter your world .
India as ' Global Power '
I. The Reality of India , the New ' Global Power ' India is , of course , not a great or global power .
That it is necessary to state this obvious fact is a testament to the power of public indoctrination .
Let us recall some obvious facts .
There is a yawning gap between India and the developed world .
According to the World Bank , India 's Gross National Product ( GNP ) in 2003 was $ 568 billion , compared to the US's $ 10.95 trillion .
India , with 17 per cent of the world 's population , accounts for less than 1.7 per cent of the world 's income .
Thus India 's per capita GNP was $ 530 , compared to the US 's nearly $ 38,000 .
Even South Korea 's per capita GNP was over $ 12,000 .
India 's situation is slightly better in terms of ' Purchasing Power Parity ' ( PPP ) 3 , but even India 's PPP per capita income is ranked 84th in the world .
For all the rosy projections of rapid growth by India and other Asian countries by 2020 , the US 's National Intelligence Council admits that " per capita income in most ( Asian ) countries will not compare to those of Western nations . "
Human underdevelopment
The situation is far worse in terms of ' human development ' .
In the UN's Human Development Index , which claims to be a composite of various factors such as health , education , and income , India ranks 127th among 175 countries .
India 's under - five mortality rate per 1,000 live births is 93 , that is , one in eleven children dies before the age of five .
Its maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births is 540 , compared to 56 for China and 380 for even Bangladesh .
No doubt , we are constantly told that poverty in India is declining , and a great industry has sprung up of academic treatises to show how fast poverty is declining .
However , these treatises have reduced poverty by defining the term so that it no longer relates to whether or not people get their minimum requirements of calories .
The official National Sample Survey of 2000 revealed that three - fourths of India 's rural population and half the urban population did not get the minimum recommended calories .
This is confirmed by nutritional and health surveys , which reveal the following : more than two - fifths of the adult population suffer from chronic energy deficiency , and a large percentage are at the border of this condition ; half India 's women are anemic ; half its children can be clinically defined as malnourished ( stunted , wasting , or both ) .
( See Aspects no.s 36 & 37 )
As one writer puts it , " There is already a sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) within India – half of our rural population or over 350 million people are below the average food energy intake of SSA countries . "
4
At any rate , any honest economist should have been struck by one glaring contradiction in this official finding of declining poverty .
Poverty as such is not directly observed : the National Sample Survey ( NSS ) gathers responses to a questionnaire regarding consumption , and the poverty estimates are then derived ( after making various assumptions ) from this data .
But the same NSS directly observes that employment growth plummeted between the last two surveys ( 1993 - 94 and 1999 - 2000 ) .
( See Aspects no.s 36 & 37 ) Now , it is virtually impossible for poverty to have declined if unemployment grew sharply , and the methodology of any study that claims poverty has fallen should be questioned .
No doubt , one sector of the country 's economy has seen breakneck growth in the past decade : the provision of software services and business process outsourcing services to foreign ( principally US ) firms .
However , that sector accounts for 0.25 per cent of the labour force .
Where are the rest ?
Nearly half of India 's total working - age population ( 15 - 59 years of age ) is unemployed , most of it not even counted as part of the labour force .
5
While agriculture continues to employ the majority of those considered employed , it accounts for less than a quarter of the national income , and that share continues to shrink .
No industrial transformation
Conventionally , national income is divided into three sectors , agriculture , industry and services .
At various times in the past , all the countries in the developed world passed from being predominantly agricultural economies ( in terms of the share of agriculture in national income and in employment ) to being predominantly industrial economies .
It was only after industry had brought these entire economies ( including their agriculture ) under its sway , commodities became vastly more plentiful than in the past , and the economic surplus grew massively , that these economies could sustain growth in the share of services .
Today , industry accounts for the largest share of GDP in the economies of China , South Korea , Taiwan , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Thailand , as much as 51 per cent in the case of China .
In India 's case , however , the share of industry is low -- just 26.4 per cent in 2001.6
Industry has never been the dominant sector of the Indian economy .
Moreover , its share of GDP has not been increasing , but is stagnant or shrinking .
And Indian industry 's share of employment is just 17.6 per cent .
Indeed , in the two commodity - producing sectors – agriculture and industry – one cannot find any miraculous takeoff in growth during the period of ' reform ' .
See Chart 1 and Chart 2 , based on data from RBI , Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy , 2004 - 05 )
The average rate of growth of agricultural production during the past decade ( 1995 - 96 to 2004 - 05 ) is just 0.6 per cent per year7 , which means production fell sharply in per capita terms .
The growth rate of industrial production during the decade 1995 - 96 to 2004 - 05 was only marginally higher than during the 1980s .
8 The last two years ( 2003 - 04 and 2004 - 05 ) have no doubt seen high rates of industrial growth ; this has continued into the current year .
But one should beware of drawing sweeping conclusions on the basis of two or even three years ' figures .
And while the services sector has led growth over the past two decades , so that it now accounts for 57 per cent of GDP , much of the services sector ( eg growth of police and armed forces , the explosion of financial sector and real estate activity ) has no tangible benefit for the people at large .
( See Aspects no.s 36 & 37 ) Finally , the rate of investment in the economy ( excluding errors and omissions ) was 23 per cent in 2003 - 04 , and 22.9 per cent for the five - year period ending 2003 - 04 .
This is lower than the rate in the last pre-reform year of 1990 - 91 .
No doubt , there has been an investment boom during 2004 - 05 , which has continued during 2005 - 06 .
Nevertheless , the rate of investment will remain far below that required for the GDP growth rates being talked of by the Government ( 8 - 10 per cent ) .
It is true that certain Indian firms ( or Indian units of foreign firms ) have attained ' world standards ' in quality of output , and with their lower labour costs may become highly competitive exporters .
Glowing press reports of such units convey the sense that the Indian economy has undergone a ' take - off ' .
However , these firms are generally dependent on imported capital goods and are strongly linked to export markets ; they have few linkages to the rest of the Indian economy .
They remain islands in the large sea of underdeveloped India .
Contrast this with the transformation of the economy that would take place with the rapid development of industries catering to domestic demand for items of mass consumption .
That would create demand for raw materials and indigenous capital goods , in the entire process generating huge employment and promoting indigenous technological know - how .
At any rate , India accounts for less than one per cent of world exports .
' High technology ' goods constitute just five per cent of its exports .
9
Moreover , India 's import bill currently is growing much faster than its export receipts : thus India 's trade deficit rose from $ 15.4 billion in 2003 - 04 to $ 38.1 billion in 2004 - 05 , and is running during just the first quarter of 2005 - 06 at nearly $ 16 billion .
The sharpest increases in the import bill are not on account of higher oil prices , or imports of machinery ; they are on account of imports of gold and electronic goods .
In consumption , no doubt , India 's elite sections rival their counterparts anywhere in the world .
In the press , India 's rapidly growing oil imports ( and India 's high - profile efforts to secure long - term oil and gas supplies from abroad ) are being held up as a sign of its rapid economic growth .
This is ridiculous .
It actually is a sign of the absence of national planning .
Much of the growth in oil consumption is on account of the great boom in private automobiles .
This is in turn the result of the failure of public transport , growing income inequalities , and the massive expansion of cheap credit for car purchases .
Moreover , rapid growth of oil imports signifies not the growing strength but the growing vulnerability of the Indian economy .
Genuine national planning would have ensured instead ( i ) restraint on consumption ( through the expansion of railways for goods and passenger transport , expansion of public transport in cities , and a variety of energy conservation investments ) , and ( ii ) a programme of investment to develop and use the country 's oil , gas and plentiful coal resources effectively and economically .
A combination of such measures could have greatly reduced the country 's dependence on oil imports .
Instead , the share of oil in India 's energy is growing , and the share of imports in its total oil consumption is on course to reach 90 per cent or more in some years .
As competition for the world 's oil and gas resources heightens , the Indian economy will pay a heavy cost for these choices .
In the last few years , large foreign capital inflows and the booming foreign exchange earnings of the IT sector have resulted in the rapid growth of the country 's foreign exchange reserves .
As a result , the Government has liberalised foreign investment by Indian firms .
Thus a number of Indian firms have been investing abroad , in many cases acquiring foreign firms .
This phenomenon has generated considerable excitement in the business press , which point to it as further evidence of India 's new global status : now , they claim , Indian firms too are multinational corporations .
Indeed , for two years , 2003 - 04 and 2004 - 05 , India ran a current account surplus , which means that it was a net capital exporter .
This was even celebrated by some commentators as a matter of pride .
Such investments may make business sense for the firms which are making them ; but in general they run contrary to the requirements of national economic development .
10 India is not a capital - surplus economy , but an underdeveloped , capital - starved one , with large resources lying idle for lack of investment .
It makes no economic sense to export capital from such a country .
Indian capitalists may earn financial returns from their investments abroad , but such returns will give paltry stimulus to the Indian economy , whereas investment in manufacturing within the country stimulates demand , productive activity and employment in a number of sectors , with far - reaching benefits for the whole economy .
' Knowledge economy ' ?
As part of the propaganda about India 's ' emerging ' as a ' global power ' , we are told ad nauseam that India is a ' knowledge economy ' , an ' information technology ( IT ) superpower ' , and the like .
The truth is that adult literacy in India is just 61 per cent ; on this score , it ranks 146th out of 177 countries in the UN's Human Development Index ( that is , many countries with much lower per capita income had much higher literacy levels than India – for example , much of desperately poor sub-Saharan Africa ) .
In recent years , on the recommendation of the World Bank , the Indian government has focussed its meagre education expenditures increasingly on primary education , largely abandoning secondary and higher education ( as if they were a luxury ) .
Yet official data tell us that 42 per cent of children enrolled drop out before completing primary education ( I - V ) Another 19 per cent , according to official data , drop out before completing upper primary education ( VI - VIII ) .
These data in fact understate the problem .
Survey - based data , which are more reliable , put the figure of drop - outs at the primary level at around 50 per centnt .
11 And according to Census data , 43.5 per cent of the children between the ages of five and nine are not in school .
12 Moreover , the quality of education imparted in government schools is so dismal that " half the children in Class IV in government schools in Mumbai cannot do the arithmetic calculations required of a Class I student .
When put to the test , 18 per cent of students attending Classes II to V in Andhra Pradesh could n't do single - digit additions while only 12 per cent managed single - digit subtractions .
In a spot - the - object quiz , only 54 per cent got the results right . " .
13 Higher education , which the Government has increasingly abandoned to a rapacious private sector , is out of the reach of all but a small section .
At any rate , the infrastructure and staff of many of the new private institutions are appalling , and thus the degrees imparted to a large percentage of graduates may not be worth the paper they are printed on .
Trivial research and development expenditures
No doubt , given India 's large population , even the tiny percentage completing higher education translates into about 2.5 million persons per year , a substantial manpower base for the IT and BPO industries catering to foreign demand .
But is even this enclave really an important centre of ' knowledge ' ?
Is India a power in the field of research ?
According to the official publication Research and Development Statistics ( 2000 - 01 , the latest edition ) , India 's expenditure on R & D has been falling as a share of GDP , from 0.91 per cent in 1987 to 0.81 per cent in 1998 .
Let us look more closely at this ' R & D ' expenditure .
First , the Indian private sector does not account for much of it .
According to official figures , eighty per cent of R & D expenditure was carried out by the Government .
This was largely not for productive purposes , but for military purposes : 32 per cent on direct military research , 21 per cent on space research ( much of which actually serves the missile programme ) and 12 per cent on atomic energy ( much of which actually serves the nuclear weapons programme ) .
Even allowing for some genuine space and atomic energy expenditures , at least half of R & D expenditure in India appears to be for military purposes .
Yet despite this ample funding , the showpieces of defence R & D – the Main Battle Tank project ( started in 1974 ) and the Light Combat Aircraft project ( started in 1983 ) – have yet not been completed , and , after the expenditure of billions of rupees each , the chances of their actually being inducted into the armed forces are dwindling .
For example , the air force is now in the international market for a mammoth order of 126 fighter planes , at a cost of over $ 6 billion .
It is unlikely that the private sector accounted for even 20 per cent of R & D expenditure .
The latest RBI survey of the private corporate sector14 shows that their R & D expenditures in 2003 - 04 account for just 0.3 per cent of sales .
By contrast , these firms spent much more on advertising and promotion ( 2.1 per cent of sales ) – a clear indication of how low R & D figures in their priorities .
Capital goods imports were , at 1.9 per cent of sales , over six times R & D expenditure .
The figure for these firms ' foreign technology payments is not given separately , but it is likely to be much larger than the figure for their R & D ; whereas , to absorb foreign technology properly ( in such a fashion that one can further develop it ) , R & D expenditures need to be multiples of technology payments .
And finally , much of what passes under the name of R & D in Indian industry is merely classified so for tax saving purposes , and actually consists of adaptation of products to local conditions , or even merely quality control .
By conventional measures of scientific output , India 's performance is dismal .
15
The standard database in this regard is the US - based Science Citation Index ( SCI ) .
In 1980 , around 40 Indian journals were indexed in the SCI ; this figure has fallen to 10 , or just 0.3 per cent of all SCI - indexed journals .
In 1980 , nearly 15,000 scientific papers from India were indexed in the SCI ; this figure fell over the next two decades to just over 12,000 ( China 's figure grew from under 1,000 to over 22,000 during the same period ) .
India 's share of the world 's total research papers published in SCI - indexed journals was just 1.79 per cent in 2002 .
Finally , India 's world ranking in the SCI 's citation impact ( the number of times a paper is cited by others ) has fallen to an abysmal 119 out of 149 countries listed .
16

The IT sector
India 's much - vaunted Information Technology ( IT ) sector is composed of two parts : the software sector , and the IT - enabled sector ( ITES ) .
In both cases , work that was earlier done in the developed world , particularly the US , has been ' outsourced ' , or contracted out , to locations in India .
In the case of the ITES , the activities outsourced include call centres , medical transcription , data entry , ticket - reconciliation , claims processing , credit card administration , and such other routine office work as can be performed at remote locations .
While this work requires knowledge of English , it does not require superior education or skills .
Indeed , some of it is so mechanical and repetitive that it is in danger of being eliminated : " Optical - character - recognition software is automating the work of Indian data - entry workers .
Electronic airline tickets are eliminating some of the ticket - reconciliation work airlines carry out in India .
Eventually , natural - language speech recognition is likely to automate some of the call - centre work that is currently going to India , says Steve Rolls , the heir apparent at Convergys , the world 's largest call - centre operator .
" 17 Other countries too are entering the same business , particularly those once colonised by an English - speaking country : the call - centre business is booming in the Philippines .
This is clearly not high - technology or knowledge - based work ; new information - and - communications technology has merely made it possible to carry out such work at remote locations .
The sole reason for outsourcing such work is that wages for it in India are a fraction of those in the developed world ( according to Deloitte Research , one - tenth ) , yielding massive savings to US and UK corporations .
The jobs threatened in those countries are primarily ones that already pay low wages because they require low skills ; by outsourcing to India , firms are able to drive their costs even lower .
Given that the sole basis on which India is competing is wages , it will lose its competitive edge if wages in India rise , or if even poorer countries join the game .
Indian ITES chiefs are thus anxious to ensure that the production of ' cyber - coolies ' in India is adequate to maintain an excess supply of labour power :
The biggest supply may be of BPO ( business - process outsourcing ) workers who do not need to use the telephone much : claims processors , credit - card administrators , health - insurance workers and so on .
Indian universities churn out 2.5 million graduates a year .
Perhaps a quarter to half of these have the right skills to do this sort of BPO work , says NASSCOM 's president , Kiran Karnik .
To improve that ratio , he is working with India 's University Grants Commission to have three - year degree courses supplemented by one - year technical certificates in IT or American accounting standards .
18
Thus university education in India is to be tailored to providing labour supply for the requirements of American and British corporations ' low - value work .
As a recent study by the V.V. Giri National Labour Institute has pointed out , the call centre industry " leads to a wastage of human resources and de-skilling of workers " which will have a high impact on Indian industry in the long - term .
A small but increasing amount of higher - value work as well is being outsourced to India , for example , animation and web design , legal services , R & D work , and in future even sophisticated financial services ( such as administering speculative funds ) .
But in all these cases , India is not competing on the basis of the superior quality of services or any technological innovation , but solely in wage costs .
The same applies for the software sector .
It is true that India 's annual production of IT engineers is larger than that of the US .
However , Indian engineers are employed in relatively low - value work : as Business Week ( 1/3/04 ) points out , " So far , the less - creative software jobs are the ones being moved offshore : bug - fixing , updating antiquated code , and routine programming tasks that require many hands . "
The magazine depicts a ' software pyramid ' , with a few thousand ' architects ' at the top , followed at successive levels of skill and pay by researchers , consultants , project managers , business analysts , and finally basic programmers .
This last category are " The foot soldiers in the information economy , they write code for applications and update and test them " .
It is a part of this lowest category that has been ' offshored ' , much of it to India .
Indeed , a large proportion of India 's software exports are still accounted for by ' body - shopping ' , whereby Indian firms supply software workers to US firms to do their work onsite in the US itself , at a much lower cost than if US citizens were hired .
19 Indian software firms manage applications of programmes owned by multinational software giants ; but Indian firms produce virtually no proprietorial software , that is , copyrighted programmes which are sold to a large number of customers , and earn a continuing stream of revenue ( what Microsoft earns its money from ) .
Rather , both the hardware and the software they use are imported .
Thus the present prime minister pleaded on his recent visit to the US for sympathetic treatment : American investments in India , especially in new technology areas , will help American companies to reduce costs and become more competitive globally .
Equally , India 's earnings from these investments will lead to increased purchases from the US .
The information technology revolution is built primarily on US computer - related technology and hardware .
( 20/7/05 ) India is thus not a ' knowledge economy ' but a low - wage economy , distinguished from other such by its colonial heritage , English .
It does not command increased international status by virtue of its economic strength ; rather , the publicity about its ' emergence ' as a ' power ' is an outcome of conscious US policy .
Let us look first at why the Indian ruling class is so anxious to be anointed a ' global power ' , and then at why the US is interested in anointing it so .
Notes :
3. ' PPP ' :
Whereas the exchange rate is Rs 45 = $ 1 , Rs 45 in India can purchase more goods and services than $ 1 can in the US .
Thus , it is claimed , India 's national income expressed in US dollar terms understates its real value as compared to , say , the real value of the US national income .
By estimating how much various currencies can purchase of a certain mix of comparable goods and services , the Purchasing Power Parity measure claims to better capture the actual national income .

No doubt , there can be different frames of reference to assess a nation 's scientific and technological performance ; properly speaking , it should be assessed in terms of its relevance to the nation 's specific problems and stage of economic development .
Yet those who claim that India is a ' knowledge economy ' and a ' research powerhouse ' are referring to conventional notions of scientific and technological advancement , which can be measured quantitatively .

The NY Times recently published an article which intimated in no uncertain terms that to do a successful technology start up you need to be in Silicon Valley : It ’s Not the People You Know .
It ’s Where You Are .
Rather topical , given the debate downunder as a result of the Bulletin article on Web 2.0 entrepreneurs leaving Australia for the Valley .
My take on this perennial debate is :
It ’s Not Where You Are .
It ’s the People You Know .
Both New York VC , Fred Wilson , and Fred from We Break Stuff strongly agree .
The best view on this though comes from Erik Schwartz :
I lived and worked in Silicon Valley for 14 years .
I ’ve worked for :
- Big overfunded startups in the valley
- Little underfunded startups in the valley
- Big companies in the valley
- Little companies in the valley that became big while I was there
Now I ’m doing a new start up , that is not in the valley .
If an entrepreneur has never worked in the valley , then I think it would behoove that entrepreneur to very seriously consider founding a company there .
SiliValley has a community that is very valuable to the entrepreneur .
But I ’m already a member of that community .
I have all of those contacts and relationships .
I communicate with that community every day via email , phone and blogs .
There is also a lot to be said for NOT founding your company in the valley .
There is a serious “ valley myopia ” , particularly in regards to understanding mainstream customers for consumer products .
This leads to a lot of people blowing smoke up their own asses ( see Bubble 1.0 ) .
Infrastructure ( office space , services , cost of living ) are as expensive in the valley as they are in Manhattan .
Traffic sucks and the public transit system is a joke .
The answer as I see it is that it is essential to have a Silicon Valley network and mindset , where you base yourself is irrelevant so long as you have good infrastructure ( broadband , etc ) .
That said , the Valley sure is a blast and I love getting my fix ( at least once a day :) .
I ’ll give the last word to Nik Cubrilovic , who is currently living the Valley dream :
Or you get the best of both worlds , like what we have done at Omnidrive .
We keep a really thin presence in the valley and have all core engineering back in Australia and in our office in India .
I split my time between the valley and Australia and take the best parts out of both ( eg. fundraising , partnerships and BD , legal advice , advisors in the valley – engineers , larger office space , support , etc. in Australia and India ) .
I do n’t see why more companies do n’t do this – being in the valley does n’t mean that you need 20 people here and a huge office – you can suck up the best parts of being here .
I also know some companies that have a split between the valley and some other part of the USA – and it works well .
Do n’t think that you need to relocate everything to take advantage of the valley .
Ben : Coming from Australia , I had no problems registering a company , opening a bank account , getting legal representation and raising money within the first 7 days .
Also my personal situation has been sorted out where I can get a phone , rent a car , have a credit card etc. and that did n’t take long either .
If you need some tips shoot me an email on nik at omnidrive.com
I have worked in 10 countries on 4 continents and the valley is by far the best place to either start or do business – this whole damn place is built around and geared towards tech startups
Living here though , is something else all together 🙂

Have you ever heard of a German military leader who celebrated , even rewarded laziness ?
What a preposterous question , you must be thinking .
Given the overwhelming industriousness of the entire Germanic population since the beginning of time , it seems impossible there could be such a leader .
Yet , there was .
He is an anomaly , to be sure , but he definitely existed .
And he was important .
He was General Helmuth von Moltke who served as chief of the German General Staff from 1858 to 1888 .
Under his leadership the German military became the model for all modern armies .
General von Moltke divided the entire officer corps into four distinct types , depending on their mental and physical characteristics : 1 ) mentally dull and physically lazy , 2 ) mentally bright and physically energetic , 3 ) mentally dull and physically energetic , and 4 ) bright and lazy .
The officers who were both mentally dull and physically lazy were given simple , repetitive , unchallenging tasks .
The officers who were both mentally bright and physically energetic , Von Moltke felt were obsessed with micromanagement and accordingly would be poor leaders .
Therefore , he never promoted this type of officer to the status of commanding officer of the German General Staff .
The officers who were mentally dull but physically energetic , Von Moltke considered dangerous .
To him , they were walking , talking mistake generators that required constant supervision .
Because they created messes faster than could be fixed , these officers were too much trouble and were dismissed .
The mentally bright yet physically lazy officer , our hero , is the type of person Von Moltke felt should ascend to the lofty heights of ultimate command .
Why ?
Because he is smart enough to see what needs to be done but is also motivated by laziness to find the easiest , simplest way to succeed .
And , of course , such an officer would never sully his hands with details , vastly preferring to delegate those concerns to the eager beaver types .

UPDATE : Foley 's " instant message " communications with yet another underage boy , circa 2003 , have now been posted by ABC .
They are horrendous .
I cannot believe that Denny Hastert knew about Foley using the Net to chat - up underage boys a year ago and DID NOTHING ( you 'll recall that the email conversations we posted earlier were around the time of Hurricane Katrina last year ) .
Tell me why Denny Hastert should n't be forced to immediately resign .
They left your kids with this man AFTER they knew what he was doing .
They let him stay in the GOP leadership .
They let him remain the chair of the child sex offender caucus .
Jesus Christ .
From ABC
News :
Does House Republican leader Denny Hastert have a soft spot for child sex offenders ?
Seems so .
Republican House Speaker Denny Hastert has some serious explaining to do , after today 's revelations that they knew about ex-Congressman Mark Foley 's sexscapades a good year ago , and did nothing .
Whether or not the kid 's parents were fine with letting it go , which the story says is the case , why did Republican House Speaker Denny Hastert permit Foley to remain in the House GOP leadership for almost a year after they knew he was having sex talk with minors online , minors he met on the job ?
Why did Republican House Speaker Denny Hastert leave Foley as the co-chair of the House body in charge of child sex offenses for a good year after they knew ?
Why did Republican House Speaker Denny Hastert permit Foley to stay in the House at all , where he would be around other pages every day all day long ?
And just as importantly , why did Republican House Speaker Denny Hastert let Foley lie publicly yesterday about the emails , claiming they were innocent , and simply a dirty attack from the Democrats , when the House leadership knew the real story ?
And finally , we find out that the FBI was contacted two months about this story .
Was there any follow - up from the Bush FBI ?
Or did they just let this potential case of child sex offense go by the wayside because it involved a friend of Bush ?
From from the SF Chronicle :
The page worked for Rep. Rodney Alexander , R - La. , who said Friday that when he learned of the e-mail exchanges 10 to 11 months ago , he called the teen 's parents .
Alexander told the Ruston Daily Leader , " We also notified the House leadership that there might be a potential problem , " a reference to the House 's Republican leaders .
Foley was a member of the Republican leadership , serving as a deputy whip .
He also was a member of the House Ways and Means Committee .
It 's interesting that Republican Speaker Hastert 's home page says Mr. Hastert is having a community meeting about " Keeping Kids Safe in Cyberspace . "
Here 's one way :
Next time someone tells you one of your friends is soliciting sex with a minor , do something about it .
TMO Reports - Apple Laptops take 12 Percent of the Market

The MacBook and MacBook Pro are selling well enough to push Apple 's take of the U.S. portable computer market in June up to 12 percent .
During Apple 's second quarter earnings report , the company noted that its laptop marketshare was at 6 percent in January .
Peter Oppenheimer , Apple 's chief financial officer , commented " The MacBook , which we introduced in mid-May , has been extremely well received and coupled with our very popular MacBook Pro has contributed to Apple 's increased unit marketshare of portables in US retail . "
That marketshare percentage may climb even higher .
Apple says that it believes many creative professionals have been holding off purchasing a new Mac while waiting for an Intel - based desktop Mac and Universal Binary applications - Like Adobe Photoshop , InDesign , and Illustrator CS3 , which should be available next spring .
Once the applications that creative pros rely on can run natively on Intel - based Macs , MacBook Pro sales are likely to ramp up even more .
The work developers have put in to migrating their application code to Universal Binary seems to be paying off .
Apple noted that third - party developers have released over 2,900 Universal Binary applications so far .
" We expect that over 70 percent of the 500 applications we consider most critical to our customers will be available in Universal versions by the end of September , " Mr. Oppenheimer said .
Apple 's chief operating officer , Tim Cook noted that once the MacBook started shipping , there was " very robust " consumer and higher education demand .
That high demand , coupled with increasing MacBook Pro sales may give Apple even more laptop marketshare in coming quarters .
You are also entitled to a refund , but you 'll probably never get one either .
Phone customers are due $ 9 billion in tax refunds and a 3 % cut in wireless phone and long - distance bills , according to a series of federal court decisions .
But the federal government continues to collect the tax and requires so much paperwork for refunds that only big corporations are likely to benefit .
On Friday , a court in Washington , D.C. , became the third federal appeals court since May to void the tax .
Two other federal appeals courts , covering seven states , have ruled the tax unlawful , and cases are pending elsewhere in the nation 's 13 appeals courts .
In all , nine federal courts have ruled that a 3 % federal tax does n't apply to phone calls that are priced only by how long a person talks — not by how far the call travels .
That means cellular phones , Internet phone service and about one - third of long distance calls would be exempt from the tax .
The wireless industry estimates that consumers would save about $ 4.5 billion a year .
Taxpayers also would be due three years of refunds — about $ 9 billion .
The cellphone industry wants the tax removed immediately from bills and the money refunded .
" Our customers should n't be paying a tax that courts have repeatedly found illegal , " says Steve Largent , president of CTIA - The Wireless Association and a former Republican congressman ...
" It sounds absurd , but the law is written so that the government can keep collecting a tax even though it 's been ruled unlawful , " says Hank Levine , a lawyer representing businesses that challenged the tax .
Federal law makes it nearly impossible to get an injunction to stop the government from collecting a tax , he says .

PUT YOURSELF in Mike 's place .
On the morning of Feb. 20 , he buys a new radio - CD player for his 17 - year - old son Christopher 's car .
He pays the $ 114 installation charge with 57 crisp new $ 2 bills , which , when last observed , were still considered legitimate currency in the United States proper .
The $ 2 bills are Bolesta 's idea of payment , and his little comic protest , too .
For this , Mike , Baltimore County resident , innocent citizen , owner of Capital City Student Tours , finds himself under arrest .
Finds himself , in front of a store full of customers at the Best Buy on York Road in Lutherville , locked into handcuffs and leg irons .
Finds himself transported to the Baltimore County lockup in Cockeysville , where he 's handcuffed to a pole for three hours while the U.S. Secret Service is called into the case .
Have a nice day , Mike .
" Humiliating , " the 57 - year old Mike was saying now .
" I am 6 feet 5 inches tall , and I felt like 8 inches high .
To be handcuffed , to have all those people looking on , to be cuffed to a pole -- and to know you have n't done anything wrong .
And me , with a brother , Joe , who spent 33 years on the city police force .
It was humiliating . "
What we have here , besides humiliation , is a sense of caution resulting in screw - ups all around .
" When I bought the stereo player , " Mike explains , " the technician said it'd fit perfectly into my son 's dashboard .
But it did n't .
So they called back and said they had another model that would fit perfectly , and it was cheaper .
We got a $ 67 refund , which was fine .
As long as it fit , that 's all .
" So we go back and pay for it , and they tell us to go around front with our receipt and pick up the difference in the cost .
I ask about installation charges .
They said , ' No installation charge , because of the mix - up .
Our mistake , no charge . '
Swell .
" But then , the next day , I get a call at home .
They 're telling me , ' If you do n't come in and pay the installation fee , we 're calling the police . '
Jeez , where did we go from them admitting a mistake to suddenly calling the police ?
So I say , ' Fine , I 'll be in tomorrow . '
But , overnight , I 'm starting to steam a little .
It 's not the money -- it 's the threat .
So I thought , I 'll count out a few $ 2 bills . "
He has lots and lots of them .
With his Capital City Student Tours , he arranges class trips for school kids around the country traveling to large East Coast cities , including Baltimore .
He 's been doing this for the last 18 years .
He makes all the arrangements : hotels , meals , entertainment .
And it 's part of his schtick that , when Mike hands out meal money to students , he does it in $ 2 bills , which he picks up from his regular bank , Sun Trust .
" The kids do n't see that many $ 2 bills , so they think this is the greatest thing in the world , " Mike says .
" They do n't want to spend 'em .
They want to save 'em .
I 've been doing this since I started the company .
So I 'm thinking , ' I 'll stage my little comic protest .
I 'll pay the $ 114 with $ 2 bills . ' "
At Best Buy , they may have perceived the protest -- but did not sense the comic aspect of 57 $ 2 bills .
" I 'm just here to pay the bill , " Mike says he told a cashier .
" She looked at the $ 2 bills and told me , ' I do n't have to take these if I do n't want to . '
I said , ' If you do n't , I 'm leaving .
I 've tried to pay my bill twice .
You do n't want these bills , you can sue me . '
So she took the money .
Like she 's doing me a favor . "
He remembers the cashier marking each bill with a pen .
Then other store personnel began to gather , a few of them asking , " Are these real ? "
" Of course they are , " Mike said .
" They 're legal tender . "
A Best Buy manager refused comment last week .
But , according to a Baltimore County police arrest report , suspicions were roused when an employee noticed some smearing of ink .
So the cops were called in .
One officer noticed the bills ran in sequential order .
" I told them , ' I 'm a tour operator .
I 've got thousands of these bills .
I get them from my bank .
You got a problem , call the bank , ' " Mike says .
" I 'm sitting there in a chair .
The store 's full of people watching this .
All of a sudden , he 's standing me up and handcuffing me behind my back , telling me , ' We have to do this until we get it straightened out . '
" Meanwhile , everybody 's looking at me .
I 've lived here 18 years .
I 'm hoping my kids do n't walk in and see this .
And I 'm saying , ' I can't believe you 're doing this .
I 'm paying with legal American money . ' "
Mike was then taken to the county police lockup in Cockeysville , where he sat handcuffed to a pole and in leg irons while the Secret Service was called in .
" At this point , " he says , " I 'm a mass murderer . "
Finally , Secret Service agent Leigh Turner arrived , examined the bills and said they were legitimate , adding , according to the police report , " Sometimes ink on money can smear . "
This will be important news to all concerned .
For Baltimore County police , said spokesman Bill Toohey , " It 's a sign that we 're all a little nervous in the post - 9/11 world . "
The other day , one of Mike 's sons needed a few bucks .
Mike pulled out his wallet and " whipped out a couple of $ 2 bills .
But my son turned away .
He said he does n't want 'em any more . "
He 's seen where such money can lead .

A riddle was proposed on the Neal Boortz show today :
If an airplane is on a large conveyor belt and is trying to take off by exerting the thrust needed to move it forward at 100 knots , and the conveyor belt starts moving backwards at 100 knots , will the plane be able to take off , or will it just sit stationary relative to the ground , with the backwards speed of the conveyor belt counteracting the forward thrust of the plane ?
Astoundingly , Neal and the rest of his crew took the position that the plane would sit there stationary !
Good God … this man is a pilot and has a law degree !
I could understand a random high school dropout being fooled by this , but a pilot ?
Then I googled the riddle , and found a thread on Airliners .
net that has been raging on , with the vast majority of people taking Neal ’s position … that the plane would not be able to take off .
Their argument is this , to quote one poster :
Thrust acts accordingly to Newtons Third Law of Motion – every action has an equal and opposite reaction .
In the case of an aircraft , the reaction of the engines is that of forward motion , against whatever medium it is stationary .
But the ground the aircraft is sitting on in this case is NOT stationary , its providing an exactly CANCELLING force pushing the aircraft back .
The problem here , of course , is that the poster ( and Neal ) cannot disengage themselves from seeing the airplane as a car .
The difference between a car and a grounded airplane is that a car uses its wheels to propel itself forward , and an airplane moves itself forward by moving air .
They assume that the runway moving backwards would move the plane backwards .
This is what would happen with a car ( that is in gear ) , so why not for an airplane ?
Well , because an airplane ’s wheels are free rolling .
There is obviously some friction , so there would be some small backwards force , but it would be infinitely small as compared to the forward thrust of the airplane .
You can test this with a piece of paper and a matchbox car ( which has free rolling wheels like an airplane … or like a car in neutral . )
Place the paper on a table , and place the matchbox car on the paper .
Take your hand , and hold the car still with a lightly placed finger on top of the car .
At this point you are providing no forward thrust , and the “ conveyor belt ” is not moving .
The car remains stationary .
Now , continuing to hold the airplane with a lightly placed finger , and start to pull the paper out from under the car , in the backwards direction .
According to Neal ’s logic , the car should push back on your finger with the same force that you are exerting on the paper … but this is not what will happen .
You will find that your lightly placed finger is not stressed to any noticeable extent .
The paper will slide out , and the wheels will spin , but the car will not be propelled backwards .
The reason for this is is that the rotation of the wheels is not related to the movement of the matchbox car except by the very small friction component of the axle , which your lightly placed finger can easily control .
So now we have established that movement of the surface beneath a free wheeling object does not exert a noticeable force on the object .
Next , we ’ll see what happens when the object is trying to move forward .
Attach a string to the matchbox car .
Place the car at one end of the paper , and use the string to start pulling the car forward with a steady force .
As the car moves forward , start pulling the paper out from under the car , backwards .
Do you feel increased resistance as you pull the string ?
Of course not .
The wheels are free rolling !
Spinning the wheels does not make the object move !
When an airplane takes off , there is one major forward force … the forward thrust .
The main rearward force is air resistance .
The turning of the wheels provides a small frictional force , but because the wheels are free - rolling , this friction is very small .
Unless the wheels are locked , the friction is always going to be less than the thrust , which means that the overall force is still forward , and the plane will still move .
Gah … people are freakin’ stupid .
Update :
There is a variation on this riddle that says that the conveyor belt matches the speed of the plane .
It does n’t matter … the plane still takes off .
The conveyor belt could be going 5 times as fast as the plane , and the plane would still take off .
You ’d get into issues about tires blowing out , but assuming that the wheels can take the strain , the airplane would still take off .

Covid - 19 news : UK government criticised for confusion over new rules
Desert storms from Central Asia are leaving a trail of global destruction .
Now Beijing is drawing a line in the sand .
The Chinese call it " yellow dragon . "
Koreans , " the fifth season . "
Each spring , the dust from China 's northern deserts is swept up by the wind and whipped eastward , blasting into Beijing .
A choking blanket of particles coats houses , cars , and people , and the city 's hospitals become flooded with patients suffering from respiratory ailments .
The dust clogs machinery , shutters airports , and destroys crops , forcing thousands of rural Chinese off their lands .
Clouds of it blow throughout Asia , carrying pollution and potentially infectious disease .
In Korea , the government recently considered declaring the dust storms a natural disaster .
The furies are fed by desertification : Overgrazing , deforestation , and drought convert arid land to desert , creating a layer of mobile topsoil .
This combination of forces is expanding the Gobi desert by about 950 square miles per year - an area two - thirds the size of Rhode Island .
Now , with the dunes within 150 miles of China 's capital city , and the 2008 Olympics on the way , Beijing officials have initiated a massive campaign to attack the problem .
The plan is known as the Green Great Wall - a 2,800 - mile network of forest belts designed to stop the sands .
Chinese scientists from the Ministry of Forestry believe the trees can serve as a windbreak and halt the advancing desert .
In a recent report to the United Nations , Chinese officials predicted that the effort will " terminate expansion of new desertification caused by human factors " within a decade .
By 2050 , they claim , much of the arid land can be restored to a productive and sustainable state .
Possibly the largest proposed ecological project in history , the new Great Wall calls for planting more than 9 million acres of forest at a cost of up to $ 8 billion .
The project began last year as the fourth phase of an afforestation program launched in 1978 .
By 2010 , the green belts are expected to stretch from outer Beijing through Inner Mongolia .
To build the wall , the government has launched a two - pronged plan :
Use aerial seeding to cover wide swaths of land where the soil is less arid , and pay farmers to plant trees and shrubs in areas that require closer attention .
A $ 1.2 billion oversight system , consisting of mapping and land - surveillance databases , will be implemented .
The government has also hammered out a dust - monitoring network with Japan and Korea .
The wall itself will be made up of an outer belt - ranging from 775 to 1,765 feet wide - with a sand fence along the perimeter .
Inside , low - lying , sand - tolerant vegetation , arranged in optimized checkerboard patterns , will create an artificial ecosystem to stabilize the dunes .
A 6 - foot - wide gravel platform will hold sand down and encourage a soil crust to form .
The government has also funded research to explore the use of genetically engineered plants , chemical dune stabilization , grass strains bred in space , and even farming techniques that will allow rice to grow in sandy soil .
Can an expansive row of trees and some strategically placed grass really stave off an encroaching desert ?
It worked before .
In 1935 , overgrazing and drought caused 850 million tons of topsoil to blow off the United States ' southern Plains , leaving 4 million acres barren and creating the Dust Bowl .
To address the problem , the newly formed Soil Conservation Service introduced the Shelterbelt Project - a 100 - mile - wide strip of native trees bisecting the country from Canada to Texas .
In a few years , it helped to reduce the amount of airborne soil by 60 percent .
But in China , the question remains as to whether the area targeted by the wall is just too arid to support trees .
And even if the trees do take root , they 'll soak up massive amounts of groundwater , which could worsen the problem .
" You may improve one part of the landscape , " says Hong Jiang , a geography professor at the University of Wisconsin , " but you can't hold back the degradation . "
Ultimately , many Western scientists fear that the Green Great Wall is an expensive band - aid on a centuries - old wound .
Or worse , propaganda .
Either way , Dee Williams , a US Department of Interior anthropologist who has cataloged the failure of past anti-desertification efforts in China , argues that the country must move beyond micro- level tech fixes and embrace political solutions .
The government needs to foster positive behavior - pay farmers to reduce livestock numbers , raise water prices to encourage conservation , and temporarily relocate locals away from arid areas to allow recovery .
The last hope , says Williams , is that the choking dust will force the government to act .
" Maybe it takes a crisis to precipitate the kind of creative thinking the Chinese are capable of , " he says .
With the dust storms intensifying , the success or failure of the wall will have an effect beyond China 's backyard .
Last year , Pacific winds blew dust plumes all the way to North America , causing spectacular sunsets off San Francisco .
But in the future , the result could be far less beautiful .
Toxins picked up over Asia 's urban centers hitch a ride on dust particles , creating a global highway for air pollution .
China is hoping that the Great Green Wall will begin working some magic before that happens - and prevent an international dustup .

" Chairman Hoekstra has raised these issues with the administration to ensure that the Intelligence Committee is able to conduct its job of oversight , " Mr. Ware said .
" Intelligence officials have committed to being forthcoming with Congress , and Chairman Hoekstra is going to hold them to their word . "
Mr. Hoekstra 's blunt letter is evidence of a rift between the White House and House Republican leaders over the administration 's perceived indifference to Congressional oversight and input on intelligence matters .
Mr. Hoekstra wrote that he had shared his complaints with House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert , Republican of Illinois , and that the speaker " concurs with my concerns . "
A spokesman for Mr. Hastert declined to comment .
The letter appears to have resulted at least in part from the White House 's decision , made early in May , to name Gen. Michael V. Hayden to lead the Central Intelligence Agency , with Stephen R. Kappes as his deputy .
The letter was sent the day of General Hayden 's confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee .
Mr. Hoekstra ( pronounced HOOK - stra ) complained publicly about the choices when they were announced , but his private letter to Mr. Bush was much harsher .
He warned that the choice of Mr. Kappes , who he said was part of a group at the C.I.A. that " intentionally undermined the administration , " sends " a clear signal that the days of collaborative reform between the White House and this committee may be over . "
Mr. Hoekstra also expressed concern about the intelligence reorganization under John D. Negroponte , the first director of national intelligence , who he said was creating " a large , bureaucratic and hierarchical structure that will be less flexible and agile than our adversaries . "
Image Representative Heather A. Wilson , whom President Bush praised in June , has said she has " deep concerns " about intelligence reforms .

Mr. Hoekstra 's views on oversight appear to be shared by some other Intelligence Committee members .
" I think the executive branch has been insufficiently forthcoming on a number of important programs , " Representative Heather A. Wilson , Republican of New Mexico , said in an interview .
She would not discuss any programs on which the committee had not been briefed , but she said that in the Bush administration , " there 's a presumption that if they do n't tell anybody , a problem may get better or it will solve itself . "

WHISTLE - BLOWERS TELL TALES WHISTLE - BLOWERS TELL TALES
Speaking out : Whistle - blowers tell of cost of conscience | Ex-employee says FAA warned before 9/11 Paying the price : ' Privilege ' blocks fired translator from suing FBI | ' They treat a whistle - blower like a virus '
Ex-employee says FAA warned before 9/11 From 1995 to 2001 , Bogdan Dzakovic served as a team leader on the Federal Aviation Administration 's Red Team .
Set up by Congress to help the FAA think like terrorists , the elite squad tested airport security systems .
In the years leading up to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , Dzakovic says , the team was able to breach security about 90 % of the time , sneaking bombs and submachine guns past airport screeners .
Expensive new bomb detection machines consistently failed , he says .
The team repeatedly warned the FAA of the potential for security breaches and hijackings but was told to cover up its findings , Dzakovic says .
Eventually , the FAA began notifying airports in advance when the Red Team would be doing its undercover testing , Dzakovic says .
He and other Red Team members approached the Department of Transportation 's Office of the Inspector General , the General Accounting Office and members of Congress about the FAA 's alleged misconduct regarding the Red Team 's aviation security tests .
No one did anything , he says .
Then came 9/11 .
" Immediately ( after 9/11 ) , numerous government officials from FAA as well as other government agencies made defensive statements such as , ' How could we have known this was going to happen ? ' " Dzakovic testified later before the 9/11 Commission .
" The truth is , they did know . "
About a month after 9/11 , he filed a complaint with the Office of the Special Counsel , the government agency that investigates whistle - blower cases .
It alleged that the FAA had covered up Red Team findings .
A subsequent Department of Transportation Inspector General 's report , ordered by the OSC in response to Dzakovic 's complaint , concluded that the " Red Team program was grossly mismanaged and that the result was a serious compromise of public safety . "
After filing his complaint , Dzakovic was removed from his Red Team leadership position .
He now works for the Transportation Security Administration , which has responsibility for airport security .
His primary assignments include tasks such as hole - punching , updating agency phonebooks and " thumb - twiddling , " he says .
At least he has n't received a pay cut , he says .
He makes about $ 110,000 a year for what he describes as " entry - level idiot work . "
TSA spokesman Darrin Kayser would not comment on Dzakovic 's allegations that he was retaliated against for being a whistle - blower .
He said in an e-mail , " While TSA transitioned functions out of FAA , many employees were doing work outside of their pre-9/11 duties .
Once TSA was established , Mr. Dzakovic did find a productive position within the agency and has been a valued contributor in our efforts to provide the highest level of security in all modes of transportation . "

Kahle v. Ashcroft write - up
Here ’s a writeup I did of the Kahle v. Ashcroft argument in the style of a Wired News piece .
Unlike my last parody of Wired News , this one actually got posted on wired.com , albeit only on one of their blogs .
I hope to write a real post about this but I ’m feeling too crummy to do it today .
SAN FRANCISCO , California — Acclaimed Stanford professor Lawrence Lessig and Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle argued Monday that the changes in the Copyright Act should be subject to the scrutiny of the First Amendment .
In the case Kahle v. Gonzales , argued here at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , Brewster Kahle is arguing that he should be permitted to make “ orphaned works ” — works whose copyright holder can no longer be located — available for free on his website .
The case began after Lessig ’s loss before the Supreme Court in his previous suit , Eldred v. Ashcroft .
Lessig argued that Congress ’s perpetual extension of the copyright act violated the Constitution ’s requirement that copyright only be granted for “ limited Times ” .
The Court disagreed , saying that Congress was allowed to modify copyright law as long as it did n’t change the law ’s “ traditional contours ” .
Now Lessig is back , arguing that Congress has done just that .
For nearly two hundred years , he notes , copyright has been an “ opt - in ” system .
Authors who wanted their work to be copyrighted had to mark it with a copyright symbol , file a registration with the Copyright Office , deposit a copy with the Library of Congress , and file a renewal if they wanted to receive the full term .
All that changed with the sweeping 1976 Copyright Act , which made a work copyrighted as soon as it was “ fixed in a tangible form ” .
Under the old system , according to Lessig , 93 % of works went into the public domain before their term had expired .
Now , 0 % do .
Lessig argues that such a fundamental change — moving copyright from an opt - in to an opt - out system — constitutes a change in the law ’s “ traditional contours ” and thus , under the precedent set in Eldred , means the law must be examined by a Court to see if it violates the First Amendment .
The Government disagrees , insisting that the only “ traditional contours ” the Eldred decision refers to are the “ fair use ” provision of the copyright law , which allows for the public to make certain uses of copyrighted works , and the “ idea - expression dichotomy ” , which means that ideas cannot be directly copyrighted , only their expression .
The 1976 law did not change either of these .
The judges hearing the case asked Lessig to explain how this case differed from Eldred .
“ In Eldred the argument was about whether Congress could retrospectively extend the copyright law to keep Mickey Mouse out of the public domain , ” he explained .
“ This case is only about ‘ orphaned works ’ — works whose copyright holders can’t even be tracked down to give permission . ”
“ Unlike Disney , ” the judge added .
The Kahle case is part of a multi- pronged strategy to deal with orphaned works .
Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren ( D - CA ) has introduced a bill called the “ Public Domain Enhancement Act ” .
The idea , based on a New York Times op - ed published by Lessig shortly after his loss in Eldred , is that copyright holders will need to send $ 1 to the government after 50 years to renew their copyright .
If they do n’t send the dollar , their works will go into the public domain .
But even if they do , their name and address will be on file so others who wish to use the work will know how to contact them .
The US Copyright Office has also held hearings on the subject of “ orphaned works ” , concluding in a hundred - page report sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee that “ The orphan works problem is real . ” and “ Legislation is necessary to provide a meaningful solution to the orphan works problem as we know it today . ”
Plaintiff Brewster Kahle founded the Internet Archive after selling his company Alexa to Amazon.com in the 1990s .
The site , as Kahle often says , provides “ infinite bandwidth and infinite disk space for infinite time ” to freely - licensed works .
Kahle wants to have his website provide orphaned works , just as libraries make available out - of - print books , but under current law would have to track down the copyright holder for every work .
The same problem plagues projects like Google ’s Book Search .
Presently , Google must track down the copyright holder before making a book publicly available or face hefty fines .
But since copyright terms are now so long , this means most out - of - print books will never be available , simply because their copyright holders are so difficult to find .
The Court is expected to rule on the case sometime next year .

Thanks go out to Albino Blacksheep for referring people to this site :-) I 'd just like to note that there 's another office space soundboard that was made in 2003 .
This board was created , and released on August 11th , 2001 .
It was the first Office Space soundboard .
The Judicial Accountability Initiative Law , J.A.I.L. , is a single - issue national grassroots organization designed to end the rampant and pervasive judicial corruption in the legal system of the United States .
J.A.I.L. recognizes this can be achieved only through making the Judicial Branch of government answerable and accountable to an entity other than itself .
At this time it is n't , resulting in the judiciary 's arbitrary abuse of the doctrine of judicial immunity , leaving the People without recourse when their inherent rights are violated by judges .
" Power tends to corrupt , and absolute power corrupts absolutely .
Great men are almost always bad men . "
~ Lord Acton , in a letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton , 1887 .
The Chicago Office of Professional Standards is an example of what happens when a government entity is answerable only to itself .
This agency , which is responsible for disciplining police officers was not effective when the head of its office reported to the police superintendent .
So this was changed .
The office head now reports to the mayor and the agency has been given new subpoena powers .
The current system of disciplining judges , a system that is also answerable only to itself , is in a similar state of ineffectiveness .
Soon after the founding of our Republic the Founding Fathers realized there was insufficient check on the Judicial Branch of government :
~ Thomas Jefferson , letter to Judge Spencer Roane , September 6 , 1819 .
" The Writings of Thomas Jefferson , " edited by Andrew A. Lipscomb , vol. 15 , p. 213 ( 1904 ) .
" The constitution , on this hypothesis , is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary , which they may twist and shape into any form they please .
It should be remembered , as an axiom of eternal truth in politics , that whatever power in any government is independent , is absolute also ; in theory only , at first , while the spirit of the people is up , but in practice , as fast as that relaxes .
Independence can be trusted nowhere but with the people in mass .
They are inherently independent of all but moral law . " ~
Thomas Jefferson , letter to Judge Spencer Roane , September 6 , 1819 .
" The Writings of Thomas Jefferson , " edited by Andrew A. Lipscomb , vol. 15 , p. 213 ( 1904 ) .
In a government by the People and for the People , it is to the People that accountability must be enforced .
With the passage of J.A.I.L. accountability to the People in mass will be achieved by independent Special Grand Juries dedicated to this purpose .
These People , who are not officers of any other branch of government or members of the Bar , will be publicly drawn by lottery for limited terms .
Complaints will come before them only after every other legal remedy has been attempted .
They shall have the power to strip those judges of their protection of judicial immunity who are the subject of complaints for criminal acts , and to investigate , indict , and initiate criminal prosecution of wayward judges .
This system of special grand juries will be an irrevocable return to an era before 1960 when grand juries did have this authority .
The granting of such power to these Special Grand Juries can only be accomplished through amendment to the Constitutions of each state .
Since there is a need for these juries on the federal level there is also a provision for a federal J.A.I.L. Bill .
Since there are powerful vested interests in the status quo , and because it is human nature for men always to seek more power and against it to surrender any of it , passage of more than ineffectual cosmetic reform will require the initiative process .
J.A.I.L. is intended to prevent the following acts of judicial malfeasance :
Any deliberate violation of law
Fraud or conspiracy
Intentional violation of due process of law
Deliberate disregard of material facts
Judicial acts without jurisdiction
Blocking of a lawful conclusion of a case
Any deliberate violation of the state or federal Constitutions
Once passed , the unconstitutional doctrine of Judicial Immunity applied unconditionally will no longer shield a judge guilty of any such misconduct .
Some examples of the above misconduct J.A.I.L. addresses are ignored laws , ignored evidence , eminent domain abuse , confiscation of property without due process , probate fraud , secret dockets , falsifications of court records , misapplication of law , and other abuses .
When passed decisions in family court will be governed by law rather than the vested interests of the state .
The unconstitutional doctrine of Judicial Immunity applied unconditionally will be eliminated by instituting a fair and effective means for its removal in cases that merit it .
The need for the passage of J.A.I.L. is urgent .
Lives and finances are being ruined , properties are being lost , innocent people are going to jail , and families are being torn apart and destroyed .
Attorney Richard
Fine was in for jail for fifteen months beginning March 4 , 2009 because of his discovery of illegal payoffs by the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors to Los Angeles County Superior Court Judges as annual salary bonuses .
These payoffs began in the late 1980's .
Because of Richard Fine a hurried attempt to make these payments retroactively legal was made with the passage of California Senate Bill SBx2 - 11 .
Had J.A.I.L. been in effect since the beginning of this payoff scandal , those affected by decisions tainted by these payoffs would have had a Special Grand Jury of twenty - five independent citizens .
who represent the people in mass , to present their case before after all appeals for justice had been exhausted .
What is more , a criminal affidavit satisfying the Fourth Amendment , could be written up against all L. A. County judges and presented to the prosecutor , giving him 120 days to begin prosecution .
Upon failure to do so , this affidavit could then be presented to this Special Grand Jury for an indictment of all L. A. County Judges , and a prosecution begun by the Special Prosecutor provided for within the measure .
Upon conviction , a trial jury , not a judge , would determine the criminal sentencing for each and every judge convicted .
The passage of J.A.I.L. will provide a positive means of justice for Richard Fine and for every other judicial victim for past and present judicial transgressions .
It will make impossible the corruptive influences purchased by Los Angeles Board of Supervisors from the L. A. County Superior Court judges .

~Thomas Jefferson , " The Declaration of Independence . "
" The reality is that the United States of America , which proclaims itself the ' land of freedom , ' has the most dishonest , dangerous and crooked legal system of any developed nation .
Legal corruption is covering America like a blanket . "
As time passes these problems will only grow worse manifesting all the more the need for the passage of J.A.I.L .
" JAIL4Judges is the best hope of a practical program for restoring justice in the USA . "

With passage of J.A.I.L. , the People will finally be assured of receiving Due Process of Law in all court proceedings which will include the requirement that judges :
I think it is time to close the universities , and perhaps prosecute the professoriat under the RICO act as a corrupt and racketeering - influenced organization .
Universities these days have the moral character of electronic churches , and as little educational value .
They are an embarrassment to civilization .
I know this .
I am sitting in my office in Jocotepec , consorting with a bottle of Padre Kino red — channeling the good Padre if you will .
It is insight cheap at the price .
A few bucks a liter .
To begin with , sending a child to a university is irresponsible .
These days it costs something like a quarter of a million dollars , depending on your choice of frauds .
The more notorious of these intellectual brothels , as for example Yale , can cost more .
This money , left in the stock market for forty hears , or thirty , would yield enough to keep the possessor in comfort , with sufficient left over for vices .
If the market took a downturn , he could settle for just the vices .
In the intervening years , he ( or , most assuredly , she ) could work in a dive shop .
See ?
By sending our young to college , we are impoverishing them , and ourselves , and sentencing them to a life of slavery in some grim cubicle painted federal - wall green .
Personally , I ’d rather be chained in a trireme .
Besides , the effect of a university education can be gotten more easily by other means .
If it is thought desirable to expose the young to low propaganda , any second - hand bookstore can provide copies of Trotsky , Marcuse , Gloria Steinem , and the Washington Post .
These and a supply of Dramamine , in the space of a week , would provide eighty percent of the content of a college education .
A beer truck would finish the job .
The student would save four years which could more profitably be spent in selling drugs , or in frantic cohabitation or — wild thought — in reading , traveling , and otherwise cultivating himself .
This has been known to happen , though documentation is hard to find .
To the extent that universities actually try to teach anything , which is to say to a very limited extent , they do little more than inhibit intelligent students of inquiring mind .
And they are unnecessary :
The professor ’s role is purely disciplinary :
By threats of issuing failing grades , he insures that the student comes to class and reads certain things .
But a student who has to be forced to learn should n’t be in school in the first place .
By making a chore of what would otherwise be a pleasure , the professor instills a lifelong loathing for the material .
The truth is that universities positively discourage learning .
Think about it .
Suppose you want to learn Twain .
A fruitful approach might be to read Twain .
The man wrote to be read , not analyzed tediously and inaccurately by begowned twits .
It might help to read a life of Twain .
All of this the student could do , happily , even joyously , sitting under a tree of an afternoon .
This , I promise , is what Twain had in mind .
But no .
The student must go to a class in American Literature , and be asked by some pompous drone ,  Now , what is Twain trying to tell us in paragraph four ? 
This presumes that Twain knew less well than the professor what he was trying to say , and that he could n’t say it by himself .
No .
Not being much of a writer , the poor man needs the help of a semiliterate drab who could n’t sell a pancake recipe to Boy ’s Life .
As bad , the approach suggests that the student is too dim to see the obvious or think for himself .
He ca n’t read a book without a middleman .
He probably ends by hating Twain .
When I am dictator , anyone convicted of literary criticism will be drawn and quartered , dragged through the streets as a salutary lesson to the wise , and dropped in the public drains .
Why is the ceiling spinning ?
Maybe I ’m caught in a gravitational anomaly .
The truth is that anyone who wants to learn anything can do it better on his own .
If you want to learn to write , for example , lock yourself in a room with copies of Strunk and White , and Fowler , and a supply of Padre Kino , and a loaded shotgun .
The books will provide technique , the good Padre the inspiration , and you can use the shotgun on any tenured intrusion who offers advice .
They tend to be spindly .
A twenty - gauge should be sufficient .
Worse , these alleged academies , these dark nights of the soul encourage moral depravity .
This is not just my opinion .
It can be shown statistically .
Virtually all practitioners of I - banking , advertising , and law began by going to some university .
Go to Manhattan and visit any prestigious nest of foul attorneys engaged in circumventing the law .
Most will have attended schools in the Ivy League .
The better the school , the worse the outcome .
Any trace of principle , of contemplative wonder , will have been squeezed out of them as if they were grapes .
Perhaps once universities had something to do with the mind , the arts , with reflection , with grasping at man ’s place in a curious universe .
No longer .
Now they are a complex scam of interlocking directorates .
They employ professors , usually mediocre , to sell diplomas , usually meaningless , needed to get jobs nobody should want , for the benefit of corporations who want the equivalent of docile assembly - line workers .
See , first you learn that you have to finish twelve years of grade school and high school .
The point is not to teach you anything ; if it were , they would give you a diploma when you passed a comprehensive test , which you might do in the fifth grade .
The point is to accustom you to doing things you detest .
Then they tell you that you need four more years in college or you wo n’t be quite human and anyway starve from not getting a job .
For those of this downtrodden bunch who are utterly lacking in independence , there is graduate school .
The result is twenty years wasted when you should have been out in the world , having a life worth talking about in bars — riding motorcycles , sacking cities , lolling on Pacific beaches or hiking in the Northwest .
You learn that structure trumps performance , that existence is supposed to be dull .
It prepares you to spend years on lawsuits over somebody else ’s trademarks or simply going buzzbuzzbuzz in a wretched federal office .
Only two weeks a year do you get to do what you want to do .
This we pay for ?
What if you sent your beloved daughter to a university and they sent you back an advertising executive ?
I think we ’re having an earthquake .
When the floor stops heaving , I ’m going to send out for more Padre Kino .

At the ripe old age of 26 , after just one year of marriage , you 're not interested in sleeping with your wife .
In fact , you have reached an almost zen - like disinterest in all things carnal .
It 's amazing how you are able to transcend worldly desire and focus your energies on more important things , like football .
I , on the other hand , am so horny that I can't see straight .
We do n't even have kids to explain the problem .
What the hell is wrong with you ?
You 're young , you 're male , you have a hot young wife who wants you , and you can't even muster up a little quickie ?
Nothing works .
I kiss your neck and caress your balls while you 're reading in bed , and you pretend not to notice .
I playfully grab your ass as you walk by , you do n't acknowledge it .
I join you in the shower , and you talk groceries .
I don a short skirt and surprise you with dinner when you get home - I get a peck on the cheek and a " Thanks for dinner , wanna watch TV ? "
I try whispering sexy things in your ear .
I try going down on you , you say you 're not in the mood .
I massage your sore legs , neck , back , whatever , while you 're watching TV and you do appreciate it , but still no action for me .
You have as many excuses for not having sex as George Bush has for not leaving Iraq .
Well newsflash to husband , the American people are beginning to catch on !
Every day I watch your little beer belly grow just a bit bigger , and every day I do n't care because I am so horny that I want you anyway , and every day you roll over and go to sleep , and I masturbate my sorrows away .
I masturbate after you leave for work in the morning , while you 're in the shower , and while you 're in the other room playing video games .
My finger is developing a permanent cramp .
I am so sex - starved that I fantasize about other men , from celebrities , to the coffee shop guy , to that shy coworker who always smiles at me , to my jackass boss who thinks he is God 's gift to women .
I am so horny that I can't get my work done during the day , I am so desperately trying to get the images of fucking you , the co-worker , the boss , the celebrity , and / or anybody else with a dick out of my head .
I mean , this is ridiculous .
I keep myself in nice shape , I get cat - called on the street and hit on at work and in bars , and I can't even get laid ?!
What kind of fucked - up universe is this ?
I 'll make this simple .
You do n't have to woo me and all that crap , just a minimum of foreplay to get me wet , and let 's fuck .
Hard .
Let 's try anal .
Let 's - gasp - do it on the couch instead of the bedroom , or God forbid maybe a little oral in the parking lot .
It 's not complicated .
Or if you want theatrics , that 's great too !
I 'd love for you to tie me up - rope , handcuffs , whatever .
How about role - playing ... Mulder & Scully ?
Principal & naughty schoolgirl ?
What about costumes ?
French maid ?
Librarian ?
Fairy godmother ?
You name it , I 'll do it .
Food items are always good .
What about toys ?
Come ON .
You must have some kind of fantasy , you must not be satisfied with this anti-sex life we have now .
Are you ???
Just tell me what it is going to take , because I cannot live 50 + years like this .
I 'm not sure it is even humanly possible to go without sex for that long .
I 'm certain it 's not healthy .
I 'm writing to Santa about this .
May 30 , 2006  --
The investigation into whether U.S. Marines killed 24 unarmed civilians -- many of them women and children -- in the Iraqi city of Haditha last November has broken the heart of a congressman , who wonders whether there was an attempted cover-up .
" Eighty percent of the Iraqis want us out of there , " said Rep. John Murtha , D - Pa. , a decorated Marine veteran and prominent critic of U.S. policy in Iraq , on " Good Morning America . "
" Forty - seven percent say it 's all right to kill Americans .
Yet when we went in , they thought it was wonderful to topple Saddam Hussein .
Now we 've lost that war , and now it is time to redeploy . "
Murtha believes the United States can no longer win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people .
The first five victims in Haditha were unarmed Iraqi civilians , who were riding in a taxi near the Marine convoy soon after it was hit by an improvised explosive device , or IED , which killed a young Marine .
The five Iraqis were said to be running away when the Marines shot them , although none of the Iraqis were armed .
The Sorrow of a Marine Veteran
The Marines are believed to have entered three houses .
In the final house , they reportedly killed four adult brothers , after ordering the women in the house to leave .
Time Magazine reported that at least one of the women tried to save her child 's life by standing over her child and begging in English .
" It breaks my heart to think that Marines would do this , " Murtha said .
" Hopefully , this is an isolated incident .
But we 're supposed to be selling ideas of America , ideals of America , and we 're losing that war .
The reason we 've lost the hearts and minds [ is ] these troops are under tremendous stress .
Day after day these roadside bombs go off .
They do n't know who the enemy is .
Then they kill innocent people . "
According to various reports , anywhere from eight to 12 Marines are under investigation for the killings .
They belonged to the outfit known as Kilo Company , 3rd Battalion , 1st Marine regiment , based at California 's Camp Pendleton .
Several of the Marines under investigation had served two tours of duty in Iraq , while one had served three .
Congressional sources who were briefed by the Pentagon said that only two , three or four Marines are believed to be the shooters , and that the other Marines are believed to have looked on without doing anything .
According to some military lawyers , several of the Marines involved could be charged with murder , which is punishable by death in military courts .
In addition to the criminal investigation into what happened and who , if anybody , should be charged , the Pentagon has launched a second investigation into whether there was a cover-up .
' I Can Still Smell the Blood '
Only hours after the Iraqi civilians were killed , a second team of Marines was sent to take the bodies to a local morgue .
One of those Marines told the Los Angeles Times he is still haunted by what he saw .
" [ The victims ] ranged from little babies to adult males and females , " Lance Cpl. Ryan Briones told the paper .
" I can still smell the blood .
This left something in my head and heart . "
One of the bodies Briones said he picked up was a young girl who had been shot in the head .
Briones ' mother said he has nightmares about that .
" He goes , ' I ca n't sleep , Mom , ' " Susie Briones said .
" And he goes , ' I ca n't get her out of my ... I ca n't get her out of my head . '
I said , ' Meijo , we need to sit down and let 's pray .
Because you did n't have anything to do with that , ' "
Briones said her son called her from Iraq the day of the killings .
" He says , ' Mom , they -- you know -- something happened .
Bad , ' " she said .
" And he -- and I said , ' What happened ? '
And he goes , ' It 's , it 's -- some people might get in trouble . ' "
Allegations of a Cover -Up
Murtha said that an alleged atrocity of this caliber is something that cannot be excused .
" There 's no question in my mind about what happened here , " he said .
" There was no gunfire .
They killed four people in a taxi and then went into the rooms and killed .
I do n't know how many were involved in it , but it 's something we cannot excuse .
This is what the Marine Corps told me at the highest level .
I know there was a cover - up someplace .
They knew about this a few days afterward and there is no question that the chain of command tried to stifle the story .
I can understand why , but that does n't excuse it .
These people have to be punished . "
Murtha said high - level reports he received indicated that no one fired upon the Marines or that there was any military action against the U.S. forces after the initial explosion .
Yet the deaths were not seriously investigated until March , because an early probe was stifled within days of the incident , he said .
" I will not excuse murder , and this is what happened , " he said .
" This investigation should have been over two or three weeks afterward , and it should have been made public and people should have been held responsible for it . "
Oops :
Reuters quoted a Pentagon official , Dan Devlin , as saying , “ What we have seen is that any video game that comes out … ( al Qaeda will ) modify it and change the game for their needs . ”
The influential committee , chaired by Rep. Peter Hoekstra ( R - MI ) , watched footage of animated combat in which characters depicted as Islamic insurgents killed U.S. troops in battle .
The video began with the voice of a male narrator saying , “ I was just a boy when the infidels came to my village in Blackhawk helicopters … ”
Several GP readers immediately noticed that the voice - over was actually lifted from Team America : World Police , an outrageous 2004 satirical film produced by the creators of the popular South Park comedy series .
At about the same time , gamers involved in the online Battlefield 2 community were pointing out the video footage shown to Congress was not a mod of BF2 at all , but standard game footage from EA ’s Special Forces BF2 add - on module , a retail product widely available in the United States and elsewhere .
With Ali al - Fadhily
RAMADI – U.S. forces are resorting to collective punishment of civilians in several cities across the al - Anbar province west of Baghdad , residents and officials say .
" Ramadi , the capital of al - Anbar province , is still living with the daily terror of its people getting killed by snipers and its infrastructure being destroyed , " Ahmad , a local doctor who withheld his last name for security purposes , told IPS .
" This city has been facing the worst of the American terror and destruction for more than two years now , and the world is silent . "
Destroying infrastructure and cutting water and electricity " for days and even weeks is a routine reaction to the resistance , " he said .
" Guys of the resistance do not need water and electricity ; it ’s the families that are being harmed , and their lives which are at stake . "
Students and professors at the University of al - Anbar told IPS that their campus is under frequent attack .
" Nearly every week , we face raids by the Americans or their Iraqi colleagues , " a professor speaking on condition of anonymity told IPS .
Students said that U.S. troops occupied their school last week .
" We ’ve been under great pressure from the Americans since the very first days of their occupation of Iraq , " a student told IPS .
Such raids are being reported all over Ramadi .
" The infrastructure destruction is huge around the governorate building in downtown Ramadi , " said a 24 - year - old student who gave his name as Ali al - Ani .
" And they are destroying the market too . "
IPS reported Sept. 5 that the U.S. military was bulldozing entire blocks of buildings near the governorate to dampen resistance attacks on government offices .
Such U.S. action seems most severe in al - Anbar province , where resistance is strongest , and which has seen the highest U.S. casualties .
The city of Hit 50 mi. west of Ramadi was surrounded by U.S. troops for several days earlier this week .
Several civilians were killed and at least five were detained by U.S. forces .
Checkpoints are in place at each entrance to the city after the U.S. military lifted the cordon around it .
This has stifled movement and damaged local businesses .
" There was an attack on a U.S. convoy , and three vehicles were destroyed , " a local tribal chief who gave his name as Nawaf told IPS .
" It was n’t the civilians who did it , but they are the ones punished .
These Americans have the bad habit of cutting all of the essential services after every attack .
They said they came to liberate us , but look at the slow death they are giving us every day . "
In Haditha , a city of 75,000 on the banks of the Euphrates River in western al - Anbar , collective punishment is ongoing , residents say .
This was the site of the massacre of 24 civilians by U.S. Marines in November 2005 .
" The Americans continue to raid our houses and threaten us with more violence , " a local tribal leader who gave his name as Abu Juma ’a told IPS .
" But if they think they will make us kneel by these criminal acts , they are wrong .
If they increase the pressure , the resistance will increase the reaction .
We see this pattern repeated so often now . "
Juma ’a added , " I pray that the Americans return to their senses before they lose everything in the Iraqi fire . "
In Fallujah , local police say residents have turned against them due to the collective punishment tactics used by U.S. forces .
" The Americans started pushing us to fight the resistance despite our contracts that clearly assigned us the duties of civil protection against normal crimes such as theft and tribal quarrels , " a police lieutenant told IPS .
" Now 90 percent of the force has decided to quit rather than kill our brothers or get killed by them for the wishes of the Americans . "
At least one U.S. vehicle is reported destroyed every day in the face of mounting U.S. raids and a daily curfew .
The scene is one of destruction of the city , not rebuilding .
" Infrastructure rebuilding is just a joke that nobody laughs at , " Fayiq al - Dilaimy , an engineer in Fallujah told IPS .
He was on the rebuilding committee set up after the November 2004 U.S. - led operation that destroyed approximately 75 percent of the city .
" People of this city could rebuild their city in six months if given a real chance .
Now look at it and how sorrowful it looks under the boots of the ‘ liberators . ’ "
Many of the smaller towns have been badly hit .
" Khaldiyah [ near Fallujah ] and the area around it have faced the worst collective punishments for over two years now , " said a government official in Ramadi .
" But of course most cities in al - Anbar are being constantly punished by the Americans . "
Samarra and Dhululiyah , both north of Baghdad , have also been facing collective punishment from the U.S. military , according to residents .
" Curfews and concrete walls are permanent in both cities , which makes life impossible , " Ali al - Bazi , a lawyer who lives in Dhululiyah and works in Samarra told IPS .
" There are so many killings by American snipers .
So many families have lost loved ones trying to visit relatives or even just stepping outside of their house . "
While Baghdad is not in al - Anbar province , occupation forces have used similar tactics there .
In January 2005 , IPS reported that the military used bulldozers to level palm groves , cut electricity , destroy a fuel station , and block access roads in response to attacks from resistance fighters .
A U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad did not comment on specific cases , but told IPS that the U.S. military " does its best to protect civilians from the terrorists . "

Poll : USA doubts Iraq success , but not ready to give up
By Susan Page , USA TODAY
WASHINGTON  Most Americans do n't believe the United States will succeed in winning the war in Iraq or establishing a stable democracy there , according to a USA TODAY / CNN / Gallup Poll .
But an ambivalent public also says sending troops to Iraq was n't a mistake , a sign that most people are n't yet ready to give up on the war .
" There 's a lot of conflicting impulses here , " says Andrew Kohut , director of the non-partisan Pew Research Center .
A Pew poll last week also showed crosscurrents in attitudes toward the Iraq war .
" People are giving bleak assessments on the one hand , and on the other hand ( they 're ) saying maybe it was still the right thing to do . "
The bombings in London this month also have roiled public opinion , intensifying a not - yet - settled debate among Americans about whether the Iraq war has made the United States safer from terrorism .
Strong fears that a family member might become a victim of terrorism spiked in the survey , rising to their highest level since October 2001 , just after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington .
Meanwhile , in Baghdad , Iraqi officials continued to draft a constitution , due Aug. 15 .
Proposals to make Islam the main source of legislation in Iraq has prompted debate and opposition from groups concerned with women 's rights .
In the poll :
For the first time , a majority of Americans , 51 % , say the Bush administration deliberately misled the public about whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction — the reason Bush emphasized in making the case for invading .
The administration 's credibility on the issue has been steadily eroding since 2003 .
By 58%-37 % , a majority say the United States wo n't be able to establish a stable , democratic government in Iraq .
About one - third , 32 % , say the United States can't win the war in Iraq .
Another 21 % say the United States could win the war , but they do n't think it will .
Just 43 % predict a victory .
Still , on the question that tests fundamental attitudes toward the war — was it a mistake to send U.S. troops ? — the public 's view has rebounded .
By 53 % - 46 % , those surveyed say it was n't a mistake , the strongest support for the war since just after the Iraqi elections in January .
" I think the American people understand the importance of completing the mission , " White House press secretary Scott McClellan said when asked about the poll results .
" Success in Iraq will help transform a dangerous region . "
Will file - sharing be the savior or the slayer of the music industry ?
The industry is quite sure that it knows the answer , and it has been attempting to sue the file - sharing genie back into its bottle , with limited success .
Defenders of sharing argue that it actually benefits the music industry by exposing people to more artists .
But for a topic this controversial , file - sharing has received limited academic scrutiny .
The entire debate is in need of some good empirical evidence , which is why Norbert Michel 's recent paper in Topics in Economic Analysis & Policy is so intriguing .
Though the methodology is complex , the results are straightforward : some US music consumers " could have decreased their CD purchases ( prior to 2004 ) by about 13 percent due to Internet file sharing . "
The paper , titled " The Impact of Digital File Sharing on the Music Industry : An Empirical Analysis , " is the first to use the fine - grained data gathered by the Consumer Expenditure Survey ( CEX ) .
The Survey is run by the Bureau of Labor Statistics , which tracks nearly all household expenses for selected families in order to calculate numbers like the Consumer Price Index .
Michel points out that such a survey has the advantage of eliminating self - serving responses , since participants have no reason to believe the data will be used to measure the effects of file - sharing .
The data used was from 1995 through 2003 .
Michel wanted to see if there 's a link between owning a computer and decreased CD buying during those years .
It turns out that there is .
During 2002 computer owners ' CD sales decreased by $ 4.79 a year , and by $ 5.55 in 2003 .
Those without computers only decreased by $ 0.80 and $ 0.22 , respectively .
On the other hand , in 2001 , the year that Napster closed , people with computers increased their CD buying by 19 percent while non-computer owners held steady .
Could the decrease in CD buying the following two years be chalked up to increased sales of digital downloads , which started to become popular just at that time ?
The paper does not address the question .
According to Michel 's methodology , those who owned a computer bought almost 13 percent fewer CDs from 1999 to 2003 , with those who bought the most music showing the largest decrease .
His conclusion is that file - sharing does have an effect on music sales , a conclusion shared by Zentner ( 2005 ) , Hong ( 2004 ) , Liebowitz ( 2004 ) , and Rob and Waldfogel ( 2004 ) .
A consensus ?
The scholarly consensus is not unanimous , however .
Michel notes that Oberholzer and Strumpf ( 2004 ) found no correlation between file - sharing and P2P use in 2002 , and a more recent paper by a Harvard student found that file - sharing benefited more obscure artists .
The dominant impression gained from reading these studies is that finding accurate correlations between file - sharing and loss of revenue for the music industry is tremendously difficult .
Michel points out , for instance , that his data would be better if it focused only on broadband users — but such data was not available for the time period he wanted .
And then , of course , having a broadband connection is not the same as using it extensively , or even for using it at all for P2P .
And of course it would be nice to know exactly how many copyrighted songs each particular household downloaded using such software , but this number too is almost impossible to get .
Despite the sophisticated regression analyses and economic modeling done by these authors , the initial data points are not ideal starting places for this sort of analysis .
And academic papers are unlikely to sway those who have either made up their minds on the issue or simply want to justify behavior they think think should be legal .
Annotated Image Exaggerated Color Contrast
With giant Saturn hanging in the blackness and sheltering Cassini from the sun 's blinding glare , the spacecraft viewed the rings as never before , revealing previously unknown faint rings and even glimpsing its home world .
This marvelous panoramic view was created by combining a total of 165 images taken by the Cassini wide - angle camera over nearly three hours on Sept. 15 , 2006 .
The full mosaic consists of three rows of nine wide - angle camera footprints ; only a portion of the full mosaic is shown here .
Color in the view was created by digitally compositing ultraviolet , infrared and clear filter images and was then adjusted to resemble natural color .
The mosaic images were acquired as the spacecraft drifted in the darkness of Saturn 's shadow for about 12 hours , allowing a multitude of unique observations of the microscopic particles that compose Saturn 's faint rings .
Ring structures containing these tiny particles brighten substantially at high phase angles : i.e. , viewing angles where the sun is almost directly behind the objects being imaged .
During this period of observation Cassini detected two new faint rings : one coincident with the shared orbit of the moons Janus and Epimetheus , and another coincident with Pallene 's orbit .
( See PIA08322 and PIA08328 for more on the two new rings . )
The narrowly confined G ring is easily seen here , outside the bright main rings .
Encircling the entire system is the much more extended E ring .
The icy plumes of Enceladus , whose eruptions supply the E ring particles , betray the moon 's position in the E ring 's left - side edge .
Interior to the G ring and above the brighter main rings is the pale dot of Earth .
Cassini views its point of origin from over a billion kilometers ( and close to a billion miles ) away in the icy depths of the outer solar system .
See PIA08324 for a similar view of Earth taken during this observation .
Small grains are pushed about by sunlight and electromagnetic forces .
Hence , their distribution tells much about the local space environment .
A second version of the mosaic view is presented here in which the color contrast is greatly exaggerated .
In such views , imaging scientists have noticed color variations across the diffuse rings that imply active processes sort the particles in the ring according to their sizes .
Looking at the E ring in this color - exaggerated view , the distribution of color across and along the ring appears to be different between the right side and the left .
Scientists are not sure yet how to explain these differences , though the difference in phase angle between right and left may be part of the explanation .
The phase angle is about 179 degrees on Saturn .
The main rings are overexposed in a few places .
This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 15 degrees above the ringplane .
Cassini was approximately 2.2 million kilometers ( 1.3 million miles ) from Saturn when the images in this mosaic were taken .
Image scale on Saturn is about 260 kilometers ( 162 miles ) per pixel .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colo .

Google has defended its right to rank web pages in any manner it likes in a groundbreaking court case over its search engine results .
The search giant is being sued in California by a parenting website which claims it lost most of its traffic when its ranking dropped to zero .
The site , Kinderstart.com , claims that it was downgraded because it is a competitor to Google .
A motion by Google to dismiss the case was heard in California last Friday , where Kinderstart argued that it competed with Google because it also offers a search facility on its site .
Kinderstart claims that its traffic dropped by 70 % when its page ranking was set to zero .
The site claims that " websites and other users in the public , seeking connections through the search engine , are allegedly restricted in speech , ideas exchange and commerce , " because of Google 's actions , according to a statement from the company 's lawyers , Global Law Group .
Google argued in court that its rankings were opinions and therefore protected by the US constitution 's first amendment , which protects freedom of speech .
Kinderstart wanted Google to reveal to the court exactly how it ranks pages .
Google 's lawyer David Kramer of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati said only that the process combined mathematical algorithms and subjective judgements on website quality .
The judge in the case , Jeremy Fogel , seemed to indicate that a forced disclosure of Google 's methods was unlikely .
" You ca n't just file a blanket lawsuit and say , ' We think we 're going to find some stuff ' , " he said , according to the IDG News Service .
Kinderstart 's class action suit states :
" As the world ’s most widely used and increasingly ubiquitous search engine , millions of Websites of persons , businesses and organizations in the United States are not accessible , seen or heard by a multitude of persons , businesses and organizations as users if the electronic link or connection is severed by [ Google ] .
" Further , many of these Websites that are improperly and / or unlawfully severed from connection through the search engine , are in the very same competitive markets as Defendant .
Such violations , individually and together , warrant declaratory and injunctive relief as well as monetary damages according to proof under applicable law based on injuries to Plaintiffs ’ person , property , and businesses . "
The judge has set a hearing date in September when the court will consider an application from Google to have certain of Kinderstart 's allegations ruled out of the court case on the basis of California 's free speech laws .
" From Judge Fogel 's questions , it was clear that he has read the papers very carefully .
We look forward to his ruling , " said Michael Kwun , Senior Litigation Counsel for Google .

Triple Sunrise
Credit & Copyright : Jim Hoida
Explanation : Today , the Sun rises due east at the Equinox , a geocentric astronomical event that occurs twice a year .
To celebrate , consider this view of the rising Sun and a lovely set of ice halos recorded on a cold winter morning near Green Bay , Wisconsin , USA , planet Earth .
Produced by sunlight shining through common atmospheric ice crystals with hexagonal cross-sections , such halos can actually be seen more often than rainbows .
The remarkable sunrise picture captures a beautiful assortment of the types most frequently seen , including a sun pillar ( center ) just above the rising Sun surrounded by a 22 degree halo arc .
Completing a triple sunrise illusion , sundogs appear at the far left and far right edges of the 22 degree arc .
An upper tangent arc is also just visible at the very top of the view .
Lots of home video games and arcade games use some sort of gun as an input device .
You point the gun at the screen and pull the trigger , and if you hit the target on the screen , the target explodes .
To create this effect , the gun contains a photodiode ( or a phototransistor ) in the barrel .
The photodiode is able to sense light coming from the screen .
The gun also contains a trigger switch .
The output of the photodiode and the switch are fed to the computer controlling the game .

At the same time , the computer is getting signals from the screen driver electronics .
If you have read How Television Works , you know about the horizontal retrace and vertical retrace signals used to align the picture on the screen .
The screen driver electronics send pulses to the computer at the start of the horizontal and vertical retrace signals , so the computer knows where on the screen the electron beam is located during each frame .
The computer normally uses one of two different techniques to figure out whether or not the gun is pointed at the target when the user pulls the trigger :
The computer blanks the screen and then paints just the target object white .
If the photodiode senses darkness after one vertical retrace signal and then light after the next , the computer assumes that the gun is pointed at the target and scores a hit .
The computer blanks the screen and then paints the entire screen white .
It takes time for the electron beam to trace the entire screen while painting it white .
By comparing the signal coming from the photodiode with the horizontal and vertical retrace signals , the computer can detect where the electron beam is on the screen when the photodiode first senses its light .
The computer counts the number of microseconds that pass between the time the horizontal and vertical retrace signals start and the time the photodiode first senses light .
The number of microseconds tells the computer exactly where on the screen the gun is pointing .
If the calculated position and the position of the target match , the computer scores a hit .

Who ever loved , that loved not at first sight ?
From Christopher Marlowe to Kylie , artists have spent centuries falling for it .
Now scientists beg to differ : rather than being struck by thunderbolts of passion on first meeting , couples take up to a year to find true love .
Researchers at Bath University have concluded that " consummate love " , defined as a balance of passion , intimacy and commitment , takes around 12 months to develop in a relationship .
Surprisingly , their findings were based on studying couplings forged via a dating website .
Of the 147 couples from the online agency Match.com who participated in the study , 61 % showed that their relationships had high levels of intimacy , passion and commitment .
Nearly all of these couples had been in their relationship for 12 months or longer .
But the females of our species , it seems , are better at fending off cupid 's arrow : men were more likely to experience true love than women , with 67 % of men and 57 % of women said to be savouring consummate love .
Women were more likely to experience " liking " compared with men ( 9 % and 2 % respectively ) .
Companionate love , a relationship with high levels of intimacy and commitment , but lower levels of passion , was the next most frequently experienced form of love , exhibited by 16 % of the study group .
The early stages of a relationship often reveals what the scientists call " nonlove " - indicating low levels of intimacy , passion and commitment .
" Love is an important predictor of success , stability and relationship satisfaction , " said Jeff Gavin .
" Love is a multifaceted concept , but is viewed in our study as the combined feelings of intimacy , passion and commitment that one has for a partner .
To date , there has been no systematic study of love in the context of relationships formed via online dating sites , but with the popularity of online dating it is imperative that we understand the factors that influence satisfaction in relationships formed in this way . "
Charlotte Harper , UK managing director of Match.com , said : " It supports our belief that the internet and email does in fact encourage old - fashioned courtship ... that is all too infrequent when meeting potential partners on the bar scene . "
Security researcher Christopher Soghoian created the Northwest Airline Boarding Pass Generator in the hope of spurring Congress to look closely at the nation 's aviation security policies , which he calls " security theater . "
The site lets anyone create a facsimile of a Northwest Airlines boarding pass , with whatever name they choose .
On Friday , Congress heard Soghoian 's message loud and clear .
But instead of promising to reform broken airport security procedures , Rep. Edward Markey ( D - Massachusetts ) , a member of the House Homeland Security committee known for his defenses of privacy , wants the site shut down and Soghoian arrested .
" The Bush administration must immediately act to investigate , apprehend those responsible , shut down the website , and warn airlines and aviation security officials to be on the lookout for fraudsters or terrorists trying to use fake boarding passes in an attempt to cheat their way through security and onto a plane , " Markey said in a statement Friday .
" There are enough loopholes at the back door of our passenger airplanes from not scanning cargo for bombs ; we should not tolerate any new loopholes making it easier for terrorists to get into the front door of a plane . "
In reality , the " loophole " is nothing new .
Security expert Bruce Schneier wrote about it in 2003 , and the online magazine Slate covered it as major news in 2005 .
Soghoian points out that Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - New York ) publicized the same security hole in April 2006 .
" Perhaps Sen .
Schumer will end up being my cellmate , " Soghoian said .
Soghoian , a Ph.D. student at Indiana University , says he has never used one of the fake boarding passes , which are likely good enough to get someone through airport security into the " sanitized " area of the airport , but not good enough to get anyone on a plane .
He was waiting for clearance from lawyers at Indiana University before attempting to test if the method worked to get through security .
Soghoian told Wired News Thursday he built the site to expose security holes , not to help terrorists .
" I want Congress to see how stupid the ( Transportation Security Administration ) 's watch lists are , " he said .
" Now even the most technically incompetent user can click and generate a boarding pass .
By doing this , I 'm hoping ( Congress ) will see how silly the security rules are .
I do n't want bad guys to board airplanes but I do n't think the system we have right now works and I think it is giving us a false sense of security . "
A fake boarding pass would be nearly impossible for airport screeners to detect , because they have no access to airline databases at the screening checkpoint and simply compare the name on the boarding pass to an identification card .
For its part , Northwest Airlines says it is " cooperating with law enforcement and government , " and that the company verifies boarding passes using bar - code scanners as passengers board planes .
The company says it alerts the TSA and the police when it catches anyone using a fraudulent boarding pass .
Now Soghoian says he 's scared , and that Indiana University 's lawyers told him that " the flip side of academic freedom is that the university wo n't defend me if there are problems . "
Even if Soghoian 's site is shut down , any boarding pass purchased over the web can still be easily edited in any browser .
That means fliers can buy a legitimate ticket through an airline 's website under a false name – evading the TSA 's no -fly list – then use a fake boarding pass under their real name to get past airport metal detectors , the only spot where IDs are checked .
Fliers prone to selection for additional screening could also create boarding passes without the " SSSS " mark that tells TSA to search them more thoroughly .
" The website in question has the potential to promote illegal activity , " said TSA spokesman Christopher White .
" Submitting fraudulent documents to airline security is illegal .
But the site will not aid anyone in circumventing security , since a boarding pass offers entry into a TSA security checkpoint and TSA ensures that every person and their property is fully screened . "
A lot of people ask me where they can get good - quality images , so I thought it would be good to have one post that I could bookmark and send out to people .
I mentioned before that I use iStockphoto.com the most ( as well as more expensive sites — though I do that much less now — and high - quality photo discs from Japan ) .
A few people gave links to their favorite free or inexpensive sites as well .
Below , then , are links to both inexpensive sites and sites offering free images in searchable databases ( but check terms of use ) .

Expect much gnashing of teeth in Hong Kong this week .
The chances of securing a comprehensive trade deal are non-existent , with the talks now really about damage limitation and the apportionment of blame .
The development charities will say that the selfish behaviour of the developed world has condemned poor nations to further penury .
Washington and Brussels will say the negotiations have been stymied by the obduracy of India and Brazil .
Economists will have a field day explaining how the world is turning its back on millions of dollars ' worth of extra growth , and that the poor countries will be the ones who will really suffer if the global economy lapses back into a new dark age of protectionism .
That 's certainly the accepted view .
An alternative argument is that the trade talks are pretty much irrelevant to development and that in as much as they do matter , developing countries may be buying a pup .
The Harvard economist Dani Rodrik is one trade sceptic .
Take Mexico and Vietnam , he says .
One has a long border with the richest country in the world and has had a free - trade agreement with its neighbour across the Rio Grande .
It receives oodles of inward investment and sends its workers across the border in droves .
It is fully plugged in to the global economy .
The other was the subject of a US trade embargo until 1994 and suffered from trade restrictions for years after that .
Unlike Mexico , Vietnam is not even a member of the WTO .
So which of the two has the better recent economic record ?
The question should be a no - brainer if all the free - trade theories are right - Mexico should be streets ahead of Vietnam .
In fact , the opposite is true .
Since Mexico signed the Nafta ( North American Free Trade Agreement ) deal with the US and Canada in 1992 , its annual per capita growth rate has barely been above 1 % .
Vietnam has grown by around 5 % a year for the past two decades .
Poverty in Vietnam has come down dramatically : real wages in Mexico have fallen .
Rodrik does n't buy the argument that the key to rapid development for poor countries is their willingness to liberalise trade .
Nor , for that matter , does he think boosting aid makes much difference either .
Looking around the world , he looks in vain for the success stories of three decades of neo-liberal orthodoxy : nations that have really made it after taking the advice - willingly or not - of the IMF and the World Bank .
Rather , the countries that have achieved rapid economic take - off in the past 50 years have done so as a result of policies tailored to their own domestic needs .
Vietnam shows that what you do at home is far more important than access to foreign markets .
There is little evidence that trade barriers are an impediment to growth for those countries following the right domestic policies .
Those policies have often been the diametric opposite of the orthodoxy .
South Korea and Taiwan focused their economies on exports , but combined that outward orientation with high levels of tariffs and other forms of protection , state ownership , domestic - content requirements for industry , directed credit and limits to capital flows .
Rodrik says : " Since the late 1970s , China also followed a highly unorthodox two - track strategy , violating practically every rule in the guidebook .
Conversely , countries that adhered more strictly to the orthodox structural reform agenda - most notably Latin America - have fared less well .
Since the mid-1980s , virtually all Latin American countries opened up their economies , privatised their public enterprises , allowed unrestricted access for foreign capital and deregulated their economies .
Yet they have grown at a fraction of the pace of the heterodox reformers , while also being buffeted more strongly by macroeconomic instability . "
This is an argument taken up by Ha Joon Chang in a recent paper for the South Centre , the developing countries ' intergovernmental forum .
Chang argues that " there is a respectable historical case for tariff protection for industries that are not yet profitable , especially in developing countries .
By contrast , free trade works well only in the fantasy theoretical world of perfect competition . "
Going right back to the mid-18th century , Chang says Pitt the Elder 's view was that the American colonists were not to be allowed to manufacture so much as a horseshoe nail .
Adam Smith agreed .
It would be better all round if the Americans concentrated on agricultural goods and left manufacturing to Britain .
Alexander Hamilton , the first US Treasury secretary , dissented from this view .
In a package presented to Congress in 1791 , he proposed measures to protect America 's infant industries .
America went with Hamilton rather than Smith .
For the next century and a half , the US economy grew behind high tariff walls , with an industrial tariff that tended to be above 40 % and rarely slipped below 25 % .
This level of support is far higher than the US is prepared to tolerate in the trade negotiations now under way .
The lesson is clear , Chang says .
South Korea would still be exporting wigs made from human hair if it had liberalised its trade in line with current thinking .
Those countries that did liberalise prematurely under international pressure - Senegal , for example - saw their manufacturing firms wiped out by foreign competition .
Infant industry
He draws the comparison with bringing up children .
" In the same way that we protect our children until they grow up and are able to compete with adults in the labour market , developing country governments need to protect their newly emerging industries until they go through a period of learning and become able to compete with the producers from more advanced countries . "
As with children , infant industry protection can go wrong .
But , says Chang , " just as failures in the world of parental protection are hardly an argument against parenting itself , so cases of failures of infant industry protection do not constitute an argument against infant industry protection per se - especially when history shows that with startlingly few exceptions , successful countries in the past and in the present have used infant industry protection " .
The chances of success are increased if the choice of target infant industries is realistic , protection is combined with an export strategy , the state imposes discipline on the firms receiving protection and the government is competent .
Another counter - argument is that while a modicum of protection may be necessary , most developing countries now have tariff rates much higher than those used by today 's developed countries in the past .
Chang says this ignores one vital point : the productivity gap between rich and poor countries today is far higher than it was in the past , so it is perfectly logical for tariffs to be higher .
For example , Britain and the Netherlands were perhaps up to four times as rich as Japan or Finland in the 19th century ; today , Switzerland or the US is 50 or 60 times as rich as Ethiopia or Tanzania .
Yet in Hong Kong the pressure will be on the bigger developing countries to make the big concessions on industrial tariffs , cutting them to levels below those that existed in most rich countries until the early 1970s .
History suggest that accepting the demands of Washington and Brussels would be unwise , to say the least .

EECS Revamps Course Structure
By Waseem S. Daher
STAFF REPORTER
Will freshman scheming be the same if their schemes are more about robots and less about Scheme ?
This coming term marks the launch of C1 , a new course designed to teach freshmen introductory electrical engineering and computer science in an integrated fashion using mobile robots as a case study .
If successful , C1 ( 6.099 ) could be a stepping stone in a revamped curriculum for Course VI , the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department .
Such curriculum modifications are scheduled for implementation by late 2007 .
While the 2007 date may be “ wildly ambitious , ” substantial progress has been made in creating a new structure for Course VI , said Professor Tomas Lozano - Perez , chair of the committee charged with reevaluating the curriculum .
The new curriculum is designed with three goals in mind : greater flexibility in requirements , better integration of electrical engineering and computer science , and more depth to better prepare students for graduate school or real - world design challenges , he said .
But C1 is a trial , and the proposed larger Course VI redesign is still in its early stages .
“ Nothing is going to happen irreversibly in the next few years , ” Lozano - Perez said .
The proposal is currently being shown to the faculty , will then be opened up for student comment , and then must jump through all the hoops of various MIT committees to be approved , meaning the changes are still fairly tentative .
“ If it does n’t work , we ’ll back away from it .
It ’s an experiment , ” said W. Eric L. Grimson PhD ’ 80 , the Course VI department head .
As for C1 , students who enroll in it and a 3 - unit Scheme class will get credit for 6.001 .
Widely respected in the field , 6.001 is an introduction to some of the principal ideas in computer science and concepts of computer programming , using the Scheme programming language .
C1 , on the other hand , has both electrical engineering and computer science , taught using the Python programming language .
Some worry that the trademark rigor of 6.001 may be lost in this transition , but many members of the faculty involved with the new curriculum insist that this will not be the case .
“ In the long run , [ C1 ] by itself will not replace 6.001 , ” said Professor Harold Abelson PhD ’ 73 , a member of the C1 staff , and one of the original creators of 6.001 .
Concepts that make up 6.001 will be presented both in C1 and again later in the proposed curriculum , he said .
New Course VI structure proposed
In late 2004 , in the wake of declining Course VI enrollment , L. Rafael Reif , the department head at the time and now the provost , created a committee for the purpose of re-evaluating the effectiveness of Course VI ’s curriculum .
The goal was “ to have the recommended modifications to the Course VI curriculum substantially in place by September 1 , 2007 , ” according to a Course VI announcement on Aug. 25 , 2004 .
While nothing has been set in stone , a sketch of a curriculum has been drafted , and is being circulated for comment .
The new structure comprises four levels : Students would be introduced to the department with two required “ core ” classes : C1 and C2 .
These classes will focus on electrical engineering and computer science as one integrated topic , using a mobile robot and a cell phone as case studies , respectively .
C2 should be offered next fall , and is largely the work of Professors Charles Sodini , Daniel Jackson , and others .
Next , students would have to take at least three “ foundation ” classes , of which there are expected to be roughly seven .
Four of these will be modified versions of the existing Course VI core , 6.001–6.004 , which are computer programs , circuits and electronics , signals and systems , and computation structures , respectively .
However , some new classes on algorithms , data structures or quantum physics will probably be added at the “ foundation ” level , Lozano - Perez said .
After that , students would take at least two “ header ” classes and some laboratory / project classes , as they do now .
These classes are typically introductions into more specific areas of Course VI , such as artificial intelligence , theory , or signal processing .
Finally , students would take at least two “ senior - level / capstone ” classes .
These classes are intended to provide focus for a specific branch of electrical engineering or computer science , in topics such as algorithms or computer architecture .
Many of these classes will be core graduate classes that will be modified so that they are suitable for senior - level undergraduates , said Srini Devadas , the associate head of Course VI .
The idea with these capstone classes is that students would be able to explore an individual subject area , so that they will be better prepared for graduate school or research , for example , Lozano - Perez said .
Another advantage to this proposed reorganization is that students would have more flexibility in choosing subjects of interest .
Students would pick two “ streams ” through the various levels described above .
The idea here is to “ break the stovepipes ” that segregate EE and CS , and allow students to mix and match subjects more easily , Grimson said .
This is potentially the first major reorganization of the Course VI undergraduate curriculum since the 1970s .
“ EECS is much broader than it has ever been , ” Devadas said , noting that it now encompasses parts of quantum physics and the life sciences .
C1 and C2 : Integrated EECS
Taught by Professors Abelson , Leslie Kaelbling , and Jacob White ’ 80 , C1 is designed to give students a hands - on feel for electrical engineering and computer science , using a mobile robot as a case study .
Assignments are “ more open - ended and let students try stuff , ” Kaelbling said .
The format of C1 is also fairly non-traditional , with one 1.5 hour lecture and 4 hours in lab every week .
Students will work in groups of 3 , with a robot .
The student - to - staff ratio is also exceptionally low , at about 2:1 .
Philosophically , the material tries to follow a “ practice - theory - practice ” model : First , a task is presented and students work on it .
Then , students learn the theory that underlies the problem presented , and finally the students tackle the problem again , given these better techniques , Kaelbling said .
Content - wise , the class is a mix as well .
The first four weeks of C1 will be a lot like the first four weeks of 6.001 , Abelson said .
The difference is that programming will be done in Python and not Scheme .
Tasks will vary from building a robot head to writing navigation code for a robot in a maze , White said .
Fundamentally , though , the course is about learning “ how to build up abstractions , and how abstractions help solve engineering problems , ” White said .
“ We also want to focus on the big concepts , ” and teach students that “ math is a useful thing , ” in solving engineering problems , Kaelbling said .
C2 , scheduled to be ready next fall , is similar in its goals , but instead focuses on big - picture concepts like radio , Fourier transforms , networks , and large systems .
Feedback from C1 will also likely shape the format of C2 , Sodini said .
Faculty from both courses stress that neither will just be a survey course .
They will “ be in the Course VI tradition of ‘ barely - doable , ’ ” Lozano - Perez said .
C1 will also be offered in the fall , along with C2 .
But “ it is an experiment , and experiments can fail , ” Lozano - Perez said .
The faculty , however , is hopeful and excited .
“ The department is putting incredible resources in this startup , ” Abelson said , “ People who take this class are going to have a blast . ”
For more than six months , Customs and Border Protection refused to part with any information on the Aug. 18 incident .
The agency finally handed over six pages of documents after Wired News filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act .
While heavily redacted , the documents cast doubt on earlier government claims that a virus did not contribute to the outage .
BECAUSE we all needed yet another set of rules to follow , because we had not yet been sufficiently bombarded with dictates about the colors of the fruits and vegetables we should eat and the ideal intake of alcohol and the optimal frequency of low - impact exercise , the Journal of the American Medical Association came along last week to tell us that serious calorie restriction might best serve the quest for a long , disease - free life .
The number of calories in the daily diets of some participants in this latest study was -- gulp -- 890 .
Which , by my nonscientific research , is less than the average teenage or adult American who lives within a half mile of a Burger King and has not had gastric bypass surgery consumes for dinner .
That might be considered a helpful target , except that it 's so ludicrously unattainable , in professions other than modeling and zip codes other than 90210 , that there is n't anything helpful about it .
It 's also hard to see the point of it .
If living to 99 means forever cutting the porterhouse into eighths , swearing off the baked potato and putting the martini shaker into storage , then 85 sounds a whole lot better , and I 'd ratchet that down to 79 to hold onto the Häagen - Dazs , along with a few shreds of spontaneity .
It 's a matter of priorities .
Do we really want as many years as we can get , no matter how we get them ?
At what point does the pursuit of an extended life -- a pursuit that pivots on the debatable assumption that habit can outwit heredity , not to mention chance -- become the entire business of a life ?
Is longevity all it 's cracked up to be ?
Lockheed Martin Is A Coalition Of Concerned Citizens
What I most appreciate about this new astroturf group Hands
Off the Internet is the shamelessness of their self - description :
Hands Off The Internet is a nationwide coalition of Internet users ...
Sure , you bet .
Though to be fair , of course , in a certain sense it is true AT&T , BellSouth , Alcatel and the National Association of Manufacturers are " a coalition of internet users . "
Dear Mr. Mankiw , I wanted to write to tell you how much I enjoy reading your economics blog .
Compounded with my class ' usage of your textbook , learning economics feels like a very interactive process .
Thanks to your work and my teacher ( he 's from Princeton , not Harvard , but still a good teacher ) , I 've taken a very genuine interest in economics .
I had a question though .
My school offers two main elective history courses for seniors : Government and Economics .
Due to scheduling limitations , not many kids are able to take both .
I 've noticed something interesting as the year has progressed .
The students who are taking the government course are increasingly endorsing leftist ideologies while the economics students are becoming increasingly right wing .
For instance , my school 's paper recently ran an editorial that ' complained ' that too many of Lawrenceville 's finest were going into investment banking , and not into seemingly ' socially beneficial ' careers .
What is your view on government intervention on economic equality and the like ?
Do all economics students show republican ( or right of center ) tendencies ?
Thanks ,
[ name withheld ]
The Lawrenceville School
Princeton , NJ
A student emails me a question about how a person 's views are determined by what he or she studies :
As a Princeton grad myself , I have full confidence in your teacher .
Putting that issue aside , let me address your central question :
Does the study of economics tend to make people conservative ?
I believe the answer is , to some degree , yes .
My experience is that many students find that their views become somewhat more conservative after studying economics .
There are at least three , related reasons .
First , in some cases , students start off with utopian views of public policy , where a benevolent government can fix all problems .
One of the first lessons of economics is that life is full of tradeoffs .
That insight , completely absorbed , makes many utopian visions less attractive .
Once you recognize , for example , that there is a tradeoff between equality and efficiency , as economist Arthur Okun famously noted , many public policy decisions become harder .
Second , some of the striking insights of economics make one more respectful of the market as a mechanism for coordinating a society .
Because market participants are motivated by self - interest , a person might naturally be suspect of market - based societies .
But after learning about the gains from trade , the invisible hand , and the efficiency of market equilibrium , one starts to approach the market with a degree of admiration and , indeed , awe .
Third , the study of actual public policy makes students recognize that political reality often deviates from their idealistic hopes .
Much income redistribution , for example , is aimed not toward the needy but toward those with political clout .
This Dave Barry column , which is reprinted in Chapter 22 of my favorite economics textbook , describes a good example .
For these three reasons , many students in introductory economics courses become more conservative -- or , to be precise , more classically liberal -- than they began .
Nonetheless , studying economics does not by itself determine one 's political ideology .
I know good economists who are distinctly right of center and good economists who are distinctly left of center .
In my department at Harvard , I would guess that Democrats outnumber Republicans among the faculty ( although there is surely more political balance in the economics department than in most other departments at the university ) .
IN RESPONSE to the Supreme Court ’s June decision in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld , the Bush administration has proposed a new Enemy Combatant Military Commissions Act .
If passed by Congress , this act would revolutionize American jurisprudence .
The White House wants military tribunals hearing the cases of terrorism suspects to be able to use “ coerced ” confessions .
As Acting Asst. Atty . Gen. Steven Bradbury helpfully assured Congress last month , “ there are gradations of coercion much lower than torture . ”
Because many in the administration and Congress feel strongly that coerced confessions constitute the “ best practice ” to get truth from people suspected of bad things , then , under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment , American citizens should be permitted to use the same method to pry the truth out of their elected representatives .
One such method is waterboarding : strapping someone to a board and pushing him underwater to make him feel like he ’s drowning .
Since then - CIA Director Porter Goss assured Congress last year that this was a “ professional interrogation method , ” not torture , citizens should be permitted to bring splintery planks , leather straps and water tanks to expedite discussions with any member of Congress who continues to insist that things are going swimmingly for the U.S. military in Iraq .

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has during his tenure approved the use of a dozen extreme interrogation methods above and beyond those previously permitted by the Pentagon , including , but not limited to , hooding , disrobing , placing detainees in stress positions and exploiting their “ fear of dogs . ”
When the resulting Abu Ghraib photos leaked out in 2004 , Sen. James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) declared that he was more “ outraged by the outrage ” than by the actual evidence of detainee abuse .
So : Inhofe should be blindfolded , put in a straitjacket and left in a room full of crazed chihuahuas until he explains why he believes that the U.S. military should not be constrained to follow the laws of the land , such as the Anti-Torture Act .
The iconic photo from the Bush / Rumsfeld interrogation era is that of the Iraqi detainee covered in a shroud , standing on a box , with wires attached to his body .
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist ( R - Tenn . ) spearheaded the coverup of the CIA ’s use of secret prisons throughout Eastern Europe , so he could stand on his own box wired to an electric charge until confessing why he believes that the Geneva Convention prohibition on making detainees “ disappear ” is null and void .
Exposure to extreme cold and heat is another method routinely used by U.S. interrogators .
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( D - Conn. ) has been the biggest Democratic apologist for Abu Ghraib in the Senate , so perhaps he could be strapped to a block of ice until he explains how using “ coercion ” helps the United States win hearts and minds in the Muslim world .

Public interrogations of elected representatives should use the same rules Bush favors for tribunals -- anyone could make an anonymous accusation against a congressman , and congressmen would be prohibited from seeing or cross-examining their accusers .
Secret evidence could be allowed , even if it ( or the “ secret ” being protected ) failed the laugh test .
We cannot let old - fashioned due - process rigamarole impede our pursuit of the truth .
Some people may object , contending that waterboarding congressmen will tarnish the dignity of democracy .
But this is rather quaint , considering everything Congress has already rubber - stamped .
Besides , politicians are not being coerced to approve the use of coerced confessions , so they still have time to avoid reaping what they sow .
At 4 pm Central
Time two weeks ago today , the US national weather service warned that the hurricane about to hit New Orleans would cause ' human suffering incredible by modern standards ' .
The following morning , as citizens drowned on their front porches , President George W Bush attended a cake - cutting photo - opportunity to mark Senator John McCain 's 69th birthday .
And now another anniversary rolls around .
On 11 September 2001 , the world reached out to a stricken America , unaware that US helplessness was a brief prelude to an era of power run mad .
From Manhattan to Mesopotamia to the Mississippi , we have come full circle .
Hurricane Katrina has turned a superpower into a victim again .
Only this time , few rally to the President .
Rotting bodies lie like rubbish sacks in the streets of New Orleans , 42 per cent of Americans think Bush has done a ' bad ' or ' terrible ' job , and the world looks at his catastrophe management in horror and derision .
Blaming Bush is easy .
That is not to say it is wrong .
It would have been better if scientists ' warnings had been heeded and the levees strengthened .
It would have been preferable if America had not housed its poorest below the Plimsoll line of civilisation , and if the emergency controller , now sidelined , had not been a klutz called ' Brownie ' who used to run gymkhanas .
Ideally , the President would learn to prioritise national disasters and birthday parties .
But the hurricane is not about one scapegoat , however powerful , nor is it just a fable of America .
Britons may be shocked that obese inhabitants of the richest nation can be victims of starvation too .
They may be startled that many New Orleans citizens are poor black people who might shoot and loot and who have never set foot in the French quarter , with its filigree balconies , jazz clubs and a population that is 95 per cent white .
But Britain , with its own gaping social divide , has no excuse for smugness .
The universal lesson of Katrina is broader , though , than inequality .
Timothy Garton
Ash argues that we have witnessed how , with the removal of the staples of civilised life , such as water and personal security , people revert to a ' Hobbesian state of nature , a war of all against all ' .
At the hint of a dirty bomb or some other apocalyptic onslaught , societies could become ' decivilised ' .
This is a very gloomy creed .
It is true that , in extremis , hungry flood victims are rarely to be mistaken for Jane Austen heroines .
You will not find them sitting around debating whether Hobbes 's gospel of state control was more relevant than the benign anarchy outlined by Proudhon , who thought that ' property was theft ' .
They will get down to Wal - Mart and grab some food and drink , if necessary at rifle point .
Such action may or may not seem more despicable than the online looting of white - collar barbarians now setting up bogus flood relief appeals .
The Lord of the Flies scenario is , by definition , nothing new .
The Greeks coined the word ' barbaros ' for anyone who did not speak their language .
To Marx , barbarism was a synonym for capitalist destruction , a theme embroidered by Osama bin Laden 's favourite writer , Sayyid Qutb , who used the term jahiliyya to label the West a materialist hell meriting attack .
And so to 9/11 and a new chapter in barbaric action .
The timeline linking September 2001 to today is studded with the headstones of its antagonists and martyrs .
They include as many as 27,000 Iraqi citizens ; the 2,000 dead US and British soldiers ; the massacred of Bali and Istanbul , Riyadh , Madrid , Casablanca , London .
There are the individuals whose histories dominated the narrative for a while ; Margaret Hassan , Kenneth Bigley , David Kelly : the aid worker , the contractor , the government inspector .
Western pugilism cannot justify the outrages of jihadism .
But few , bar the US President and the British Prime Minister , would seriously argue that an unlawful Iraq war , fought against world opinion , has not fomented terrorism and laid innocent people everywhere open to attack and peril .
North Korea has the bomb and Iran may not be far behind .
Bush , and now Blair , have defied international rules to welcome India to their nuclear club .
If the people who strolled to work in the Twin Towers on a cloudless September morning could see the blood that saturates their graves , they would be incredulous .
Many would also be appalled , not only by fanatics who want to rewind the world to a 7th - century caliphate but by the forward planners of the West .
On decivilisation , we do not have much to learn from a few hungry looters .
Those interested in the seeds of savagery should look elsewhere .
The destitute driven to anarchy are simply victims .
Those who commit grave crimes under the cover of disaster deserve punishment by the law , but even they do not undermine civilisation in the same way as people who wear suits , kiss babies and sign the orders that enable , though never command , the outrages at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo and Camp Breadbasket .
Crowds may look menacing , but the powerful are much better at torture and havoc than the weak .
For Americans , and all other nations , today is the anniversary of year zero .
The resurgence of religion in a world reforged four years ago meshed with Bush 's war of good versus evil ; of right - wing Christendom versus radical Islam .
The Lord 's carelessness in allowing 9/11 to happen might deepen hardline faith , but that was murder in the second degree .
His callousness in unleashing an act of God has shaken Bible Belt America to its pious roots .
That doubt may do some good , if a side - effect of Katrina is to downplay the hand of the Almighty in US politics .
Already Bush is proving much less eager than many feared to cram the Supreme Court with anti-abortion zealots .
His country might learn to love the gun a little less and the poor a little more .
There are more lessons , as relevant for Britain as for America .
The solidarity instilled by 9/11 made electorates too credulous .
Even the most vehement opponents of invading Iraq were shocked to discover that the evidence for Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction was no more than the fantasy of leaders spoiling for a war .
There will be other crusades .
Bush still menaces Iran .
Blair talks of justice and human rights as if they are the shield and armoury of jihadis , rather than the pillars of civilisation .
The discarded dead of New Orleans offer another story : of social division , craven politicians and incompetent public servants .
But , most of all , the disaster has been a reminder to all who hold the powerful to account .
Tragedy once conferred upon our leaders a wisdom they did not possess and a trust they did not merit .
Never again .

The perfect prototype .
The geek ’s ideal mate .
Sigh .
Too bad she does n’t exist .
Then there ’s the one the producers call Boomer and fans call Galactica - Boomer .
She was in love with the Chief , shot Adama , and teamed up with Caprica - Six to “ save ” humanity .
Now she lives on a base star .
And I am in love with all of them .
Even the ones that would kill me .
The perfect woman , the Supreme Being .
That ’s Milla Jovovich .
No , sorry , I mean Leeloo , a .k.a. Leeloo Minai Lekatariba - Laminai - Tchaii Ekbat De Sebat , a.k.a.
The Fifth Element .
Is it the orange dreads ?
The pale blue - green eyes ?
The perfect body ?
The Gaultier outfits ?
The adorable accent ?
The martial arts ?
The saving the Earth from the Ultimate Evil ?----------------------------------
Okay , sure , you could n’t buy Denise Richards as a tank - top - and - hot - pants - wearing nuclear physicist in “ The World Is Not Enough . ”
But as a hotshot starship pilot and , eventually , captain ?
Sure , why not ?---------------------One of the main plot points of Heinlein ’s original novel was that all the experienced officers were killed off , leaving only the kids in charge .
And at least Carmen had the sense to dump goofy hunk Casper Van Dien for slightly - less - goofy hunk Patrick Muldoon – right ?
And she did look spectacular in those Nazi-esque uniforms .
TOKYO , Thursday , Jan .
12 - The Nikon Corporation , the Japanese camera maker , said Thursday that it would stop making most of its film cameras and lenses in order to focus on digital cameras .
The company , based in Tokyo , is the latest to join an industrywide shift toward digital photography , which has exploded in popularity .
Rivals like Kodak and Canon have already shifted most of their camera production into digital products .
Nikon said it would halt production of all but two of its seven film cameras and would also stop making most lenses for those cameras .
The company will halt production of the film camera models " one by one , " though it refused to specify when .
A company spokesman said Nikon made the decision because sales of film cameras have plunged .
In the most recent fiscal year ended March 2005 , Nikon said that film camera bodies accounted for 3 percent of the 180 billion yen ( $ 1.5 billion ) in sales at the company 's camera and imaging division .
That is down from 16 percent the previous year .

Chapter 0
When you program a computer , you have to " speak " in a language your computer understands : a programming language .
There are lots and lots of different languages out there , and many of them are excellent .
In this tutorial I chose to use my favorite programming language , Ruby .
Aside from being my favorite , Ruby is also the easiest programming language I have seen ( and I 've seen quite a few ) .
In fact , that 's the real reason I 'm writing this tutorial : I did n't decide to write a tutorial , and then choose Ruby because it's my favorite ; instead , I found Ruby to be so easy that I decided there really ought to be a good beginner 's tutorial which uses it .
It 's Ruby 's simplicity which prompted this tutorial , not the fact that it 's my favorite .
( Writing a similar tutorial using another language , like C++ or Java , would have required hundreds and hundreds of pages . )
But do n't think that Ruby is a beginner 's language just because it is easy !
It is a powerful , professional - strength programming language if ever there was one .
When you write something in a human language , what is written is called text .
When you write something in a computer language , what is written is called code .
I have included lots of examples of Ruby code throughout this tutorial , most of them complete programs you can run on your own computer .
To make the code easier to read , I have colored parts of the code different colors .
( For example , numbers are always green . )
Anything you are supposed to type in will be in a dotted box , and anything a program prints out will be in a grey box .
If you come across something you do n't understand , or you have a question which was n't answered , write it down and keep reading !
It 's quite possible that the answer will come in a later chapter .
However , if your question was not answered by the last chapter , I will tell you where you can go to ask it .
There are lots of wonderful people out there more than willing to help ; you just need to know where they are .
But first we need to download and install Ruby onto your computer .
Windows Installation
The Windows installation of Ruby is a breeze .
First , you need to download Ruby .
There might be a couple of versions to choose from ; this tutorial is using version 2.2.2 , so make sure what you download is at least as recent as that .
( I would just get the latest version available . )
Then simply run the installation program .
It will ask you where you want to install Ruby .
Unless you have a good reason for it , I would just install it in the default location .
In order to program , you need to be able to write programs and to run programs .
To do this , you will need a text editor and a command line .
My favorite text editor is Sublime Text .
It would also be a good idea to create a folder somewhere to keep all of your programs .
Make sure that when you save a program , you save it into this folder .
To get to your command line , select Command Prompt from the Accessories folder in your start menu .
You will want to navigate to the folder where you are keeping your programs .
Typing cd .. will take you up one folder , and cd foldername would put you inside the folder named foldername .
To see all of the folders in your current folder , type dir / ad .
And that 's it !
You 're all set to learn to program .
Macintosh Installation
If you have Mac OS X 10.2 ( Jaguar ) or later , then you already have Ruby on your system !
What could be easier ?
In order to program , you need to be able to write programs and to run programs .
To do this , you will need a text editor and a command line .
Your command line is accessible through the Terminal application ( found in Applications / Utilities ) .
For a text editor , you can use whatever one you are familiar or comfortable with .
My favorite text editor is Sublime Text .
If you use TextEdit , however , make sure you save your programs as text - only !
Otherwise your programs will not work .
And that 's it !
You 're all set to learn to program .
Linux Installation
First , you will want to check and see if you have Ruby installed already .
Type which ruby .
If it says something like / usr / bin / which : no ruby in (... ) , then you need to download Ruby , otherwise see what version of Ruby you are running with ruby - v .
If it is older than the latest stable build on the above download page , you might want to upgrade .
If you are the root user , then you probably do n't need any instructions for installing Ruby .
If you are n't , you might want to ask your system administrator to install it for you .
( That way everyone on that system could use Ruby . )
Otherwise , you can just install it so that only you can use it .
Move the file you downloaded to a temporary directory , like $ HOME / tmp .
If the name of the file is ruby - 1.6.7.tar.gz , you can open it with tar zxvf ruby - 1.6.7.tar.gz .
Change directory to the directory you just created ( in this example , cd ruby - 1.6.7 ) .
Configure your installation by typing ./ configure -- prefix=$HOME ) .
Next type make , which will build your Ruby interpreter .
This might take a few minutes .
After that is done , type make install to install it .
Next , you 'll want to add $ HOME / bin to your command search path by editing your $ HOME /. bashrc file .
( You might have to log out and back in again for this to take effect . )
After you do that , test your installation : ruby - v .
If that tells you what version of Ruby you have , you can now delete the files in $ HOME / tmp ( or wherever you put them ) .
And that 's it !
You 're all set to learn to program .
Considering that IronPython started out as a test to see if Microsoft could run a dynamic programming language on top of the .NET Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) , the Python port has managed to snake its way into the company 's software development portfolio .
After running in beta for a little less than a year , IronPython 1.0 was released at the beginning of September , and now Microsoft has decided to take things one step further by releasing an ASP .
NET compatible version of the language .
With IronPython for ASP .
NET , Microsoft hopes to create a model for language extensibility within their popular web - centric development platform .
In a whitepaper written by David Ebbo , the Microsoft CLR dynamic language architect states that this new model will eventually serve as a generic structure for any dynamic language .
" Giving ASP.NET users the choice of languages was part of the design since our first version , and this is just another step in that direction .
Unlike a number of other Web platforms that support only a single language , the ASP.
NET team wants to enable users to choose the language that fits them best , " wrote Ebbo .
Using the same structure as C# or Visual Basic .
NET for ASP .
NET , IronPython pages are separated into two files : one .aspx page and one .py code - behind class .
Almost every feature of ASP.
NET is supported in IronPython for ASP.
NET including the standard server controls and visual designer .
Actually , the only thing you can't do in IronPython for ASP .
NET is create web services and use IntelliSense .
The current CTP of IronPython for ASP.NET can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center .
It comes with Visual Web Developer which is a free integrated development environment ( IDE ) .
Although the project is currently not open source , Ebbo stated that Microsoft is considering a move to the open source model in the future .

A National Guardsman in camouflage fatigues waved cars forward , and as each rolled up to a squad of soldiers , one sang out , " Pop the trunk . "
Other soldiers stepped forward with cartons of bottled water and plastic bags of ice , putting them in the car , tapping the trunk shut and motioning the driver on .
Each delivery was over in seconds .
" We 've done this so much over the last two or three years that we 're getting pretty good at it , " said Sgt. First Class Tim Harper of the 265th Air Defense Artillery of Sarasota .
The storm clogged the streets of Naples , one of the wealthiest cities in the country , with fallen shrubs and trees .
But even as the wind was dying down Monday afternoon , yellow frontloaders were pushing and shoving and lifting away debris , and by Tuesday afternoon the main streets and most residential byways were clear .
Floodwater that had risen knee - high in some parts of Naples also was all but gone by Tuesday afternoon , as it was in Miami 's downtown banking district .
But the sleek high - rise buildings that line Miami's Brickell Avenue , home to some of Florida 's largest banks , law firms and expensive hotels , looked shabby with many windows blown out , the glass shattered in the street below .
" It looks worse than it is , " said Cesar Alvarez , chief executive and president of the law firm Greenberg Traurig , which lost windows in about a third of its lawyers ' offices .
Schools throughout South Florida will stay closed for the rest of the week , officials said , and the Broward County Courthouse , a high - rise building that lost dozens of plate - glass windows in the storm , will not reopen for at least two weeks .
Ceilings collapsed in judges ' chambers , and the jury room , state attorney 's office and public defender 's office were also damaged , said Chief Judge Dale Ross .
One of the state 's biggest businesses is growing ornamental plants and flowers and trees , but dozens of nurseries in the southwest Florida were battered by the storm .
At the H.M. Buckley & Sons wholesale nursery in Naples , about half of the 40 workers turned up Tuesday to find the plastic and mesh covering ripped off many greenhouses .
A few had been knocked down , and some sheds had been reduced to heaps of shredded lumber .

First appeared in print in The Rhinoceros Times , Greensboro , NC By Orson Scott Card July 24 , 2005 Weapons of Mass Destruction A week before the London bombings , I was in England for a US Defense Department - sponsored conference on the future of weapons of mass destruction .
It was held in Sussex , as part of the Wilton Park conference series , which is well attended by diplomats and military people from many European and Middle Eastern countries .
This time , they also brought along some science fiction writers , in the hope that we would actually know something about the future .
( Whether we delivered on that hope is another question .
The other guys did great .
As for me : I warned them in advance that I would n't be much use , but they brought me anyway .
Caveat emptor . )
The deal was that nothing in the meetings was classified , so we can talk or write freely about the ideas we discussed -- but we can't cite any particular person as the source of anything .
So none of the information I 'm talking about is a secret , but the sources are .
* What Is a " Weapon of Mass Destruction " ?
Traditionally , we use the term to refer to chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons .
But why is this the list ?
It is n't really about the number of people you can kill with each weapon .
After all , if you send up some bombers you can kill a lot more people than if you use poison gas .
And if it 's sheer awfulness that puts a weapon on that list , I think napalm and flame throwers are every bit as appalling .
War kills people and maims many a survivor for life .
War kills civilians from time to time , and nations that think of themselves as decent have targeted civilians deliberately and called it a just war .
And , just to put things in perspective , four jet airplanes were turned into weapons that killed thousands of people and made a highly symbolic statement on 9/11 four years ago , while just last month a few bombs on subway trains and buses managed to kill a few people and tie up traffic in London for a day .
*
Here 's why the list of WMDs consists of CBN -- chemical , biological , and nuclear : Chemical weapons are on there because they were the first weapon that everybody agreed to ban after World War I .
And the ban was more or less successful -- even in World War II , nobody used chemical weapons against each other 's armies .
( Germany used mustard gas against civilians under its own control , of course , but that was n't , technically , a violation of the treaty . )
True , the U.S. and the USSR both developed potent nerve gases , but they were never used on the battlefield -- again , the only known use was by Iraq against its own civilians .
We loathe chemical weapons primarily because we breathe them right in and we can't get away .
It 's like the last plague in the movie The Ten Commandments .
It can seep in and get us unaware .
But then , so can a car bomb that goes off in front of our house .
( Well , it does n't seep , but it can kill us in our sleep and there 's no defense against it . )
Several hundred years ago , the same complaints could have been made about muskets and cannons and grenades .
And in its day , the bow and arrow was a vicious , unfair weapon .
But nobody was able to ban those weapons .
Why ?
Because they worked .
Chemical weapons were successfully banned because they do n't work .
Not in a way that gives them any military value .
First , there 's the problem of blowback .
It 's hard to deliver poison gas against a massed enemy without running the risk of the wind blowing the poison gas back on you .
Second , you can only use it effectively once -- then your enemy will have gas masks and the soldiers will use them faithfully , so your gas will stop working .
Chemical weapons , then , have little battlefield value .
That 's why the ban worked .
We could also ban chariots , if we wanted to , and everybody would stick to the ban .
Biological Weapons are another matter .
Potentially , nature can unleash such a weapon against us at any time .
Given our vast , packed - in populations and our swift transportation , a plague could sweep through the world in a very short time .
And if the modern equivalent of the Black Death were to strike today , killing half of the people it infected or more , the results would be devastating .
In fact , the reason the Black Death did n't kill more than it did was quite possibly because people lived in more of a spread - out pattern .
Because those with genetic resistance to the disease were far fewer than half the population .
We are n't spread out .
There 's nowhere to hide .
And if we were struck by an airborne version of Ebola , killing ninety percent or more , it 's likely that our infrastructure would be unsustainable .
Civilization could collapse , and the survivors would have to relearn skills we left behind generations ago .
But that 's a natural disaster that affects all nations more or less equally .
As a military matter , biological weapons are n't very useful .
You can't make military use of a disease that spreads itself , or you have to immunize your own population first .
And how do you stop it from spreading to neutral countries ?
So the only weaponized biological agents are those that kill only where you want them to .
That means you need something like anthrax -- and you need a particular strain of anthrax that your target wo n't have immunized his soldiers against .
Then you have the very difficult problem of delivering it to exactly the spot where you want it to start spreading .
This is very hard to do , and the payoff is n't as high as you 'd think .
For one thing , you have to wait until the enemy gets sick .
And while they 're busy dealing with the medical emergency , what 's to stop them from moving in replacement troops to cover the affected area ?
Like chemical weapons , the only use of biological agents is for terrorism -- for attacks against an undefended population .
The anthrax scare in the fall of 2001 was frightening , yes ... but it did n't kill any of its actual targets , only innocent clerical workers .
And look at the numbers .
Can we really call it a weapon of mass destruction ?
A guy with a rifle shooting out of the trunk of his car killed more people and disrupted a region of the country more effectively than those anthrax - filled envelopes .
Nukes , though .
Those are weapons of mass destruction no matter who sets one off or where -- as long as it's in a place where fallout can spread .
And if there are a lot of people living at ground zero ... * Are There Worse Weapons Coming ?
There are some scary possibilities coming down the pike .
Nanotechnology , if it ever actually works , has the possibility of delivering killing power into places that are supposedly immune .
Imagine you have a swarm of tiny flying robots that do n't show up on any radar .
Each one carries about a firecracker 's worth of explosives .
When they are released from their carrier in the vicinity of a bunker deep underground , they find their way through the ventilation system , cutting holes where filters are designed to keep them out .
Then they reassemble , combining their explosive power , and set themselves off simultaneously .
Boom .
That 's a weapon which , if it can ever be built , has a serious military use .
It can also be defended against fairly easily ( debilitating electrical fields , for instance ) , if you know it might be coming .
And there is a nightmare scenario -- nanobots that can replicate themselves from ambient materials .
That is , they can chew up cars or bicycles for their constituent elements and build tiny new robots out of them and program them on the spot .
The problem here is like the problem with bioweapons :
Once something like that gets unleashed , it simply eats up everything in its path .
Sure , you 've programmed them to switch off when you give a certain signal -- but all it takes is one self - replicating nanobot with a tiny defect that makes it disobedient to your command , and you 've got the Sorcerer 's Apprentice .
It just keeps duplicating itself until it has used all the available elements and the surface of the earth is just a thick swarm of nanobots .
Do n't worry .
It probably can't be done , and even if it could , who'd be stupid enough to do it ?
* The Only Real Weapon of Mass Destruction
Most of the other technologies we discussed were either improvements in existing weapons concepts , sabotage of infrastructure , too farfetched to worry about ( yet ) , or so destructive they could not be targeted selectively enough to achieve any rational goal .
In other words , do n't worry about somebody going out into space , finding an asteroid , and redirecting it so it will smash into Earth .
Any nation with the means to do that would be among those to suffer most if it happened .
So it wo n't happen .
That 's why nobody will put up a solar power collector in space that might beam a killing ray down onto the surface without absolute failsafe security .
( The obvious security is to have the device powered by a small ricochet beam -- if the beam ever wanders off its collection point on Earth , it will stop receiving power from Earth and will automatically shut off . )
There 's only one weapon of mass destruction for the foreseeable future that lives up to the name :
It can be targeted like a weapon against a specific target , and it will kill huge numbers of people .
We 're talking about nukes .
That 's why we 've been trying not to allow them to proliferate .
The theory of nukes is widely known -- I learned about how to build an atomic bomb in junior high , and how to build a thermonuclear device in high school .
But the practical engineering of it is n't quite so easy .
1 . You have to get special nuclear fuel -- enriched uranium or its derivatives , and for a fusion bomb , deuterium and tritium as well .
2 . You have to find exactly the right solution to many intricate engineering problems ; if your solution is off by a little , you 'll quite likely have dud .
But since it will be a dud that everyone knows dudded , you get all the blame for having tried to set off a nuke without any of the bang for your buck .
That 's part of the reason why nations test their weapons -- so they 'll know they work , and so their enemies will believe you have a working weapon .
3 . It takes a very high - level technology to produce the parts needed for every stage of the process , and very few nations have the capability .
So you either have to develop the capability yourself , in secret , or acquire the parts you need from countries that can build them -- without anybody knowing .
* Is Proliferation Inevitable ?
Let 's please remember that the United States was the first nation to successfully build a nuke , and we used it -- twice .
There is a sound ethical case for each of those two uses , but frankly , they both depend on this :
Our enemy did n't have a defense against the weapon , and did n't have an equivalent weapon to use against us .
So the only rational course of action for any nation that thought of the United States as its enemy was to develop its own nukes and a credible delivery system .
Naturally , we would have preferred it if we remained the only nation with nuclear weapons .
And we proved our relatively benign nature by the fact that during that brief window when we and only we possessed nukes , we did not use them against the Soviet Union in order to force compliance with our national will .
Though perhaps there were a few million Poles and Hungarians and Czechs , not to mention the millions suffering in the Gulag , who might have wished we had n't been such decent folks .
Then the USSR got the bomb , and it was a different game .
We protected Europe with our " nuclear umbrella , " which was a doctrine that absolutely promised that we would use nuclear weapons first if the USSR ever invaded Germany .
The trouble was , Britain and France did n't quite believe we would use our nuclear weapons to protect Europe , when it was sure to bring down a rain of nukes upon our own country .
So they developed their own nuclear weapons -- in Britain 's case , with our complete cooperation -- in order to make the threat of first use by the West more credible .
Soon , though , it came down to the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction to keep either side from using nukes at all .
Both sides had to believe that the other side would be insane enough to use their nukes ; both sides had to try to build a force of nuclear missiles that could ride out a first attack and still have the capacity to respond ; and any anti-missile system that could reduce or remove the threat of first use by the other side would mean that the side with the missile defense could use nukes with relative impunity .
It was very complicated , but nobody set off a nuke in anger for two generations .
The trouble was , the East and the West were n't the only ones with nuclear ambitions .
First China felt it needed its own nukes for the very good reason that they did n't think that America would come to their defense if the USSR decided to nuke them .
And once China got nukes , India had no choice but to pursue its own nuclear program .
After all , Chinese troops had already shown themselves quite willing to cross those passes in the Himalayas ( am I the only one who remembers that little Chinese demonstration back in my youth ? ) .
People keep saying that China has no ambition to conquer other nations , but to the Indians , Tibet and Taiwan look like obvious warnings .
But once India got nukes , what choice did Pakistan have but to develop a nuke in order to keep the Indian military from using their nukes to prevail in the constant struggle between Urdu- speaking Muslims and Hindi- speaking Hindus across that permeable and blood - soaked border ?
Meanwhile , in another little corner of Asia , Israel may or may not have developed a nuclear weapon .
They 've never tested one , so officially the U.S. does n't " know " whether Israel has such a weapon ; but at the same time , the rumor that they have one works as a powerful deterrent against those nations that like to talk a lot about wiping Israel off the face of the earth .
Of course they have one .
Of course it works , tested or not .
Even those who like to tell terrible lies about how horrible Jews are absolutely believe that Jews are smart enough to build anything they want to build .
And then in 1989 the world changed .
The Soviet Union crumbled .
And now the Soviet missile fleet was divided among three nations : Russia , Ukraine , and Kazakhstan .
Of these , only Ukraine decided to dismantle its nuclear capability .
And though there are doubts about how long a shelf life the Kazakhstani nukes might have , we still have to consider them a nuclear power .
Now North Korea claims -- without proof , but with considerable credibility -- that it has a working nuke .
Nobody wants to bet on its being a dud .
And Iran is working on its own weapon , with a high likelihood of success within a few years .
The only reason Iraq was not already on the list was a certain raid by the Israeli Air Force a few decades ago .
That and the fact that after the Gulf War , Saddam decided that instead of building a nuke , he'd buy one , and nobody had yet sold him one when we toppled him from power .
* Is Deterrence Working ?
Which brings us to the big question about proliferation :
So what ?
The nuclear " club " now has nine proclaimed members , eight of them with proven weapons ( all but North Korea ) , and one stealth member ( Israel ) which may soon be joined by another ( Iran ) .
Yet in all these years , nobody has blown up anybody 's city , and any fallout deaths were the result of ignorance about the danger of nuclear testing .
Nobody has used a nuke as a weapon since 1945 .
Well , not really .
We in the nuclear club have actually used nukes constantly as weapons -- weapons to deter other nations from taking military actions we do n't want them to take .
Israel might well owe its continued existence to that nuke is might or might not have .
India probably has n't punished Pakistan for supporting terrorism against them because Pakistan has that nuke .
Russia never disciplined China for its disobedience -- partly , at least , because China had a nuke .
So nuclear weapons have done one of the jobs that military power is designed to accomplish : prevent the enemy from carrying out its will , because of the fear of effective retaliation .
* Deterrence Breakdown
The more that nukes spread , the more dangerous they become .
The Iranian nuke , for instance , might be regarded as one more in the chain of proliferation from Russia to China to India to Pakistan -- each nation acquiring a nuke solely to deter a known enemy from using theirs .
Shi'ite Iran , after all , sits right next to Sunni Pakistan , a nation they have no love for .
And it is quite possible that Iran will be just as slow to use nuclear weapons as Pakistan and India and China have been .
Is n't our real reason for wanting to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon because they are our enemy , actively supporting terrorism ?
It 's not that they would give a nuke to a terrorist group .
It 's that their having a nuke would keep us from invading them in order to stop them from supporting terrorism .
We can imagine a world in equilibrium , sort of , with Iran having a nuclear weapon .
Though of course Turkey would need to acquire one next .
The real point of breakdown is in North Korea , where there is already a madman running the government .
There is no government on earth , with the possible exception of Zimbabwe , that is governed as badly by leaders as insane as those ruling North Korea .
And North Korea does n't need a cause .
They have only to decide that it 's time to get even with Japan for its crimes against the Korean people and lob a missile onto Tokyo .
That would , of course , be the last nuclear weapon North Korea ever fired ... but the maddening thing is that we do n't want even that first one to go off .
Japan already paid for its crimes by what happened at Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
But to the madmen of Korea , it wo n't count until the nuclear weapon comes from Korean soil , making a Korean statement .
And that 's one of the most difficult things about dealing with North Korea 's nuke :
Too many South Koreans regard it , not as the nuclear weapon of the madmen in the north , but as the Korean National Weapon .
They trust ( though not for any good reason ) that Pyongyang would never use their nuke against South Korea .
They believe ( again , not for any good reason ) that soon both Koreas will be united , and then the possession of a nuclear weapon will give prestige and power to all Koreans .
So for us to invade North Korea and take away their nukes , even if China agreed to stand back and allow us to do it , would be extremely unpopular in South Korea .
And without South Korean backing , exactly where would we launch this " invasion " from ?
It 's a stalemate that only China can break -- and , possessing nukes themselves , they believe ( again without any good reason ) that they will never be threatened by North Korea 's nuke .
So why should they save Japan or South Korea ?
Let us twist in the wind , they say .
In other words , we are now living in a world where madmen control nukes and we can't easily stop them from using them without committing the unthinkable act of making an unprovoked nuclear attack against North Korea .
No other weapon we possess can reach them without the help of allies and the consent of opponents .
And there ai n't no way any U.S. government is going to use nukes .
So I guess we 'd better visit Tokyo soon , or not go at all .
Or else we 'll trust that nations that possess such terrible power will somehow manage to keep their leaders from using it .
Too bad that Saddam in Iraq and Assad in Syria already proved that there is no act so barbaric you can't find people willing to carry it out .
The one bright spot in all this is that no nation that possesses nukes is likely to turn them over to terrorists ... knowingly , anyway .
Especially to unconditional terrorists like Al - Qaeda , who might very well want to set off a nuke any old where , because they love the idea of civilization coming to a collapse in nuclear chaos .
They think it would give God such a lovely chance to show his power .
Which brings us to Kazakhstan , with all those old weapons .
It 's a majority Muslim country .
Their security on those nuclear sites is not the best .
There might be people in that impoverished country who think that they could make a buck by selling nukes that probably wo n't work anyway .
There are still plenty of genies to be let out of bottles .
What is the future of the one real Weapon of Mass Destruction ?
Nukes will spread .
And someone , somewhere , someday , is going to set one off .
The real questions are :
Are there any steps the U.S. and its few allies might take that could realistically lessen the chance of that happening ?
And if there are , will we take them ?

Elisheva Frankel started to get the kind of joint pain most people associate with the elderly when she was only six years old .
By the time she reached her teens , her joint pain had become severe , and she was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis .
By then the damage to the joints in her left wrist was permanent .
The disease would flare up painfully at times .
“ I had to miss my junior year of high school because I could n’t get out of the house , ” she said .
“ I was in a lot of pain . ”
As many as 50,000 children in the United States are afflicted with a childhood version of rheumatoid arthritis .
Some children grow out of their arthritis to lead normal lives , while others , like Frankel , continue to suffer the cumulative effects of joint damage .
She had tried a variety of drugs like steroids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) — with side effects including weight gain , anxiety and the jitters .
The drugs were not completely effective in stopping the progression of her illness , and her doctors had begun to consider surgery for her wrist .
As a last resort , they decided to try a new drug called Enbrel that had just been released a year earlier .
“ Enbrel changed my life , ” said Frankel , who can now enjoy running and other activities without pain .
Enbrel is part of a new class of arthritis medications that appears to be revolutionizing the treatment of some kinds of arthritis with fewer perceptible side effects than other drugs .
Because how effective these drugs are , and the lower level of patient discomfort , this class of drugs has become widely used — and not just for rheumatoid arthritis , but also for other inflammatory diseases like psoriasis , and Crohn ’s disease .
But the popularity of these drugs is raising issues in experts ’ minds about what the long - term side effects might be , and whether those risks are worth it for patients with less debilitating diseases than arthritis .
As more and more of these drugs gain Food and Drug Administration acceptance for use in milder disease , their availability and acceptance increases .
A recent study found that this type of drug carries a bigger risk of cancer than was originally thought — and some experts are worried that patients might not be aware of the potentially serious consequences they could face .
If the “ hot new drug with surprisingly few side effects ” title sounds familiar , that ’s because it is :
That ’s how Vioxx was described after it was approved in 1999 .
The drug was initially approved for treating pain associated with several kinds of arthritis , and later the Food and Drug Administration approved it for milder indications such as migraines and acute pain in adults .
Vioxx and other Cox - 2 inhibitors were hailed as a revolution in the treatment of pain — gone were the uncomfortable side effects associated with the older generation anti-inflammatory drugs , like gastric upset .
Soon Vioxx was used across the globe and had become one of Merck ’s blockbuster drugs .
But long - term studies , conducted after the drug was released , revealed that Vioxx increased its users ’ risk of heart attack and stroke .
Suddenly the risks were no longer worth the benefit for people using the drug for milder conditions .
In September 2004 , Merck withdrew the drug from the market , although some patients with severe arthritic pain might have accepted the higher risks if it meant relief from daily pain .
A difficulty that continually faces drug makers and consumers is that long - term effects of a drug are often not known until a new drug is released to the general public and used for a number of years .
Enbrel has been on the market for just over seven years — not long enough for doctors to extrapolate long - term side effects like cancer , which can take a longer time to develop .
But a study published in last month ’s Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) extrapolated those long - term side effects by combining data from many past trials , rather than waiting decades to evaluate the consequences of the widespread use of Enbrel and related drugs .
Tim Bongartz of the Mayo Clinic and his colleagues compiled data from nine different early clinical trials of two of the three TNF - alpha inhibitors , which prevent inflammation by blocking the chemical TNF - alpha , part of the immune system .
The study looked at trials of Remicade , made by Centocor ( owned by Johnson and Johnson ) and Humira , made by Abbott .
Enbrel , made by Wyeth and Amgen , was excluded .
With data from such a large pool of rheumatoid arthritis patients , researchers were able to examine how rare some of the side effects really were .
The study concluded that patients using TNF - alpha inhibitors are 3.3 times as likely to get cancer and 2 times as likely to get a serious infection as a group of patients who used standard treatment or nothing .
While these risks may be acceptable for patients with diseases like rheumatoid arthritis , which in some cases painfully cripples and disfigures the joints of the body , the risk might not be worth it for less severe diseases .
Enbrel is also being used for psoriasis , in which raised splotches of red flaky skin appear on the body and cause itchiness .
The disease is not physically debilitating , but can be socially and emotionally damaging in severe cases when the red patches cover large and externally visible areas of the body .
Enbrel was the only TNF - alpha inhibitor approved for treating moderate to severe psoriasis , until September of this year when the FDA approved Remicade .
But regardless of FDA approval , many doctors were already prescribing TNF - alpha inhibitors to their patients with psoriasis .
This practice , known as “ off - label prescribing , ” is perfectly legal and common with all types of drugs .
And although drug companies are not allowed to advertise their drugs for off - label uses , all three makers of TNF - alpha inhibitors continue to gain immensely from the considerable number of psoriasis patients looking for effective treatment .
There are about 6.6 million people in the U.S with psoriasis .
But patients are eligible for TNF - alpha inhibitors only when they have moderate to severe cases of psoriasis , in which three percent or more of the body is covered with the disease ( one percent is about a palm - sized patch of skin ) .
If the entire population of eligible psoriasis patients were to take this drug — about 1.5 million people — the U.S. could see roughly 11,000 more cases of cancer for every year the drugs were taken .
The longer the drugs are used , the more new cancers are likely to occur .
These results were n’t a huge surprise to some doctors .
The package inserts for this class of drugs warn of the risk of serious infections and the possibility of cancer .
TNF - alpha inhibitors block part of the body ’s natural inflammation process , which is overactive in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis .
These diseases arise when the body ’s TNF - alpha mistakenly recruits the immune system to fight against healthy parts of the body — a condition called autoimmunity .
The immune system attacks and causes inflammation in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis , or the skin in psoriasis .
But inflammation also helps fight infection , and can help keep cancer in check , according to Jan Geliebter , a professor of immunology at New York Medical College .
“ We ’d be in big trouble if we got rid of all of the TNF - alpha in our bodies , ” he said .
While it may not have been surprising , the JAMA study was important because it gave an actual estimate of risk in concrete numbers , showing that serious side effects may be more common than doctors realized .
After a few years on Enbrel , Elisheva Frankel experienced one of these side effects first hand .
She came down with cellulitis , a potentially life threatening bacterial skin infection , which began to spread rapidly on her arm .
She was treated with antibiotics at the hospital and recovered , but these types of infections can be deadly for people taking TNF - alpha inhibitors if they are not treated quickly and appropriately .
People faced with a choice of surgery or permanent joint damage might choose a higher risk of cancer if it helps them live their lives more fully .
Eric Matteson from the Mayo Clinic , another researcher on the TNF - alpha study , said it ’s important to remember that “ these drugs have made people ’s lives immensely better . ”
But would a person with psoriasis make the same decision to take the drug if they understood the risk ?
There are still a number of questions the study does not answer .
Are the risks the same for Enbrel , the drug that Frankel uses , as they are for the two drugs included in the study ?
According to the authors , Enbrel was excluded because it blocks TNF - alpha slightly differently than do Humira and Remicade .
However , Matteson , a key investigator in the study , conceded that all three drugs have about the same effect in the patient , and the FDA considers all three drugs to have similar side effects .
Another question unaddressed by the study is whether the risks for patients with rheumatoid arthritis are the same as the risks for patients with psoriasis .
Mark Lebwohl , a member of the Medical Advisory Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation , says he thinks both sets of patients face the same risks .
However , Matteson from the Mayo Clinic disagrees .
He said patients with rheumatoid arthritis start out with a higher risk of some kinds of cancer , which could make them more susceptible to that particular side effect of immunosuppressive drugs like TNF - alpha inhibitors .
What is clear is that the pharmaceutical companies that sell TNF - alpha inhibitors stand to gain huge sales from the psoriasis market , even in the U.S. alone .
Enbrel is the number one prescribed non-topical drug for psoriasis , despite being also being one of the most expensive .
According to Med Ad News , part of the Biotech Communications Group , Enbrel was ranked 10th of all pharmaceutical products sold around the globe .
Potentially muddying the issue is the fact that the two organizations that serve as a resource for doctors who treat psoriasis accept large grants from the major manufacturers of Enbrel , Humira and Remicade .
Both the National Psoriasis Foundation and the American Academy of Dermatology link to articles and educational sites that extol the benefits of TNF - inhibitors , offering a disclaimer that their sites are funded in part by the drug makers .
In general , doctors treating psoriasis and those treating rheumatoid arthritis agree that TNF - alpha inhibitors are serious drugs , not to be given to people with mild disease .
Practicing dermatologist David Cohen , an associate professor in the dermatology department of New York University ’s medical school , often treats psoriasis patients .
He said he would n’t prescribe Enbrel to a patient who came to him with psoriasis because of its considerable side effects .
“ I would send them to a rheumatologist , ” he said , or to another specialist who could monitor their reaction to the drug more carefully .
But how severe a patient ’s disease must be before a TNF - alpha inhibitor is prescribeed is left to each doctor ’s discretion .
Lebwohl , a practicing dermatologist , says that insurance companies often require patients to fail the cheaper and more widely used alternative therapies before they will cover the cost of these drugs .
However , he added that TNF - alpha inhibitors could be useful for people who “ ca n’t make it in three times a week for UV treatment , ” which is one of the safest and most effective dermatologists have for psoriasis .
The reputation and undeniable effectiveness of TNF - alpha inhibitors means these drugs have the potential to be over - prescribed to psoriasis patients who want to see results , but do n’t fully realize the extent of the risks .
Despite the side effects , this class of drugs is filling an important therapeutic hole .
They improve the lives of patients who have failed every other arthritis treatment and they ’ve let children suffering from rheumatoid arthritis return to the playgrounds .
Elisheva Frankel , who has temporarily gone off Enbrel to have her first child , says that when she goes back on medication she will try other rheumatoid arthritis drugs first .
But because of the advent of drugs like Enbrel , she says she can foresee a time when rheumatoid arthritis will no longer be considered the crippling disease it is today .
One common pattern I ’ve seen with small tech companies is how their initial success by focusing on self - driven engineering talent creates problems they are completely unequipped to solve .
I call this the start - up management inflection point .
The premise :
Small engineering start - up is born , does well , hires like mad .
Heavy hiring bias for self - driven solo programmer prodigies .
Company grows ; scores of engineers are productive , but conflicts and miscommunications rise .
Soon primary challenge is n’t quality programmers : it ’s organizing them .
No matter how self - directed programmers are , eventually their utility declines as ambiguities in direction , conflicts in direction and ownership increase .
When a certain size is reached , likely 100 to 200 , the company changes because of scale effects .
But scale effects are hard to recognize , predict or compensate for .
Hiring more brilliant engineers wo n’t solve this problem .
The trap :
The organization has history of success without management talent .
The staff has biases against depending on management to solve problems ( that ’s why they joined a startup ) .
Organizational leaders are engineers first , managers second ( or fifth ) .
This may include the founders and CEO , who ’s only sanity check on management philosophy is themselves .
Even if leaders want better management , it ’s not a strength .
Worse , they ’re trying to improve management in an environment resistant to it .
Dozens of tech - sector companies are stuck in this trap and have been for years .
They have manager to programmer ratios of 15 to 1 , bad user experiences ( a common result of different programmers designing things differently ) and consensus driven decision making models that squander programmer brilliance .
For awhile the fast pace of changes hides these problems , but soon those with more experience realize the effectiveness of individuals has dropped dramatically .
So what ’s the solution ?
The answers come fast if everyone has shared goals .
Someone has to call out this new kind of problem : the meta problem of scaling up #s of people , and make managing it a top goal .
Talent and passion alone are not the solution to this new kind of problem .
Good questions include :
What are the symptoms ?
The pain points ?
Which teams have been best at overcoming them ?
worst ?
What can be copied or emulated from the good teams , or from other similarly sized startups ?
With those questions fresh in everyones mind overcoming the inflection point is possible .
Goals start - ups need at the inflection point :
We want everyone to be as productive and happy as possible
We want programmers to be as autonomous as possible , without diminishing # 1
We are a different company and need to actively ensure those things are still true
With pain points + goals , the magic happens .
People can see why surgical addition of management structure , or smarter ways to work when you have teams of teams , are logically necessary .
It ’s the same smart , no - frills behavior that ’s gotten the company to where it is , just applied to a different dimension .
Tactics to use to get past the inflection point :
The pain points of any growing start - up vary .
But here ’s a starter list of common tactics that should be considered .
Create an empowered team lead role , for people talented at leading , communicating and organizing .
This is a different skill from writing great code : recognize your best leads wo n’t necessarily be your best coders .
Invest in rewarding , hiring and training for this role .
Do n’t default to making your best programmers leads , as that is classic Peter Principle behavior .
If you create the role , do n’t create rules or procedures .
The leads will self - create with their teams as needed .

Reward folks who use their authority appropriately .

Make every VP or senior manager say the word Delegate , 5 times a day , and at least once before every meeting .
As start - ups scale , founder types often become bottlenecks : they have to learn to get out of the way .

Have every VP or senior manager wear a t - shirt that says “ Hit me if I Micromanage you ” every Wednesday : call it Micromanagement recovery day .
Serve beer , pizza and smash magnifying glasses with hammers .
( See An Open Letter To Micromanagers )

( See An Open Letter To Micromanagers )
Use a simple process for planning work .
XP , lightweight specs , something – it ’s unavoidable , but it does n’t have to suck and you do need to have one .
More people means more dependencies , and eventually retroactively handling dependencies costs you more than catching them before you write code .
Let teams experiment with methods until ones that work best are discovered .
Whatever you do , clarify the reasons / goals before you do it .
Then check in with all the impacted parties in 2 weeks after the change , and see if the pain is gone .
If it ’s not , stop or change what you did , and try again .

Ted Landau 's User Friendly View - Before You Buy an Intel Mac
by Ted Landau
January 24th , 2006
< script language = " JavaScript " src= " https://bullseye.backbeatmedia.com/bullseye/adserver/253/280/viewJScript?pool=3160&type=3158&pos=9&zone=5000&redirect=ajs&dontcount=1 "></script> < noscript >< a href= " https://adserver1.backbeatmedia.com/servlet/ajrotator/253/280/clickCGI?pos=9&zone=5000 " >< img src= " https://bullseye.backbeatmedia.com/bullseye/adserver/253/280/viewCGI?pool=3160&type=3158&pos=9&zone=5000&redirect=ajs&dontcount=1 " border= " 0 " ></a></noscript>
It 's official .
The first Intel Macs were announced on January 10 at Macworld Expo .
An Intel - based iMac is already shipping and a 15 " MacBook Pro will ship next month .
Perhaps you are already chomping at the bit , anxious to get one of these new speed demons for yourself .
I understand .
In fact , I ordered a new iMac the same day they were announced .
But it 's my job to jump into the deep end of the new technology pool .
Before you rush out and order a new Mac , take a deep breath , pause and consider the following :
• If there is any guaranteed axiom about purchasing a Mac , it 's this :
Do n't buy a Mac during the holiday season .
Major announcements are always made at Macworld Expo in January .
That means there is a good chance that any Mac you buy prior to New Year 's will immediately be replaced by something newer , cheaper and twice as good .
Still , if you were eyeing the iMac , you might have thought that this was the year to assume an exception to the rule .
After all , it was only October 12 that Apple unveiled a significant upgrade to the iMac ( with a remote control and built - in iSight camera ) .
What were the odds that Apple would replace it in less than 3 months ?
Very good , as it turned out .
Apple surprised nearly everyone by releasing an Intel - based iMac .
I know .
This advice is too late to help you for 2005 , but it 's something to remember for 2006 .
• Speaking of everyone being surprised , the rumor sites pretty much got it all wrong this time around .
As a group , they predicted Intel - based iBooks and Mac minis .
Instead , we got Intel - based iMacs and the MacBook Pro .
At least they were right that an Intel - based something would be released .
But that 's not saying too much .
Which is why you should n't depend on rumors to make your purchasing decisions .
• Many pundits have tried to minimize the significance of Apple shifting to Intel processors .
You read things such as : " Who cares what 's running inside the machine , as long as everything still works the same ? "
This logic works well if we are discussing shifting from one DVD drive manufacturer to another .
But a processor shift really is a big deal .
For starters , not everything works the same on Intel Macs .
In particular , for your current software to run on an Intel Mac , it needs either to be upgraded to a " universal binary " version or be able to run in Rosetta ( the PowerPC emulator included as part of Mac OS X for Intel Macs ) .
Some notable software does not yet fit in either category .
This includes Apple 's own Pro apps ( e.g. , Final Cut Studio , Aperture , and Logic ) .
Apple says updated Pro apps will be out by April .
Similarly , Microsoft 's Virtual PC will not run on Intel Macs .
Microsoft says that it is studying the feasibility of an upgrade , but has made no formal commitment as yet .
[ As noted by a reader and by my own subsequent testing since I first wrote this column , AppleWorks does work on Intel iMacs .
Accordingly , I have edited out comments indicating that the contrary might be true . ]
Many shareware and freeware utilities will also need to be updated to run on Intel Macs .
Check out sites such as VersionTracker.com to see if your favorite utilities are in this category .
I do n't want to be an alarmist here .
Many , many programs will work just fine on Intel Macs ( although , if the program uses Rosetta , it will likely run slower than on a comparable PowerPC Mac ) .
And those that do not work today will likely be upgraded soon .
Still , if you can afford to wait awhile before buying a new Mac , you can bypass even these minor transition headaches .
• There is no more Classic environment in Mac OS X for Intel - based Macs .
If you used Classic at all , for any programs whatsoever , it 's time to bid them adieu .
• Do n't expect a new Intel - based Mac to have the 2X to 5X speed boost ( as compared to the latest G5 iMac and PowerBook G4 ) touted in Apple 's ads .
These claims are based on benchmark tests .
While such tests are a useful way to make relative comparisons of different computers , they do n't simulate real world usage — where factors such as the speed of your hard drive and the nature of the software you use play a bigger role .
These can be a bottleneck , slowing down the otherwise indicated speed .
Steve admitted as much at his keynote .
Still , you should see a noticeable speed improvement .
And if you are going from a G3 or G4 iMac , you will likely be very impressed by how much faster a new iMac is .
• If , despite all of the above , you are still determined to buy an Intel Mac before the day is over , I recommend sticking with the iMac for now .
It is basically the same machine as the current G5 iMac , except for the shift in processors .
So , aside from potential problems due to the Intel processor itself , you can be confident that there wo n't be any " new model " glitches and bugs to be worked out .
The 15 " MacBook Pro , in contrast , although similar in design to the current PowerBooks , is a fundamentally new architecture .
As such , there is a much greater potential for as - yet - undiscovered problems .
Especially as it is n't even shipping yet .
Hardware design issues usually get addressed in a revised upgrade that comes out about 3 - 4 months later .
So you might want to wait for that .
But there 's an even more compelling reason to wait :
It is virtually certain that a 12 " and 17 " MacBook Pro are waiting in the wings , set to replace the current PowerBook models of the same size .
My money says that these notebooks will have significant new features not included in the current 15 ” MacBook Pro .
When these models get released , the 15 " model will be similarly upgraded so as to maintain feature parity .
I 'd wait to see these " real " MacBook Pros before I bought one .
Remember , it 's a fact , not a rumor , that every Mac will be transitioned to Intel processors before the end of 2006 ( probably well before the end ) .
So you know they are coming .
• Do n't try to boot an Intel Mac from an external hard drive that was formatted with a version of Mac OS X 10.4.4 installed from a PowerPC Mac .
It wo n't work .
The converse is true as well .
It turns out that there are two separate versions of 10.4.4 and each one is machine specific .
Apple promises to eventually release one universal version of Mac OS X , but it is not there yet .
If this is a cause for concern for you , it is yet another reason to consider waiting before you purchase .
• Do n't buy any devices that require FireWire 800 .
Apple dropped the 800 port from the MacBook Pro ( and it was neither on the old or new iMac ) .
When I asked Apple about this , they replied that customer feedback indicated a lack of demand for this feature , so they dropped it .
The Intel - based replacements for the desktop Power Macs may still sport this port , but it is otherwise gone .
• If you still use a dial - up connection to the Internet , now is an especially good time to think about moving to broadband .
The new Intel Macs do not come with a built - in modem ( although you can buy an external modem as an accessory ) .
• The built - in iSight camera , included with both the iMac and the MacBook Pro , is an excellent idea overall ( eliminating the extra bulk and cost of a separate camera ) .
However , there is one notable downside :
You can't move the camera separately from the display .
This means you cannot position the camera to the side of the display ( to perhaps get a better angle on your face ) , turn the camera to face the display ( useful to show someone else what is on your screen ) , or conveniently hold it in your hand to scan barcodes ( as you might want to do with the popular Delicious Library program ) .
All of that said , the new Intel Macs are great looking machines , with an impressive range of features and significantly greater speed than the models they replace .
Over time , you will need an Intel - based Mac just to keep up with the latest software and hardware ( just as Macs with PowerPC processors eventually replaced the 68xxx Macs ) .
Intel Macs are undeniably the wave of the future .
You may not want to ride the wave just yet , but you will be riding it soon enough .
2006 is shaping up to be a very interesting year .

Doctors also caution against chasing an anti-anxiety pill with a drink , because alcohol functions as a “ powerful augmenter ” to benzodiazepines like Xanax , said Dr. William Rickles , an assistant clinical professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California , Los Angeles .
Unlike with powerful barbiturates , the mix “ does n’t drop your blood pressure and does n’t stop you breathing , so it does n’t kill you , ’’ Dr. Rickles said .
“ But you might sleep for a long time . ”
FOR some fliers , sleep is the goal .
Dr. Neil B. Kavey , director of the Sleep Disorders Center at NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center , said he has witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of patients who use these sleep drugs for flights — most to combat jet lag , but some who simply knock themselves out to avoid anxiety — over the last year or two .
“ When I noticed the increase , I worried a bit if I would see people awakening on airplanes too heavily drugged , ” he said .
“ But I do n’t think I ’ve had any incidents . ”
The new generation of prescription sleep drugs , which includes Sonata and Lunesta as well as the popular Ambien , is marketed as safer than an older generation of sleeping pills .
( Ambien became a cocktail - party topic earlier this year , after reports that some users claimed they went on eating binges or driving excursions they did n’t remember .
And last summer , a London - bound plane was diverted after a passenger who later said that he had taken Ambien — and drank two individual - serving bottles of wine — tore off his shirt and made threatening remarks . )
Paul Taylor , a hair colorist in White Plains , was an unnerved air traveler who had to experiment with anti-anxiety drugs to find one that worked for him .
Mr. Taylor , a native of South Africa who has been flying home routinely for years , said he developed a severe aversion to air travel after a trip in the late 1990 ’s that required an emergency landing .
Then a few years ago , a sympathetic acquaintance gave him a Valium for an upcoming trip to Seattle .
He tried it .
Nothing .
On the flight , Valium failed to “ shut down the little people in my brain , as I call them , ” said Mr. Taylor , 43 , referring to his neuroses .
“ I was literally grabbing onto the arm of my partner the whole way and freaking out . ”
A year or so later he confessed his fears to a doctor , who prescribed Xanax .
Thanks to that , combined with the cognitive therapy he learned from the Soar program , for him the skies have never been , well , quieter .
Although doctors and therapists confirm that drug use among jittery fliers is common , it is impossible to measure how common , because many people who pop the occasional pill do so without mentioning it to any professionals , especially if they received it from a friend .
When ‘ Smart ’ Cut / Copy / Paste Attacks
If you ’re young enough that your first computer was a Mac or a Windows PC , you probably can’t fathom just how big a deal Cut / Copy / Paste were when they were introduced as standard features of all applications .
Pre -Macintosh , it was generally quite tricky to copy something from one program into another .
1
C/C/P changed that .
There were three great things about C/ C/ P , right from the get - go :
It ’s incredibly useful .
Again , though , if you ’re too young to remember computing before ubiquitous C/ C/P , you probably can’t help but take it for granted .
It ’s my generation trying to appreciate color television .
It ’s incredibly simple and obvious what it is and how it works .
Everyone “ gets ” C/C/ P.
The three commands have perfect keyboard shortcuts ( at least on QWERTY keyboards . )
Copy is the only one of the three that uses the obvious mnemonic shortcut ( ⌘C on the Mac , Ctrl - C on Windows and on open source Windows rip - offs ) .
⌘ X for Cut feels right , though — there ’s something that feels X -y about “ cutting ” something ; plus , the X key is conveniently located right next door to C .
So those two shortcuts were fairly obvious ; the genius decision was using ⌘V for Paste .
There ’s absolutely nothing V-y about “ pasting ” .
But the reason it works so well as a shortcut is that the action of pasting is so strongly related to the actions of cutting and copying that the shortcut seems to demand an adjacent position on the keyboard .
Apple even reinforced this relationship with the commands ’ order in the Edit menu : Cut , Copy , Paste ; X , C , V. [ Update :
Over a dozen readers have already emailed me to suggest that there is something V-y about pasting : that the shape of the letter V suggests the upside - down caret editing mark used to indicate a place of insertion .
That had never occurred to me , but it ’s a reasonable mnemonic . ]
And that other brilliant “ you goddamn kids probably can’t believe we ever got along without it ” standard Edit menu command , Undo , fits right into this order .
It ’s the Z key ’s location on the keyboard that makes ⌘ Z feel so natural for “ undo ” .
2
C/C/P has evolved a bit over the years , but in large part remains the same as it was on the original Mac .
These three commands really are self - explanatory .
They do exactly what you expect them to .
Except , now , when they do n’t .
A few weeks ago I noticed that most NSText View - based apps now use a rather annoying “ smart ” C/C/ P implementation .
3 NSText
View is the standard built - in text - editing control in Cocoa , so this applies to most — but not all — Cocoa applications that allow you to edit text .
The app I noticed it in is MarsEdit , but it ’s also present in TextEdit , so feel free to use TextEdit if you want to play along at home .
Here ’s an example .
Start with this text :
<b></b> foo
Select the word “ foo ” by double - clicking on it , then invoke Cut .
The first bit of “ smartness ” here is that the trailing space after the “ < /b > ” is removed along with the word “ foo ” , even though it was n’t part of the selection .
Now place the insertion point between “ < b > ” and “ < / b > ” .
Paste .
What I expect is :
< b> foo</b>
But what I actually get is :
< b > foo </b>
I find this infuriating .
What ’s worse though , is that if you go back to the beginning :
<b></b> foo
and select “ foo ” by clicking and dragging across the three letters comprising the word , then you do n’t get any of this “ smart ” C/C/ P behavior .
The trailing space after the “ < /b > ” is n’t removed when you cut , and when you paste , it does n’t add any unwanted spaces before or after the pasted text .
Technical Interpolation on the Word- Selection Techniques That Trigger ‘ Smart ’ C/C / P
I use a custom DefaultKeyBinding .
dict file that allows me to add and adjust the default editing shortcuts for NSTextView and NSText View - derived editing fields .
One of my entries in that file binds Ctrl - L to the selectWord : selector :
" ^l " = " selectWord : " ;
This means that when I type Ctrl - L , it selects the current word , where “ current word ” means whatever word the insertion point is adjacent to or within — pretty much exactly as though I ’d double - clicked the mouse cursor on the exact spot where the insertion point is .
4
If I use this keyboard shortcut to select a word , I also get the “ smart ” C/C/ P behavior when I cut the selection and when pasting it subsequently .
If I use regular keyboard text - selection keystrokes , such as Shift - Arrow or Shift - Option - Arrow , then I get the regular old - fashioned “ just cut the selection and do n’t do anything fancy regarding surrounding spaces ” C/C/P behavior .
Word to the Wise
So the point here is that you get very different C/C / P behavior depending upon how you make your selection .
Double - clicking with your mouse ( or using a shortcut based on NSText View ’s selectWord : selector ) puts you into a word - wise selection mode , and selections made in this mode are treated differently than normal selections .
Is word - wise selection a shortcut , or is it an entirely different action than regular click - and - drag selection ?
I say it ’s a shortcut , and I think that ’s certainly how most users — especially the vast non-technical majority — think .
But this Cocoa “ smart ” C/C/ P behavior forces you , the user , to think of them as different actions , and to think that , you have to understand what ’s going on .
And because most users clearly have no idea that “ word - wise ” selection is a different mode than normal selection , the result is that from most users ’ perspective , this “ smart ” C/C/ P behavior seemingly kicks in at random .
I.e. the worst part about this is n’t the “ smart ” C/C/ P behavior itself , which I find irritating but which let ’s concede for the moment might conceivably be deemed useful by some .
( Obviously , someone at Apple thinks it ’s useful . )
The worst part is that unless you understand that word - wise selection puts you into a special mode , the “ smart ” C/C/ P behavior seems to kick in at random .
Sometimes spaces are removed and added automatically , sometimes they are n’t .
Features that seem to kick in at random are bad features .
In this case , Apple has taken a very simple , completely obvious feature — a feature that almost every user completely understood — and turned it into something governed by a complicated and undocumented set of rules that most users do n’t even know exist .
They ’ve exchanged the elegant simplicity of traditional C/C/ P for the very marginal benefit of sometimes having word - bordering spaces taken care of for you automatically .
“ Smart ” editing features are often more trouble than they ’re worth .
Many of the common complaints about Microsoft Word , for example , revolve around the on - by - default features where it gets too smart for its own good .
( Remember Clippy the “ I see you ’re trying to write a business letter ” animated paperclip from Office 97 ?
Or just try to enter a URL in Word without having it automatically turned into a blue underlined hyperlink . )
Once software starts down this path of guessing what it is the user is trying to do , and then doing something special based on that guess , it must guess correctly nearly every time , because the times when it guesses wrong are so annoying that they far outweigh the extra convenience of the times when it guesses right .
Software that eschews the clever for the obvious — in this case , using good old - fashioned “ what you see selected is what you get ” C/C/ P behavior — will always do exactly what the user expects .
That ’s what people mean when they talk about intuitive software design .
The report by Argentine prosecutors in support of the arrest warrants just issued for seven former Iranian officials for the 1994 terror bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires reveals that Argentina was continuing to provide Iran with low - grade enriched uranium and the two countries were in serious negotiations on broader nuclear cooperation when the bombing occurred .
The new revelations on Argentine - Iranian relations in the Oct. 25 report by prosecutors Alberto Nisman and Marcello Marquez Burgos undermine the official argument that Iran ’s top leaders were motivated to order the bombing by Argentina ’s decision in 1992 to cut off its supply of nuclear materials to Iran .
The new information underlines the fact that Rafsanjani and other Iranian officials still viewed Argentina as willing to cooperate with Iran on the sensitive subject of nuclear technology , despite U.S. pressures to end that cooperation .
The arrest warrants for former Iranian president Ali Akbar Rafsanjani and six other former top Iranian officials were issued only after the United States had applied diplomatic pressure , according to a Nov. 3 report by Marc Perelman in the Jewish daily Forward .
Perelman also reported that the George W. Bush administration intends to cite the indictment as part of its campaign to get Russia and China to support a Security Council resolution on sanctions against Iran .
The main theory about Iran ’s motive for ordering the bombing of the headquarters of the Jewish organization AMIA on July 18 , 1994 , which killed 85 people , is that Iran wanted to retaliate against Argentina for its decision to cut off exports of nuclear materials .
That motive was asserted by former Iranian intelligence officer Abdolghassem Mesbahi in a 2002 deposition and repeated in a report by the Argentine intelligence service , SIDE , in September 2002 .
A related theory advanced by the prosecutors is that Iran was angry at the government of Carlos Menem for realigning its foreign policy more closely with that of the United States , for example , by sending warships to the Persian Gulf during the U.S. war there in 1991 .
But the prosecutor ’s report shows that Argentina never completely terminated its nuclear cooperation with Iran , and that the Iranian and Argentine nuclear organizations that had negotiated the original contracts were negotiating on restoration of full cooperation on all three agreements from early 1992 through 1994 .
The report identifies three distinct agreements reached between Argentina and Iran in 1987 - 88 : the first involved help in converting a nuclear reactor in Tehran so that it could use 20 percent enriched uranium ( i.e. , low - grade uranium , which can not be used for weapons production ) and indicates that it included the shipment of the 20 percent enriched uranium to Iran .
The second and third agreements were for technical assistance , including components , for the building of pilot plants for uranium dioxide conversion and fuel fabrication .
The indictment shows that the United States put strong pressure on the Menem government to terminate all nuclear cooperation with Iran .
In December 1991 , according to the detailed account in the report , the U.S. embassy in Buenos Aires informed Argentina ’s foreign ministry that the United States could not accept the continuation of the contracts on nuclear cooperation with Iran .
In January , Argentina announced the suspension of the shipments of nuclear materials to Iran .
But the report also documents the fact that Iran did not take the suspension as final or anticipate an end to the other contracts on nuclear technology .
According to a Feb. 10 , 2002 , cable from the Argentina ’s ambassador in Iran , an Iranian foreign ministry official reaffirmed to him the " priority " that the Islamic Republic placed on nuclear technology transfer from Argentina and said the foreign policy positions taken by Argentina with which Tehran did not agree  such as sending warships to the Persian Gulf  " apparently did not alter the pragmatic attitude held by Argentina . "
On Feb. 26 , according to the account , the director of the American department of Iran ’s foreign ministry " emphasized the need to reach a solution to the problem that would avoid damage to other contracts . "
Thus Iran was signaling its hope of finding a negotiated solution that could end the suspension and maintain the other contracts with Argentina as well .
Less than three weeks after that Iranian bid for negotiations , on March 17 , 2002 , a bomb blast destroyed the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires , killing 26 people .
Argentina , the United States , and Israel have long maintained that Iran was responsible for both that bombing and the 1994 bombing of the AMIA headquarters .
But it seems unlikely that Iranian leaders would have ordered or knowingly supported any terror bombing in Buenos Aires just when they were concerned with nailing down an agreement to protect Iran ’s important interests in relations with Argentina .
The report goes on to present new information that also appears to rule out an Iranian role in the 1994 AMIA bombing .
It confirms that Menem canceled the second and third nuclear technology contracts with Iran but not the first contract involving the low - enriched uranium .
The prosecutors ’ report further reveals that after the Menem decision , Iran and Argentina entered into serious negotiations aimed at restoring full nuclear cooperation .
The general manager of INVAP , the Argentine firm that dominated the National Commission on Atomic Energy , testified to investigators that during 1992 , there were " contacts " between INVAP and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ( AEOI ) " in the expectation that the decision of the national government would be revised , allowing the tasks in the contracts to be resumed . "
The report does not indicate what results the talks produced .
But an article in the Christian Science Monitor Feb. 18 , 1993 , quoted an Iranian official saying that Iran was still purchasing low - grade uranium from Argentina and said the International Atomic Energy Agency had confirmed that a shipment of low - enriched uranium would arrive in Iran within a year .
From 1993 to 1995 , according to the same INVAP official , the negotiations with the AEOI continued , aimed at " reaching a definitive solution " to the issues surrounding the two canceled projects .
It was not until 1996 , according to the report , that Iran communicated its intention of taking legal action against Argentina over the cancellation of the two nuclear technology contracts .
The new evidence on nuclear technology relations between Iran and Argentina is a serious blow to the credibility of the central assertion in the indictment that Rafsanjani and other former Iranian officials decided at a meeting on Aug. 14 , 1993 , to plan the bombing of AMIA .
That assertion was based entirely on the testimony of Iranian defector Abdolghassem Mesbahi , who was evidently unaware of the continued uranium exports and continuing negotiations revealed in the prosecutors ’ report .
Mesbahi ’s credibility on Iran ’s alleged role in the bombings was also damaged by his spectacular allegation that President Menem had received a $ 10 million payoff from Iran to divert the investigation away from Iranian involvement  an allegation the defector later withdrew .
To square these diplomatic revelations with the charges against Iran , the prosecutors quote what they call a " hypothesis " advanced by SIDE that Iran uses " violence " in order induce " victim countries " to agree to " negotiations convenient to Iran ’s interests . "
But they offer no further evidence to support that theory .
The investigation of the 1994 bombing by the Argentine judiciary , which has no political independence from the executive branch , has had little credibility with the public , because of a bribe by the lead judge to a key witness and a pattern of deceptive accounts based on false testimony .

第 4 版 2008 , 5/1 情報処理技術社試験の中で良く出て来る「待ち行列」理論を，直感的に覚えやすく解説してみました．
何度もトライしたけど待ち行列が理解できない人向けです．
正確な定義や論理展開は重視せず，いかに効率的にこの理論を覚えることができるかに焦点を絞ってみました． 動機
まず，な ぜ「待ち行列」なるものを考えないといけないのか，そもそもどうしてそんな理論が必要なのか，という動機を理解することからはじめます． 風邪をひいちゃった．
病院に行きたいんだけど混んでるしなぁ，
病院行ってかえってこじらしたらやだな．
*** どのくらい待つんだろう？ *** こんな素朴な疑問，誰でももちますよね．この待ち時間を定量的に求めたい，という
のが動機です．もちろん確率の問題ですから，正確には
*** 平均どのくらい待つか *** というのがいいでしょう．これに答えを出すのが「待ち行列理論」ということになります．
必要な情 報
さて，前もって何も情報がなくて「どのくらい待つんだろう」という問には答えられませんね．これの答えを出すためには，
*** どのくらい混んでいるの？ *** という情報が必要です．混み具合も確率の問題となるため，
*** 平均どのくらい混んでいるか *** というのがより正確です．驚くべきとこに，「どのくらい混んでいるか」さえ 分かれば，「どのくらい待つか」という答えがでるのです．これが，この理論の強力なところです．
すこし形式的な言い方をすれば，待ち行列理論では，「平均待ち時間」は，
「 混み具合」という変数のみの関数として表現されます．
いきなり結 論
さて，一気に結論を言ってしまいます．「 混み具合 」 を「 ρ」(ロー)というギリシャ文字で表すと，あなたが医者に行くと，あなたの待つ時間は， 待ち時間 ＝ ρ / ( 1-ρ) [ 人分 ]
です．なんとシンプルなんでしょうか！( 驚いて下さい) ここで， [ 人分 ]
と書いたのは，あなたの前にはすでにρ/(1-ρ)人が並んで待っているということです．実は，この式にはいろんな前提が含まれているのですが，それは置いておいて，待ち行列理論の肝はこの式です．これさえ理解していれば大丈夫．なお，待ち時間の単位については，後で説明します．
0 <= ρ <= 1 でこの式のグラフを書いてみましょう．
ρ/( 1-ρ) = -1/(ρ-1 ) -1 ですから，y=1/x の双曲線をy軸対称に反転し，( 1, -1 ) だけ平行移動したものです． ρ=0 の時に待ち時間は 0 です．ρ=1 に近付くにつれて，待ち時間は急激にはね上がります．ρ=1 では∞になります．(永久に待たされます)
混み具合の表 現
さて，で は 「どのくらい混んでいるか」というのをもう少し正確に定義してみます．
先の病院の例を使うことにします． 混み具合は，「患者がどの位頻繁にくるのか」と「お医者さんがどの位手際良く患者 を診るか」という2つの独立した要素に左右されます．
「 λ」(ラムダ)というギリシャ文字を使って，患者がどのくらい頻繁にくるかを表します．つ まり，「1時間に何人患者がくるか」という量です．これを，「平均到着率」といい ます．この「λ」という文字を良く見ると，頭をうなだれてとぼとぼ歩く患者のイメージが湧きます．
λ ..... とぼとぼ歩く患者 ...とぼとぼとぼ 次に ， 「 μ 」(ミュー)というギリシャ文字を使って，お医者さんの診察の手際良さを表します． つまり，「1時間に何人の患者を診察するか」という量です．これを「平均サービス
率」といいます(自分をサービス業だと思っている医者が増えるとよいですね)．この 「 μ」という文字を良く見ると，お医者さんのカルテのサインに見えませんか?お医者さ
んはドイツ語(最近は英語でしょうか)でカルテを書きます．さらさらと書くので，何
が書いてあるのか気にはなりますがよくわかりません．そのカルテの末尾のサインを
この文字からイメージしてください． μ ..... さらさら書く医者のカルテ...さらさらさら 混み具合は，患者が訪れる頻度と，医者の手際に掛かっています．次のようなモデルを考えると分かりやすいでしょう．
μμμμμ
診る医者
さらさら ← 受け付け ← λλλλλ λ
来る患者
とぼとぼ ここで，混み具 合 「 ρ」を表す準備ができました．λとμの比率がρです．
ρ ＝ λ／μ ( 混み具合 ) ... 利用の回転 ... くるくる 2つの量の比率をとっています．この量でもって，病院の「混み具合」を表現しま
す．ρという字から，サービスがくるくる回る感じをイメージします． この量を「平均利用率」と言います．この量が大きければ「混んでいる」，小さ ければ「すいている」ということです．平均利用率「平均トラフィック密度」，
という言葉も使用されます． ρには単位がありません．単なる比率ですから，0 から 1 までの値，あるいは， 0 % から 100 % までの値をとります．これに対して，λとμは時間を分母に持ちます．
時間の単位はλとμで同じであればなんでもよいです．
もう少し補足します．λは1時間に何人来るか，という量ですが，この逆数を，Ta と いう記号を使って 「 平均到着時間」と言います．つまり，何時間おきに患者は来る
か，という量です( a は arrival の a です ) ． また，μは1時間に何人診るか，という量ですが，この逆数を ,
Ts という記号を 使って 「 平均サービス時間」と言います．つまり，1人あたり何時間掛かるか，とい
う量です(s は service の s です ) ． 混み具合の表現 文字 イメージ 意味 名前 逆数 λ とぼとぼ歩く患者 患者 が1 時間に何人来るか 平均到着率 Ta( 平均到着時間 ) μ さらさら書く医者のカルテ 医者 が1時間に何人患者を診るか 平均サービス率 Ts ( 平均サービス時間 ) ρ=λ /μ くるくる回転 混み具合 平均利用率 これで，どれくらい混んでいるか，が定式化できました．
待ち時間
最初に書いたように， 「 どれくらい混んでいるか」から「 どれくらい待つか」を求め るのが待ち行列理論でしたよね．混み方が定式化できたのだから，もう答えを出してもよいでしょう．
理論の詳細は省き，結論だけ覚えてしまいましょう．答えは，
ρ/( 1-ρ) 人分待つ です．一人当た りTsの時間が掛かるとすると，待つ時間を Tw ( w は wait ) は， Tw = ( ρ/( 1-ρ ) )
Ts とも言えます．あなたが医者へ着いたときには，すでにρ/(1-ρ)人待っているでしょう．と言ってもいいです． これで理論はすべてです．
練習
では，実際の情報処理試験の問題を一問解いて見ましょう．
ある医院では，患者が平均10分間隔でランダムに訪ねてくる。医者は、1人であり、一人の患者の診断および処方の時間は平均8分の指数分布であった。このとき，患者が診察を受け始めるまでの純粋待ち時間は何分か。
上記の問題には，「ランダムに」とか「指数分布」とか書かれています．
実は，これまでの理論はすべて，到着がランダムであること(ポアソン分布 ) ，
それから平均サービス時間が指数分布であることが前提でしたが，
わかりやすさのために，説明を省いていました．ここでは，この条件が，
そろっているのでこれまでの理論をそのまま使うことができます．
さて，順に考えます．まずλ(とぼとぼ )
とμ( さらさら)を求め，そこから混み具合ρを求めましょう．
λ( とぼとぼ ) は， Ta( 平均到着時間 ) の逆数ですから， λ = 1/10 [ 人 /分] です．すなわち，1分に 0.1 人到着します．少数が出てくると分かりにくい人は， λ = 6 [人/時間 ] と考え，1時間で6人くる，と考えて下さい． μ( さらさら ) は，Ts ( 平均サービス時間 ) の逆数ですから， μ = 1/8 [ 人 /分] です．すなわち，1分に 0.125 人診察します．また，時間で考えると， μ = 7.5 [ 人 /時間 ] です． μμμμμμμμu
7.5 さらさら ← 受け付け ← λλλλλ λ
6 とぼとぼ という状況ですね． よって， ρ( 混み具合 ) は，どちらの単位でも同じで， ρ = ( 1/10 ) / ( 1/8 ) = 6/7.5= 0.8 となります．つまり混雑度は 80 % ということです．すると，待ちは， ρ/( 1-ρ) = 0.8/(1-0.8 ) = 4 [ 人分 ] です．1人あたりの診察時間が Ts = 8 分なので，待ち時間は， 4 * 8 [ 分 ] = 32 [ 分 ]
ということになります．問題文中， 「 純粋待ち時間」というのは 「 自分が診てもらっている時間を含めない」ということです．自分
の診察まで含めて，医者での診察が終了するまでの時間は，
32 + 8 = 40 分 となります．自分のサービス時間も含める場合が重要になることが あります．その時間 は 「 ターンアラウンド」タイムと言います．
ネットワークなどの待ち時間の問題では，「ターンアラウンド」時
間，すなわち，キーを押してからその反応が戻って来るまでの時間が求められることが多いからです．
窓 口が倍，列も倍になった場合
この問題で，窓口の数が倍になった場合，すなわち、サービス時間はそのままで患者が平均的に2つの列に分かれて待つようにするとします。例えば病院を２つ建てた場合などです。そうすると、混み具合も半分になります。 μは変わりませんが，λが 6 から 3 になり，ρは半分の 0.4 となりますね． μ=7.5[人/時間]
λ =3[人/時間 ]
ρ=3/7.5=0.4
待ち=0.4/(1-0.4) =0.67 [人分 ]
待ち時間=0.67*8[分] =5.3 [ 分]
ターンアラウンドタイム=5.3+8=13.3[分] 待ち時間が32[分]から 5.3 [ 分]
と80%以上改善されます．約6倍です．ターンアラウンドタイムも約67%改善されます．
ちなみに，窓口が2つで，列が1つの場合は、M/M/2モデルになりますので，また違う式になります．
サービス時間が半分になった場合
今度は，お医者の能力が上がって，サービス時間が半分になった場合を考えて見ます． μ=15[人/時間]
ρ=6/15=0.4
待ち=0.4/(1-0.4) =0.67 [人分 ]
とここまでは、窓口が倍と同じです．しかし，サービス時間が半分になっているので、同じ待ち人数でも待ち時間は半分です。 待ち時間=0.67*4[分] =2.7 [分]
ターンアラウンドタイム=2.7+4=6.7[分]
この場合待ち時間は，32[分]から 2.7 [ 分]
と90%以上改善されます．約12倍にもなります．ターンアラウンドタイムも約83%改善されます．
倍の人数を雇うよりも、2倍の能力を持った人を2倍の給料で雇うほうがお得って感じでしょうか．
おわりに
とっても大雑把に，待ち行列の理論を解説してみました．ここでの
お話は，M/M/1と分類される待ち行列です．サービス時間
の分布や到着時間の分布，窓口の数などでこの式は変わりますが，
ここまで理解できれば，分かったような気になるには十分だと思います．
では，次に医者に行くときは，とぼとぼと頭をうなだれて行かないように
気をつけましょう． おしまい
おまけ 窓口が倍 で1列の場合
ちょっとだけややこしいM/M/2モデルのお話になります．ややこしいといっても，回転率を2乗にするだけです．
Tw= ( ρ^2/(1-ρ^2 ) ) Ts 窓口が2倍になって処理能力が倍になるので，回転率ρは μ=7.5*2=15[人/時間]
ρ=6/15=0.4 この式で待を求めると，窓口が2倍になって処理能力が倍になるので，待ちは
( ρ^2/(1-ρ^2 ) ) Ts=( 0.4^2/(1-0.4^2 ) )
=0.16/(1-0.16 ) =0.19 [ 人分 ] サービス時間は8 [ 分] ですから 待ち時間=0.19 [ 人分 ] * 8[ 分] =1.5 [ 分]
ターンアラウンドタイム=1.5+8=9.5[分 ]
なんと，待ち時間は32[分]から 1.5 [ 分]
と95%以上の改善です．ターンアラウンドタイムについては約76%となり，サービス時間を半分に短縮したほどではありませんが，なかなかの効果ですね．

良かった 普通 イマイ チ
The Game is Afoot
My biases are obvious .
I am a programmer ( or rather , a developer ) .
I believe the best ISVs are the ones which are started and managed by someone who knows how to use a compiler , not by someone who was trained to run a business .
But I do admit that a big problem happens when a geek becomes the founder of a software product company .
Suddenly the geek must do a whole bunch of stuff they were never trained to do .
Somebody has to keep track of the finances , make the coffee and devise clever ways for management to mistreat the employees .
Luckily , a lot of this " non computer science stuff " is fairly intuitive .
We 've got no training on such matters , but if we can figure out how to write a multithreaded network server , we can probably rent some office space without screwing it up too badly .
But one area consistently confounds us .
In my opinion , nothing in a small ISV is more difficult for a geek than market competition .
We can understand deep abstractions and object oriented programming .
We have no problem grasping how virtual memory works .
Some of us can even remember the keystrokes to do a search and replace in vi .
But when geeks start talking about the issues of software product strategy in a competitive market , otherwise intelligent people suddenly sound like Paris Hilton .
We just do n't get it .
Geeks understand market competition about as well as men understand women .
To some extent , this deficiency arises from the tendency for computer programmers to think of things in " black and white " terms .
We polarize every issue toward one extreme or the other .
The basic element of a computer is a bit , and a bit is either on or off , never in between .
This " binary mentality " infects our perspective at a very basic level , often causing us to be somewhat clumsy when dealing with any topic that is characterized by shades of grey .
But my convictions remain unchanged , so I am always looking for ways to explain this topic in terms that geeks will find intuitive .
Along those lines , this article proceeds from a single observation :
Geeks do n't understand marketing , but they do understand games .
#include < You_Need_Competition .h>
Before I get started , I want to remind the reader of something that I have said before :
You can not avoid competition .
You think you can .
In fact , you think that you must .
You believe that the only way your product idea can succeed is if it does n't have to actually beat any competitors .
So as you daydream about starting your own company , you search for product ideas , and you discard all of the ones which would already have a known competitor .
Eventually , you find an idea which is completely unique .
Nobody is selling anything like it .
Finally , the path before you is clear !
So you proceed to build your killer app .
Of course , you are terrified that somebody else will discover your amazing idea , so you keep everything a secret .
You setup a small office in the corner of your basement and paint the windows black .
You tell your wife you are downstairs looking at porn so she wo n't get suspicious about what 's really going on .
Not a single human being on earth gets a glimpse of your product until you are finally ready to unveil your 1.0 release .
You emerge from stealth mode and wait for the world to overload your web storefront with traffic .
But the orders do n't come in .
Several months go by and eventually you realize the truth :
The reason nobody else was selling this kind of product already is that nobody really needs it .
If any substantial number of people were willing to pay for the solution you created , then somebody else would already be trying to relieve them of their money .
So your company fails .
You decide to take three months off to recover from all the stress .
You sit at home all day , listening to soft music on your iPod , oblivious to the irony : Apple is the clear market leader in digital music , even though they brought their product to the market very late , after all of its competitors were well established .
You cannot succeed by trying to avoid all competition .
But you also can't succeed by simply pretending that the competition is n't there .
Your intuition may be horrible , but it is n't actually that bad .
Competition can kill you .
Marching directly into territory occupied by strong competition is usually just as stupid as it sounds .
So neither of these two extremes is very helpful .
We really need to understand the subtleties in between .
In this article , I 'm going to surface a few principles of software product competition by drawing comparisons to games .
Ping Pong
The game
Ping
Pong is a game of two people using paddles to hit a small plastic ball back and forth across a table with a net in the middle .
For obvious reasons , Ping Pong is also called " table tennis " .
The winner is the first person to score 21 points .
The principle
The thing I find most interesting about Ping Pong is that you can often win without doing anything fancy or aggressive .
A lot of players think the way to win is to slam the ball really hard .
The problem with this strategy is that a slam is a high - risk / high - reward shot .
If you do it right , you almost certainly score a point when your opponent fails to return the ball .
If you do it wrong , you give your opponent a point .
Modesty aside , I consider myself a " pretty good " Ping Pong player .
I can slam the ball when necessary , but I hardly ever do .
I can beat most other players by simply returning every shot with a little backspin .
Hitting the ball hard simply is n't necessary .
All I need to do is wait for the other player to make 21 mistakes .
How software is similar
You can beat a lot of competitors by simply not beating yourself .
Most companies go out of business because of their own stupid mistakes , not because of the brilliance or strength of their competitor .
Stay conservative , and stay in business .
Watch the years go by , and you 'll be surprised how many of your competitors come and go .
This lesson is hard to learn .
Slamming the ball is fun .
It 's so satisfying when we score a point that way .
But when our slam misses the table by 3 feet , we often avoid learning the lesson .
We tend to want to blame failures on external factors instead of asking ourselves if the risks we took were reasonable .
After the company fails and the Aeron chairs have been auctioned off to pay creditors 20 cents on the dollar , management blames everyone but themselves .
" It 's the VC 's fault !
We only needed maybe 12 more months and we would be taking revenue , but that @ *& # $ %# refused to give us our seventh round of financing ! "
The lesson is actually quite simple :
If you regularly take big risks , you will eventually get burned .
Example
Oh my .
I need an example of a company that killed itself by taking too much risk .
There are thousands upon thousands of such firms .
Who should I choose ?
I guess I 'll stay close to home and briefly summarize the story of Argus Systems Group , a security software company here in Champaign , Illinois .
If you visit their website today , you 'll find a company which is alive and well , but that 's not the whole story .
What you see now is the new Argus .
The original Argus filed for bankruptcy in May 2003 .
The company 's assets were sold in July 2003 for a little over $ 1.5 million to new management who have resurrected the failed venture .
What went wrong ?
Clearly the company had value .
A company selling advanced security software in the post 9/11 world should certainly be able to find customers , right ?
The problem with Argus was not in finding customers , but in finding enough customers to pay the enormous financial obligations to its investors and creditors .
Argus was founded in 1993 .
They took money from outside investors in 1994 , but I do n't know if it was debt or equity or a mixture of both .
More outside money came in 1996 .
And again in 1998 .
And a bunch more in 1999 .
And then another chunk in 2000 .
In 2001 , they were working on getting another 35 M in financing , but the deal fell through , and the death spiral began .
In March 2003 the local newspaper was writing about Argus missing payroll .
One of the company execs said , " We 're still carrying a lot of debt . "
Argus had real products with real customers , but the company was crushed by all of the financial risks it had taken over the years .
Do n't take this too far
Conservative or bold ?
Which one ?
This issue is not a checkbox , it 's a slider .
You have to take some risks if you want to be in business .
The trick is to figure out what kind of risks to take .
Learn how to take smaller risks , and then take as many of them as you can .
Sorry !
The game
Sorry ! is a family board game produced by Parker Brothers .
Each player has four " pawns " .
The goal is to move all four of your pawns from a starting point to the finish .
Each turn , you draw a card and move one pawn the number of spaces indicated on the card .
( Sorry ! is a registered trademark of Parker Brothers . )
The principle
In order to move a pawn into the finishing area , you have to draw the exact number you need .
If you are 3 spaces away and you draw a 5 , then you can't move .
The effect of this rule is that every game of Sorry !
ends up being close .
A player can get way ahead , but they almost always slow down at the end as it takes them several turns to draw the card they need to win .
How software is similar
In software product competition , things are often set up favorably for the other players to catch up to the leader .
By nature , the leader usually has more things slowing them down .
Version 4.0 of a software product often happens more slowly than version 1.0 .
You have to implement special support for backward compatibility with your previous releases .
You have to implement the features your customers want instead of the ones your prospective customers want .
You have to be careful not to break things when you are making code changes .
You never want version N to be worse than version N - 1 .
The small ISV working on version 1.0 does n't have all this baggage to carry around .
In fact , I think I 'll just over - generalize and say it like this :
The older your product is , the slower your development is .
Example
The most obvious example of this phenomenon is Microsoft Windows .
How many times has Cairo / Longhorn been delayed ?
Remember , this is not a criticism -- it is merely a natural part of the aging process for software products .
Each release of Windows takes a long time , and I bet that a big percentage of the effort is spent on backwards compatibility and regression testing .
A huge number of applications rely on the Windows platform , and Microsoft needs to be sure that old apps work with its new releases .
In other words , they are trying to improve Windows without changing it .
That needs to be done with a lot of care .
Do n't take this too far
The day after I publish this article , some yoyo is going to send me email flaming me for saying that it 's bad to be the market leader .
Please do n't bother .
I 'm not really saying that .
Given a choice between being two years ahead of a competitor or two years behind , we all know which choice to make .
I 'm just saying that not every factor favors the leader .
If you are out in front , be aware of the natural reasons why your development is slowing down .
If you are trailing , do n't despair .
Realize that there are certain issues working in your favor .
The 100 meter dash
The game
Wait at the starting line .
When the gun fires , run toward the finish line , 100 meters away .
The principle
Strictly speaking , only one person actually wins this race .
However , second and third place are honored with medals as well .
The silver and bronze medalists are obviously among the fastest human beings on earth .
They did n't " win " the race , and yet , they achieved something amazing .
How software is similar
There is usually more than one winner .
In fact , I 'd say that most market segments work out to be very much like the Olympics :
The top three players are all considered successful .
The game of running an ISV is not a two - player affair with a winner and a loser .
You can be quite successful without being the market leader .
Example
Lots of successful products are not # 1 in their market : SQL Server .
Last time I checked , Microsoft is # 3 in the database market , well behind IBM and Oracle .
It would be real difficult to credibly argue that SQL Server is a failure .
Opera .
I can't cite a source , but it seems fairly obvious to me that these guys are # 3 , behind Internet Explorer and Firefox .
It seems equally obvious to me that Opera is a successful company , but I can't prove that either .
TestComplete .
I 've got even less evidence here , but I admire AutomatedQA and what they have accomplished .
Their GUI testing product is at least # 3 in the market , maybe even further down than that .
They came along years after companies like Mercury Interactive and Rational , but I definitely get the impression that this product is doing well for them .
Do n't take this too far
Every rule has exceptions .
The number three player in desktop operating systems is probably not considered very successful , whoever they are .
Golf : The Putting Green
The game
Golf is played with a club and a ball .
The object is to get the ball into a hole by hitting it as few times as possible .
In the final step of playing a golf hole , we roll the ball along a surface of very short grass into the cup .
This surface is called the " putting green " .
It is rarely flat or level .
The principle
The tricky thing about putting is studying the green to figure out how the ball will roll .
When putting across a slope , how much will the grade cause the path of the ball to curve ?
When putting down a slope , how hard should you strike the ball to avoid rolling too far if you miss ?
Using nothing more than visual inspection , it can be really tough to figure this stuff out .
Professionals have spent countless hours learning how to " read the green " .
Making a putt is far simpler if you can watch somebody else attempt it first .
This is completely legal within the rules of golf .
The person whose ball is further away from the cup must attempt the putt first .
The other player has the right to watch the ball roll .
Putting second can be a big advantage .
You can learn a great deal by watching your competitor go first .
How software is similar
Using nothing more than visual inspection ( market research ) , it can be really tough to figure out just how a product is going to roll .
Very few products get it right the first time .
People want to use the product in ways you never expected .
Everybody explains that you did n't provide integration with their favorite app .
Customers want your product but the price is too high .
Customers do n't immediately realize that they have the problem your product is designed to solve .
Hindsight makes all this stuff obvious .
Releasing your product second can be a big advantage .
You can learn a great deal by watching your competitor go first .
We call this effect the " second mover advantage " .
Example
C# is probably the most perfect example of second mover advantage that I have ever seen .
Microsoft is always very careful when they talk about C# .
They do n't want people thinking of C# as a clone of Java .
But the truth is obvious : C# is Java done right .
Do n't take this too far
The reason we call this " second mover advantage " is because presenting it in contrast with the more commonly discussed " first mover advantage " , which is very real .
Being first has plenty of benefits too .
It 's just that the benefits of being first are different from the benefits of being second .
Bridge
The game
Bridge is a card game played by four players with a traditional 52 - card deck .
In each deal there are 13 tricks .
The goal is take lots of them .
The principle
The basic rules of bridge are very simple , but competitive bridge is extremely complex .
Bridge players use a " system " , a methodology which provides strategy and tactics for play .
The system is not part of the basic rules of the game .
There are quite a few different methodologies for bridge , all of which are designed to help a player and his partner win .
A friend of mine taught me to play bridge .
Let 's call him Bob ( because that 's his name ) .
Bob is a very good bridge player .
One might think that because I was taught by such a strong player that I might be rather good at the game .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
I am a terrible bridge player .
There are many things about bridge which are not easily taught .
You either " get it " or you do n't .
Bob gets it .
He sees things at the bridge table that I just can't see .
He always seems to know where the cards are .
He and I will sit down for an evening and play 27 hands of bridge .
After it 's all done , he draws my attention to the 5th hand .
I barely recall playing it , but he remembers all 13 of the cards I was holding and tells me exactly where I screwed up .
There is one fact about the remainder of my lifetime that is extremely clear : I will never beat Bob at a game of bridge .
I simply do n't have the talent .
Bob 's mind can do things mine cannot .
More to the point , there is no system or methodology which would allow me to beat Bob .
I only know how to play one bridge system ( it 's called Standard American ) .
Bob plays several different systems , depending on who his partner is .
He usually wins , regardless of what system he is playing .
In bridge , there is no methodology which is a substitute for talent .
How software is similar
I used to work with a guy who was in love with the notion of a really good methodology .
He was always talking about how great it is to have a system which is not dependent on the abilities of the people on the team .
He liked to explain the concept using a sausage grinder as a metaphor .
No matter how smart or dumb the developers are , you always get sausage as the result .
Methodology of software development is a popular topic , but count me as a skeptic .
In software , there is no methodology which is a substitute for talent .
Choosing the right development methodology is not going to help you beat your competitors .
None of your competitors are going to beat you just because of the methodology they chose .
Example
I can't find an example to give here , except to offer the following observations as weak evidence of my claims : I 've spoken with folks at lots and lots of ISVs .
I tend to see smart people following excellent development practices .
But I do n't know of a single shrinkwrap software company which follows one of the strict development methodologies , much less one that gains competitive advantage by doing so .
Do n't take this too far
I 'm not saying that methodology is a completely uninteresting topic .
I 'm saying is that talent will beat methodology every time , but methodology and talent do n't have to be mutually exclusive .
Some methodologies seem to be specifically designed to let smart people be smart .
Gymnastics
The game
Gymnastics is a sport in which athletes demonstrate strength , agility and balance in several different events using several different kinds of equipment .
The principle
Most people watch gymnastics every four years when the Olympics come on TV .
Both women and men participate in the sport ( separately ) , but the women 's competition seems to be generally more popular .
Women 's gymnastics involves four different events : Floor exercise
Balance beam
Vault
Uneven bars Participants must compete in all four stages of the competition , and each stage is very different from the others .
A gymnast might be truly gifted on the balance beam , but that does n't mean she 's any good on the uneven bars -- the two events require entirely different sets of skills .
Each of the four events requires a different approach and different training .
How software is similar
Marketing teaches us that the life cycle of a product has four stages , each of which corresponds to one group of people in the market : Early Adopters are risk takers who actually like to try new things .
are risk takers who actually like to try new things .
Pragmatists might be willing to use new technology , if it 's the only way to get their problem solved .
might be willing to use new technology , if it 's the only way to get their problem solved .
Conservatives dislike new technology and try to avoid it .
dislike new technology and try to avoid it .
Laggards pride themselves on the fact that they are the last to try anything new .
Each stage is very different from the others .
Your ISV might be very successful selling products to Early Adopters , but that does n't mean you will have any success at all selling stuff to the Pragmatists .
These are two entirely different groups of customers and reaching them requires entirely different skills .
Example
Linux is perhaps the most obvious example today of a product which is very popular with certain Early Adopters and almost completely irrelevant to the Pragmatists .
That is not to say that Linux is a failure .
I like Linux very much and I use it regularly .
But the fact remains : Linux does n't have much market penetration in the mainstrain markets like the corporate desktop or the home PC .
Those buyers are Pragmatists , or Conservatives or even Laggards .
Being successful with the Early Adopters is one thing .
Selling products to the later stages is a completely different problem .
Do n't take this too far
Unlike gymnastics , an ISV is not absolutely required to participate in all four stages .
Some companies cater exclusively to Early Adopters , never bothering to even try and sell stuff to the Pragmatists .
An even more common strategy is to only sell stuff to the Pragmatists and Conservatives , sparing yourself from exposure to the bizarre buying patterns of the Early Adopters .
Football
The game
Here in the United States , the sport we call " football " is played on a grass field 100 yards long .
Each team has 11 people .
At any given moment , one team is trying to move the ball to the end of the field while the other team is trying to stop them .
A complex set of rules attempts to regulate the amount of violence and keep it at just the right level .
The principle
Football is a game of strategy .
You can't just grab the ball and throw it down the field .
Each team develops " plays " where every player on the field is given very specific instructions .
During the week , they practice these plays over and over until the team knows how to do it right .
Then the weekend comes , and it 's time to actually play the game .
In every football game , there is a play where the coach chose the right strategy but the players just did n't get it done .
Somebody was supposed to run to the left and instead they ran to the right .
This is the moment where the TV cameras zoom in on the coach as he throws up his hands in frustration and screams a word I wo n't repeat but which can be roughly translated to say : " That is NOT how we practiced that play !! ! "
Football is a game of strategy , but even more , it is a game of execution .
The best strategy wo n't help you a bit if you can't execute it well .
How software is similar
The challenge of building and selling a software product is a game of strategy , but even more , it is a game of execution .
Most people get this balance exactly backwards .
They believe the essence of success is to come up with a really great business plan built on a really great product idea .
Those things are important , but a great idea and a great plan wo n't help a bit if you can't execute it well .
Experienced people know that execution is more important than idea .
In fact , the more jaded and cynical folks in our industry would say that software product ideas are worthless .
Without a doubt , great execution on a good idea is far better than poor execution on a great idea .
If you want to beat your competitors in the market , focus on being a team that can get things done .
Example
Back in 1997 , folks were anticipating the upcoming release of the Motorola MAP phone , a " smart phone " which incorporated web browsing and a graphical user interface .
By today 's standards , I suppose the MAP phone would be rather ordinary , but it was a cool idea for its time .
Or rather , it would have been a cool idea if they had ever delivered it .
Some Motorola exec killed the project , in early 1999 if I recall correctly .
The phone was years late , and its feature set was no longer worth delivering .
Competitors already had products on the market with the same or greater functionality .
What went wrong ?
In a nutshell , there was a lot of questionable execution , including some major changes to the architecture and feature set , very late in the game .
My company was one of the subcontractors building apps for the phone .
Our billings to Motorola were a significant amount of money , so I can only imagine the total sunk cost in this disastrous project was at least an 8 - figure number .
Too bad .
It was a great idea .
Do n't take this too far
Here 's a football play I 've never seen :
Give the ball to one player and have the other ten stand around and watch as he slowly walks down the field .
Perfect execution on a terrible idea will get you exactly the results you should expect .
The Oscars
The game
The Academy Awards ( aka the " Oscars " ) are generally considered to be the most prestigious honor in filmmaking .
The principle
Every year , immediately after the Oscar winners are announced , people begin the debate :
Who should have won ?
The Academy Awards are n't like horse racing or chess where the winner is usually quite clear and undisputed .
The decisions about Oscar winners are entirely subjective .
Reasonable people disagree .
With all due respect to Ben Kingsley and his performance in Gandhi , I still wish Dustin Hoffman had won .
But that 's just the way the Oscars work .
The Academy voters hold the only opinion that matters .
The rest of us can argue over which movie or performance we think was the " best " , but our opinions do n't make a bit of difference in who actually wins .
How software is similar
The " best " product does n't always win .
That 's a pithy way to express the point , so let me try to be a bit more precise .
There are two groups of people who have opinions about which software product is the " best " : Us .
The developers .
The geeks .
The people who create the products .
Them .
The customers .
The normal people .
The people who buy the products .
Here 's the lesson that developers must learn :
The customers hold the only opinion that matters .
Sometimes their choices do n't seem to make any sense .
They prefer one product when we know the other one has better technology .
In the end , we can fuss all day about why the market is making " the wrong choice " , but it does n't matter .
Our job is not to make the product that we think is best .
Our job is to make the product that they think is best .
If you can't accept that , you should consider the possibility that you and your career choice are not as well suited as you thought .
Example
Strictly from a technology perspective , it was n't terribly difficult to figure who had the best personal computer operating system in 1985 .
Most people would probably have said that the Amiga operating system was clearly superior to Windows 1.0 .
Twenty years later , the score of this game looks roughly like this : Windows : 500 million users
Amiga : 500 users
The " best " product does n't always win .
Do n't take this too far
Your notion of what is the " best " product may not completely match the opinion of the marketplace , but it 's probably not 100 % wrong .
I do n't think I have ever seen the Academy give an Oscar to a performance which was also nominated for the Razzies .
Rugby
The game
Most people in the United States are not terribly familiar with rugby .
It could be compared to football , but it is a sport all its own .
Like football , it involves lots of players running into each other .
Unlike football , the players are n't wearing pads .
The principle
Traditional Rugby is played with 15 people on each team .
At the time of this writing , the top three international rugby teams are New Zealand , Australia and South Africa .
My rugby fanatic coworker tells me that this configuration is typical .
Noticeably absent from this list is Fiji , a small island nation in the south Pacific .
Fiji is about the size of New Jersey but has about one tenth the population .
Rugby is the most popular sport in Fiji , but this tiny country simply does n't have the resources to compete with the big boys .
The Fijan rugby team competes , but do n't look for them to be in the top three anytime soon .
However , there is a variant of rugby which is played with 7 people instead of 15 .
The game is called " Rugby Sevens " .
It 's not as big as traditional rugby , but its popularity is growing .
Guess who won the Rugby Sevens World Cub this year ?
Fiji .
Rugby is segmented into two different categories .
Fiji puts most of its resources into competing where it has the best chance to win .
How software is similar
Segmentation is perhaps the most important concept in marketing , and the world of software products is no exception .
Very often , the way to win is not to be better , but to be different .
Look at your market and identify the different segments or categories .
For each category , ask yourself lots of questions :
How many customers are in this category ?
How much money do they spend ?
Are those customers well served ?
Who is selling stuff to those customers now ?
What unsolved problems do those customers have ?
Choose a category where you can win .
Example
I think the best example here is the Apple Macintosh .
Steve Jobs is very smart .
He could have killed the company by trying to beat Microsoft in the broader market .
Instead , the Macintosh seems to have found serenity by dominating a small niche of rabid fans .
Do n't take this too far
Choosing a category where you can win is not the same thing as a creating a whole new category .
Which of the following tasks sounds easier ?
Start a new team to play Rugby Sevens .
Make your team good enough to compete with Fiji .
Create a new variant of Rugby which is played with 11 people .
Start a team .
Learn the nuances of this particular configuration .
Make your team really , really good at this newly created game .
Contact 29 other nations and convince them to start playing " Rugby Elevens " .
Convince millions of people that their lives would be happier if they would watch 11 people playing rugby instead of 7 or 15 .
Find lots of corporations and convince them that they should be advertising to your fan base .
Contact the International Olympic Committee and ask them to add yet another sport .
Sound absurd ?
At this very moment , somewhere in the world , there is a person writing a business plan which is just as silly .
If by chance you are that person , please stop now .
Creating a new market category is very , very hard .
It is much easier to sell people a product which solves a problem they already know about .
Golf : The Tee Shot
The game
Earlier I mentioned golf in the context of the putting green .
But that 's the end of the story .
Long before the ball lands on the green , each hole starts out with the ball sitting on a tee .
The principle
The fourth hole at my local course is reasonably typical .
When I begin to play this hole , my ball is 561 yards away from the cup where it is supposed to end up .
The par for this hole would suggest that I should be able to get the ball into that cup by hitting it only 5 times .
My last two shots will be far more precise , so what I need from this first shot is distance .
It would be great if I could get the ball around halfway there on the first shot .
This should be easy .
It 's not like the ball is moving .
It 's just sitting there waiting for me to smack it .
All I have to do is swing my club and hit the darn ball straight .
Unfortunately , it turns out that this task is incredibly difficult to do with any accuracy .
The slightest error will be magnified , usually causing my ball to veer off to the right where it will be reunited with dozens of its friends which are now resting comfortably at the bottom of the lake .
The tee shot in golf is all about concentration .
This is a mental challenge , not a physical one .
There are plenty of teenage girls and 75 - year - old men who can hit the ball 300 yards .
Muscles do n't matter .
What you need is 100 % focus and absolute concentration on the task .
The easiest and most common way to dilute your concentration is to think about your competitor .
During your shot , that guy just does n't matter .
It 's not like he 's playing defense .
The best thing to do is to just ignore him completely .
If you think about him , then you 're not thinking about your shot , and you 're probably going to screw it up .
It 's just you , the club and the ball .
Everything else is a distraction .
How software is similar
I 'm ending the article with this illustration because I believe that managing an ISV is more like the golf tee shot than it is like any other game .
It 's just you , the product , and the customer .
Everything else is a distraction .
Software companies routinely spend far too much of their attention on their competitors .
Our customers wish we would spend all that effort on providing solutions to their problems .
Example
I 'm citing Fog Creek as my example here .
I suspect that I could find a hundred different bug - tracking products which appeared on the scene before FogBugz , but Joel ignored all that and kept spouting his mantra : " Listen to your customers , not your competitors ! "
He has built himself a very fine company , and along the way , the rest of us have learned an awful lot of good stuff from his writings .
Do n't take this too far
It is theoretically possible to take this principle too far , but I 've never seen anyone do it .
Ignoring our competitors takes discipline .
Human nature virtually guarantees that we will err in the other direction .
If you have achieved this particular flaw , spending so much time focusing on your customers that your business is actually harmed because of your ignorance of the competition , please accept my congratulations .
Most of my readers wish their problems were as easy to fix as yours .
The 19th Hole
This article ended up a lot longer than I thought it would be .
If you got tired while reading it , just be thankful that I deleted the whole section about how seeing into the future is like trying to look down a dark hallway in Doom 3 .
Be happy that I never wrote the whole bit about how Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 ignored Wayne Gretzsky 's sage advice about skating to where the puck will be .
And most of all , be grateful that I deleted the long rant about offshore outsourcing , the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs . :-)
The center of the upgraded CDF detector features a silicon vertex detector , installed in January 2001 .
The improved detector has taken data since March 2001 .
The vertex detector allows experimenters to record tracks of charged particles with utmost precision .
Tracing the particle tracks back to their origin , scientists discover what processes take place at the core of proton - antiproton collisions .

Scientists of the CDF collaboration at the Department of Energy 's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory announced today ( October 23 , 2006 ) the discovery of two rare types of particles , exotic relatives of the much more common proton and neutron .
" These particles , named Sigma - sub - b [ Σ b ] , are like rare jewels that we mined out of our data , " said Jacobo Konigsberg , University of Florida , a spokesperson for the CDF collaboration .
" Piece by piece , we are developing a better picture of how matter is built out of quarks .
We learn more about the subatomic forces that hold quarks together and tear them apart .
Our discovery helps complete the ' periodic table of baryons . ' "
Baryons ( derived from the Greek word " barys " , meaning " heavy " ) are particles that contain three quarks , the most fundamental building blocks of matter .
The CDF collaboration discovered two types of Sigma - sub - b particles , each one about six times heavier than a proton .
Six quarks -- up , down , strange , charm , bottom and top -- are the building blocks of matter .
Protons and neutrons are made of up and down quarks , held together by the strong nuclear force .
The CDF experiment has discovered exotic relatives of the proton and neutron , particles that include a bottom quark .

There are six different types of quarks : up , down , strange , charm , bottom and top ( u , d , s , c , b and t ) .
The two types of baryons discovered by the CDF experiment are made of two up quarks and one bottom quark ( u - u - b ) , and two down quarks and a bottom quark ( d - d - b ) .
For comparison , protons are u-u-d combinations , while neutrons are d-d-u .
The new particles are extremely short - lived and decay within a tiny fraction of a second .
Utilizing Fermilab's Tevatron collider , the world 's most powerful particle accelerator , physicists can recreate the conditions present in the early formation of the universe , reproducing the exotic matter that was abundant in the moments after the big bang .
While the matter around us is comprised of only up and down quarks , exotic matter contains other quarks as well .
The Tevatron collider at Fermilab accelerates protons and antiprotons close to the speed of light and makes them collide .
In the collisions , energy transforms into mass , according to Einstein 's famous equation E=mc2 .
To beat the low odds of producing bottom quarks -- which in turn transform into the Sigma - sub - b according to the laws of quantum physics -- scientists take advantage of the billions of collisions produced by the Tevatron each second .
" It 's amazing that scientists can build a particle accelerator that produces this many collisions , and equally amazing that the CDF collaboration was able to develop a particle detector that can measure them all , " said CDF cospokesperson Rob Roser , of Fermilab .
" We are confident that our data hold the secret to even more discoveries that we will find with time . "
The CDF experiment identified 103 u-u- b particles , positively charged Sigma - sub - b particles ( Σ+ b ) , and 134 d - d - b particles , negatively charged Sigma - sub - b particles ( Σ- b ) .
In order to find this number of particles , scientists culled through more than 100 trillion high - energy proton - antiproton collisions produced by the Tevatron over the last five years .
Baryons are particles made of three quarks .
The particles can exist in a ground state ( J=1/2 ) and an excited state ( J=3/2 ) .
The CDF experiment discovered the positively charged Sigma - sub - b and the negatively charged Sigma - sub - b in both spin configurations .
The graphic shows the various three - quark combinations with J=3/ 2 that are possible using the three lightest quarks -- up , down and strange -- and the bottom quark .
Past experiments discovered all of the baryons made of light quarks .
The CDF discovery is the first observation of baryons with one bottom quark and spin J=3 / 2 .
Theory predicts four more such particles to exist .
There are additional baryons involving the charm quark , which are not shown .
The top quark , discovered at Fermilab in 1995 , is too short - lived to become part of a baryon .

In a scientific presentation on Friday , October 20 , CDF physicist Petar Maksimovic , professor at Johns Hopkins University , presented the discovery to the particle physics community at Fermilab .
He explained that the two types of Sigma - sub - b particles are produced in two different spin combinations , J=1/2 and J=3/2 , representing a ground state and an excited state , as predicted by theory .
Quark theory predicts six different types of baryons with one bottom quark and spin J=3/2 ( see graphic ) .
The CDF experiment now accounts for two of these baryons .

THE CREATIVE PRINCIPLE
IN ART AND SCIENCE
What Mathematics Can Learn
from Classical Music by Bruce Director
 Heard melodies are sweet , but those unheard are sweeter . 
 John Keats That the creation and re-creation of great Classical musical compositions is a source of human happiness , is undeniable .
Yet , such happiness cannot be relegated to the domain of pleasurable distractions .
In fact , it is in the domain of great Classical musical composition , that human beings can and do discover fundamental principles of human knowledge and of the physical universe itself .
As will be shown below , by way of examples and otherwise , the source of human happiness associated with creating , performing , and listening to great Classical musical compositions , arises solely from the mental process of creative discovery associated with such compositions .
Consequently , a rigorous examination of the principles of creative discovery , embodied in Classical musical composition , has profound implications far beyond the domain of art .
Fundamental issues confronting mathematics and physical sciences are dealt with in the realm of musical composition .
Much effort has been made by the Venetian - led enemies of human knowledge to obscure , degrade , and destroy the science of musical composition .
On the one side , the so - called Romantics and modernists have degraded music to the level of pure sensuality , where musical development is lowered to a Benthamite pleasure / pain principle .
Such evil efforts reduce music to mere alternating erotic episodes of dissonance ( pain : tension ) and consonance ( pleasure : release ) .
On the other side , attempts have been made to sterilize music into an axiomatic array of fixed rules and laws .
Unfortunately , most performers and audiences today suffer the effects of these deliberate forms of debasement .
Friedrich Schiller , in  The Aesthetical Lectures ,  defines this issue in terms of aesthetics :
The perfect , presented with freedom is immediately transformed into the beautiful .
It is , however , presented with freedom , when the nature of the thing appears harmonizing with its technique , when it looks as if it were flowing forth voluntarily from the thing itself .
One can also briefly express the preceding so :
An object is perfect , when everything manifold in it accords with the unity of its concept ; it is beautiful , when its perfection appears as nature .
The beauty increases , when the perfection becomes more complex and the nature suffers nothing thereby ; for the task of freedom becomes more difficult with the increasing number of compounds and its fortunate resolution therefore , even more astonishing .
All Classical musical composition is inherently paradoxical .
The beauty of a musical composition increases with the ability of the composer to maintain a unity of effect throughout the composition , while increasing the complexity ( density of change ) in the composition .
However , it is impossible to state explicitly the unifying idea of the composition ; it exists only in the mind of the composer , and subsequently , in the minds of the listeners , as what Lyndon LaRouche has defined as a  thought - object . 
This thought - object is as real as the notes that are performed and heard , but it cannot itself be heard in the audible domain .
This thought - object is communicated as a properly performed musical composition that is unfolded by the performers over a finite period of time , from the opening notes to the final cadence .
As the piece unfolds , the listener is led on a journey of discovery .
At the very moment after the final cadence , the entire composition is enfolded in the mind of the listener and grasped as a virtually simultaneous whole .
That unifying enfolding occurs only in the sovereign mind of the listener .
It is an irreducible One , yet it can come into existence only in the mind of the listener , as a result of the unfolding of the composition over time .
The composition exists in time , yet its central idea exists in virtually no time .
It unfolds through audible tones , yet its subject , that from which it is generated , is inaudible .
The power of a musical composition is associated with the ability of the composer to create increases in beauty for the listener , as identified above by Schiller .
But such increases in beauty are not achieved by simply making compositions more complex .
Any increased complexity a Many must result only from the creation , first , of a higher conception a One from which the complexity is unfolded .
Paradoxically , this process is heard by the mind in reverse : the complexity of the composition is what is heard ; the higher conception , the One , arises in the mind of the listener , but is unheard .
Such increases in power can themselves be ordered according to what Georg Cantor defined in mathematical terms as cardinalities .
Each higher cardinality is characterized by a unity ( One ) , of increasing complexity ( Many ) .
Each higher cardinality subsumes all lower ones .
Each successive higher cardinality is generated as a solution to a fundamental paradox existing in its predecessor .
Such paradoxes are perceived by our senses , in this case hearing , as mathematical discontinuities or singularities .
As we will see , the generation of rising powers ( cardinalities ) of creative thought , is the subject matter of great Classical musical composition .
The Physical Principles of Well - Tempered Polyphony Before turning to the musical examples , let us first examine some of the physical properties of the audible tones of the well - tempered system of polyphony which externally bound all musical compositions .
The seven octaves each divided into twelve tones of the Classical well - tempered system of polyphony , are physically determined singularities of physical space - time .
Contrary to the fraud perpetrated by Hermann Helmholtz , which sadly is generally accepted by most musicians and physicists today , these tones are not arbitrary values chosen merely by whim .
Each tone is a force - free region of physical space - time , whose value ( frequency ) , like Keplers values for the orbits of the planets in the Solar System , is determined by the characteristic properties of a quantized field underlying physical space - time .
The specific frequencies of these tones , centered on middle C = 256 Hz , are revealed by discovering the bio-physical properties of the bel canto qualities of the human singing voice .
These discoveries show that there are six separate species of the human singing voice : soprano , alto ( mezzo - soprano ) , contralto , tenor , baritone , bass .
Each species has a characteristic set of physiologically determined regions where the singer , in order to maintain a beautiful tone , must shift from one register to another .
For example , when C = 256 , the soprano and tenor must shift from their middle to high register between F and F♯ [ Figure 1 ] .
When two or more voices , either a capella or in combination with musical instruments , sing together , it is quickly discovered that a system of tuning is required which is not determined by ratios of whole numbers .
Such a non-linear system of tuning is known as the well - tempered system , and was most thoroughly elaborated by J.S. Bach .
The totality of intervals in the well - tempered system of polyphony can be bound together conceptually , by a unifying ordering principle ( order type ) .
The most generalized order type , is associated with the major / minor mode .
This order type , elaborated by J.S. Bach , is identified with the twenty - four key , well - tempered system ( or , forty - eight key , if ascending and descending are considered , as they should , to be different species ) [ Figure 2 ] .
Consequently , discoveries in the musical domain are valid discoveries of objective physical principles , as well as subjective ones .
The audible tones of the well - tempered system are externally bounded by a quantized field which is itself unheard ; yet its properties are nonetheless discoverable through the audible realm .
In the workshop of musical composition , the bounding characteristics of this unheard quantized field are revealed by the behavior of the singularities that emerge as musical paradoxes .
This property enables the composer to focus the mind of the listener not on the notes , but on change .
For example , the listener never hears a single tone in a musical composition .
The listener always hears the interval between tones , that is , the change between tones .
And yet , in the well - tempered system , an interval between two notes does not express just one type of change .
Look at the interval of a fifth in the key of C major / minor , i.e. , C - G , shown in Figure 2 .
Ascending from C - G , the listener hears an ascending fifth .
This simple interval divides the octave into two distinct intervals : a fifth ( C - G ) and a fourth ( G - C ) .
Going in the reverse direction , i.e. , descending from C , generates the interval C- F , i.e. , a perfect fifth .
An ascending fourth , C- F , is different from its reverse , descending from F to C , because F to C implies the descending fifth .
In addition , any particular interval is changed in relation to specific keys .
For example , in the key of C , the fifth C- G , is the interval between the first and the fifth notes of the scale .
In the key of F , this same fifth , C - G , is the interval between the fifth and the ninth ( second ) .
In the key of G this same fifth , is the interval between the fourth and the octave .
In the key of D , this fifth is the interval between the fourth and the diminished seventh .
Therefore , a seemingly simple interval is not really so simple after all .
Similar ambiguities exist for other divisions of the octave [ Figure 3 ] .
In the major / minor mode , sequences of intervals can be re-ordered , or inverted , according to a specific principle .
For example , the first five notes of the major mode can be inverted , thus generating the minor mode , and vice versa .
The major mode can be inverted at the octave to generate a minor mode of a different key [ Figure 4 ] .
A singularity of significant importance is the interval which divides the octave exactly in half , misnamed the devils  interval or tritone , which were better called the  Lydian interval for reasons which will become clear later in this report [ Figure 5 ] .
The Lydian interval is the only interval which cannot be generated by the principle of inversion of complementary intervals within any given key .
This interval uniquely divides the octave exactly in half : that is , the interval from the tonic to the Lydian tone is the same amount of change as the interval from the Lydian tone to the octave .
In the key of C major / minor , for example , this corresponds to the interval between C and F♯ , which also corresponds to the physical singularity of the register breaks in the soprano and tenor singing voice [ Figure 5 ( a ) ] .
( above ) Divide an octave in half .
This generates a Lydian interval .
In the major / minor mode , the Lydian interval is a dissonance with respect to any given key .
For example , in the key of C major / minor , the interval C - F♯ is such a dissonance .
Yet this Lydian interval has the unique property of being a pathway from one key to the next , by way of the leading tone of that next key ( F♯ - G in the key of G major / G minor ) [ Figure 5 ( b ) ] .
It is a type of singularity to be resolved through the development of the composition .
When the octave is divided in half again , two Lydian intervals are created .
There are only three such combinations possible in the well - tempered system [ Figure 5 ( c ) ] .
( above )
An analogy can be made with Cardinal Nicolaus of Cusas treatment of the transcendental nature of & Mac185 ; .
When a circle is divided in half by circular action , a diameter is generated , the ratio of whose length to the circumference of the circle , is & Mac185 ; .
Cusa showed that while the value of & Mac185 ; can be calculated to any decimal value , its exact value is not determinable , because the diameter , a straight line , is of a different species than the circle .
When two such different species are compared , a mathematical discontinuity , or singularity , results .
Simlarly , when an octave is divided in half , the Lydian interval , a singularity , is generated which is transcendental with respect to that octave .

Now step back and think of a given key , for example , C major , as a unity .
See the singularities .
Now think of C major along with C minor , and think of these singularities anew .
Now think of all twenty - four keys as a whole .
Now think of all twenty - four keys as ascending and descending , i.e. , all forty - eight keys .
With each new mental act , the mind generates a succession of order types .
But the fun is just beginning .
What has been described above is simply the natural beauty of the well - tempered system of polyphony , presented to us by God and discovered by that which makes us in the image of God , creativity .
Now we must turn to the great scientific geniuses of musical composition , who continue Gods creation with works of artistic beauty .
We will illustrate the principles outlined above with examples from four string quartets .
For the purposes of our illustration , we will examine here only the generative principles out of which each of these compositions develops , for the potential development of each composition is contained entirely in the generative idea which creates bounding conditions on it .
It is the composers genius to discover and reveal this potential .
As the composition unfolds , the singularities embedded within the generative principle are subjected to transformations by the composer , and the listener hears development in the composition in terms of the change associated with these transformations .
By comparing the generative material from compositions of three composers encompassing the span of approximately forty years , it is possible to see the successive breakthroughs in human conceptual power associated with these creative discoveries .
The string quartet [ two violins , viola , and violoncello ( cello ) ] virtually came into existence through the work of Franz Joseph Haydn .
This medium allows for maximum musical transparency , because of the registral characteristics of these stringed instruments when made to sing by performers familiar with the principles of bel canto singing .
This ensemble of four voices actually composes a fifth voice , that of the quartet as a whole .
The string quartet serves both as the core of the entire symphony orchestra and as a test bed for compositional innovation .
These illustrations , while necessarily partial , nevertheless should serve as a sufficient guide to the reader , to whom we leave the task of exploring , with the ears and the mind , the full richness of these compositions .
Haydns Opus 33 , No. 3 Franz Joseph Haydns Opus 33 , the collection of six string quartets composed in 1781 , represented a major breakthrough in human knowledge , with the development of a new principle of musical composition called Motivführung , or motivic development .
Here Haydn takes an extremely simple idea and subjects it to transformations across the musical space .
The effect is to enable the listener to hear a greater density of change , while maintaining a unity of effect .
Look at the opening seventeen measures of the first movement of Op. 33 , No. 3 in C major , the  Bird . 
In measure 1 , the viola plays repeated eighth - note Es with the second violin playing repeated eighth - note Cs above [ Figure 6 ] .
This interval divides the octave into a major third and a minor sixth .
In measure 2 , the first violin enters on a G above as a whole note , adding the additional interval of the perfect fifth , and implicitly the minor third and major sixth .
In measure 3 , the first violin adds a little grace note F♯ to its G , introducing the interval which divides the octave exactly in half .
Also , the first violin now divides the measure rhythmically in half .
As we identified above , this interval ( C - F♯ ) is at the boundary with the adjacent key of G , and is dissonant with respect to C.
Finally , on the first beat of measure 4 , the first violin extends the grace note from a half - step below the G , to a whole - step above .
So , in the first three measures , Haydn has , with the simplest means , presented the listener with the primary divisions of the octave in a condensed idea ( the fifth , fourth , major third , minor third , major sixth , minor sixth , half - step , and whole - step ) .
In measures 4 , 5 , and 6 , these divisions are simply unfolded .
The cello plays the C- E - G of the viola , second violin , and first violin , as an ascending arpeggio .
The first violin plays a descending flourish with the F♯ changed back to F natural , thus underscoring the paradoxical character of the initial F♯ grace note .
The rest at the end of measure 6 gives the listener a chance to now hear , in his mind , the first six measures as a One .
In measures 7 - 12 , the quartet projects the same motivic idea to a different place , which changes the intervallic relationship between the instruments and generates a new array of singularities [ Figure 7 ] .
The viola is displaced up a half - step , from E to F ; the second violin is displaced up a whole - step , from C to D ; and the first violin is displaced up a whole - step , from G to A .
Now the interval between the viola and the second violin is a minor third / major sixth , the complement of the major third / minor sixth of the first measure .
The grace note now becomes a G♯ , thus preserving the Lydian interval with the second violin .
As these next six measures unfold , a new unity is generated in the mind of listener , which is different from the One associated with the first six measures , but , because it is generated out of the first
One , the mind easily unifies both ideas into a new One which is associated with the change between the two sections .
The mind abstracts from this change that which is universal , but unheard .
The rest at the end of measure 12 directs the mind of the listener toward this objective .
In measures 13 - 17 , a still newer transformation is generated out of the previous twelve measures , which , when reflected in the mind of the listener , generates again a new One , causing the mind to abstract again a new universal from this new degree of change [ Figure 8 ] .
As they unfold in time , each transformation is discontinuous from the one preceding , yet thinking back , one hears  the transformations as a continuous process of change .
Haydn places no rest at the end of measure 17 , and from measure 18 onward this process continues , unfolding the implications of the initial idea , while the mind enfolds these developments into an unheard 
One , whose beauty increases as  the perfection becomes more complex and the nature suffers nothing thereby .
In measures 66 - 73 , the density of change is greatest as the implications of the initial motivic ideas are now themselves the subject of development [ Figure 9 ] .
The movement ends with the restatement of the initial idea , but this time it is heard in an entirely different way .
Mozarts String Quartet K. 464
In response to Haydns Opus 33 , Mozart , over the next few years , composed six string quartets which integrated Haydns development of the Motivführung , with J.S. Bachs discovery and elaboration of the properties of the major / minor mode .
Mozart dedicated these six quartets to Haydn .
Of particular interest is the string quartet K. 464 in A major , for it is known that Beethoven studied this quartet closely .
Here Mozart increases the density of change by generating the composition from a more condensed motivic idea [ Figure 10 ] .
Notice the way Mozart constructs the initial idea such that a seemingly simple , two - measure idea has embedded within it a fundamental paradox .
In measure 1 , the quartet begins with a simultaneous division of the octave into a major third and a perfect fifth ( A - A - C♯ - E ) .
In the last half of the second beat of measure 1 , the first violin descends one half - step to a D♯ , while the other instruments hold their original notes .
The listener is presented with the singularity of the Lydian interval when he hears this half - step change from E to D♯ in relation to the As of the cello and viola .
Now the violin , playing alone , ascends up a minor third to F♯ , taking it across the sopranos register shift between F and F♯ .
Then it descends step - wise a fourth to C♯ ( playing a D natural in contrast to the previous D♯ ) .
Then it ascends again a minor third to the E on which it started , and then it descends step - wise a fifth to an A , where it is joined by the other instruments which , when combined , play the same notes as those on which the piece began , except , significantly , in a different order ( C♯ - E - E - A ) .
This time the E is doubled instead of the A .
From measure 3 to measure 4 , all four instruments play simultaneous quarter notes .
The cello descends step - wise a fourth ( C♯ - B - A - G♯ ) ; the viola ascends step - wise a fifth , to B ( E - G♯ - A - B ) ; the second violin , starting from the same note ( E ) as the viola , reverses the violas direction , and descends to the B an octave lower than the viola , a step - wise fourth ( E - D - C ♯ - B ) .
To summarize , both the viola and the second violin start on the same note ( E ) and end on the same note ( B ) , but an octave apart .
Thus , the second violin ascends a fifth , while the viola descends the complement , a fourth .
The first violin then ascends step - wise a fourth ( A - B - C♯ - D ) .
In addition , the second violin also plays the same E with each note .
Even though this E does n't change its pitch , it is heard differently every time it is played , because everything around it changes .
A new Lydian interval , G♯ - D , is formed on the second beat of measure 3 , between the viola and second violin , and on the first beat of measure 4 , between the cello and the first violin .
All instruments rest on the second beat of measure 4 , directing the listener to bind what has just been heard , into a One .
Look at the types and density of audible singularities which are presented in these first four measures .
For example , the Lydian interval in measure 1 ; the changes in registration in measures 1 and 2 ; the difference between ascending and descending intervals , and the complementarity of the fourth and the fifth , in measures 3 and 4 .
All these singularities are embedded in what Mozart has organized into a seemingly simple idea , which the listener then re-creates in his mind as a thought - object which itself is unheard . 
From the last beat of measure 4 to the first beat of measure 7 , the quartet subjects what has just been heard to a transformation which produces a significant difference in the behavior of the singularities previously generated .
The statement opens with the intervals generated in measure 3 ( E - G♯ - B - D ) which contain the Lydian interval ( G♯ - D ) formed in measures 3 and 4 .
The first violin then plays the same intervals in measures 5 and 6 as it did in measures 1 and 2 , but displaced down one step , starting on D instead of E .
This displacement changes the behavior of the singularities thus produced .
The violin plays : descending half - step ( D - C♯ ) , ascending minor third ( C♯ - E ) , step - wise descending fourth ( E - B ) , ascending minor third ( B - D ) , step - wise descending Lydian ( D - G♯ ) ( instead of descending step - wise fifth , as in measure 2 ) .
In opposition to the opening , the new Lydian interval is this time heard in the notes played by the whole quartet at the beginning of the statement , but it disappears when the first violin plays alone .
Note the generative quality of the half - step interval D - C♯ - D - C♯ in the first violin in measures 5 and 6 , in contradistinction to the generative quality of the intervals E - D♯ - E - D-natural in measures 1 and 2 .
Measures 7 and 8 imitate measures 3 and 4 , but again with significant differences .
The first violin ascends step - wise a fourth , as in measure 3 , but this time starting a half - step lower ( G♯ - A - B - C♯ ) .
( Of course , this changes the internal relationships between the steps from whole - step , whole - step , half - step , in measure 3 , to half - step , whole - step , whole - step here . )
The second violin ascends step - wise a fourth ( E - F♯ - G - A ) , in contrast to the step - wise descending fourth from the same note in measure 3 .
The cello takes the E from the second violin in measure 3 , but plays this note as one continuous tone , instead of four separate ones , and then descends a fifth to A .
The viola descends a minor third by half - steps ( E - D♯ - D - C♯ ) .
Notice the formation of the two previously heard Lydian intervals , D♯ - A on beat two , and , D - G♯ on beat three .
The second beat of measure 8 is a rest , to allow the listener to form what has just been heard into a new thought - object .
As we have seen , measures 5 - 8 , being a transformation of measures 1 - 4 , seem to imitate them , but with significant differences .
Those differences are heard as changes in the behavior of the audible singularities presented .
Now the listener forms in his mind an abstraction of what is the same , and what has changed , between these two thought - objects , a new One which , while unheard ,  is as real as the audible tones from which it was generated .
From the last beat of measure 8 to the first beat of measure 12 , all four instruments play the same notes ( with the cello playing an octave lower ) .
Such a unison focuses the listener intensely on this more condensed form of what has been heard in the previous measures .
In measure 9 , the quartet ascends a major third ( A - C♯ ) taken from the very first notes of the piece ; then ascends and descends the half - step C♯ - D ( the generative interval of measures 5 and 6 ) ; and then descends a whole - step , to end on a B .
In measure 10 , after a rest , the quartet , drawing on the generative interval of measures 1 and 2 , starts on that B , and again ascends a major third ( B - D♯ ) , ascends again a half - step ( D♯ - E ) , but then descends a whole step to D- natural , and then descends a half - step to C♯ .
This is a condensed and more generalized restatement of the singularities embedded in the first nine measures ; yet , such a restatement would have been impossible without what has been previously unfolded .
After another rest , the quartet plays the opening notes ( C♯ - E - A - A ) in different registers , and in measure 13 , the first violin ascends the major third ( A - C♯ ) , then descends step - wise an octave and a fourth , as the quartet completes the initial development on the same notesan octave lower on which it began ( A - A - C♯ - E ) ( measure 16 ) .
Think back on what has been unfolded over these opening sixteen measures .
The piece began with a seemingly simple statement , rich in singularities .
This statement was then subjected to a transformation , presenting to the listener paradoxically change and no change .
Then , the generative principle of the transformation was abstracted out , and put in contradistinction to the generative principle of the original statement .
Finally , everything was brought together in a concluding statement .
Nothing was arbitrary .
Every development arose out of the opening idea which Mozart had so skillfully chosen .
Each step required new powers of thought for the listener .
The listeners happiness increases as he discovers the ease with which the powers of his own mind rise , seemingly effortlessly , on the beautiful tones of Mozarts composition .
And this is only the first sixteen measures !
The reader is encouraged to compare the kind of change represented here , with what was examined previously in the Haydn example .
Space limitations prevent us from fully exploring this composition .
We will , however , indicate several places for the reader to explore on his own .
Look at the last beat of measure 16 .
Here Mozart changes the C♯ to a C - natural , bringing us into the minor mode .
The opening idea is now subjected to even more rapid transformations in measures 16 - 24 .
Here , Mozart achieves a density of change which is not achieved in the Haydn example until measure 66 .
[ Figure 10 , measures 16 - 24 ] .
In addition to the increased density of change in this Mozart example , there is a unity across the movements , extending the Motivführung principle to the entire composition .
For example , the entire last movement , is generated from the three descending half - steps E - D♯ - D - C♯ ( minor third ) in measures 1 - 2 , stated by the viola in measure 7 of the first movement , embodying the initial paradox stated in the first movement , but now heard by the listener in an entirely different way [ Figure 11 ] .
Beethovens Opus 59 , No. 2
After extensive study and development of all previous music , Beethoven extended human knowledge further , reaching the greatest compositional power in his late string quartets .
To more adequately grasp the significance of those developments , let us first stop along the way and see the formation of his later ideas in their earlier stages .
In 1806 , Beethoven composed three string quartets dedicated to the Russian Count Razumovsky , published under Opus 59 .
In these quartets , Beethoven explored the boundary conditions of the major / minor mode , embarking on a course which ultimately led to his discovery of a higher ordering principle of musical space , elaborated in the late quartets .
A look at Op. 59 , No. 2 in E minor illustrates the point .
The first movement opens with two chords played by all four instruments of the quartet ( E - B - E - G - B - E - E minor ; D♯ - B - E - B - F♯ - B - B major ) marked forte and separated by an eighth - note rest [ Figure 12 ] .
These two chords present the listener , implicitly , with the boundary conditions of the major / minor mode .
The full measure rest [ measure 2 ] directs the listener to form in his mind a unified conception of these conditions .
In measures 3 and 4 , measure 1 is unfolded by the first violin and cello playing in octaves , a descending fourth , E - B , ascending minor sixth , B - G , and ascending major third , G - B .
The first violin continues , ascending to C , and then playing three rapidly descending minor thirds ( C - A - F♯ - D♯ ) , a descending major third ( D♯ - B ) , and an ascending fourth ( B - E : the inverse of the first interval of measure 3 ) .
Embedded within this descending violin line are two Lydian intervals ( C - F♯ , A - D♯ : the octave divided in half twice ) .
The full measure rest that follows [ measure 5 ] directs the listener to enfold into a One what has just been unfolded .
In measures 6 and 7 , joined now by the viola , this same idea is projected up a half - step to F , with the cello dropping into a lower register .
This projection changes the complementary intervallic relationships of measure 3 : descending fourth ( F - C ) , ascending major sixth ( C - A ) , ascending minor third ( A - C ) .
The order of the intervals in the descending violin line in measure 7 is changed to , first , a descending major third ( D - B♭ ) , followed by two descending minor thirds ( B♭ - G - E ) , a descending major third ( E - C ) , and an ascending fourth ( C - F ) .
Notice the invariance of the fourth while the other intervals change .
The full measure rest that follows [ measure 8 ] now directs the listener to hear as a One what this projection has changed , and not changed , and to abstract in the mind that which is universal about this development .
In measure 9 , Beethoven presses the boundaries of the major / minor mode .
The viola begins alone on F♯ , up another half - step from the previous section , but instead of descending a fourth as in measures 3 and 6 , the viola descends a minor third , as in the violin line of measures 4 and 7 , bringing it to the D♯ of the cello in measure 1 .
Then , instead of ascending a major or minor sixth , the viola ascends a Lydian interval to A .
Because the viola keeps the same rhythmical pattern as in measures 3 and 4 , the listener hears this intervallic change in relation to those measures .
The line continues , jumping now to the first violin , which in a new register begins on D♯ as the viola holds its A .
Thus , the listener hears the unique halving of the octave by the Lydian interval ( D♯ - A - D♯ ) .
Following the viola , the first violin descends a minor third ( D♯ - C ) , and then ascends a Lydian interval to F♯ .
So the sequence just heard is F♯ - D♯ - A - D♯ - C - F♯ .
Instead of the full measure rest that followed every previous statement , the quartet now rests  for the first half of measure 10 on the seemingly unstable Lydian intervals now played together ( D♯ - A - C - F♯ ) .
In the second half of measure 10 , the first violin descends a half - step to B- natural , resolving one of the Lydian intervals into a fifth ( B - F♯ ) .
This new type of rest directs the listener to form a new type of One .
In measure 11 , the first violin begins where it last ended on F♯ , and plays , an octave higher , the viola part from measure nine ( F♯ - D♯ - A ) .
The second violin plays different intervals starting on D♯ , descending a major third to B , and ascending a fifth to F♯ .
This is followed by the cello , which preserves the intervallic relationships of the first violin , but starting on A , descending a minor third to F♯ , then ascending a Lydian to C .
In measure 12 , the quartet rests  again , on the same notes as in measure 10 , but in a different order ( C - D♯ - F♯ - A ) .
Taking advantage of the leisure afforded us by our written medium , let us summarize what has just been unfolded .
In measure 1 , the quartet presented us with the minor mode , and after a rest , we were presented with the major mode .
We were given a full measure rest , to form in our minds something that had not been stated in this combination , the thought - object of the major / minor mode .
Then this was unfolded , first from E in measures 3 and 4 , then a half - step higher in measures 6 and 7 .
Each time , new singularities implicit in measure 1 were revealed .
This change caused us to form a new thought - object in our minds .
The Lydian intervals embedded in measures 4 and 7 , were then unfolded in measures 9 through 12 , which change caused us to form yet again a new thought - object .
This process continues throughout the movement .
For example , in measure 19 , the Lydian intervals arrived at in measure 10 , are now stated as the opening chords of measure 1 , but which now are themselves unfolded in yet another new way which is itself not possible without the development that preceeds it .
The reader should now compare this opening with the Haydn and Mozart examples .
See the greater complexity ( density of change ) , while the unity of effect is not lessened , indicating to us a higher unheard idea .
To get a sense of what potential has been developed in this opening , lets look briefly at the second movement , marked ,  Molto Adagio .
This piece is to be treated with much sentiment ,  which presents a further development but in an entirely different mood from the first movement , where the unfolding proceeds more slowly and contemplatively [ Figure 13 ] .
This movement has two parts , which , combined , form an unheard third idea .
As we will see , Beethoven will turn back to this form in his late quartet , Op. 132 .
In the first seven measures , the quartet functions as a four voice chorus ,  presenting various singularities of the major / minor mode .
This is followed by an unfolding .
In measures 52 - 56 , this chorus returns , followed by a new unfolding .
In measures 138 - 143 , this chorus returns again , followed by a final unfolding .
Each time the chorus returns , the unfolding which follows is changed .
In measure 1 , the first violin begins with a descending half - step ( E - D♯ ) , extracted from the cello in measure 1 of the first movement .
Each voice enters , in the low register , a fourth below and two beats after the previous entrance .
This is heard in reference to measures 3 and 6 of the first movement .
The cello enters on C♯ and , like the first violin , descends a half - step to C- natural ; this leads in measure 3 to the Lydian intervals ( C - F♯ - D♯ - A ) , which are again heard in reference to the first movements development .
In measure 4 , the second violin descends two half - steps ( E - D♯ - D- natural ) .
When the D - natural is heard , the rest of the quartet stops .
Instead of a complete rest , as in the first movement , to allow for the formation of a One , here the listener hears both the D- natural and the unheard rests .
When the first violin re-enters in measure 5 on a B , played now in the middle register , this combination of the heard and the unheard ,  creates an ambiguity which allows the listener to hear the major and minor as one unified mode .
This is the inverse of the opening of the first movement ( E minor / B major in the first movement ; E major / B minor here . )
On the first beat of measure 7 , the chorus presents the listener with a new Lydian interval ( E - A♯ ) , which forms the boundary with the next key , B major .
This interval is played forte ( loud ) for emphasis , and in contrast to the piano ( soft ) played both before and after it .
What follows is a beautiful unfolding beginning on B , which is best heard directly by the reader .
In measures 43 - 47 , the first violin counterposes this transition to B with all twelve tones of the well - tempered system [ Figure 14 ] .
In measures 52 - 56 , the chorus returns , this time in a higher register [ Figure 15 ] .
When the unfolding resumes , the A♯ has changed back to an A .
In measure 123 - 126 , the first violin counterposes the notes of E major to all twelve tones of the well - tempered system [ Figure 16 ] .
In measures 138 - 143 , the chorus returns a final time , followed again by the unfolding [ Figure 17 ] .
Each chorus presents a variation of the opening seven measures , but each is heard in relationship to the previous unfolding .
This juxtaposition of such seemingly different ideas , generates a new thought - object in the mind of the listener .
Beethovens Opus 132
Approximately twenty years after composing the Razumovsky quartets , in what were to be the last years of his life , Beethoven composed a series of five string quartets and  Grosse Fuge ,  which comprise the highest development of musical science achieved to this day .
In these quartets , Beethoven launched a revolution in musical composition , by elaborating a new ordering principle for the well - tempered system , which corresponds to a higher power of thought .
The singularities of the major / minor mode are seen in an entirely new way ; the boundaries between keys are dissolved and the entire well - tempered system is conceptualized under a new more generalized order type .
In mathematical terms , this new ordering principle externally bounds the major / minor mode of the well - tempered system .
At a future time we will examine more fully all these revolutionary compositions .
For now , let s look at Opus 132 in A minor , which includes the famous third movement marked ,  Heiliger Dankgesang eines Genesenen an die Gottheit , in der lydischen Tonart ( A holy song of thanks to the Divinity , in the Lydian mode ) .
The Lydian mode is a division of the octave based on the F - major scale with a B - natural instead of the B♪ .
This ordering has the unique property , that the interval which divides the octave in half , identified as the  Lydian interval above , is part of the mode itself , i.e. , F - B-natural .
However , the potential for compositional freedom is less than in the major / minor mode , because the Lydian mode lacks the major / minor modes complementary relationship between the fourth and the fifth [ Figure 18 ] .
Ironically , Beethoven generates , by reference to this combination of the Lydian mode and the major / minor mode , a higher modality , subsuming the properties of both .
This higher modality or ordering principle of the well - tempered system , is neither the Lydian mode , nor the major / minor mode , nor a simple summation of the two .
The higher ordering principle corresponds to a higher power of conceptualization , which Beethoven elaborates through the composition of these last quartets .
The listener hears the results of this creative process in the greater density of change achieved in the compositions .
At all times , however , Beethoven maintains a unity of effect , because he adheres rigorously to all the principles of Classical musical composition established by the creative discoveries of his predecessors .
After Beethovens death , the so - called Romantics and moderns made every effort to destroy Beethovens accomplishment , by claiming that Beethoven , in the late quartets , had liberated them from the constraints of Classical tonality .
They were enamored with the greater potential for sensual effects resulting from this perceived liberation .
Not surprisingly , what they produced is best described as organized , or in some cases disorganized , noise .
Beethovens new conception is expressed in the opening eight measures of Opus 132 .
Here , the quartet imitates a four - part chorus of human singing voices , announcing the new idea in song [ Figure 19 ] .
The piece begins with the cello playing alone , in a low register , and very softly the ascending half - step G♯ - A .
Each tone of this interval is equal in time and volume , creating an ambiguity because the listener cannot tell which one is primary .
This interval references what a physicist would call a boundary condition .
The G♯ is the leading tone to the tonic A , and at the same time the Lydian interval to D .
But there is a further ambiguity .
Is this interval that of the leading tone to the tonic , or is it that of the fifth to the minor sixth of C minor , or that of the third to the fourth of E , etc . ?
Or is it many things at once ?
In measure 2 , the viola , in its low register , reverses this interval at an octave higher ( A - G♯ ) , which reinforces the ambiguous nature of the opening interval .
At the same time , the cello , in a different register , also plays a descending half - step , but on different tones ( F - E ) .
This also references a boundary condition : the minor sixth to the fifth , and the tonic to the leading tone in F .
Aided by the transparency provided by the change in registration the mind of the listener goes two places simultaneously : G♯ - A - A - G♯ ( cello to viola ) ; and G♯ - A - F - E ( cello ) .
While the mind is forming an unheard idea from the comparison of these two heard intervals , the second violin enters , on the last two beats of measure 2 , on a B in its low register .
In measure 3 , the first violin , in its low register , projects the opening interval up a fifth , playing the ascending interval D♯ - E .
This also references a boundary condition , as D♯ is the Lydian interval to the tonic A , and the leading tone to E.
Simultaneously , the second violin plays exactly the same tones as the viola in measure 2 , the descending half - step A - G♯ ; but , significantly for purposes of transparency , the difference in tone between the viola and the violin causes this to sound different .
The viola , at the same time , projects the cellos F - E up a fifth , playing another descending half - step ( C - B ) , which references a different but similar boundary condition .
Measure 4 continues the projections just begun .
The first violin continues the projection up a fifth from the cello line , changing registers and playing the descending interval C - B an octave higher than what was just played by the viola .
In imitation , the viola plays what the first violin just played , but drops an octave instead .
The first violin returns to the low A , adding an F♯ and a G♯.
Before going on , let us look at what has been generated in these first four measures .
By simple projection , inversion , and registration of the opening ascending half - step , Beethoven has juxtaposed a multitude of boundary conditions for the listener , which enable him to form in his mind an unheard conception of the manifold from which these boundary conditions arise .
Evidencing these boundary conditions are the Lydian intervals ( A - D♯ ) produced between the two violins in measure 3 , and the Lydian intervals generated in measure 4 ( A - D♯ between the viola and second violin , and F♯ - C between the two violins ) .
The cello re-enters in measure 5 , repeating measure 2 ( F - E ) .
The viola jumps to a high register and inverts the first violin line from the previous measure 4 , playing the ascending interval B - C .
The second violin , still in a low register , plays the descending whole - step D-C , and the first violin jumps to a higher register and repeats its first two notes ( G♯ - A ) .
Measure 6 continues this process of inversion , projection , and registration .
The violin , still in the high register , mimics the violas inversion of its own line , playing the ascending half - step B - C .
The second violin mimics the cellos F - E , and adds a C .
The viola mimics the second violin from the previous measure ( D - C ) , and the cello mimics its own opening ( G♯ - A ) , which is now heard in an entirely different way from when those same notes were first presented to the listener .
With each new transformation , the listener hears an increasing density of combinations of boundary conditions , as evidenced by the generation of Lydian intervals : in measure five , F - B between the cello and viola , and D - G♯ between the violins ; and these same intervals in different order in measure 6 , G♯ - D between the cello and viola , and F - B between the two violins .
Further projections and transformations occur in measure 7 .
The first violin inverts itself ( C - B ) .
The second violin inverts the opening cello notes ( A - G♯ ) .
The viola mimics the second violin from measure 4 ( F♯ - G♯ ) .
The cello drops to its lowest register , projecting its opening notes ( D♯ - E ) down a fourth , , which were themselves already played by the first violin as a projection up a fifth in measure 3 .
Again , new orderings of these boundary conditions are produced , evidenced by the generation of more Lydian intervals : D♯ - A between the cello and second violin ; F♯ - C between the viola and first violin .
A new ordering is generated in measure 8 , leading to the rapidly descending minor thirds of the first violin in measures 9 and 10 .
Reflect again on these amazing eight measures .
Because everything in them is generated by projection , inversion , and registration of the cellos ambiguous opening two notes , there is a total unity of effect across all voices and all measures .
And , because these two notes themselves reference a boundary condition , while at the same time are ambiguous , there is a greater density of singularities produced .
As a result of these two considerations , the mind is led to create a new and higher conception , a reflection of Beethovens new ordering principle which is of a higher cardinality .
Compare these first eight measures with the previous examples of Haydn , Mozart , and Beethoven .
In those examples , the singularities were embedded in the opening intervals , and revealed as those intervals were unfolded .
Here the opening interval is itself the singularity .
Having created a new and higher conception in the mind of the listener , Beethoven now puts the listener to work exploring the implications of this discovery .
First , in measure 11 , the cello condenses the first eight measures into a singing line played in its highest register ( A - B - C - B - A - G♯ ) , ending ironically on the leading tone ( G♯ ) , the same tone on which the piece began .
These tones have been abstracted from the opening eight measures , in the manner Cantor defines for the generation of transfinite numbers ; that is , each tone played by the cello in this measure , is heard in relationship to the tonality defined in the first eight measures .
For example , in measures 103 - 106 , the entire quartet restates fortissimo the first violins opening line , which itself is a projection from the cellos opening [ Figure 20 ] .
In measures 193 - 202 , the opening notes are juxtaposed to the cellos abstraction , forming a new thought - object from the combination of the two [ Figure 21 ] .
Now , look at the previously mentioned third movement .
This movement is composed of five sections : three are marked Molto Adagio and written in the Lydian mode , alternating with two marked Andante and written in D major [ Figure 22 ] .
The movement begins with one of the Molto Adagio sections .
Here , the quartet again assumes the role of an imitation human vocal choir , singing , as a canon , this holy hymn of thanks to God .
These sections are written solely using the eight tones of the Lydian mode , with no sharps or flats , yet there is no lack of development .
The first violin starts alone , ascending a major sixth ( C - A ) which crosses from a low to a middle register .
The violin then descends a whole step to G , and ascends a fourth to C .
At the same time , the second violin enters , repeating the ascending major sixth ( C - A ) , but then descending an octave to G in the low register , and then repeating the first violins ascending fourth to bring it back to its original C [ measure 1 ] .
The second violin also adds an E , making explicit the minor third implied by the major sixth ( C - A ) .
On the last two beats of this measure , the viola enters , in its low register , repeating again the rising major sixth ( C - A ) , and then continues the line in the next measure , dropping to G and ascending to C , as the cello enters with the ascending sixth ( C - A ) [ measure 2 ] .
So in these first two - and - a - half measures , the intervals , ascending sixth , descending whole - step , and ascending fourth , are played as a sequence horizontally ( over time ) as well as vertically ( simultaneously ) , explicitly directing the listener to hear the interval between the intervals .
Here the audible singularities generated by complementary intervals ascending in comparison with descending and registration , are clearly heard .
In measures 6 - 8 , these intervals are projected and inverted .
The first violin , in a high register , starts on A , descends a fifth to D , ascends step - wise a fourth to G , descends step - wise a minor third to E , and finally descends a major sixth to G .
The second violin follows the first , except the descending fifth ( A - D ) is in a lower register , and then it descends a fifth to Gcontrary to the first violins ascending fourth to G .
The viola enters with the descending fourth ( A - D ) , but the cello introduces something new , a descending minor sixth ( G - B ) hearkening back to the ascending minor sixth ( A - F ) of the first movement .
This generates the Lydian interval F - B between the cello and the first violin , which is generated again two beats later between the viola and second violin .
In measures 12 - 13 , these same intervals are projected in the cello , down and into a different register , to G ; they are then projected up into a different register in measures 18 - 19 , by the first violin .
In measures 24 - 25 , we are back to the opening , but in different registers .
As this section unfolds , the listener seeks to form a One , but because of the ambiguous way the intervals are presented , that One cannot be associated with any particular key or succession of keys .
Instead , the listeners mind must form a One that is above the separation between keys .
Compare this to the choral opening measures of the first movement , which achieve a similar effect , but from a different direction , so to speak .
The thought - object thus defined is a new and higher conception of the ordering of the well - tempered system .
The entire Molto Adagio is brought into a One with the abrupt shift to the Andante at measure 31 .
Suddenly , the quartet switches to D major , formed by changing the F to F♯ ( the Lydian of C ) and the C to C♯ ( the Lydian of G ) .
Beethoven subtitles this section  Neue Kraft fühlend  (  Feeling new power ) , something experienced immediately by the listener .
With the unfolding of this section , the listener forms two distinct objects in the mind : the One associated with the Molto Adagio and the One associated with the following Andante .
These now form a new unheard 
One in the mind .
The Molto Adagio returns , but this time changed .
The opening intervals are the same ( C - A - G - C ) , but the duration of the G and the second C are cut in half , and are now played as eighth notes , creating a greater density of effect [ Figure 23 ] .
This more developed section is again compared in the mind of the listener with the previous two sections , forming yet again a new One .
After thirty - one measures , the Andante returns .
This is again followed by the Molto Adagio , this time marked ,  Mit innigster Empfindung  (  With more fervent sentiment ) [ Figure 24 ] .
Now Beethoven directs the listener to combine everything previously heard , into a newer One .
This is achieved by increasing the density yet again , through a rhythmical change and adding a D , which references the Andante section , to the generating intervals ( C - A - G - C - D - C ) .
This creates in the mind a combination of the seemingly disparate previous Molto Adagio and Andante sections .
This combination reveals an even greater potential implicit in this new and higher conception , lifting the listener to new powers of thought and reaching a peak with the condensation articulated in measures 191 - 192 [ Figure 25 ] .
Beethoven did not limit the new musical conceptions presented in Opus 132 to just one composition , and it were useful , before ending this report , to point the reader to other examples from among the late quartets , so that you may explore them for yourself .
In Opus 131 in C♯ minor ( written after the Opus 132 , although published earlier ) , for example , Beethoven opens with a fugue generated from an ascending and descending major third , separated by a half - step . [ Figure 26 ] .
These intervals , like the opening to Op. 132 , are on the boundaries and generate ambiguities , such as ; is the B♯ to C♯ the leading tone to the tonic of C♯ minor or is it the third to the fourth of G♯ minor ?
From this Beethoven unfolds the longest of his late quartets .
Or , we have the extraordinary  Grosse Fuge ,  in which Beethoven composes an entire fugue from a motivic idea made up wholly of singularities generated by the boundary conditions embedded in the well - tempered system [ Figure 27 ] .
Looking Back Now , look back at the four compositions : Haydns Op. 33 , No. 3 ; Mozarts K. 464 ; Beethovens Op. 59 , No. 2 ; and Beethovens Op. 132 .
Construct in your mind , as a One , the successive increases in conceptual power , won for us by the creative work of over forty years by three of the greatest geniuses humanity has ever produced .
From our vantage point , looking back , we can see the kernel of each successive development embedded in the previous one .
It appears continuous but it was n't .
For each successive breakthrough occurred only by a discontinuous leap , secured solely through the creative powers of the composer the same creative powers which , through these compositions , we may sometimes glimpse in ourselves .

By Caroline Wyatt
BBC News , Paris
Hundreds of thousands of people - mostly students - have taken to the streets in France for a second week of protests against the controversial new employment contracts .
Caroline Wyatt has been considering whether they might be the symptom of a greater malaise in French society .
" To the barricades ! " is the cry heard again on the streets of France , as they ring to the sound of student chants .
Anger is focused on a new job contract to tackle chronic unemployment
A delicious sense of people power has gripped the French and most of all , the students I mingled with a few days ago as they marched arm in arm through the boulevards of Paris , shouting their anger with the government .
To the barricades , they went , these revolutionaries , to fight for their rights - to pensions , mortgages and a steady job .
Such odd revolutionaries .
No heartfelt cry to change the world , but a plea for everything to stay the same .
For France to remain in its glorious past : a time of full employment and jobs for life - a paternalistic state to take care of them from cradle to grave .
Cause and effect
So what brought this on ?
On the surface , a new youth employment contract , aimed at helping young people get their first job - no easy task in a country with 10 % unemployment , but almost one in four out of work among the young .
It 's a contract that would allow employers to take a chance , to hire a youngster in the knowledge that the trial period could be up to two years long , and the normal French restrictions on firing would not apply .
But scratch the surface and it is a far wider issue .
The trouble with France has been brewing for decades .
In an echoing stone courtyard at Paris University , Marion and other students are making banners to carry on their march .
" Mr Villepin , you are not the king " , they read , a reminder of what happened to France 's aristocracy after people power won out in times gone by .
" I have n't studied hard to get nothing at the end of it , " says Marion , with indignation .
" I 've earned the right to a secure job . "
A secure job like the one her parents and grandparents enjoyed .
A recent survey suggested that for most of the young in France , the real dream is to become a civil servant - a fonctionnaire .
To work in government offices with regular hours , long holidays , and a 35 hour working week .
Revolt
One teacher looks on with an indulgent smile .
English professor Jenny Lowe took to the barricades herself in May 1968 .
All it could take is one careless spark for this howl of existential anxiety to explode
" We thought anything was possible then , " she says , " but these days , it 's rather different , " she gestures at her students .
And Jenny Lowe is right .
As the world around them changes at a baffling rate , her students want the old certainties back - but these are certainties France can no longer guarantee .
No country and no government could .
Yet the belief in an all - powerful government is a very French creation , an attachment that goes deep .
" The government must create jobs , " Victor , an economics student tells me as he prepares to march again .
He will walk alongside his parents at the next protest , the first time the family has demonstrated together since 1995 .
That is when the young Victor was taken for his first taste of people power - then the French got rid of Prime Minister Alain Juppe and his plans for economic reform .
Mr Juppe 's latest successor Dominique de Villepin is receiving conflicting advice from his own MPs on what to do next to avoid the same fate .
Hold firm , say some .
We need a French Margaret Thatcher right now .
Give in , others advise , listen to the streets because in France you cannot govern without them .
And it is true that politically , a war has begun for the very soul of France , to decide how it faces the future .
The left here senses a weakened president , and a prime minister perhaps mortally wounded by his battle with cabinet rival Nicholas Sarkozy for the ultimate prize - the nomination for the presidency next year .
De Villepin , say his foes , is ready to drag down France to achieve his ambition : gaining the Elysee Palace .
Existential anxiety
And France today does feel like a tinder box , a nation dancing on a volcano - just as it did in the troubled suburbs last year .
The employment law is Dominique de Villepin 's pet project
Last week they indulged in an orgy of violence near the Sorbonne on the Left Bank , the intellectual heart of Paris .
All it could take is one careless spark for this howl of existential anxiety to explode .
And yet , Paris still feels like the Paris of old .
The front page of Paris Match carried an iconic photograph .
Shot on a slow exposure , as if smudged by moonlight , a couple dance near the River Seine .
Behind them is a row of riot police , shields aloft , like a guard of honour .
The girl 's long hair fans out in the evening air as she is twirled around in a late - night last waltz , by a young Frenchman with a smile and his arm around her waist .
And just faintly , comes the echo of May 1968 and a reminder that in France , even revolution for a mortgage and a pension has its own mysterious allure .

Every evening , before I switch off the bedside light , I take my right leg off and plug it into the mains .
I am a below - knee amputee .
I lost my leg in 2003 after stepping on a landmine while covering the war in Iraq for BBC News .
Unfortunately , my prosthesis does n't enable me to leap over a wall with a single bound or run faster than a speeding bullet
Stuart Hughes
The word " bionic " inevitably conjures up memories of the 1970s TV series , the Six Million Dollar Man .
Unfortunately , my prosthesis does n't enable me to leap over a wall with a single bound or run faster than a speeding bullet .
Rather , it uses sensors and a built - in microprocessor to mimic some of the actions of a human foot .
The Proprio Foot is one of a new range of bionic artificial limbs designed by Ossur , a prosthetics company based in Iceland .
" The sensors detect whether the user is walking on level ground , going uphill or downhill or climbing steps , " says Ossur 's Richard Hirons .
" Every type of terrain has a distinct ' signature ' which the software controlling the foot is able to interpret .
When the microprocessor recognises a change in terrain , it instructs a very accurate motor to automatically adjust the angle of the foot in preparation for the next step . "
Motor control
Researchers have been connecting man and machine since the 60s when they first began using electrodes attached to the body to direct motorised arms to move and bend .
1. Prosthetic socket 2 . Battery 3 . Battery cable 4 . Keypad and circuit board 5 . accelerometers - sensors - to track movement and pick up slopes , stairs etc 6 . motor drive to pivot heel 7 . actuator brings down toe during each step
How amputees learn to walk
" The technology is a lot cheaper now , " Professor Zahedi says .
" Electronic components that would have cost hundreds of pounds 10 years ago now cost just a few pounds .
" Computer - controlled devices can be programmed and are much more flexible , which is why designers are choosing them instead of complicated and expensive mechanical devices . "
One market keeping a close eye on developments is the military , which has seen a rise in the number of amputees among its ranks .
Advances in battlefield medicine and better protective equipment mean that many soldiers who would once have died are now surviving , but are returning from war zones with horrific injuries .
Hundreds of soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have lost limbs , many due to roadside bombs and improvised explosive devices .
If an amputee soldier wants to remain on active duty , we are going to find a job for him
Colonel Daniel Garvey
" The mindset , even as early as five years ago , was if a soldier had impairments such as an amputation , they are unfit and they may be at risk to others around them if put in a combat situation .
That has changed , " says Colonel Daniel Garvey , Deputy Commander of the US Army Physical Disability Agency .
" If a soldier wants to remain on active duty , we are going to find a job for him .
That is a cultural change for us . "
Count the cost
But Grania Hyde - Smith , from the Limbless Association , a charity which provides advice and support to amputees , urges caution .
She says the cost of the current generation of bionic limbs - up to £ 60,000 for some powered knee systems - puts them beyond the reach of many users .
Ms Hyde - Smith wants more research to be carried out into whether the benefits justify the hefty price tag .
There 's bound to come a time where the concept of the bionic man stops being just science fiction
Saeed Zahedi
" People are reading about the new technology and are getting very excited about it -- and rightly so .
" But if you speak to health care professionals and prosthetists they say it 's still very early days .
They 're not sure the new systems have been tried and tested sufficiently . "
Some researchers believe the current generation of bionic limbs is just the beginning .
They are working towards the day when man and machine are seamlessly integrated .
" There 's bound to come a time where the concept of the bionic man stops being just science fiction , " says Professor Zahedi .
" Promising work is taking place with limb transplants .
One day it may be possible to create hybrid limbs which combine human tissue with electromechanical devices .
Experiments with neural implants are also progressing quite rapidly , connecting the nervous system to external devices .
What we 're seeing at the moment is just the tip of the iceberg . "
Perhaps one day an electronically - enhanced human being - " better , stronger , faster " as the opening titles of the Six Million Dollar Man put it - will be a reality .
But bionic technology is already bringing benefits for amputees like me - just so long as we do n't forget to recharge our batteries .
I disagree with Grania Hyde - Smith , from the Limbless Association .
I 've been an above - knee amputee for five years now .
I have a C Leg , by Ottobock .
It contains a microprocessor as described in the article .
The difference in my quality of life from using this leg versus a traditional mechanical leg is worth way more than 60 K pounds .
The amount of energy I use to walk is greatly reduced .
I fall less often than I would , since the knee detects stumbles and changes in walking speed and adjusts for them .
This all means I can work fulltime , care for my two year old son , and have as independent a life as possible .
Juliet , USA
I think the trauma of losing a part of your leg would prevent 99 % of soldiers returning to the battlefield .
To lose a limb like this must affect the way you were before
Robin Yates , Swindon , Dudley
I retired from the US Army after 30 years of serving our great country .
During my duty at Fort Stewart , I visited our soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Center , MD , every month .
I strongly agree with Col Garvey - keep amputee soldiers in our army .
This was my number one request when I visited our soldiers .
Wounded in action soldiers want to serve .
CSM ( R ) US Army , Sam Perrotta , Richmond Hill , Georgia
There is one very famous military amputee that went back to the front line 60 years ago - Group Captain Douglas Bader .
Injured in a crash in the 20s , fought everyone to get back in to the air force , there was no reason why he should n't have been he could fly better than anyone else .
It was just not accepted by anyone , but Douglas fought all the way and one , he was one of the reasons why we won the Battle of Britain .
Richard , West Wickham
For 25 years I 've had a lower leg that , while still there , has been seriously compromised ( war injury ) .
This is the first thing I 've seen that makes me feel that it might be better if my leg did drop off one day .
Charles Haley , Harare , Zimbabwe
Bravo bionic technology , I have always long to see the end to the sufferings of the limbless .
Disability is not inability and so incorporating them back in to society bridges the gap .
The cost is the only drawback , I hope it will be cheap and affordable one day .
Aaron Tellve Pabai , Freetown , Sierra Leone
I can't wait to get a bionic foot so that I can go walking on all sorts of terrain not just flat surfaces .
It will make amputees much fitter because as you get older it is more difficult to take exercise which involves walking or running .
Wendy Gething , East Bridgford , Nottingham
Might the day come when prosthetic limbs are better than their organic equivalent ?
- then everyone might want upgraded body parts .
In time I 'm sure we could come up with some ' alternative ' designs that improve on the original and allow movement not currently envisaged .
Exciting stuff !
Anthony , Bristol
I remember reading concepts about heel - powered systems to provide electrical energy through walking ; the focus market was laptop users .
Could lower body limbs use the compression of impact whilst walking to recharge their power levels .
If it worked , then the limb could even use a smaller battery .

This is quite clever but there 's one additional tip that takes it from " clever " to " really , truly useful " .
Supposing you 're using the bar chart to show a project schedule .
If you 're doing that then ...
column A contains the task names
column B contains the number of days / weeks / months before the task will begin .
column C contains the number of days / weeks / months a task will take .
And cell D1 contains the formula :
= Rept ( " " , B1 ) & Rept ( " | " , C1 )
Now just copy the formula down column D . You 'll get staggered " bars " showing when tasks will begin and how long they will take .
Some further minor enhancements : a column with task start dates and another with task end dates means that the number of days before the task starts can be calculated dynamically and the duration of the tasks can also be calculated dynamically and that means the bar chart can be generated dynamically .
With a bit of tidying up , some nice headers , perhaps a bit colour , you 'll have something to impress management ( and also be quite useful ) .
I will definitely be using this tip .
Thank you , Gus !

The Security Threat of Unchecked Presidential Power
This past Thursday , the New York Times exposed the most significant violation of federal surveillance law in the post - Watergate era .
President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to engage in domestic spying , wiretapping thousands of Americans and bypassing the legal procedures regulating this activity .
This is n’t about the spying , although that ’s a major issue in itself .
This is about the Fourth Amendment protections against illegal search .
This is about circumventing a teeny tiny check by the judicial branch , placed there by the legislative branch , placed there 27 years ago — on the last occasion that the executive branch abused its power so broadly .
In defending this secret spying on Americans , Bush said that he relied on his constitutional powers ( Article 2 ) and the joint resolution passed by Congress after 9/11 that led to the war in Iraq .
This rationale was spelled out in a memo written by John Yoo , a White House attorney , less than two weeks after the attacks of 9/11 .
It ’s a dense read and a terrifying piece of legal contortionism , but it basically says that the president has unlimited powers to fight terrorism .
He can spy on anyone , arrest anyone , and kidnap anyone and ship him to another country … merely on the suspicion that he might be a terrorist .
And according to the memo , this power lasts until there is no more terrorism in the world .
Yoo starts by arguing that the Constitution gives the president total power during wartime .
He also notes that Congress has recently been quiescent when the president takes some military action on his own , citing President Clinton ’s 1998 strike against Sudan and Afghanistan .
Yoo then says : “ The terrorist incidents of September 11 , 2001 , were surely far graver a threat to the national security of the United States than the 1998 attacks .
…
The President ’s power to respond militarily to the later attacks must be correspondingly broader . ”
This is novel reasoning .
It ’s as if the police would have greater powers when investigating a murder than a burglary .
More to the point , the congressional resolution of Sept. 14 , 2001 , specifically refused the White House ’s initial attempt to seek authority to preempt any future acts of terrorism , and narrowly gave Bush permission to go after those responsible for the attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center .
Yoo ’s memo ignored this .
Written 11 days after Congress refused to grant the president wide - ranging powers , it admitted that “ the Joint Resolution is somewhat narrower than the President ’s constitutional authority , ” but argued “ the President ’s broad constitutional power to use military force … would allow the President to … [ take ] whatever actions he deems appropriate … to pre-empt or respond to terrorist threats from new quarters . ”
Even if Congress specifically says no .
The result is that the president ’s wartime powers , with its armies , battles , victories , and congressional declarations , now extend to the rhetorical “ War on Terror ” : a war with no fronts , no boundaries , no opposing army , and — most ominously — no knowable “ victory . ”
Investigations , arrests , and trials are not tools of war .
But according to the Yoo memo , the president can define war however he chooses , and remain “ at war ” for as long as he chooses .
This is indefinite dictatorial power .
And I do n’t use that term lightly ; the very definition of a dictatorship is a system that puts a ruler above the law .
In the weeks after 9/11 , while America and the world were grieving , Bush built a legal rationale for a dictatorship .
Then he immediately started using it to avoid the law .
This is , fundamentally , why this issue crossed political lines in Congress .
If the president can ignore laws regulating surveillance and wiretapping , why is Congress bothering to debate reauthorizing certain provisions of the Patriot Act ?
Any debate over laws is predicated on the belief that the executive branch will follow the law .
This is not a partisan issue between Democrats and Republicans ; it ’s a president unilaterally overriding the Fourth Amendment , Congress and the Supreme Court .
Unchecked presidential power has nothing to do with how much you either love or hate George W. Bush .
You have to imagine this power in the hands of the person you most do n’t want to see as president , whether it be Dick Cheney or Hillary Rodham Clinton , Michael Moore or Ann Coulter .
Laws are what give us security against the actions of the majority and the powerful .
If we discard our constitutional protections against tyranny in an attempt to protect us from terrorism , we ’re all less safe as a result .
This essay was published today as an op -ed in the Minneapolis Star Tribune .
Here ’s the opening paragraph of the Yoo memo .
Remember , think of this power in the hands of your least favorite politician when you read it :
You have asked for our opinion as to the scope of the President ’s authority to take military action in response to the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11 , 2001 .
We conclude that the President has broad constitutional power to use military force .
Congress has acknowledged this inherent executive power in both the War Powers Resolution , Pub . L. No. 93-148 , 87 Stat. 555 ( 1973 ) , codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1541 -1548 ( the “ WPR ” ) , and in the Joint Resolution passed by Congress on September 14 , 2001 , Pub .
L. No. 107-40 , 115 Stat. 224 ( 2001 ) .
Further , the President has the constitutional power not only to retaliate against any person , organization , or State suspected of involvement in terrorist attacks on the United States , but also against foreign States suspected of harboring or supporting such organizations .
Finally , the President may deploy military force preemptively against terrorist organizations or the States that harbor or support them , whether or not they can be linked to the specific terrorist incidents of September 11 .
There ’s a similar reasoning in the Braybee memo , which was written in 2002 about torture :
In a series of opinions examining various legal questions arising after September 11 , we have examined the scope of the President ’s Commander - in - Chief power .
. . .
Foremost among the objectives committed by the Constitution to [ the President ’s ] trust .
As Hamilton explained in arguing for the Constitution ’s adoption , “ because the circumstances which may affect the public safety are not reducible within certain limits , it must be admitted , as a necessary consequence , that there can be no limitation of that authority , which is to provide for the defense and safety of the community , in any manner essential to its efficacy . ” . . . [ The Constitution ’s ] sweeping grant vests in the President an unenumerated Executive power . . .
The Commander in Chief power and the President ’s obligation to protect the Nation imply the ancillary powers necessary to their successful exercise .
NSA watcher James Bamford points out how this action was definitely considered illegal in 1978 , which is why FISA was passed in the first place :
When the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was created in 1978 , one of the things that the Attorney General at the time , Griffin Bell , said — he testified before the intelligence committee , and he said that the current bill recognizes no inherent power of the President to conduct electronic surveillance .
He said , “ This bill specifically states that the procedures in the bill are the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance may be conducted . ”
In other words , what the President is saying is that he has these inherent powers to conduct electronic surveillance , but the whole reason for creating this act , according to the Attorney General at the time , was to prevent the President from using any inherent powers and to use exclusively this act .
Also this from Salon , discussing a 1952 precedent :
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales argues that the president ’s authority rests on two foundations : Congress ’s authorization to use military force against al - Qaida , and the Constitution ’s vesting of power in the president as commander - in - chief , which necessarily includes gathering “ signals intelligence ” on the enemy .
But that argument cannot be squared with Supreme Court precedent .
In 1952 , the Supreme Court considered a remarkably similar argument during the Korean War. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , widely considered the most important separation - of - powers case ever decided by the court , flatly rejected the president ’s assertion of unilateral domestic authority during wartime .
President Truman had invoked the commander - in - chief clause to justify seizing most of the nation ’s steel mills .
A nationwide strike threatened to undermine the war , Truman contended , because the mills were critical to manufacturing munitions .
The Supreme Court ’s rationale for rejecting Truman ’s claims applies with full force to Bush ’s policy .
In what proved to be the most influential opinion in the case , Justice Robert Jackson identified three possible scenarios in which a president ’s actions may be challenged .
Where the president acts with explicit or implicit authorization from Congress , his authority “ is at its maximum , ” and will generally be upheld .
Where Congress has been silent , the president acts in a “ zone of twilight ” in which legality “ is likely to depend on the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law . ”
But where the president acts in defiance of “ the expressed or implied will of Congress , ” Justice Jackson maintained , his power is “ at its lowest ebb , ” and his actions can be sustained only if Congress has no authority to regulate the subject at all .
In the steel seizure case , Congress had considered and rejected giving the president the authority to seize businesses in the face of threatened strikes , thereby placing President Truman ’s action in the third of Justice Jackson ’s categories .
As to the war power , Justice Jackson noted , “ The Constitution did not contemplate that the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy will constitute him also Commander in Chief of the country , its industries , and its inhabitants . ”
Like Truman , President Bush acted in the face of contrary congressional authority .
In FISA , Congress expressly addressed the subject of warrantless wiretaps during wartime , and limited them to the first 15 days after war is declared .
Congress then went further and made it a crime , punishable by up to five years in jail , to conduct a wiretap without statutory authorization .
The Attorney General said that the Administration did n’t try to do this legally , because they did n’t think they could get the law passed .
But do n’t worry , an NSA shift supervisor is acting in the role of a FISC judge :
GENERAL HAYDEN : FISA involves the process — FISA involves marshaling arguments ; FISA involves looping paperwork around , even in the case of emergency authorizations from the Attorney General .
And beyond that , it ’s a little — it ’s difficult for me to get into further discussions as to why this is more optimized under this process without , frankly , revealing too much about what it is we do and why and how we do it .
Q
If FISA did n’t work , why did n’t you seek a new statute that allowed something like this legally ?
ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES :
That question was asked earlier .
We ’ve had discussions with members of Congress , certain members of Congress , about whether or not we could get an amendment to FISA , and we were advised that that was not likely to be — that was not something we could likely get , certainly not without jeopardizing the existence of the program , and therefore , killing the program .
And that — and so a decision was made that because we felt that the authorities were there , that we should continue moving forward with this program .
Q
And who determined that these targets were al Qaeda ?
Did you wiretap them ?
GENERAL HAYDEN : The judgment is made by the operational work force at the National Security Agency using the information available to them at the time , and the standard that they apply — and it ’s a two - person standard that must be signed off by a shift supervisor , and carefully recorded as to what created the operational imperative to cover any target , but particularly with regard to those inside the United States .
Q
So a shift supervisor is now making decisions that a FISA judge would normally make ?
I just want to make sure I understand .
Is that what you ’re saying ?
Senators from both parties are demanding hearings :
Democratic and Republican calls mounted on Tuesday for U.S. congressional hearings into President George W. Bush ’s assertion that he can order warrantless spying on Americans with suspected terrorist ties .
Vice President Dick Cheney predicted a backlash against critics of the administration ’s anti-terrorism policies .
He also dismissed charges that Bush overstepped his constitutional bounds when he implemented the recently disclosed eavesdropping shortly after the September 11 attacks .
Republican Sens. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Olympia Snowe of Maine joined Democratic Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan , Dianne Feinstein of California and Ron Wyden of Oregon in calling for a joint investigation by the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees into whether the government eavesdropped “ without appropriate legal authority . ”
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat , said he would prefer separate hearings by the Judiciary Committee , which has already promised one , and Intelligence Committee .
This New York Times paragraph is further evidence that we ’re talking about an Echelon - like surveillance program here :
Administration officials , speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the information , suggested that the speed with which the operation identified “ hot numbers ” – the telephone numbers of suspects – and then hooked into their conversations lay behind the need to operate outside the old law .
And some more snippets .
There are about a zillion more URLs I could list here .
I posted these already , but both Oren Kerr and
Daniel Solove have good discussions of the legal issues .
And here are three legal posts by Marty Lederman .
A summary of the Republican arguments .
Four good blog posts .
Spooks comment on the issue .
And this George W. Bush quote ( video and transcript ) , from December 18 , 2000 , is just too surreal not to reprint : “ If this were a dictatorship , it ’d be a heck of a lot easier , just so long as I ’m the dictator . ”
I guess 9/11 made it a heck of a lot easier .
Look , I do n’t think 100 % of the blame belongs to President Bush .
( This kind of thing was also debated under Clinton . )
The Congress , Democrats included , have allowed the Executive to gather power at the expense of the other two branches .
This is the fundamental security issue here , and it ’ll be an issue regardless of who wins the White House in 2008 .
EDITED TO ADD ( 12/21 ) : FISC Judge James Robertson resigned yesterday :
Two associates familiar with his decision said yesterday that Robertson privately expressed deep concern that the warrantless surveillance program authorized by the president in 2001 was legally questionable and may have tainted the FISA court ’s work .
…. Robertson indicated privately to colleagues in recent conversations that he was concerned that information gained from warrantless NSA surveillance could have then been used to obtain FISA warrants .
FISA court Presiding Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly , who had been briefed on the spying program by the administration , raised the same concern in 2004 and insisted that the Justice Department certify in writing that it was not occurring .
“ They just do n’t know if the product of wiretaps were used for FISA warrants — to kind of cleanse the information , ” said one source , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the FISA warrants .
“ What I ’ve heard some of the judges say is they feel they ’ve participated in a Potemkin court . ”
More generally , here ’s some of the relevant statutes and decisions :
“ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) ” ( 1978 ) .
“ Authorization for Use of Military Force ( 2001 ) , ” the law authorizing Bush to use military force against the 9/11 terrorists .
“ United States v. United States District Court , ” 407 U.S. 297 ( 1972 ) , a national security surveillance case that turned on the Fourth Amendment .
“ Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , ” 124 S. Ct. 981 ( 2004 ) , the recent Supreme Court case examining the president ’s powers during wartime .
[ The Government ’s position ] cannot be mandated by any reasonable view of the separation of powers , as this view only serves to condense power into a single branch of government .
We have long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation ’s citizens .
Youngstown Steel and Tube , 343 U.S. at 587 .
Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for the Executive in times of conflict with other Nations or enemy organizations , it most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches when individual liberties are at stake .
And here are a bunch of blog posts :
Daniel Solove : “ Hypothetical : What If President Bush Were Correct About His Surveillance Powers ?. ”
Seth Weinberger : “ Declaring War and Executive Power . ”
Juliette Kayyem : “ Wiretaps , AUMF and Bush ’s Comments Today . ”
Mark Schmitt : “ Alito and the Wiretaps . ”
Eric Muller : “ Lawless Like I Said . ”
Cass Sunstein : “ Presidential Wiretap . ”
Spencer Overton : “ Judge Damon J. Keith : No Warrantless Wiretaps of Citizens . ”
Will Baude : “ Presidential Authority , A Lament . ”
And news articles :
Washington Post : “ Clash Is Latest Chapter in Bush Effort to Widen Executive Power . ”
The clash over the secret domestic spying program is one slice of a broader struggle over the power of the presidency that has animated the Bush administration .
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney came to office convinced that the authority of the presidency had eroded and have spent the past five years trying to reclaim it .
From shielding energy policy deliberations to setting up military tribunals without court involvement , Bush , with Cheney ’s encouragement , has taken what scholars call a more expansive view of his role than any commander in chief in decades .
With few exceptions , Congress and the courts have largely stayed out of the way , deferential to the argument that a president needs free rein , especially in wartime .
New York Times : Spying Program Snared U.S. Calls . ”
A surveillance program approved by President Bush to conduct eavesdropping without warrants has captured what are purely domestic communications in some cases , despite a requirement by the White House that one end of the intercepted conversations take place on foreign soil , officials say .

Germany : P2P lawsuits cost taxpayers millions
The German music industry has filed thousads of lawsuits against P2P users .
Separately , some game softare makers sued tens of thousands of suspected file sharing users in Germany .
This huge wave of lawsuits is starting to take its toll on the German legal system , heise .
de reports The State Attorney General of Northrhine Westfalia Roswitha Müller - Piepenkötter now said that taxpayers have to pay millions to ISPs alone in order to get the information necessary for these lawsuits .
In Germany an ISP can bill law enforcement officials for the work that is necessary to find the corresponding personal data connected to an IP address at a given time .
Usually these fees are in the range of 35 to 40 Euro ( about 45 to 50 USD ) .
But since rights holders sometimes sue tens of thousands of users at the same time , the total costs are in the hundreds of thousands per single enforcement action .
German righs holders use criminal lawsuits against unnamed defendants to get ISPs to reveal the identity of file sharers .
Once the music industry has the names of the alleged sinners they start another civil lawsuit - only to settle it soon after against the payment of a few thousand Euros .

Study shows that proposed carbon nanotube cables wo n't hold up .
Fatally flawed ?
Nanotube fibres are expected to get weaker the longer they are .
Credit : Pat Rawling / NASA
Is it possible to make a cable for a space elevator out of carbon nanotubes ?
Not anytime soon , if ever , says Nicola Pugno of the Polytechnic of Turin , Italy .
Pugno's calculations show that inevitable defects in the nanotubes mean that such a cable simply would n't be strong enough .
The idea of a space elevator was popularized in science fiction , where writers envisioned a 100,000 - kilometre - long cable stretching straight up from the Earth 's surface and fixed in a geosynchronous orbit .
Payloads , or tourists , would simply ascend the cable into low - Earth orbit , eliminating the need for rocket launches .
When carbon nanotubes were discovered to have an incredibly high strength - to - weight ratio , researchers hoped they would take the idea out of fiction and bring it into reality .
But Pugno argues that atomic - scale defects in the nanotubes would reduce the strength of such a giant cable by at least 70 % .
Space ribbon
Researchers think that the best shape for a space - elevator cable would be a ribbon , about a metre wide and as thin as paper .
It would need to withstand at least 62 gigapascals ( GPa ) of tension .
That 's about as much as in the rope of a tug - of - war with more than 100,000 people on each side .
Laboratory tests have shown that individual nanotubes can withstand an average of about 100 GPa , an unusual strength that comes courtesy of their crystalline structure .
But if a nanotube is missing just one carbon atom , this can reduce its strength by as much as 30 % .
And a bulk material made from such tubes is even weaker .
Most fibres made from nanotubes have so far had a strength much lower than 1 GPa .
Recent measurements of high - quality nanotubes have found them to be missing one carbon atom out of every 1012 bonds ; that 's about one defect over 4 micrometres of nanotube length1 .
Defects of two or more missing atoms are much more rare , but Pugno points out that on the scale of the space elevator they become statistically probable .
Using a mathematical model that he has devised himself , and which has been tested by predicting the strength of materials such as nano - crystalline diamond , Pugno calculates that large defects will unavoidably bring a cable 's strength below about 30 GPa .
His paper has been posted to arXiv2 , and will appear in the July edition of the Journal of Physics : Condensed Matter .
Pugno adds that even if flawless nanotubes could be made for the space elevator , damage from micrometeorites and even erosion by oxygen atoms would render them weak .
So can a space elevator be made ?
" With the technology available today ?
Never , " he says .
Never say never
This comes in sharp contrast to claims made by Bradley Edwards , whose space elevator feasibility study for NASA4 and a subsequent book have made him the most frequent spokesman for the project .
Edwards , who is president and founder of the Dallas - based company Carbon Designs , shrugs off the controversy , and says that with adequate funding he could make cables at or above the 62 - GPa benchmark in just three years .
He suggests that the key step is carefully spinning long nanotubes together in a close - packed way , which encourages cooperative frictional forces that make the strengths of individual nanotubes less crucial .
Pugno counters that the larger defects critically weaken the cable , no matter what its construction .
And lab efforts thus far do n't seem to inspire much optimism .
Ray Baughman , director of the NanoTech Institute in Dallas , published a paper in Science last year3 demonstrating metre- long cables spun in a similar way to Edwards ' preferred design .
But these too had a strength well below 1 GPa .
ADVERTISEMENT
Baughman says Pugno's results are n't surprising .
It has been known for decades that crystalline materials are sensitive to defects , and that they show a clear drop in strength with increasing size .
But he adds that a solution may one day be found .
The space elevator , he says , " wo n't happen in my lifetime , but I do n't like to say never . "

プログラミングを独習するに は10年かかる 著者： Peter Norvig 日本語訳： yomoyomo、竹中明 夫
以下の文章は 、Peter Norvig による Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years の日本語訳である 。
本翻訳文書については、以下の方々にご教示を頂きました。ありがとうございました。
どうしてみんなそんなに急ぐの？
どの本屋に足を運んでも、『7日で学ぶ Java』といったハウツー本を見かけるし、そのそばには
Visual Basic や Windows やインターネットなどについて、同じように数日や数時間で学べると売りこむ本が無限のバリエーションで並んでいる。Amazon.com
で以下の条件で検索してみたところ、
248件ものヒットがあった。そのうち上から78冊はコンピュータ関連の書籍だった（79番めは『30日で学ぶベンガル語』）。「日」を「時間」に置き換えてみたところ、とてもよく似た結果が得られた。253冊がヒットし、上から77冊がコンピュータ関連の書籍で、78番目は『24時間で学ぶ文法と文体』だった。上位200冊のうち、96%がコンピュータ関連書籍だった。
結論としては、誰もがコンピュータについて学ぶのに大わらわであるか、さもなくばコンピュータというものが、他のどんなものより、学ぶのがどういうわけか信じられないくらい易しいということになる。だって数日や数時間で学ぶベートーベンやら、量子物理やら、犬の調教といった本は皆無だもの。
『 3日で学 ぶ Pascal』といった題名が意味するところを分析してみると：
学ぶ： 3日間では、いくつか意味のあるプログラムを書いたり、その過程での成功や失敗から学ぶ時間などありはしない。経験を積んだプログラマーと一緒に作業を行い、そうした環境における生活がどういうものかを理解する間もない。早い話、大したことを学ぶ時間がないということだ。よってそうした書籍は、うわべだけ精通することについて説くばかりで、深い理解にはつながらない。アレキサンダー帝が言ったように、生兵法は怪我の元なのだ。

Pascal： 3日間で Pascal の文法を学ぶことは可能かもしれないが（類似する言語を既に知っていれば）、その文法の使い方までは十分に学べない。つまり、例えばあなたが
Basic プログラマーならば 、Basic スタイルで Pascal の文法を利用するプログラムの書き方は学べるかもしれないが
、Pascal が実際のところ、何に向いているか（向いてないか）を学ぶことはできない。さて、ここでのポイントは何だろう？
Alan Perlis [ 訳 注 1 ] はかつて 、 「
プログラミングに対する考え方に影響を与えないような言語は知る価値はない」と言った。ここで考えられるポイントは、あなたが
Pascal（それよりどちらかといえば Visual Basic や JavaScript などの方が現実には多いだろう）をほんのちょっと学ばなければならないとしたら、それは特定の業務を行うために、既存のツールを使う必要があるからだろう。しかし、それではプログラミングを学ぶことにはならない。その業務のやり方を学んでいるだけなのだ。

3日間：残念ながら、これでは十分ではない。次項で解説する。
プログラミングを独習するには10年かかる
研究者 ( Hayes , Bloom ) によると、チェス、作曲、絵画、ピアノ演奏、水泳、テニス、そして神経心理学や位相幾何学の研究を含む、広範な分野のいずれについても、専門技術を身につけるにはおよそ10年かかるそうだ。近道など実在しないようなのだ。4歳にして音楽の神童だったモーツァルトでさえ、超一流の楽曲を作り出すまでに13年以上を要している。別のジャンルになるが、ビートルズが突如現れナンバーワンヒットを連発し、エド・サリバン・ショーに出演したのは1964年だった。しかし、彼らは1957年からリバプールやハンブルグの小さなクラブで演奏していたわけで、また彼らは初期から大衆の支持を獲得したが、彼らがはじめて批評的にも大きな成功を得た『サージェント・ペパーズ』がリリースされたのは1967年である。サミュエル・ジョンソン[訳注2 ]は、「どんな分野であれ、生涯にわたる努力なくして優れたものには達し得ない。それよりも安い代償で手に入れることはできないのだ」と、それには十年以上かかると考えた。またチョーサーも「人生はとても短く、技を習得するにはとても時間がかかる」と嘆いている。
ここでプログラミングで成功するための、私なりのレシピを紹介すると：
以上すべてを考慮すると、本で学ぶだけではどこまで習得できるか疑わしいものである。最初の子どもが生まれる前は、私はハウツー本を全部読んでみても、自分が何も分かってない新参者に思えたものだ。30ヶ月後、二番目の子どもが生まれることになったとき、私は本で復習しただろうか？
そんなことはしなかった。それどころか、私は自分の個人的な経験を信じていたし、専門家によって書かれた何千ページの本よりもずっと有能だと自信を持つまでになっていた。
Fred Brooks は、エッセイ No Silver Bullets [ 訳注 7 ]
において、優れたソフトウェア・デザイナーを育てる三段階を明らかにしている。
できるだけ早期にトップデザイナーを体系的に認定する。
有望な人材の育成を責任を持って行うキャリアアドバイザーを任命し、綿密なキャリアファイルを保持する。
育成中のデザイナーが互いに交流・刺激し合う機会を与える。
以上は、既に優れたデザイナーになるのに必要な資質を持っている人が存在するということを前提にしている。そこでやるべきことは、彼らをしっかり誘導してあげることだ。Alan Perlis はそれをより簡潔に表現している。「誰でも教えてやれば、彫刻をできるようにはなる。ミケランジェロは、放っといても彫刻をしていただろう。優れたプログラマーも同様だ」
さあどうぞ、その Java の本をお買いなさいな。それが何かの役に立つかもしれない。でも、24時間や数日や数ヶ月であれ、それであなたの人生は変わらないし、プログラマーとしての実際の技能全般もまたしかり。

付録：言語の選 択
何人もの人が、どのプログラミング言語を最初に学ぶべきか聞いてきた。単一の答えは存在しないが、以下のポイントを考えてみよう。
友人を利用する。 「 どのオペレーティングシステムを使うべきだろうか。Windows、Unix、それとも Mac？」と聞かれたら、私は普通「何であれ君の友達が使っているものを使えば」と答える。友達から学ぶことで得る強みは、OS
やプログラミング言語間に内在するどんな相違も相殺するだろう。また未来の友達も考慮すること。学習を続ける場合、あなたがその一部となるプログラマのコミュニティのことである。選択する言語のコミュニティは大きく成長しているだろうか、それとも小さく死にかけているだろうか？
答えを得る書籍、ウェブサイト、オンラインフォーラムは存在するだろうか？
そうしたフォーラムにいる人たちのことは好きだろうか？
シンプルに保つ 。C++ や Java といったプログラム言語は、コードの実行時の効率を気にする経験を積んだプログラマの大集団が専門的な開発を行うよう設計されている。その結果、これらの言語には、そうした環境向けの複雑な部分がある。あなたはプログラムを学ぶことに関心があるのであって、そうした複雑さは必要ない。一人の新米プログラマが学び覚えるのがやさしいように設計された言語が欲しいわけだ。
動かす。あなたはどちらの方法でピアノ演奏を学ぶだろうか。鍵盤を叩けばすぐにその音が聞こえる当たり前の対話的なやり方か、それとも曲をまるごと弾き終えた後でないとその音が聞こえない「バッチ」モードだろうか？
明らかに対話モードのほうがピアノを楽に学べるし、プログラミングも同じである。対話モードを持つ言語にこだわり、それを使うこと。
以上の基準により、はじめてのプログラミング言語として私がお勧めするのは、Python か
Scheme である。しかし、環境が変われば他の良い選択肢もある。もしあなたの年齢が一桁なら、Alice や Squeak を好むかもしれない（年長の学習者でも楽しめるけど）。重要なのは、選択して始めることだ。
付録：書籍やその他の情報源
何人もの人が、どの書籍やウェブページから学ぶべきか聞いてきた。私は「書籍による学習だけでは不十分」と繰り返しているが、以下のものなら勧められる。

Onshore construction is ' ahead of predictions ' , says the BWEA
In a new report , it says turbines are being installed faster than predicted .
If this is correct , onshore wind farms will take the government halfway to its target of generating 10 % of electricity from renewable sources by 2010 .
The report comes a day before the government unveils a major review of its climate change policies .
Entitled Onshore Wind : Powering
Ahead , the report claims to be the most comprehensive assessment of the UK 's onshore wind sector ever undertaken .
It forms part of the BWEA 's response to another ongoing government review on energy which is due to conclude in the middle of the year .
Half full
Our research proves that onshore wind will bring major benefits to the economy and the environment
Chris Tomlinson
Taking into account potential barriers such as planning consent and grid capability , it identifies a further 3,000 MW capacity which it says is " forecast to be consented and built " by the decade 's end .
" Onshore wind can play a hugely significant role in meeting renewable energy and climate change targets , " said the BWEA 's head of onshore , Chris Tomlinson .
" Our research proves , very clearly , that onshore wind will deliver , bringing major benefits to the economy and the environment while securing our energy supplies . "
Farming the UK wind

A 2004 reform of the planning process aimed at easing approvals has proven only a partial success , with a number of recent applications refused or scaled down .
But despite opposition from a few high - profile figures such as TV naturalist David Bellamy , polls suggest the public approves , with a Guardian / ICM survey in 2005 showing about 70 % of the population endorsing wind farm construction within 20 miles ( 32 km ) of their home .
If the onshore wind industry is as healthy as the new report suggests , the challenge for the government is to stimulate the remaining 5 % of renewable capacity needed to reach its 2010 target .
BWEA figures show that only four offshore wind farms are currently in operation .
Though output can be higher per turbine and wind more consistent , construction costs are also higher and grid connection is a bigger issue .
Photovoltaic solar panels produce less than 1 % of the nation 's electricity , and wave and tidal technologies remain in the development stage .
In a bid to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , New York state officials have announced that cars sold or registered in the state must cut the amount of CO 2 they produce , as of 2009 .
The move could cut the state 's emissions of the gas by 14.9 million CO 2 equivalent tons per year by 2020 , and by 26.3 million CO 2 equivalent tons per year by 2030 .
The new regulations are at odds with the Bush Administration 's approach , which has largely been to hope that new technology will come along and solve the problem , rather than to move to curb emissions .
But , as Kit Kennedy , an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council told Reuters : " New York is n't waiting for President Bush or the federal government to take action . "
The state 's Republican governor George Pataki , who is reportedly considering a presidential bid , is also trying to regulate greenhouse emissions from power plants in the North East of the US , along with eight other states .
New York is not alone in defying the Bush party line .
California imposed regulations of car emissions a year ago , and last week , Vermont said it would also move to put upper limits on how much CO 2 a car could produce .
Massachusetts , Maine Connecticut and Rhode Island are also making similar plans , Reuters reports .
Unsurprisingly , the car industry is not delighted .
A spokeswoman for the industry lobby group , Alliance of Automobile Manufactures , said that a national consensus was needed .
" National fuel economy standards cannot be written by any single state or group of states , " she added .
However , state officials note that the rules make no mention of fuel economy , and are in fact governing emissions .
New York says the new regulations will be finalised in 30 days . ®
Can a person survive on free Web - based services alone ?
By Allison Linn , Associated Press SEATTLE 
For Microsoft , 2005 was the year the big bad webcame calling .
Again .
The Microsoft Office software suite is shown at center next to screens from CalendarHub , left , and OpenOffice .
By Ted S. Warren , AP A decade after Microsoft counterattacked to beat Netscape in the Web browser wars , the company finds itself surrounded yet again by competitors looking to leverage the Internet to gain an edge over the industry titan .
Web - based software and services are emerging for everything from checking e-mail to collaborating on business tasks .
Microsoft 's concern is twofold :
The paid services are convenient and easy to update , potentially offering an edge over Microsoft 's Office and other desktop - bound applications .
And the free services are , well , free ; advertising often supports them .
For now at least , Redmond - based Microsoft says it does n't see these alternatives as a major threat , regarding them mainly as complementary to Office .
And yet , Microsoft recently launched its own companywide push towards offering more Web - based software and services .
The question is , how scared should Microsoft be ?
To get a sense , this reporter decided to spend one week relying as much as possible on free software and services — available via the Internet — for everyday business tasks .
Although I sought to use the free Office alternatives whenever I could , I allowed myself to make exceptions when it would seriously interfere with my job .
I continued to use The Associated Press ' writing and editing program , which is not made by Microsoft .
I also often had to use Microsoft Outlook since — like most workers — I depend on e-mail for my job and Outlook is tightly tied to the Microsoft Exchange e-mail server that AP employs .
I began by looking for a viable word processing alternative to Microsoft Word .
OpenOffice 's " Writer " is a close replica , right down to the annoying tendency both have to try to " help " you when no help is needed .
Writer repeatedly tried to finish the words I was typing .
It also flashed a light bulb in the corner of the screen — apparently its version of Word 's much - derided Mr. Clippy .
Still , the entire free OpenOffice suite , which includes database , spreadsheet and other applications , was easy to download with a broadband connection .
And once I had Writer on my machine , I found I did n't miss Microsoft Word at all .
Many of the commands were the same , and I was able to easily open Word documents using Writer .
The program also makes it extremely easy to save documents in the PDF format , something Microsoft only plans to offer with the forthcoming version of Office , due out in 2006 .
Web - based word processing programs promise the further convenience of being able to access documents on any computer , and easily collaborate over the Internet with others .
One such product , Writely , was very easy to set up , and it was simple to create and store documents .
It was a breeze with Writely to import Word documents already on my hard drive , and relatively simple to save Writely documents in either the Word or OpenOffice format .
My only beef was that I could n't save documents as PDFs , but a spokeswoman said there are plans to fix that .
Competitor gOffice offered more sophisticated formatting options , and it was easy to print documents as PDFs .
I had difficulty setting up a gOffice account , although the company was helpful when I called .
Still , after the initial problems were resolved I found the process of saving and accessing files needlessly cumbersome .
As a reporter , I spend much of my day looking up sources ' phone numbers and e-mail addresses , so it was essential that I find a good place to import , store and access my contact list .
OpenOffice 's database program , Base , was able to import my contact list from Microsoft Outlook quickly and elegantly but did not give me the option of saving the data into the file format needed to transfer it to most other applications .
Another OpenOffice program , Calc , let me to save the data in the right format but took more time to tweak the data so it would import correctly .
Overall , I found it easier to use Microsoft Excel .
I tested several different programs for storing my contacts and liked Gmail — Google Inc. 's e-mail program — best .
It offered simple instructions and imported my data with no problems .
Plus , it was then easy to search the contacts .
There are tons of Web - based calendar programs that let you either upload your desktop - bound digital calendar or synchronize it with your existing program .
One that I tested , AirSet , did not provide clear guidance on how exactly it would sync information found on my hard drive , and in the end I balked out of security concerns .
Yahoo's calendar application required that I uninstall other syncing software — something I did n't want to do — so I did n't end up using that , either .
I also found Yahoo's system for adding new calendar items to be onerous ; each entry requires the user to fill out a long form .
My overall favorite turned out to be CalendarHub , which easily imported four years worth of calendar data into a pleasing interface and — like several out there — offered handy e-mail reminders of upcoming events .
CalendarHub also offers a desktop program that will list upcoming meetings , but I had trouble getting it to work .
When contacted , the company quickly fixed the bug .
Many Web - based calendars promote options for sharing calendar data with others .
If I were setting up a carpool , e.g. , this would be a nice feature .
Although my company 's server software settings made it difficult to use other e-mail clients , I did work some with Mozilla 's Thunderbird and found it to be a functional alternative to Outlook .
The interface was familiar , and it was easy to set up and to import old e-mails .
I also used several free , Web - based e-mail accounts for some business communication .
Gmail was my favorite for organizing data based on " conversations . "
In the end , it came down to the familiar question of what was worth more , my time or my money .
While it was technically possible to perform most of my daily work without using Microsoft Office — or my credit card — it took considerably more time .
Setting up the new systems was time - consuming , as I had expected .
But my tolerance was tested by all the glitches , which can be common in new and free products .
Also , although it is nice in theory to be able to access data online , in practice it often took longer to log on to different applications every time I needed something , rather than just opening a file on my desktop .
Perhaps my biggest concern was about my privacy , once I began entrusting my calendar , contacts and other information to Web - based systems instead of my own hard drive and my company 's secure network .
I scoured each product 's privacy statement and did n't use some that I felt were too vague on protections .
But I still could n't shake the nagging feeling that my data was now in too many companies ' hands .
And I wondered if I should really be storing such valuable work data on systems that could crash or go out of business at any time .
I found some benefits to having my work available on Web - based systems , and there are some I will probably use again .
But , for now at least , Microsoft is right — these challengers will complement , not replace , my Microsoft Office software .

In 2012 , an 85 - year - old scientist and his son - in - law pulled a cylinder of muck from a faraway island .
They carried it home like a newborn baby , froze it , and mailed it to a researcher across the country .
The scientist used it to determine that there is less sea ice in the Bering Sea now than any time in the last 5,500 years .

Sexual Success And The Schizoid Factor
By Rusty Rockets
Ever wondered why uncouth , scruffy rock musicians are pursued by legions of doting , lovelorn female fans ?
Or why women threw themselves at Pablo Picasso ?
Well , a new study suggests that creativity may confer an evolutionary advantage in finding a mate ; indicating that creative types have increased sexual appeal .
But paradoxically , people who have certain traits predictive of schizophrenia - a condition not normally associated with evolutionary fitness - also have a higher propensity toward artistic ability .
This creative ability , say some evolutionary experts , is far from being a disadvantage , as creativity is highly attractive when it comes to mate choice .
Like Richard Dawkins , Daniel Dennett and Stephen Pinker , evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller considers sexual selection to be right up there in importance with natural selection .
Advocates of sexual selection argue that competition between members of the same sex drives the evolution of particular traits that mates of the opposite sex find attractive .
Miller , author of The Mating Mind : How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature , claims that traits like morality , art , language and creativity , influence the way in which the human mind evolves .
It may sound like a stretch , but recent studies show that reliable predictions of mate choice can be made using these kinds of traits as a guide .
Before looking more closely at these studies , however , it 's worth first considering whether creativity is actually quantifiable .
Neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran 's musings on savants , who display exceptional skills in a very specific field , is illuminating in this respect , as he " unashamedly speculates " that a savant 's talents may stem from an enlarged section of the brain called the angular gyrus .
" You can imagine an explosion of talent resulting from this simple but ' anomalous ' increase in brain volume , " says Ramachandran , adding : " The same argument might hold for drawing , music , language , indeed any human trait . "
Ramachandran explains that this theory is at least in part testable , and points to examples where damage to the right parietal cortex " can profoundly disrupt artistic skills , just as damage to the left disrupts calculation . "
Ramachandran also considers possible the idea that these esoteric human traits can be attractive to mates in the way that a male peacock 's plume is attractive , as exceptional ability in music , poetry or drawing may be an " externally visible signature of a giant brain . "
Citing Dawkins , Ramachandran argues " that this ' truth in advertising ' may play an important role in mate selection . "
Despite what seems to be logically valid reasoning , Ramachandran stresses that the talents and specializations associated with the savant are not enough .
They will not become a Picasso or Einstein , because they are missing one vital , ineffable ingredient : creativity .
" There are those who assert that creativity is simply the ability to randomly link seemingly unrelated ideas , but surely that is not enough , " writes Ramachandran .
We may have a fantastic grasp of language , and think that we can knock out a half decent metaphor on call , but it is actually harder than most people think .
Yet when we come across something truly creative , it speaks volumes to us , " In fact , " says Ramachandran , " it 's crystal clear once it is explained and has that ' why did n't I think of that ? ' quality that characterizes the most beautiful and creative insights . "
But if creative juices are responsible for an evolutionary advantage , there must surely be some aspect of this seemingly ineffable trait that can be identified as heritable .
This brings us back to Geoffrey Miller , who argues that traits such as creativity are a result of personality disorders such as schizophrenia .
Yes , that 's right ;
Miller is arguing that what is usually considered to be an evolutionary disadvantage is actually just the opposite .
After conducting their own study , researchers Daniel Nettle and Helen Clegg believe that they have confirmed Miller 's assertions , and in doing so have solved a long standing mystery .
" There is an evolutionary puzzle surrounding the persistence of schizophrenia , since it is substantially heritable and associated with sharply reduced fitness , " the authors begin in their paper entitled " Schizotypy , creativity and mating success in humans " , published in The Proceedings of the Royal Society .
The authors cite previous studies that claim schizophrenia is associated with poor health and reduced chances of reproduction , but add : " The fact that this does not appear to happen has lead many commentators to speculate that there must be other , beneficial effects of the traits . "
Nettle and Clegg state that schizophrenia - proneness manifests in a number of different personality traits collectively known as schizotypy , with schizotypy coming in 4 distinct dimensions .
Schizophrenia patients score more highly on all 4 dimensions , say the authors , with schizotypy scores being predictive of schizophrenia in longitudinal studies .
The authors also point to studies of people within the creative arts who display increased levels of certain schizotypy traits , as well as a bulging case file of people with psychiatric illness in artistically successful families .
Nettle and Clegg believe that there is enough evidence to support the idea that " artistic creativity is a candidate for the evolutionarily beneficial effect of schizotypy . "
Studying a cross section of the community which was augmented by a targeted sampling of artists and poets , Nettle and Clegg set about examining the subjects ' mating conquests , measured by such things as the length , type and number of encounters each subject had .
The study included a mix of the 4 schizotypy dimensions :
Unusual experiences
Contains items referring to perceptual and cognitive aberrations and magical thinking .

Cognitive disorganization

Describes difficulties of attention and concentration .
Impulsive non-conformity
Refers to violent and reckless behaviors .
Refers to violent and reckless behaviors .
Introvertive anhedonia
Measures lack of enjoyment and social withdrawal .
It was found that not all schizotypy dimensions are advantageous in regard to creative attractiveness .
Cognitive disorganization , for example , was not included in the path analysis , because they found it had no significant bearing on creativity or mating success , and introvertive anhedonia was found to have an inhibiting effect on both creativity and the number of mates .
Of the two remaining dimensions , unusual experiences was found to have a positive impact on creative activity , which in turn led to a positive effect on the number of partners , while impulsive non-conformity had a significant positive effect on the number of partners .
Nettle and Clegg believe that these results are enough to support Miller 's hypothesis that artistic creativity functions as a mating display .
" The results are consistent with the view that schizotypal traits are maintained in the human population at significant levels because the negative effects in terms of psychosis and other psychopathology are offset by enhanced mating success . "
These findings raise interesting questions .
Where do we acquire our receptiveness to creativity and our appreciation for creative works ?
Is it innate , or are the people exhibiting creative schizotypy traits doing the hard work for us , by presenting reality to us in novel , imaginative and inventive ways ?
Whether or not we have a natural capacity for creative appreciation , our like or dislike of specific creative works may be primed by prior creative achievements .
One recent study illustrates this point .
It examined what is known as " white space " in the advertising industry , and showed that what might appear to be an innate pull toward specific aesthetics in humans has actually been acquired from prior periods in art .
In this particular case , the researchers found that our appreciation for white space - and the refined , chic qualities it conveys - harked back to the 1950s minimalist period .
They also found that subjects unaware of the origins of white space still appreciated its intended qualities nonetheless .
Given these findings , can we conclude that while humans have a capacity for creativity or creative appreciation , that this creativity is influenced by social norms predicated on past creative periods ?
A creative feedback loop , if you like , that constantly advertises one aspect of evolutionary fitness : creativity .
Nearly a third of people worldwide support the use of torture against terror suspects in some circumstances , a BBC survey suggests .
Over 27,000 people in 25 countries , including Israel , were asked if torture was acceptable if it could provide information to save innocent lives .
Fifty - nine percent were opposed to torture , 29 percent replied it an acceptable means to combat terrorism .
Respondents were asked which position was closer to their own views :
a) Clear rules against torture should be maintained because any use of torture is immoral and will weaken international human rights standards against torture .
b ) Terrorists pose such an extreme threat that governments should now be allowed to use some degree of torture if it may gain information that saves innocent lives .
In Israel a majority of Jewish respondents in Israel , 53 percent , agreed that the governments should be allowed to use some degree of torture to obtain information from terror suspects , while 39 percent were completely opposed and wanted clear rules against it .
However the Muslim population in Israel polled overwhelmingly against any use of torture .
58 percent against torture in US
And what do countries who have suffered terror attacks think ?
In the United States 58 percent oppose torture , 36 percent are in favor and 6 percent have n't made up their minds yet .
In Britain , where a large scale terror plot was recently thwarted , 72 percent are against retrieving information from terror suspects through torture while 24 percent are in favor .
Similar figures were apparent in Spain , where 65 percent oppose terror and only 16 percent condone it .
The poll was also conducted in Muslim countries .
In Iraq , which suffers daily terror attacks , 42 percent are in favor of torturing terror suspects , 55 percent are against it .
In Egypt the figure drops to 25 percent in favor and 62 percent against .
The rest are undecided .
In three other countries , besides Israel , less than half the population polled against torturing terror suspects .
In China – 49 percent were against and 37 percent were in favor .
In Russia , 43 percent polled against and 37 percent were in favor .
In India , which has also suffered from terror attacks the data is intriguing – 23 percent are against torture and 23 percent are in favor of the tactic .
The remaining 45 percent have yet to make up their minds .
It 's a time - honored Halloween ritual : children getting dressed up as scary creatures and trick - or - treating .
It 's all harmless fun , except for the part where parents feel they must protect their children from sinister strangers .
Each year , police and medical centers across the country follow another ritual , X - raying candy to check for razors , needles , or other objects that might have been placed there to hurt or kill innocent children .
Special events are held that offer kids " a safe Halloween , " suggesting that there are real lurking dangers far worse than spooky costumes .
Yet year after year , few if any sinister foreign objects are found .
This scary tale is essentially an urban legend .
Despite e-mail warnings , scary stories , and Ann Landers columns to the contrary , there have been only two confirmed cases of children being killed by poisoned Halloween candy , and in both cases the children were killed not in a random act by strangers but intentional murder by one of their parents .
The best - known , " original " case was that of Texan Ronald Clark O'Bryan , who killed his son by lacing his Pixie Stix with cyanide in 1974 .
There have been a few instances of candy tampering over the years — and in most cases the " victim " turned out to be the culprit , children doing it as a prank or to draw attention .
With the exceptions noted above , no child has been killed or seriously harmed by contaminated Halloween candy .
There are several problems with X - raying Halloween items to find harmful objects .
For one thing , it would be obvious to even the most sugar - addled child or teen if a razor blade or pins were stuck in an apple or candy bar .
Secondly , X - raying provides a false sense of security , since the process would reveal metal , and possibly glass , but would not detect poison .
Third , and most obviously , it 's unnecessary : if in doubt , throw it out !
Like any other food — including last week 's questionable leftovers lingering in the fridge — if you have even the slightest good reason to suspect that a piece of candy has been tampered with , it 's easiest to simply toss it .
There 's no need to waste medical facility or police time making sure that a small free candy bar is safe to eat .
Children are in far more danger from being hit by a car on a dark street .
X -raying candy helps parents feel like they are protecting their children , but in fact parents are simply wasting resources and feeding children 's fears unnecessarily .
This is perhaps the saddest part about this myth : children are given the message that their neighbors might try to poison or hurt them .
In fact , a child is in far more danger from his or her own parents than from strangers .
Surely there are better uses for the X - ray equipment and film than battling a myth .
Clinics would do more good offering free or low - cost X - rays to needy families than scanning candies .
Benjamin Radford , Managing Editor of Skeptical Inquirer magazine , wrote about the Halloween candy scare in his book " Media Mythmakers : How Journalists , Activists , and Advertisers Mislead Us . "
I hope this is the week that everyone in the world finds out what a root kit is .
And I hope it's a week we look back on in amazement , as we consider just how far Sony was willing to go to criminalize consumers in its efforts to preserve control over its product .
Because I believe this is the week that Sony effectively declared war on the consumer , announcing what most of us had already suspected : fair use is a joke in the movie and record industry , and the companies who control mass - market content will truly stop at nothing to protect their profits .
We 're not gonna take it
But let me start at the beginning .
On Monday , October 31 , alert users discovered that Sony BMG is using copy - protected CDs to surreptitiously install its digital rights management technology onto PCs .
You do n't have to be ripping the CD , either -- just playing it from your CD - ROM drive triggers the installation .
The software installs itself as a root kit , which is a set of tools commonly used to make certain files and processes undetectable , and they 're the favored tool of crackers who are , as Wikipedia puts it , attempting to " maintain access to a system for malicious purposes . "
In fact , root kits are often classified alongside Trojan horses .
And Mark Russinovich , who created a root - kit detection utility and was one of the first to blog about the Sony intrusion , discovered another little gem when he tried to remove the DRM drivers .
It broke his computer -- disabling his CD drive
So , I think we all agree that this is pretty bad , right ?
Tell it !
So , let 's make this a bit more explicit .
You buy a CD .
You put the CD into your PC in order to enjoy your music .
Sony grabs this opportunity to sneak into your house like a virus and set up camp , and it leaves the backdoor open so that Sony or any other enterprising intruder can follow and have the run of the place .
If you try to kick Sony out , it trashes the place .
And what does this software do once it's on your PC ?
It enacts unbelievably restrictive DRM , including possible incompatibility with computer CD - ROM players , DVD players , and car CD stereos .
And in a deep - dive into the Sony end - user license agreement , the Electronic Frontier Foundation found some astonishing fine print .
For example , if you lose the original CD or it's stolen , you lose the right to any digital copies you 've made .
You can't keep your music on computers at work .
You must delete your songs if you move out of the country or if you file for bankruptcy .
The list goes on and on .
As for the artists whose names have been sullied by their association with the root kit , it seems that at least some of them did n't give permission to Sony to use the backdoor DRM technology and want no part of it .
Happily , and despite the use of scary words like root kit , this story hit the Web in a big way .
The PR for Sony is , shall we say , not good .
On Wednesday , November 2 , Sony had announced that it would , in conjunction with the company that developed the root - kit plan in the first place ( First4Internet ) release a patch to antivirus companies so that hackers would n't , hopefully , be able to take advantage of the backdoor they just opened on your property .
But the patch only reveals the the antipiracy software , it does n't uninstall it .
And of course , it leaves the insanely draconian copy protection cheerily intact .
If you want to remove the software , you must beg Sony for an uninstall link .
CNET 's Brian Cooley
reports that he received the link via e-mail , but that running the uninstall gave him an error .
Visiting the support site to request help with the error , Cooley was sent to a form whose first field asks which country you 're from .
Neither USA nor North America are options .
That 's not trying very hard to fix the problem .
Actually , Sony 's response to the mess it caused is almost as bad as the mess itself .
The company continued to insist , despite growing evidence to the contrary , that its components were n't harmful in the first place .
And in fact , the president of Sony BMG 's global digital business division , Thomas Hesse , told National Public Radio that most people do n't know what a rootkit is , so they should n't care that it had been secretly installed on their PCs .
Mr. Hesse , they care .
And they should start caring a whole lot more -- on November 10 , BitDefender uncovered the first Trojan horse ( but possibly not the last ) that takes advantage of the unpatched DRM technology to open a backdoor on a Windows PC .
So , if you 're the recipient of the rootkit and you have n't yet received a patch , Sony has officially endangered your PC .
No , we ain't gonna take it
This is an unacceptable development in digital rights enforcement .
I do n't know how to put this any more clearly .
Do n't get me wrong -- we 've long since crossed the line of DRM insanity .
But this -- using the tactics of criminals to invade our PCs without our knowledge and to expose us to further attack , just so you can keep us from , say , burning a mix CD and giving it to our friends -- this is beyond the pale .
And as many news sources are beginning to point out , there 's some reason to think it might also be illegal , under the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .
As of this writing , two class - action suits had been filed against Sony BMG over the root kit -- one in Italy , and one in California .
I 'm quite sure that wo n't be the end of it .
We 're not gonna take it ... anymore
Companies :
You will never get the increasingly technology - aware , mass media - consuming populace to support your right to copy protection or digital rights management unless they are on yourside .
And because we are increasingly technology aware , your ever - increasing assault on not only our fair use but also our common sense will virtually guarantee that we use our God - given ingenuity to find a way around whatever bizarre restrictions you see fit to impose .
Why ?
Not because we 're dying to break the law , but because you have sold us a crappy product , and , fundamentally , because it is not our responsibility to protect your profits .
What 's the solution ?
In the near term , for us , it 's not to buy any Sony CDs , and maybe not any Sony anything .
In the longer term , it 's to start agitating for a rewrite of copyright law in the manner so eloquently suggested recently by Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal .
He suggests copyright law with actual teeth that can chomp on massive - scale piracy , but with broad exemptions for personal use , because excessive DRM is hampering innovation and alienating consumers .
I could n't put it any better .
And companies ?
Sony ?
Are you really going to tell us that overhauling these outmoded rules is harder and more destructive than suing retirees over honest mistakes made by their 12 - year - old grandsons ?
This is the path you 're going to choose ?
I 'm truly sorry that there are , out there in the world , mass - production piracy operations that are digging into your bottom line , but you know what ?
I 'm not one of them .
Neither are most of the people who will be laboring under the nasty little flags , Trojan horses , and FairPlay / Plays For Sure doublespeak that you see fit to slap on the stuff we legitimately purchased .
And you know who 's not going to labor under those restrictions ?
You know who 's not even going to notice ?
The mass - production piracy operations , that 's who .
You know it , and I know it .
So why are you engaged in this nickel - and - dime , small - time thrust - and - parry with me and my friends ?
Trust me , you 're not going to make back the money by dropping viruses onto my PC , because my almighty dollar and I are going elsewhere -- and you 're probably not going to like where I end up .
Technology will march on .
Technology is the reason we 're in this fix in the first place , and technology will keep on giving us solutions to whatever irritating , invasive , and potentially illegal roadblocks you keep throwing in our path .
And damned if we and our almighty dollars , no matter how long it takes , do n't eventually win these little wars .
Next generation DVD formats promise a huge jump in resolution , from the 720 x 480 of standard DVD to the 1920 x 1080 of HD - DVD and Blu-Ray .
Additional resolution is always welcome , of course .
But it 's not free .
You 'll have to purchase a HD - DVD or Blu - Ray player , and a television set capable of displaying the new high definition formats .
Then you 'll need to either rent or buy features on the new optical media formats , as they become available .
But are those additional pixels worth your money ?
Decide for yourself .
Consider this detailed comparison of Fellowship of the Ring in both formats .
Mouse over each image to see before and after ; click the images to see the full - size versions .
Here 's a closeup of one particular section to illustrate the difference in fine detail :
There is more detail , but I 'm left wondering how much of that detail I would notice on a 42 " display ten feet in front of my couch .
Edward Tufte 's arguments in favor of information density are for the printed page , which you read less than a foot from your eyes .
I do n't think the same rules apply to video ten feet or more away .
And how , exactly , do we explain the runaway success of YouTube , where video quality is never less than appalling ?
Clearly , the rules are different for images in motion .
As screens grow in size , you do need more detail .
I doubt a DVD would look very good projected on a movie screen in a typical movie theater .
But I also think people tend to overestimate how much detail is needed for an image of a given size ; witness David Pogue 's street experiment :
On the show , we did a test .
We blew up a photograph to 16 x 24 inches at a professional photo lab .
One print had 13 - megapixel resolution ; one had 8 ; the third had 5 .
Same exact photo , down - rezzed twice , all three printed at the same poster size .
I wanted to hang them all on a wall in Times Square and challenge passersby to see if they could tell the difference .
Even the technician at the photo lab told me that I was crazy , that there 'd be a huge difference between 5 megapixels and 13 .
I 'm prepared to give away the punch line of this segment , because hey -- the show does n't air till February , and you 'll have forgotten all about what you read here today , right ?
Anyway , we ran the test for about 45 minutes .
Dozens of people stopped to take the test ; a little crowd gathered .
About 95 percent of the volunteers gave up , announcing that there was no possible way to tell the difference , even when mashing their faces right up against the prints .
A handful of them attempted guesses -- but were wrong .
Only one person correctly ranked the prints in megapixel order , although ( a ) she was a photography professor , and ( b ) I believe she just got lucky .
I 'm telling you , there was NO DIFFERENCE .
So , by the same logic , are high definition DVD formats a waste of money ?
Perhaps .
But I 've noticed that typical DVD playback pales in comparison to high definition video clips , even when downscaled to the 800x480 of my 42 " EDTV plasma .
It 's a form of supersampling anti-aliasing ; higher resolution sources scale better to larger and smaller screens .
I do n't think you necessarily need a giant screen , or even a particularly high resolution screen , to benefit from the additional source resolution .
Next - gen DVDs offer almost 5 times the resolution of standard DVDs .
Despite the math , the practical difference between DVD resolution and next - gen DVD resolution is highly subjective .
And it 's arguably much less significant than the giant jump we took over the last 10 years to get from standard television resolution to DVD resolution .
Have we already reached the point of diminishing returns ?
Is anyone actually arguing that DVDs do n't look good enough ?
And is the market willing to pay more for higher resolutions ?
To make matters worse , the road to next - gen DVD is currently fraught with risks : technological copy - protection pitfalls , additional costs , and an ongoing format war .
PCFormat UK writes that both formats reek of exploitation , and offers an apples to apples comparison of DVD , HD - DVD and Blu - Ray stills from the movie Training Day .
Judge for yourself .
Although I 'll always be a fan of increased resolution , I 'm not sure these additional pixels have earned my money yet .

Outside this window the shadow of a buzzard swerves across a bright grass lawn .
It 's very distracting , and for a while I just stare , distracted .
After a while , a car goes past .
Silence again .
Something moves in the shadow of the bushes with a jerky , almost regular rhythm , and I watch that , carefully , too , until it resolves itself into a wagtail 's tail .
This is what 's known among writers as thinking , and when a writeable thought does appear in my mind , as startling and unbidden as a bird , I write it down .
The window is the quicklime in which these thoughts are caught .
It hardly matters what it should look out on .
It is a pity that the particular view I am watching is suffused for me with a loneliness and a sense of abandonment more terrible than anything I have felt since I was eight years old and newly sent to boarding school .
But even that is better and more productive than the internet .
I still have silence and a window to stare out of , not a connection to stare into .
I am coming to suspect that the internet will be to my generation of journalists , and to any younger ones , what alcohol was to our predecessors ' : a destroyer first of thought and then of productivity , destructive both of the capacity to reflect , and to react , blurring everything into a haze of talk and endlessly repeated variations on the same experience .
Just like alcohol , and even cigarettes once were , it seems an inevitable part of the job , one of the things that distinguishes it from all others .
Stories are chased and found on the net just as they once were in bars .
This wo n't kill journalism , or thought , of course .
There were always many journalists who functioned drunk , and some who could not function any other way .
Stupidity , sloppiness , bias , inelegance - all these are charges which might be raised against a journalistic opponent , and fairly .
But drunkenness is of no interest unless it contributes to other professional sins .
The trouble is that it very often does .
For every hack who really did or does get more out of the bottle than the bottle gets out of them ( and I can think of a couple of distinguished contemporaries ) , there are perhaps three times as many whose lives , and those of their families , were wrecked by the stuff , and far more who could have been much more interesting and energetic if only they had n't looked for every story through the bottom of a glass .
Looking for stories through a screen has much the same effect .
It 's not all bad ; neither was drink .
The internet , like alcohol , brings spontaneity and conversation to the writer : often the illusion of wit , and sometimes its substance .
But it never ever brings you silence , and it makes it far too easy to escape from the necessary boring solitude of the job .
Obviously , no one ever went into journalism in search of boring solitude .
In fact it is a profession unusually attractive to people with overactive , playful minds and short attention spans .
Alcohol is attractive partly because it damps down the natural exuberance of such minds ; the internet seems to encourage it and liberate from the mundane altogether .
Either way , the effect is often terribly destructive .
To hold my thoughts in solitary confinement is the only way to force them to the hard labour of sentences .
Pure application just wo n't do it .
Though quite a lot of editing and even some sorts of writing are a lot like the mindless drudgery of programming - where you know from the beginning what you must say and are just filling out the blanks in a scheme very well understood from the beginning - very little that 's not written to an immediate purpose is .
There needs to be a shadow swerving unexpectedly across the lawn to show you where to go ; and this is not true just at the beginning of a piece of writing , but at intervals all the way through .
An extraordinarily high proportion of writing time consists of waiting until you can see , or hear what 's wrong with the words in front of you ; this is not a process that can be hurried .
Windows , like books , have edges .
The shadows swerves across , gives life , and then it 's gone .
But the internet has no edges , any more than it has depth .
The sudden movement of someone else 's thought across a screen is something you can follow far beyond the room in which your thoughts could be confined .
There 's no tether to jerk you back and by the time your thoughts return , the room has changed : whatever lay in front of the next sentence has disappeared .
And so I sit now in a room with a window and no telephone , waiting for the next sentence , patient and pious as a dried - out drunk .
A Java coder admits to liking Python : Simon sez .

Terrorism
Here 's a ( recently rare ) foray into politics for ya , just to keep you on your toes ...
In response to a post to IP by Hiawatha Bray , I offered my reasons for disliking both the Bush Administration 's approach to the War on Terror , and the naive " Golden Rule " - ism of some liberals .
( Incidentally , I count myself as a liberal in these matters . )
Charlie Stross ( a fantastic sci - fi writer ) weighed in on the absurd " asymmetric warfare " < / a> statement made about the four Gitmo suicides .
Authoring for O'Reilly
Well , Jason spoke , so I 'll confirm : Grig , Jason and I have contracted to write a series of short PDFs for O'Reilly .
The umbrella topic is ' Testing Stuff ' , and a brief list of individual topics we hope to cover includes : Intro to Web Testing ( covering twill & intro Selenium ) ; Advanced Web Testing ( some twill , lots more Selenium ) ; Unit Testing in Python ; Continuous Integration with buildbot ; Python Testing with FitNesse ; and perhaps more .
Each book will cover a discrete chunk of material , and we hope the series will pull the individual books together into a whole , as well .
The first two , together with a ( free ) introductory book on testing , should be available within 3 months .
( And remember , Gentlemen prefer PDFs ! )
figleaf
When last we met , I professed a rewrite of coverage .py .
Since then , I realized that my tokenize - based method of extracting interesting lines of code ... did n't work .
There were several situations where lines of code simply would n't be counted , because there was n't enough context to determine whether or not it was an actual expression .
Specifically , this kind of code broke the parser :
def f( a = ( lambda x : x + 1 ) ( 1 ) , b = ( lambda y : y * 2 ) ) : pass
After flailing a bit , I realized that you really needed the AST to properly determine what lines of code are worth counting .
This realization was helped by the fact that the sys.settrace ' line ' tracing function is only called on the ' lambda ' and ' def ' lines , above , and not on the ' a= ' and ' b= ' code .
( Kudos to Ned Batchelder for including so many nasty evil tests with coverage .
py -- I just stole his code . ;)
I delved into coverage .py and confirmed my suspicion that some nasty AST visitation was occurring , using code based on the ' compiler ' package .
Moreover , coverage .py used code way beyond me to determine what was actually an executable line of code ... and then did even more clever things to count that code even when the sys.settrace function did n't hit it .
Now , my rule is , if it 's too complicated for me to understand , it should n't be in software I write .
So I set myself a new goal : make a really really simple coverage - measuring utility that ( a ) only counts lines that Python actually " executes " ( as measured by sys.settrace ) ; and ( b ) I can understand .
In the process of working on implementing this with the parser module , I discovered a few amusing details about Python .
First : can you guess which lines of code are " executed " in the following ?
def f( ) : " a " 5 " b " 6 f ( )
Well , in a bit of a surprise to me , it turns out that only the numbers are counted :
>- def f ( ) : " a " >- 5 " b " >- 6 >- f ()
( where '>-' represents executed lines ) .
Yep , only the numbers , not the stringS !
There are two reasons for this , I think : one is that each number is actually a numerical expression , to be evaluated and replaced by its value , while strings are just literals ; and the other is that this does n't count docstrings .
I 'm also a bit surprised by some aspects of the AST that is generated , too .
For example , here 's what my AST pretty - printer outputs for the number " 5 " , all alone in a file :
file_input stmt simple_stmt small_stmt expr_stmt testlist test and_test not_test comparison expr xor_expr and _expr shift_expr arith_expr term factor power atom NUMBER ( ' 5 ' , 1 ) NEWLINE ( '' , 1 ) NEWLINE ( '' , 1 ) ENDMARKER ( '' , 1 )
Is this really a necessary part of the AST ?
I clearly need to read up on this more ; ) .
The last thing I did was build in an optimization : coverage .py uses a global trace function that is continually reassigned to the local trace function by calls into new code blocks .
This means that all
Python code is traced .
Figuring that this would be kind of a speed drain , I separated out the logic into a global trace function that only set the local trace function on a call into interesting code , where " interesting " could be specified by the user .
In other words , rather than tracing coverage on everything , only code executing in user - specified modules would be traced .
The early results are pretty positive .
With the usual caveats about naive benchmarking -- which this certainly is -- I found the following times for running the twill tests in nose :
coverage.py -- 30 seconds total figleaf.py , tracing * all * code -- 23 seconds total figleaf.py , tracing * only * user code -- 15 seconds total no coverage analysis at all -- 7 seconds total .
Naively , it looks like I get a ~ 20 % speedup from switching to my naive AST implementation , and I get another ~ 25 % speedup from only looking at local code .
Neat , huh ?
( Sadly , you still lose a factor of 2 because of the code coverage ! )
Here 's my ( hideously ugly and un- re- factored , yes ) implementation of a class to turn code into " interesting line numbers " :
class _ LineGrabber : def __init__( self , fp ) : self.lines = sets .
Set ( ) ast = parser.suite( fp.read ( ) ) tree = parser.ast2tuple( ast , True ) self.find_terminal_nodes( tree ) def find_terminal_nodes ( self , tup ) : " " " Recursively eat an AST in tuple form , finding the first line number for " interesting " code . " " " ( sym , rest ) = tup [ 0 ] , tup [ 1 : ] line_nos = [ ] if type ( rest [ 0 ] ) == types .
TupleType : ### node for x in rest : min_line_no = self.find_terminal_nodes(x ) if min_line_no is not None : line_nos.append(min_line_no ) if symbol.sym_name[sym ] in ( ' stmt ' , ' suite ' , ' lambdef ' , ' except_clause ' ) and \ line_nos : # store the line number that this statement started at self.lines.add( min( line_nos ) ) else : # ## leaf if sym not in ( token. NEWLINE , token .
STRING , token .
INDENT , token .
DEDENT ) : return tup [ 2 ] if line_nos : return min( line_nos ) ## use like so : lines = _ LineGrabber ( open ( filename ) ) .lines
I will be eternally grateful to anyone who points out why this is a stupid way to do things , and / or can improve the logic .
( I already know it 's unmaintainable . )
I 'll post the full figleaf module sometime soon ; right now it 's too dangerous to let loose on the Internet .
If you 're willing to handle such dangerous material , just drop me a line .

This week kiko decided to close shop and put their code and domain up for sale at eBay .
The main reason , also mentioned by Paul Graham , is that they were going head on with Google Calendar .
Paul advises not to get in Google ’s way , but is Google really invincible ?
Paul in his recent blog post correctly observes that it was not so much the kiko ’s calender itself that lost against Gcal but the integration of Gcal with Gmail was the killer blow .
I agree .
Most Web 2.0 ( or any other incarnation of business ) services like wish lists , to - do lists , calendars , notepads etc. are not going to make it on their own .
There has never been much of a marketplace for such standalone services , they belong to more complex solutions .
Does it mean that independent entrepreneurs should not innovate in this space ?
Or the acquisition exit strategy is flawed because your target acquirer could just built these services on their own ?
I beg to differ .
Let ’s look at what is happening here .
Say you want to build a new calender and believe you can do it better than Google .
But there is no way you can make money doing just the calender .
Advertising is not enough and might be intrusive .
Paid customers would not come if they can get similar ( even less sophisticated ) features with Google .
One possible way would be to use online version of your app only as a testing mechanism and sell the product to the Enterprise or an Enterprise player , e.g. an eLearning solution provider could use your calender component .
But there might be a yet another way , look around for other Web 2.0 ( again , used for lack of better term ) companies that could use your component .
The infrastructure is there and one of the basic tenets of Web 2.0 is integrable services .
So , why not partner with other similar small players .
This is a win - win - win situation for you , your partners and your users .
As for calender , David posted his reaction to Paul ’s post , where he states that 37 Signals also launched a calender recently and even charges for it .
Of course , they would n’t be able to do so , if it was n’t part of Backpack .
It ’s all about an integrated experience .
There are about 1000 Web 2.0 companies on Seth Godin ’s Web 2.0 Traffic Watch List .
Will all of them survive ?
I doubt it , but by collaborating with each other they increase their chances many fold .
So do n’t give up on your dream and creativity .
Kiko ’s death does n’t mean much in the larger context .
It ’s still remarkably cheap and easy to put together an Internet based business .
My web hosting is cheaper than my bank account fees .
The only significant investment you are making is your time and even that pays off .
Just the lessons learned would be worth the effort .
Kiko founders already have ton of job offers and investment for their next project .
Millions of Chinese go online via internet cafes
Only the US now has more web surfers as young and old Chinese take to the internet in record numbers .
The figure is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years .
China 's economic boom is behind the dramatic rise as increasing personal wealth means more people are able to buy computers and go online .
Great Firewall
But the Chinese authorities are less in love with the net .
The government regularly tries to block access to material it considers pornographic or politically subversive .
Only last week , the authorities threatened to shut down websites and blogs that failed to register with regulators in a new campaign to tighten controls on what the public can see online .
The so - called Great Firewall of China is constantly being breached as citizens and the authorities play a cat and mouse game with the flow of information .
Of the 100 million net users , about 30 million have broadband .
Mobile phone usage is also on the rise , gaining about 60 million new users each year .
There are now 358 million mobile phone users in China and it makes up 44.6 % of China 's telecom business .
This has nothing to do with my books , or indeed any of the subjects that most of you guys are interesting in hearing about , but I feel a need to vent .
About a month ago , I discovered to my puzzlement and annoyance that my account at PayPal had been locked .
I had no idea why .
I 've had a PayPal account for years , and never had a problem .
In all that time , I was only involved in one dispute , and that was a case where I was the one filing the complaint .
Besides , that was three years ago , at least .
I use PayPal mainly for buying toy knights on ebay ( these days , many sellers will accept only PayPal , money orders , or cashier 's checks , and the latter two are just too much trouble ) , and for collecting payment when readers buy signed copies of my old books off my website .
It 's a convenient service , well worth the fees , and I 've never had a problem with it .
Till now .
This turned out to be a big problem , though .
My account was locked , with no explanation .
I can't get into it , ca n't use it to pay , ca n't accept payments , can't access the money I have in the account .
Why ?
I emailed PayPal 's " Account Review Department , " as instructed , to find out what had happened and get the account unlocked .
My first two emails went unanswered .
The third time proved to be the charm , and finally got me a reply .
It said , in part : " PayPal is a regulated financial services company required under law toassess its customers against certain lists of individuals and entitieswhich have had sanctions imposed against them .
Where a potential match isidentified , PayPal 's policy is to lock the account and request furtheridentifying documentation .
The decision to lock your account has been takensolely by PayPal in line with its compliance policy .
" This made no bloody sense to me , so I decided to phone PayPal and try and talk to an actual human being .
That 's not easy either , in this world we live in .
I found the number , phoned , negotiated the usual infuriating Voice Mail maze of " press 1 for this , press 2 for that , " and finally reached a customer " service " representative .
She , of course , was no help whatsoever .
She looked up my account and told me the same stuff that was in the email I 'd received .
In fact , I think she was reading from the email .
When I asked her questions , she had no answers .
So finally I asked to speak to a supervisor .
He , at least , gave me some meaningful information .
Despite the hokeydoke in the letter about " the decision ... has been taken solely by PayPal , " the source of my trouble is actually the federal government .
The reason my account was locked was because my name has turned up on a list out of the U.S. Treasury Department .
Specifically , something called the " Office of Foreign Assets Control .
"
Why the hell I would be on this list , I have no idea .
I have no " foreign assets " that I know of , aside from a long - moribund bank account in Poland from the days before the Berlin Wall went down , when the Poles could only pay you in soft zlotys that you had to go to Poland to spend .
Or maybe it's because I have used PayPal to pay for toy soldiers from sellers in Germany , Australia , and the UK , or to accept payment for books from a dozen different foreign countries .
Or ... if you will allow me a moment of paranoia here ... maybe someone in the Treasury Department did n't like some of the political views I 've posted here , or my opinions about the TSA and the War on Terror .
Whatever the reason , I 'm on the OFAC list , and unlike Santa 's list , this one is just for the naughty , so PayPal has locked the accounts of everyone whose name appears there .
The most infuriating thing of all is that I have MONEY in that PayPal account .
Money which PayPal flatly refuses to disburse to me .
" Can I close the account and withdraw my funds ? " I asked them .
" No , " the supervisor said , " the account is locked . "
I accused him of stealing my funds , which he denied .
They 're still my funds , he insisted .
It 's just that they wo n't let me withdraw them , or use them to pay anyone , because , after all , the account is " locked . "
( How much you want to bet that after some period of " inactivity , " they will start taking fees out of the account ? )
I did luck out in one respect , I suppose .
At the moment , there 's only about fifty bucks in that PayPal account .
That has n't always been the case .
There have been times in the past when I 've had as much as thousand bucks floating in my PayPal account .
Believe me , if you think I 'm honked off now , imagine how pissed I 'd be if they were robbing me of a thousand bucks instead of fifty .
How do unlock the account ?
All I have to do is furnish PayPal with several different proofs of my identity .
They already have a credit card number and a bank account number , mind you , but that 's not sufficient , now they want copies of my passport , my birth certificate , and a utility bill .
A service like PayPal is supposed to make my life easier , to enable me to buy and sell with a click of my mouse , to spare me annoying trips to the bank to buy money orders and cashier 's checks , to allow me to receive small payments from readers abroad who want signed copies of my books .
CONVENIENCE is the reason I use PayPal .
I do n't have the time , the energy , or the inclination to jump through their hoops .
Right now I 'm trying to finish A DANCE WITH DRAGONS , working on a breakdown of the contents and art required for THE WORLD OF ICE AND FIRE , editing the new Wild Cards book INSIDE STRAIGHT and writing my own story for same , beating out an outline for a comics project with John J. Miller , trying to stay on top of the various Ice & Fire spinoffs from Subterranean Press , Fantasy Flight Games , Testor 's , DBPro , Avatar Comics , and several other licenses , dealing with the aftermath of the Byron Preiss bankruptcy auction , trying to extricate my RPG rights from the collapse of Guardians of Order , living through major home renovations .
I do NOT have the time to take on PayPal and the U.S. Treasury as well .
So there you go .
For the foreseeable future , my PayPal account will remain locked , I 'm afraid .
If you want to buy a signed book , you 'll need to mail me a check or money order .
And I guess I wo n't be bidding on nearly as many knights on ebay , since so many sellers " prefer PayPal .
"
If any of you are PayPal users , however , and are accustomed to allowing a significant amount of money to sit around in your account ... take it out .
Take it out NOW .
Your name could turn up on a list as easily as mine did , and then , like me , you 'll find yourself cut off from your money with no right of appeal .
I say it 's spinach , and I say to hell with it .
End of rant .
Napoleon won the battle of Waterloo .
The German Wehrmacht won World War II .
The United States won in Vietnam , and the Soviets in Afghanistan .
The Zealots won against the Romans , and Ehud Olmert won the Second Lebanon War .
You did n’t know that ?
Well , during the last few days the Israeli media has paraded a long series of experts , who did not leave any room for doubt : the war has brought us huge achievements , Hezbollah was routed , Olmert is the great victor .
The TV talk - show hosts and anchormen put their microphones at the service of professors , publicity experts , “ security personnel ” and “ strategists ” ( a title not denoting generals , but advisers of politicians ) .
All of them agreed on the outcome : an honest - to - goodness victory .
Yesterday , I switched on the TV and saw a person radiating self - assurance and explaining how our victory in Lebanon opens the way for the inevitable war with Iran .
The analysis , composed almost entirely of clichés , was worthy of a high - school pupil .
I was shocked to learn that the man was a former chief of the Mossad .
Anyway , we won this war , and we are going to win the next one .
So there is no need at all for a commission of inquiry .
What is there to inquire into ?
All we need is a few committees to clear up the minor slips that occurred here and there .
Resignations are absolutely out .
Why , what happened ?
Victors do not resign !
Did Napoleon resign after Waterloo ?
Did Presidents Johnson and Nixon resign after what happened in Vietnam ?
Did the Zealots resign after the destruction of the Temple ?
Joking aside , the parade of Olmert ’s stooges on TV , on the radio , and in the newspapers tells us something .
Not about the achievements of Olmert as a statesman and strategist , but about the integrity of the media .
When the war broke out , the media people fell into line and and marched in step as a propaganda battalion .
All the media , without exception , became organs of the war effort , fawning on Olmert , Peretz , and Halutz , waxing enthusiastic at the sight of the devastation in Lebanon , and singing the praises of the “ steadfastness of the civilian population ” in the north of Israel .
The public was exposed to an incessant rain of victory reports , going on ( literally ) from early in the morning to late at night .
The government and army spokespersons , together with Olmert ’s spin team , decided what to publish and when , and , more importantly , what to suppress .
That found its expression in the “ word laundry . "
Instead of accurate words came misleading expressions : when heavy battles were raging in Lebanon , the media spoke about “ exchanges of fire . "
The cowardly Hassan Nasrallah was “ hiding ” in his bunker , while our brave chief of staff was directing operations from his underground command post ( nicknamed “ the hole ” ) .
The chicken - hearted “ terrorists ” of Hezbollah were hiding behind women and children and operating from within villages , quite unlike our Ministry of Defense and General Staff , which are located in the heart of the most densely populated area in Israel .
Our soldiers were not captured in a military action , but “ abducted ” like the victims of gangsters , while our army “ arrests ” the leaders of Hamas .
Hezbollah , as is well known , is “ financed ” by Iran and Syria , quite unlike Israel , which “ receives generous support ” from our great friend and ally , the United States .
There was , of course , a difference of night and day between Hezbollah and us .
How can one compare ?
After all , Hezbollah launched rockets at us with the express intent of killing civilians , and did indeed kill some 30 of them .
Our military , “ the most moral army in the world , " took great care not to hurt civilians , and therefore only about 800 Lebanese civilians , half of them children , lost their lives in the bombardments , which were all directed at purely military targets .
No general could compare with the military correspondents and commentators , who appeared daily on TV , striking impressive military poses , who reported on the fighting and demanded a deeper advance into Lebanon .
Only very observant viewers noticed that they did not accompany the fighters at all and did not share the dangers and pains of battle , something that is essential for honest reporting in war .
During the entire war , I saw only two correspondents ’ reports that really reflected the spirit of the soldiers  one by Itay Angel and the other by Nahum Barnea .
The deaths of soldiers were generally announced only after midnight , when most people were asleep .
During the day , the media spoke only about soldiers being “ hurt . "
The official pretext was that the army had first to inform the families .
That ’s true  but only for announcing the names of the fallen soldiers .
It does not apply at all to the number of the dead .
( The public quickly caught on and realized that “ hurt ” meant “ killed ’ . )
Of course , among the almost one thousand people invited to the TV studios during the war to air their views , there were next to no voices criticizing the war itself .
Two or three , who were invited for alibi purposes , were shown up as ridiculous weirdoes .
Two or three Arab citizens were also invited , but the talk - masters fell on them like hounds on their prey .
For weeks , the media suppressed the fact that hundreds of thousands of Israelis had abandoned the bombarded North , leaving only the poorest behind .
That would have shaken the legend of the “ steadfastness of the rear . "
All the media ( except the Internet sites ) completely suppressed the news about the demonstrations against the war that took place almost daily and that grew rapidly from dozens to hundreds , and from hundreds to thousands .
( Channel 1 alone devoted several seconds to the small demonstration of Meretz and Peace Now that took place just before the end of the war .
Both had supported the war enthusiastically almost to the finish . )
I do n’t say these things as a professor of communications or a disgruntled politician .
I am a media person from head to foot .
Since the age of 17 , I have been a working journalist , reporter , columnist , and editor , and I know very well how media with integrity should behave .
( The only prize I ever got in my own country was awarded by the Journalists ’
Association for my “ life work in journalism . " )
I do not think , by the way , that the behavior of our media was worse than that of their American colleagues at the start of the Iraq war , or the British media during the ridiculous Falklands / Malvinas war .
But the scandals of others are no consolation for our own .
Against the background of this pervasive brainwashing , one has to salute the few  who can be counted on the fingers of both hands  who did not join the general chorus and did indeed voice criticism in the written media , as much as they were allowed to .
The names are well known , and I shall not list them here , for fear of overlooking somebody and committing an unforgivable sin .
They can hold their heads high .
The trouble is that their comments appeared only in the op - ed pages , which have a limited impact , and were completely absent from the news pages and news programs , which shape public opinion on a daily basis .
When the media people now passionately debate the need for all kinds of inquiry commissions and examination committees , perhaps they should set a personal example and establish a commission of inquiry to investigate the actions of the media themselves at the time of supreme test .
In Goethe ’s Faust , the devil presents himself as the “ force that always strives for the bad and always produces the good . ”
I do not wish , God forbid , to compare the media to the devil , but the result is the same : by its enthusiastic support for the war , the media deepened the feeling of failure that came afterwards and which may in the end have a beneficial impact .
The media called Hezbollah a “ terror organization , " evoking the image of a small group of “ terrorists ” with negligible capabilities .
When it became clear that this is an efficient and well - trained military force with brave and determined fighters , effective missiles , and other weapons , that could hold out against our huge military machine for 33 days without breaking , the disappointment was even more bitter .
After the media had glorified our military commanders as supermen and treated every one of their boasts with adulation , almost as if they were divine revelations , the disappointment was even greater when severe failures in strategy , tactics , intelligence , and logistics showed up in all levels of the senior command .
That contributed to the profound change in public opinion that set in at the end of the war .
As elevated as the self - confidence had been , so deep was the sense of failure .
The gods had failed .
The intoxication of war was replaced by the hangover of the morning after .
And who is that running in front of the mob clamoring for revenge , all the way to the Place de la Guillotine ?
The media , of course .
I do n’t know of a single talk - show host , anchorman , commentator , reporter , or editor who has confessed his guilt and begged for forgiveness for his part in the brainwashing .
Everything that was said , written , or photographed has been wiped off the slate .
It just never happened .
Now , when the damage cannot be repaired anymore , the media are pushing to the head of those who demand the truth and clamor for punishment for all the scandalous decisions that were taken by the government and the general staff : prolonging the war unnecessarily after the first six days , abandoning the rear , neglecting the reserves , not sending the land army into Lebanon on day X and sending them into Lebanon on day Y , not accepting the G8 ’s call for a cease - fire , and so on .
But , just a moment 
During the last few days , the wheel may be turning again .
What ?
We did not lose the war after all ?
Wait , wait , we did win ?
Nasrallah has apologized ?
( By strict orders from above , the full interview of Nasrallah was not broadcast at all , but the one passage in which he admitted to a mistake was broadcast over and over again . )
The sensitive nose of the media people has detected a change of the wind .
Some of them have already altered course .
If there is a new wave in public opinion , one should ride it , no ?
We call this the “ Altalena Effect . "
For those who do n’t know , or who have already forgotten : Altalena was a small ship that arrived off the coast of Israel in the middle of the 1948 war , carrying a group of Irgun men and quantities of weapons , it was not clear for whom .
David Ben-Gurion was afraid of a putsch and ordered the shelling of the ship , off the coast of Tel - Aviv .
Some of the men were killed ; Menachem Begin , who had gone aboard , was pushed into the water and saved .
The ship sank , the Irgun was dispersed , and its members joined the new Israeli army .
Twenty - nine years later , Begin came to power .
All the careerists joined him in haste .
And then it appeared , retroactively , that practically everybody had been on board the Altalena .
The little ship expanded into a huge aircraft carrier  until the Likud lost power and Altalena shrunk back to the size of a fishing boat .
The Second Lebanon War was a mighty Altalena .
All the media crowded onto its deck .
But the day after the war was over , we learned that this was an optical illusion : absolutely nobody had been there , except Captain Olmert , First Officer Peretz , and Helmsman Halutz .
However , that can change any minute now , if the trusting public can be convinced that we won the war after all .
As has been said before : in Israel nothing changes , except the past .
Kramnik said he would like a rematch in a year or two
Deep Fritz won by four points to two , after taking the last game in 47 moves in a match lasting almost five hours .
Of the six games , Deep Fritz won two and four ended in draws .
The 31 - year - old Russian , who received $ 500,000 ( £ 253,000 ) for playing the machine , could have walked away with double if he had been successful .
After the game , Mr Kramnik said he was " a bit disappointed " but hoped a rematch could be arranged in a year or two .
" With more time to prepare , I still have a chance , " he said .
In 2002 , Mr Kramnik held Deep Fritz to a draw after eight games , but the chess software has since been updated , calculating millions of positions every second .
In October , Mr Kramnik defeated Bulgaria 's Veselin Topalov to become the undisputed world chess champion for the first time since 1993 .
OR , Close your < script > and < canvas > tags !
The relationships among HTML , XML and XHTML are an area of considerable confusion on the web .
We often see questions on the webkit - dev mailing list where people wonder why their seemingly XHTML documents result in HTML output .
Or we ’re asked why an XML construct like < b /> does n’t actually close the bold tag .
This article will attempt to clear up some of that confusion .
You may be wondering what the subtitle has to do with the title .
Well , the HTML / XHTML distinction may seem like an obscure topic , but it can have significant practical effects .
In particular , it is likely to affect Dashboard Widget developers in a huge way in upcoming WebKit versions .
I ’ll explain further at the end .
What are HTML , XML and XHTML ?
The original language of the World Wide Web is HTML ( HyperText Markup Language ) , often referred to by its current version , HTML 4.01 or just HTML4 for short .
HTML was originally an application of SGML ( Standard Generalized Markup Language ) , a sort of meta - language for making markup languages .
SGML is quite complicated , and in practice most browsers do not actually follow all of its oddities .
HTML as actually used on the web is best described as a custom language influenced by SGML .
Another important thing to note about HTML is that all HTML user agents ( this is a catchall term for programs that read HTML , including web browsers , search engine web crawlers , and so forth ) have extremely lenient error handling .
Many technically illegal constructs , like misnested tags or bad attribute names , are allowed or safely ignored .
This error - handling is relatively consistent between browsers .
But there are lots of differences in edge cases , because this error handling behavior is not documented or part of any standard .
This is why it is a good idea to validate your documents .
XML and XHTML are quite different .
XML ( eXtensible Markup Language ) grew out of a desire to be able to use more than just the fixed vocabulary of HTML on the web .
It is a meta - markup language , like SGML , but one that simplifies many aspects to make it easier to make a generic parser .
XHTML ( eXtensible HyperText Markup Language ) is a reformulation of HTML in XML syntax .
While very similar in many respects , it has a few key differences .
First , XML always needs close tags , and has a special syntax for tags that do n’t need a close tag .
In HTML , some tags , such as img are always assumed to be empty and close themselves .
Others , like p may close implicitly based on other content .
And others , like div always need to have a close tag .
In XML ( including XHTML ) , any tag can be made self - closing by putting a slash before the code angle bracket , for example < img src=" funfun.jpg " /> .
In HTML that would just be < img src=" funfun.jpg " >
Second , XML has draconian error - handling rules .
In contrast to the leniency of HTML parsers , XML parsers are required to fail catastrophically if they encounter even the simplest syntax error in an XML document .
This gives you better odds of generating valid XML , but it also makes it very easy for a trivial error to completely break your document .
HTML - compatible XHTML
When XML and XHTML were first standardized , no browser supported them natively .
To enable at least partial use of XHTML , the W3C came up with something called “ HTML - compatible XHTML ” .
This is a set of guidelines for making valid XHTML documents that can still more or less be processed as HTML .
The basic idea is to use self - closing syntax for tags where HTML does n’t want a close tag , like img , br or link , with an extra space before the slash .
So our ever - popular image example would look like this : < img src=" funfun.jpg " /> .
The details are described in the Appendix C of the XHTML 1.0 standard .
It ’s important to note that this is kind of a hack , and depends on the de facto error handling behavior of HTML parsers .
They do n’t really understand the XML self - closing syntax , but writing things this way makes them treat / as an attribute , and then discard it because it ’s not a legal attribute name .
And if you tried to do something like < div /> , they would n’t understand that the div is supposed to be empty .
There are also many other subtle differences between HTML and XHTML that are n’t covered by this simple syntax hack .
In XHTML , tag names are case sensitive , scripts behave in subtly different ways , and missing implicit elements like < tbody > are n’t generated automatically by the parser .
So if you take an XHTML document written in this style and process it as HTML , you are n’t really getting XHTML at all – and trying to treat it as XHTML later may result in all sorts of breakage .
What determines if my document is HTML or XHTML ?
You may be a bit thrown off by the last sections talk of treating an XHTML as HTML .
After all , if my document is XHTML , that should be the end of the story , right ?
After all , I put an XHTML doctype !
But it turns out that things are not so simple .
So what really determines if a document is HTML or XHTML ?
The one and only thing that controls whether a document is HTML or XHTML is the MIME type .
If the document is served with a text / html MIME type , it is treated as HTML .
If it is served as application / xhtml+xml or text / xml , it gets treated as XHTML .
In particular , none of the following things will cause your document to be treated as XHTML :
Using an XHTML doctype declaration
Putting an XML declaration at the top
Using XHTML - specific syntax like self - closing tags
Validating it as XHTML
In fact , the vast majority of supposedly XHTML documents on the internet are served as text / html .
Which means they are not XHTML at all , but actually invalid HTML that ’s getting by on the error handling of HTML parsers .
All those “ Valid XHTML 1.0 ! ” links on the web are really saying “ Invalid HTML 4.01 ! ” .
HTML is probably what you want
Perhaps you ’re just now realizing that your lovingly crafted valid XHTML document is actually invalid HTML .
You have a couple of choices :
Serve your content as application / xhtml+xml .
That ’s probably not such a good idea though .
Microsoft Internet Explorer will not handle XHTML at all , and serving it such a MIME type will lead it to download .
Unless you ’re willing to completely lock out IE users , you probably do n’t want to take this option .
Serve as text / html to IE , but as application / xhtml+xml to other browsers .
This way your content at least has a chance of working in IE , and uses HTML - compatible XML for its original intended purpose , as a fallback compatibility hack .
However , there are still downsides .
Your documents will be processed in entirely different ways in IE vs other browsers .
A construct that may be perfectly valid HTML could totally break XML parsing , due to the strict error handling rules .
Or conversely , some kinds of valid XHTML changes might result in an HTML document that looks wrong .
Furthermore , the XHTML modes of the browsers that support it are not nearly as mature or well tested as the HTML modes .
This is definitely the case for Safari .
And Mozilla also discourages this practice due to lack of support for incremental rendering .
And they have a list of some of the many differences in processing XHTML vs HTML .
Stick with the status quo .
Another option is to just stick with the status quo – generate XHTML content but serve it as HTML .
The disadvantages here are mainly that you are losing out on HTML validators , which will validate the document in a way that matches how browsers parse it ; and that you run the risk of subtle incompatibilities if your document is ever actually processed as XHTML .
But this also raises the question : what do you think you are getting out of using XHTML ?
You may have heard a lot of hype about it , experts may have told you it ’s the next big thing , but what kind of benefits do you get if in the end it ’s just treated as HTML tag soup ?
Serve valid HTML .
This is the option I recommend – serve valid HTML documents with a text / html MIME type .
This way you ’ll be using the best - tested mode of web browsers , wo n’t have to worry as much about weird compatibility issues , and will get the most benefit out of HTML - based toolchains .
So overall it seems best to go with HTML , and follow through consistently .
But do n’t just take my word for it .
Leading web standards experts like Ian Hickson , Anne van Kesteren and Mark Pilgrim have all pointed out the pitfalls of serving XHTML as HTML .
Best practices
On today ’s web , the best thing to do is to make your document HTML4 all the way .
Full XHTML processing is not an option , so the best choice is to stick consistently with HTML4 .
Here ’s the best way to do that :
Use an HTML4 doctype declaration , ideally one that will trigger “ standards mode ” in web browsers .
One example of an HTML4 standards mode doctype is <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd " >
Serve your content with the text / html MIME type , or for local content give it a .html or .htm suffix .
This will lead browsers , search engines , and other apps to properly process your content as HTML .
Validate your content as HTML , not as XHTML .
One handy way is using a validation service , such as the W3C Validator .
( But beware , the validator looks at your doctype instead of the MIME type , unlike browsers . )
Unfortunately , sometimes you are not fully in control of the content you produce .
For example , this very blog , published with WordPress tags .
If you find yourself in this same boat , encourage your tools vendors to provide support for generating valid HTML .
About those < script > and < canvas > tags
I promised at the start of this post to tell you all what this had to do with closing script and canvas tags in Dashboard widgets .
Well , the upshot is that XML - style self - closing syntax in HTML is not always so innocuous .
The Safari 2.0 version of WebKit had a special quirk for treating script elements with the self - closing syntax ( like this : < script src=" myscript.js " /> ) as if they were actually properly closed .
At the time Gecko - based browsers like Firefox had a similar quirk , and we decided to copy it for compatibility with particular web sites .
However , future versions of Firefox will remove this quirk , and this kind of behavior is going to be explicitly outlawed by future standards that build on HTML , such as Web Apps 1.0 .
So we will probably remove this quirk in future versions of WebKit as well .
Unfortunately , HTML relying on this parsing quirk has crept into a lot of Dashboard widgets .
A WebKit that did n’t support this quirk would lead to broken widgets – the external script code would never run .
There is a similar issue with the canvas alement , as it makes its way through the standardization process .
canvas was originally implemented in Safari as an empty tag like img , but standards and other browsers have all gone with making it require an explicit close tag , to support fallback content .
Widgets hit two different pitfalls here – many use the XML self - closing syntax ( < canvas /> ) , while others have just a plain old unclosed ( < canvas > ) tag .
Either way , you need to change to using an explicit close tag ( < canvas > </ canvas > , or future WebKit versions will think all the rest of your document is inside the canvas element and wo n’t render it .
Conclusion
It ’s easy to get confused about HTML and XHTML , and many of the experts out there give misleading advice on the subject .
Fortunately , most of the time it does n’t matter .
But sometimes it does , and can badly break your content .
So make sure you understand the difference , and serve up some good clean markup .

Former sex slaves are still demanding official compensation
In their midst , a small group of elderly women sit silently .
They are the survivors of the brutal , Asia - wide system of sex slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army , which the military government encouraged and helped to operate for 13 years , from 1932 until the end of World War II in 1945 .
They were euphemistically called " comfort women " .
But experts like Korean American scholar Edward Chang of the University of California say the network of " comfort stations " were actually officially - sanctioned rape camps .
Many of the women were even killed as part of an attempt to cover up the crime .
" There should be no time limit on prosecuting these crimes against humanity , " Prof Chang said .
Japan says all potential claims by individuals for sufferings inflicted in the war were closed years ago , by treaties normalising its ties with other Asian countries .
But Kang Kyung - wha , a senior official at South Korea 's foreign ministry , has recently urged Japan to come to terms with its " legal responsibility " and human rights obligations towards the former comfort women .
Repeatedly abused
Kim Gunja , now aged 80 , is too frail to attend the Wednesday demonstrations .
Her story is typical of the tens of thousands - some estimates say 200,000 - women from across Asia whose lives were ruined when they became military sex slaves to the Japanese .
At the age of 17 , she was tricked into being abducted by a Korean middle - man who delivered large numbers of young women and girls to his country 's then Japanese colonial masters .
Kim Gunja is especially angry at current Japanese leaders
She was taken by train to the so - called comfort stations for the Japanese army in Manchuria , north - east China , where she says she was raped by the soldiers many times a day for three years .
" The soldiers did n't know when they would die , and they were very cruel , " she said .
She was beaten so badly that she lost her hearing in one ear .
After the war she could never marry or get a good job .
She still cannot forgive .
And she saves her fiercest hatred for current Japanese leaders .
She wants them to show sincere atonement for Japan 's past wrongdoings and to take responsibility by paying official compensation .
Facing up to the past
Japan stands accused of a series of evasions in facing up to the military sex slave issue .
According to Mr Chang , Japan 's first admission of involvement only came in 1991 , after a wartime document came to light in the foreign ministry about the granting of travel permits for Asian women in areas occupied by the Japanese army .
He says that , since then , the Japanese authorities have continued to hinder the search for detailed evidence about the fate of the former comfort women .
But his own research team 's trawl through America 's national archives has produced a sheaf of files captured by the US army from the retreating Japanese forces .
They contain photos and other personal details of dozens of young Filipino women - evidence , he says , of the most extensive system of female trafficking the world has ever seen .
Since 1992 Japanese prime ministers have all made formal apologies for the war .
But Shin Heisoo , head of the Korean council supporting the former military sexual slaves , believes these statements are just empty words .
Only legal reparations , she says , will suffice to acknowledge what she sees as war crimes .
In Japan , a recent opinion poll showed that only 13 % of the population think further apologies to Asian countries are needed .
Many in South Korea cannot just forget the past
It also directly funded medical care for the recipients .
A director of the fund , Yasuaki Onuma , acknowledges the criticism of Japan 's slow and limited response .
But he also holds some hard - line South Korean campaigners responsible for the impasse .
Many of the Korean victims , he says , were put under intense social pressures to refuse the Japanese donations , although they sorely needed that support .
It was recently decided that the fund will shut down within two years .
So the poison from past cruelties will be passed on to a new generation of Koreans and Japanese .
Kim Gunja now lives near Seoul in a home for former comfort women supported by the South Korean government .
She says she hopes Japan will reveal the truth and offer her official compensation .
" Otherwise " , she said , " I will not be able to close my eyes when I die . "
If it 's your job to stop people pirating movies , you should really be very careful not to get caught making pirate copies .
But that 's what the Motion Picture Ass. of America has managed to do .
The MPAA lobbies for stronger action against pesky pirates and more effective digital rights management .
This week it admitted copying a movie , but effectively claimed it was above copyright law .
The MPAA also runs the US rating system .
It views films and allocates ratings according to content - G for general audiences , PG for parental guidance .
That was how it got its hands on a copy of " This Film Is Not Yet Rated " - a documentary about how the MPAA rates films .
The director , Kirby Dick , specifically asked the MPAA not to make any copies of his film .
Dick was assured by an MPAA representative that " the confidentiality of your film ... is our first priority .
Please feel assure [ sic ] that your film is in good hands " .
But on Monday the MPAA admitted it had made a copy of the film but claimed , because their staff were the subject of the film , they were not breaking copyright law .
An MPAA spokeswoman said : " We made a copy of Kirby 's movie because it had implications for our employees .
We were concerned about the raters and their families , " the LA Times reported .
She added that the film was " locked away " and no further copies were being made - good to know they 're not flogging them down the market then .
More from the LA Times here . ®
There have been a few accounts on the web about a copyright enforcement action I took yesterday morning .
Below are some long details if you are interested in the full details in about 1400 words .
Yesterday morning a Microsoft employee used a photograph of mine in a corporate blog post promoting new features in the Windows Vista operating system and version 7 of the Internet Explorer web browser .
The photograph used in the Microsoft blog post pictured Dean Hachamovitch , general manager of the Internet Explorer component of Windows , on stage at the Gnomedex 2005 announcing support for web feed syndication built - in to the next version of his product , bundled with Windows Vista .
The image was licensed under Creative Commons 2.0 By - Attribution Non-Commercial and hosted on Flickr , a Yahoo ! photo sharing site .
The original photograph
I attended the Gnomedex conference in June 2005 and captured a few photographs from a few rows back as Dean Hachamovitch demonstrated support for web feeds in a Windows Vista build .
I posted those pictures to Flickr as quickly as I could , trying to find enough Internet connectivity for what I thought would be the first pictures of the announcement available to bloggers under Creative Commons for use in their posts .
I used some of the pictures in - context on my own blog while sharing Microsoft ’s announcement with my readers .
Full - resolution pictures of my photo set were lifted off Flickr and posted on just about every Windows news and fan site .
A few even offered copies for sale and license for anywhere from $ 8 for a personal print to a few hundred dollars for the photo ‘s reuse .
I spent the afternoon and part of my evening sending out Digital Millennium Copyright
Act takedown notices to sites in the United States , and contacting individual webmasters of foreign domains ( if there was legit contact info available ) .
The picture of Dean Hachamovitch on stage happened to be the most popular photo of the set , evidenced by the almost 22,000 times the image has been viewed on Flickr , driven largely by blog authors who provided proper attribution .
The Microsoft post
On Monday morning , December 4 , Sean Lyndersay , a senior program manager on the Internet Explorer team , authored a post promoting feed syndication in Windows Vista on the “ Microsoft Team RSS Blog ” hosted on the Microsoft Developers Network .
My photograph was used in this commercial post to promote the availability of the Windows Vista suite of products and the feed syndication platform on Windows Vista available to developers .
The depiction of Dean Hachamovitch wearing a t - shirt with a “ Longhorn * heart * RSS ” marketing message was part of a larger Microsoft marketing campaign at the Gnomedex 2005 conference showing a renewed commitment to an abandoned browser and Microsoft ’s willingness to step out and do something totally new and different by not only adding web feed subscriptions as an in - browser option , but exposing that data and handling as an API to any Windows application .
Microsoft used the image I shot of Dean Hachamovitch in June 2005 without attribution and to commercial advantage , in violation of the Creative Commons by - attribution non-commercial license attached to the work .
The Microsoft blog post also violated Flickr Terms of Service by not including a link to the original photo hosting page with the use of the hosted image .
Taking action
I had a few options to prompt Microsoft , or the original author , to either remove the Flickr - hosted photo thumbnail from the post or pay a licensing fee .
I could try e-mailing Microsoft , but for some reason Microsoft has been routing e-mails from my domain to the Junk Mail folders of its employees for a while ( likely issues with users in the server neighborhood of my web and mail hosting provider , TextDrive , and not a custom mail rule by Microsoft admins ) .
I do n’t have the telephone numbers of anyone in the Windows group .
What would Microsoft do if someone violated their IP ?
A few months ago Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake swapped one of her Flickr photos after improper use on Om Malik ’s blog , placing the word “ GOATSE ” in big letters in place of her picture of an awning of the Brickhouse restaurant in San Francisco .
Photo swapping is a definite way to grab the attention of the site misusing your content .
The Goatse meme is particularly apt for cases of direct or attempted IP theft .
Some Goatse history
The Goatse internet shock meme was used on IRC channels as a means of discouraging the distribution and solicitation of copyrighted software .
The channel admin s set up scripts to return a file named hello.jpg to users and bots attempting to download pirated software , including the then popular Windows 98 and its leaked builds .
The meme made its way to the web , with a special gift from Christmas Island ( .cx tld ) .
You can read more about Goatse on Wikipedia .
Goatse developed into a piece of Internet culture as its original use to shock copyright offenders expanded .
A few companies seeded peer - to - peer file sharing networks with these shock items , introducing a surprise when someone unpacked what they thought was the latest pirated copy of Windows .
Microsoft sponsors the activity of the Business Software Alliance and other anti-piracy groups to track down potential and outright violators of their intellectual property rights and send a message through binaries .
Swapping the Image
I decided to educate Microsoft about the use of images licensed under Creative Commons and hosted by third - party sites by using the same tactics employed in its own fight against piracy , but with a little twist .
I edited the Goatse image to remove depictions of anything that might be considered offensive , and placed the Creative Commons circle logo covering up the focus of the image .
The modified image was meant to send a message to readers of the Internet Explorer team ’s blog that the new picture was out of place , and ensure quick corrective action from Microsoft .
I was unsure how many employees in the software division would get the subtle reference to Microsoft ’s own anti-piracy efforts .
I sent an e-mail to Sean Lyndersay , author of the Microsoft blog post , shortly after the image swap stating I was the copyright holder and detailing the violation of Creative Commons license and Flickr terms of use .
I provided a link to his blog post and advised him to choose a different image .
Sean responded with his own interpretation of commercial use , claiming the inclusion of my picture in the post was an appropriate non-commercial use .
I sent instant messages to a few Microsoft employees in the Live and Live Platforms divisions to spread some internal awareness and possibly speed up resolution .
The image was later removed from the Microsoft blog , and a future revision of the post pointed to a blog post from the Microsoft archives instead of referencing my image .
An apology was later added to the bottom of the post noting the lack of attribution .
As a result of my actions the swapped photo appeared above - the - fold on the Microsoft “ Team RSS ” blog for a brief period of time late Monday morning .
You can take a look at the modified image I used and see a screenshot of the image and its placement on the Microsoft blog if you are interested in further context .
Summary
I license my text and image creations under Creative Commons licenses in the hope they will help other people tell a better story or unleash some sort of increased creativity upon the world of content I enjoy every day .
When that content is used beyond the terms of my published license I choose to take various forms of action ranging from e-mailing or sending an instant message to the person ( if I have it or can query accurate information without much effort ) or by issuing legal documents of copyright violations to the offending site or host .
A member of the Microsoft packaged software team lifting one of my images is definitely a case where the infringing party should have known better , as the company routinely takes action to protect its own IP .
Will Microsoft will change its IP enforcement policies such as issuing broad cease and desist to members of its community or guilty until proven innocent tactics of Business Software Alliance audits ?
Doubtful .
I likely kicked off a round of IP discussions on Microsoft mailing lists yesterday with a variety of opinions both ways .
There were multiple ways I could have handled the reuse of my content without license , and the Microsoft blog treatment was definitely a unique case for a unique company .
Internet Explorer has a bit of a history and happened to take action on the wrong side of copyleft .
The Bush administration has scaled back its ambitions to rebuild Iraq from the devastation wrought by war and dictatorship and does not intend to seek new funds for reconstruction , it emerged yesterday .
In a decision that will be seen as a retreat from a promise by President George Bush to give Iraq the best infrastructure in the region , administration officials say they will not seek reconstruction funds when the budget request is presented to Congress next month , the Washington Post reported yesterday .
The $ 18.4bn ( £ 10.6 bn ) allocation is scheduled to run out in June 2007 .
The move will be seen by critics as further evidence of the administration 's failure to plan for the aftermath of the war .
A decision not to renew the reconstruction programme would leave Iraq with the burden of tens of billions of dollars in unfinished projects , and an oil industry and electrical grid that have yet to return to pre-war production levels .
The decision is a tacit admission of the failure of the US rebuilding effort in the face of a relentless insurgency .
Nearly half the funds earmarked for reconstruction were diverted towards fighting the insurgency and preparations to put Saddam Hussein on trial .
At least $ 2.5 bn earmarked for Iraq 's dilapidated infrastructure and schools was diverted to building up a security force .
And funds originally intended to repair the electricity grid and sewage and sanitation system were used to train special bomb squad units and a hostage rescue force .
The US also shifted funds to build 10 new prisons to keep pace with the insurgency , and safe houses and armoured cars for Iraqi judges , the Post said .
The reconstruction fund was tapped for the hundreds of millions of dollars required to hold elections and for four changes of government .
It also helped pay for the tens of millions required to establish a criminal justice system , including $ 128 m to examine several mass graves of Saddam 's victims .
While 3,600 projects will be completed by the end of the year , the cost of security accounted for as much as 25 % of each project , according to the office of the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction .
A US congressional report in October forecast that many reconstruction projects were unlikely to get off the ground because of the spiralling costs of security .
Production on Iraq 's national electrical grid remains at 4,000 megawatts , 400 megawatts below pre-war levels , with the average Iraqi receiving less than 12 hours of power a day .
Oil production , which was supposed to provide the funds for Iraqi reconstruction , according to the Pentagon 's pre-war planning , also remains well below pre-war levels , mainly due to sabotage by insurgents .
Iraq 's refineries are producing 1.1 m barrels of oil a day , compared with 2.6 m barrels on the eve of the invasion .
The cut - off to reconstruction programmes adds to increasing speculation that the administration is planning at least a partial withdrawal of troops from Iraq before November 's US mid-term election .
It marks a retreat from a promise by Mr Bush in 2003 to provide Iraq with the best infrastructure in the region .
Yesterday , however , a Pentagon official disavowed that ambition .
" The US never intended to completely rebuild Iraq , " Brigadier General William McCoy , the Army Corps of Engineers commander overseeing the work , was quoted in the Post as saying .
" This was just supposed to be a jump - start . "
The Post also notes that fewer than 30 % of Iraqis were even aware of ongoing reconstruction projects , suggesting the US has failed to extract public relations benefit from any of the reconstruction projects it has completed .
WHAT happens if a penny is worth more than 1 cent ?
That is an issue the United States Mint could soon face if the price of metals keeps rising .
Already it costs the mint well more than a cent to make a penny .
This week the cost of the metals in a penny rose above 0.8 cents , more than twice the value of last fall .
Because the government spends at least another six - tenths of a cent -- above and beyond the cost of the metal -- to make each penny , it will lose nearly half a cent on each new one it mints .
The real problem could come if metals prices rise so high that it would be economical to melt down pennies for the metals they contain .
Appearances aside , pennies no longer contain much copper .
In the middle of 1982 , after copper prices rose to record levels , the mint starting making pennies that consist mostly of zinc , with just a thin copper coating .

Zimmermann , the man who released the PGP e-mail encryption program to the world in 1991 – only to face an abortive criminal prosecution from the government – has been trying for 10 years to give the world easy - to - use software to cloak internet phone calls .
On March 14 , Zimmermann released a beta version of the widely anticipated Zfone .
The software is currently available only for OS X ( Tiger ) and Linux , though a Windows version is due in April .
The open - source software manages cryptographic handshakes invisibly , and encrypts and decrypts voice calls as the traffic leaves and enters the computer .
Operation is simple , and users do n't have to agree in advance on an encryption key or type out long passcodes to make it work .
Would - be beta testers must provide Zimmermann with an e-mail address .
That seems an odd requirement for a privacy product , but the process itself was painless , and an e-mail with a download code arrived immediately .
In our test , Zfone installed easily and quickly on OS X , though there were some mild hitches in actually getting it to work .
Zfone is designed to work with VoIP clients that use the industry standard SIP protocol , and has been tested with clients such as X - lite , Free World Dialup and Gizmo Project .
Following Zfone 's instructions , Wired News was able to fairly quickly configure Gizmo Project to work with the software .
But initial efforts to make phone calls with the system failed .
Eventually , a little trial and error revealed that Zfone needed to be started before Gizmo Project , and that to see if a secure connection has been created , both Gizmo and Zfone 's interface needed to be visible on the desktop .
Once that happens , and the caller on the other end also has Zfone installed , the interface cleanly indicates that the call is secure .
It also displays two different three - character codes .
One party reads his code , e.g. " CF8 , " while the other says hers , " TKP . "
This bit of cloak - and - dagger is n't just fun , it helps prevents what is known as a man - in - the - middle attack , in which an eavesdropper sits between two callers , intercepting their cryptographic keys and then relaying the communications between them .
If someone tries that with Zfone , the spoken codes wo n't match what the callers see on their screens .
Using Zfone did n't add any noticeable latency or distortion to calls made with Gizmo Project .
Once it 's up and running , you 're simply talking on the phone .
But make no mistake : to eavesdroppers , Zfone is anything but routine .
The protocol is based on SRTP , a system that uses the 256 - bit AES cipher and adds to that a 3,000 - bit key exchange that produces the codes callers can read off to one another .
It has been submitted to IETF for approval as an internet standard , and by most accounts is strong enough to defy even the most sophisticated code - breaking technologies , from a hacker 's packet sniffer to the acres of computers beneath Ft. Meade .
That makes Zfone the " most secure telephone system anyone has ever used , " according to PGP Corporation 's CTO Jon Callas , who worked with Zimmermann on the protocol
Of course , security is nice , but the value of an end - to - end crypto system is partially a function of its popularity .
If you 're the only one using the system , there 's nobody to talk to .
The Gizmo Project ostensibly uses its own encryption for Gizmo - to - Gizmo calls , though the company wo n't reveal what algorithms they use .
But primarily , Zfone is competing with the built - in crypto that comes with Skype , which is closed - source , uses its own proprietary protocols , and employs its own encryption scheme – which , significantly , is not available for inspection and peer - review ( though some have evaluated ( . pdf ) it and others purportedly cracked it anyway ) .
Those are all troubling signs for a security system .
But as a standard element in Skype 's popular VoIP software , this unproven crypto has already achieved a market penetration that will likely elude Zimmerman 's system .
So as nice as it is , unless Zfone is adopted by mainstream VoIP providers , it will probably occupy the same limited market niche as the hyper - secure PGP program that ruffled so many government feathers over a decade ago .
PGP did n't become standard e-mail fare outside of the community of geeks , cypherpunks and those with special privacy needs , like human rights workers and people living in countries where the government routinely spies on its citizens without oversight .
Fortunately for Zimmerman , there are a lot more of us these days .
