In a 1999 essay about The Sopranos written after its first season , Vincent Canby suggested that the show was an example of a relatively new form of television , the megamovie .
“ Berlin Alexanderplatz , ” “ The Singing Detective ” and “ The Sopranos ” are something more than mini-series .
Packed with characters and events of Dickensian dimension and color , their time and place observed with satiric exactitude , each has the kind of cohesive dramatic arc that defines a work complete unto itself .
No matter what they are labeled or what they become , they are not open - ended series , or even mini-series .
They are megamovies .
That is , they are films on a scale imagined by the big - thinking , obsessive , fatally unrealistic Erich von Stroheim when , in 1924 , he shot “ Greed , ” virtually a page - by - page adaptation of Frank Norris ’s Zola - esque novel , “ McTeague . ”
Stroheim intended it to be an exemplar of cinematic realism .
Megamovies take television seriously as a medium .
They have dramatic arcs that last longer than single episodes or seasons .
Megamovies often explore themes and ideas relevant to contemporary society — there ’s more going on than just the plot — without resorting to very special episodes .
Repeat viewing and close scrutiny is rewarded with a deeper understanding of the material and its themes .
They ’re shot cinematically and utilize good actors .
Plot details sprawl out over multiple episodes , with viewers sometimes having to wait weeks to fit what might have seemed a throwaway line into the larger narrative puzzle .
Episodes of these megamovies , Canby argued presciently , are best watched in bunches , so that the parts more easily make the whole in the viewer ’s mind .
For many , bingeing on entire seasons on DVD or downloaded via iTunes has become the preferred way to watch these shows .
If stamina and non-televisual responsibilities were n’t an issue , it would be preferable to watch these shows in one sitting , as one does with a movie .
Since
The Sopranos kick - started things in 1999 , the megamovie has become a far more common occurrence on TV .
Virginia Heffernan recently stated that the creators of nearly all hour - long dramatic series are aiming to make megamovies .
I ’ve collected a few examples of megamovies accompanied by their total running times below .
The list is incomplete but represents several of the best - known and - appreciated megamovies out there .
The Sopranos , 81 hours 46 minutes
Lost* , 61 hours 59 minutes
Mad Men* , 18 hours 6 minutes
Six Feet Under 57 hours 45 minutes
Deadwood * , 36 hours
The Wire , 60 hours 45 minutes
The West Wing , 111 hours 56 minutes
For The West Wing , that ’s 4 days and 16 hours of continuous watching .
An asterisk marks megamovies that are as - yet incomplete .
In the case of Deadwood , it ’s as if the film projector broke about halfway through the movie , only no one got their money back and eveyone left the theater pissed .
Update :
In his review of the third episode of Mad Men this season , Andrew Johnston talks about the two dominant forms of TV drama and how The Sopranos and Mad Men fit in .

Cant believe that there are no comments yet .
I read the article , and all the articles linked to it .
I have one question for you Brad .
The 1.3 million new voters that ACORN registered .
Is the number the total they collected , or the number they collected that they did not " flag " as possibly being bad ?
In other words is the 1.3 million a good number , or is the number closer to 1.2 million or less ?
Also the Prosecutor of the Weathermen in the 1970s wrote a letter to the New York Times saying he is " outraged " that the republicans are trying to link Ayers and Obama .

Seems ever since I can remember , the Pukes have been whining about ACORN because it offsets ( cancels out ) their suppression tactics .
Ayers was a fat cats kid most likely fighting against his daddy ... ( Daddy says ' those damn liberal colleges !!!')

Yes , getting the word out helps , the more people know about righting the wrong is a good thing !
Maybe the Repugs are worried about flipping votes , it 's easier just to discourage voters from voting ... I know it is a naive question , but if a state is blamed for dumping voters from the voting lists , can't they just go back and add the names ??..

Thanks for posting this , Bub !
Do the Republicans play the corporate media like a fiddle , or is the corporate media " in on it " ?
That 's the only question that I have .
I think they 're " in on it " , we 'll see if there 's retractions or reporting by them of ACORN 's side , or if they 'll cover Sarah Palin 's late Friday " abuse of power " announcement on Monday .
Or will the continue simply being a megaphone for anything and everything the Republicans throw against the wall !

So , if ACORN pays canvassers by the hour , not the card , there is little reason for fraudulent cards .
If organized election fraud is the goal , then it would take an army of volunteers going from polling place to polling place , posing as these fraudulent registrants to sway an election .
Nearly impossible to do .
Also , there is no logical reason for registrations under names such as Mickey Mouse or the the Dallas Cowboys starting line - up .
That just calls attention to a likely fraudulent card .
The most logical explanation I see , beyond mere stupidity on the part of the canvassers , is a deliberate attempt to sabotage ACORNS efforts using planted canvassers .
But who would do such a thing ?

I have read the info on Acorn and Acorn 's own response to charges of voter fraud .
It seems no one who makes this charge ever says that there has been any actual proof of voter fraud because of false registration forms .
Why has n't CNN and particularly Lou Dobbs added these responses and facts to their reporting ?

I must admit , I did n't reply because I am at a total loss of words or ideas that are acceptable in a civil society .
It 's like my country has been completely destroyed , and the people that care and swore an oath to not let this happen , can't do anything about it .
There 's too few of us now , and new laws have been created to make us irrelevant .
Without a television network media to tell the truth , no light will be shown on the cancer in government .
Without election cops that are going to go against the law enforcement cops , what point is anything anymore ?
Our country has been completely taken over , and is now run by unseen bankers .
Corruption pays well , while poverty get 's worse .
It probably wo n't matter much longer because neither candidate has a ticket to hop aboard the cluetrain to fix the " TRUST PROBLEM " in the markets .

Anyone who has donated money to this site in order to presevre voting rights in this country should stop today .
Every fraudulent vote that Acorn produced cancels the vote of a legal and rightful voter .
Brads effort to cover this up shows us that he isnt interested in legal accurate voting , hes interested in party politics .
Brad , you should be ashamed .

Thanks for the reminder " Smithy " !

Excuse me ?
I canvassed for 6 months for the ' 04 election ( not for Acorn ) so I know what canvassers go through .
Some people will fill out a form using fake info because they do n't want to say no to you or they think its a joke .
It does n't happen frequently , but its not uncommon .
In those cases the registrations are flagged , and as Brad reported , MUST be handed over regardless of whether they are already flagged as fraudulent .
This is to ensure voter registration groups are n't suppressing registrations from any particular party or group .
Of course , if the GOP had their way , a major registrar of poor & minority voters in swing states would be shut down , for doing nothing other than following their legal requirement of reporting false registrations .
This may also be a tactic to try and push them to start trashing flagged registrations ( which really would be illegal ) , fortunately they are not falling for it , and all this attention as probably helped them ALOT with new registrations !
Reporting the truth about a false propaganda effort is n't a " cover up " .
Obviously you are bothered by how thoroughly this report debunks the GOP voter disenfranchisement campaign .

The release says that is the number of voters they have registered , a flagged form is not registered , so they would not be counted in registration totals .

Call me a conspiracy theorist if you like , but it 's not to hard to come up with a scenario in which a group ( ACORN ) intentionally uses the registration rules to their own advantage .
They ( ACORN ) state they turn in ALL voter registrations ( even the known bad ones ) because they are required to by law .
This is well and good if , and only if , the ' incorrect ' registrations are truly the sole fault of actual registrants .
When your ( ACORN's ) employees are the one 's committing the fraud that 's a whole different story .
When it 's your own ' upstanding ' employees that are simply copying names out of phone books , making addresses up and then signing all the registration forms in the same handwriting it is absolutely disingenuous to try and pretend that they are blameless in the problem .
Gee , let 's hire a bunch of morons knowing full well there is a good chance they will simply turn in piles of garbage registrations just to make a little cash ( or cigarettes and drugs as some have alleged ) .
Now we have thousands and thousands of registrations we could have predicted in advance would be suspect at best .
But hey , the law says we HAVE to turn them all in , so here you go ... ( fill in your favorite swing state election board here ) ... we tried real hard to verify these and we were even so kind to flag all the ones we ' think ' might be bad .
Get back to us in six months when you ( the election board ) have had time to review them .
( Heavy snickering and sarcasm here ) .
Oh , we 're sorry , we did n't realize that the election is in just two months , guess you better get busy checking those out .

Every day , approximately 18.7 billion text messages are sent and received .
It ’s very rare to find someone who does n’t text on a regular basis , and many business owners have found that sending targeted texts to their customers is a great way to keep them interested and aware of new products and promotions .
Have you considered making use of opt - in text messaging to reach your customers ?
Read on to learn about 10 of the greatest benefits that come from using this technique as part of your marketing strategy .
1. Higher Open Rates
Email marketing can be effective , but can also be quite challenging to get people to open the emails you send their way .
Often , when people suspect that an email is marketing related , they ignore it or delete it without even reading it .
With text messages , though , there ’s a much higher open rate .
In fact , some reports show that text messages have up to a 98 percent open rate !
With such great odds that your message will be opened , you ’re also much more likely to see conversions come from marketing text messages .
2. Low Cost
It costs very little money to send opt - in marketing text messages , too .
You can spend way less money on text messages than you would on Facebook or other social media ads and , in many cases , see a much better result .
This makes sending marketing texts a great option for those who are new businesses or those who are working with a very limited budget .
3. Meet People Where They Are
It ’s rare to find someone who does n’t have their phone on them at all times .
In fact , it ’s usually right there in their hand .
Marketing text messages have such a high open - rate because people are almost always on their phones and are almost always ready and willing to receive texts .
With opt - in text messaging , you can meet people where they are and get them interested in what you have to offer right away .
4. Reach a Wider Demographic
Not too long ago , marketing text messages would have seemed like something that only appealed to young people .
These days , though , people of all ages send and receive text messages every day .
Even your grandma probably knows how to send and open them .
Because so many people use their phones to text each day , this gives you an opportunity to reach a wider audience and attract new customers to your business .
5. Fast Response
Most people open text messages shortly after they receive them .
Their high open rate also comes with a high ( and fast ) response rate .
In many cases , you ’ll get responses to your marketing text messages right away .
In addition to coming with fast response times , it ’s also easy to send marketing text messages quickly .
They do n’t require a lot of prep time , so you can send them out as soon as you come up with an idea that you think will be effective .
6. Increased Engagement
You ’re often going to see much higher rates of engagement with marketing text messages , too .
If they can answer your questions or take advantage of a promotion that you ’re offering right there while they ’re already on their smartphone , they ’re going to be much more inclined to do so .
The more engagement you can get , the more business growth you ’re likely to see moving forward .
7. Customer Control
Another great thing about marketing text messages is the fact that the customer has a lot of control over what they receive , too .
For example , customers get to opt -in to marketing text messages .
If they choose to opt - in to these messages , there ’s a good chance that they ’re already somewhat interested in making a purchase in the near future .
Being able to measure who opts in also gives you more information about the people most likely to buy products or services from you .
They get to opt - out , too .
Knowing that they can stop receiving messages at any time is often very helpful .
They wo n’t see the harm in signing up and will likely continue to receive your texts for a lot longer than they would have otherwise .
8. Flexibility
There ’s a lot of flexibility that comes with marketing text messages , too .
There are plenty of different approaches you can take and different types of messages you can send .
Some of the most common options include the following :
Exclusive deals
Insider information
Polls and surveys
You can also run contests via your marketing text messages .
People are always excited about opportunities to win something , even if it ’s just a simple prize like a free t- shirt .
9. Combine with Other Channels
You do n’t have to limit yourself to text message ads alone .
As with most marketing techniques , opt - in marketing texts work best when they ’re combined with other channels , such as email marketing or social media marketing .
Many marketing platforms even give you an option to integrate your text message marketing campaigns with your other campaigns .
This allows you to measure progress in a more effective way and see which approaches work best for your target audience .
10 . Gather Important Information
Finally , opt - in text messaging also gives you an opportunity to gather valuable information about your current and potential customers .
Many people are much more inclined to respond to text messages than they are to emails .
As a result , you can have a more in - depth conversation with a customer and get to know them in real - time ( or almost real - time ) .
This helps you figure out exactly what your customers want and learn more about their behaviors .
When you have this information available , it ’s easier for you to make adjustments to your business to increase their satisfaction rates .
Start Using Opt - In Text Messaging Today
As you can see , there are a lot of reasons why you ought to make opt - in text messaging part of your marketing plan .
Are you ready to take the plunge and connect with your customers in a new way ?
Or , do you need a bit more information before you make a decision ?

On the eve of the Transgender Day of Remembrance , we cannot help but be moved by the impact of discrimination on our communities , 11 gender non-conforming individuals killed in US alone this past year .
It is imperative to speak up to eliminate discrimination ; discussing the devastating effects of discrimination and violence on both the individual and their community .
A component of discrimination that should not be overlooked is its link to health .
Over the past two decades , limited research has established the trend that LGBTs are a health disparate population with increased health risks and access to care barriers , producing a broad pattern of disparities in many health areas .
People in our community are more likely to delay routine medical care due to past negative experiences with providers , which puts the population at - risk for higher rates of preventing chronic conditions such as cancer .
Because of the social stressors LGBTs endure like homophobia and isolation , we have higher rates of substance abuse , mental health problems and stress - related disorders .
Unfortunately , lack of data collection and only sporadic inclusion in policy , research , and intervention programs has hindered the efforts to address and ultimately reduce these disparities .
With the change of administration , it is time for us to unite as activists , health professionals , and LGBT advocates in the struggle for health equality .
Please support us by signing our petition ( click here ) urging the federal government to create an Office of LGBT Health .
No one should be afraid to come out to their doctor .
Our health professionals should have access to information on how discrimination affects our health and what they can do to make it better .
Too little attention has been paid to our health needs for too long .
With the current focus on federal health reform we can no longer wait to close the gaps in our health needs .
Equal health is a part of equal rights and as we fight for full federal equality we need our government to understand that our health needs cannot wait .

BBC News , Berlin
The building site now where the Palace of the Republic once stood Around a dozen people are crammed onto the bridge by the River Spree , pointing their cameras through the fence , determined to catch a glimpse of the huge building site where the Palace of the Republic once stood .
" It 's a disgrace that they 're tearing down the Palace of the Republic , it 's an expression of political superiority after the reunification of Germany , " one old man said .
" They 're destroying a powerful symbol of Berlin 's history , " he added .
After years of heated debate about the building 's future , even today , feelings are running high .
The demolition work started in February 2006 and it has cost at least 30 m euros ( £ 26 m ; $ 40 m ) .
Controversial
After the discovery of toxic asbestos , the demolition work dragged on for almost three years .
It has been a huge operation - around 20,000 tonnes of steel and 54,000 tonnes of concrete have been removed .
The demolition of the Palace of the Republic is a symbolic killing of the representation of the communist regime of former East Germany
Philipp Oswalt , architect
The diggers are still at the site and the whole area has been fenced off .
A viewing platform has been installed to enable curious passers - by to gaze at the vast crater and piles of rubble .
This is probably one of Germany 's most controversial building sites .
The German government is paying 64 % of the demolition costs while the regional Berlin government is paying for 36 % of the costs .
But still many Berliners think it is all a waste of money .
Why , critics argue , did n't the authorities leave the old communist - era building ?
" The demolition of the Palace of the Republic is a symbolic killing of the representation of the communist regime of former East Germany , " said Philipp Oswalt , an architect .
" It 's an expression of a desire by today 's political elite to redesign Germany 's past , by skipping the history of the 20th Century and starting again in the 19th Century .
But this is a mistake because Berlin has been shaped by the 20th Century , by both the positive and negative aspects of history , " he said .
The giant concrete and copper - coloured glass structure was built in 1976 and it was home to the East German parliament .
With its bowling alley , concert hall and restaurants , it was also a venue for weddings and communist youth initiation ceremonies until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
The Palace of the Republic was nicknamed " Erich 's Lamp Shop , " a reference to the hundreds of lamps and chandeliers hanging in the foyer .
Symbol of oppression Some regarded the Palace of the Republic as a symbol of oppression , others condemned it as an eyesore in the heart of the German capital .
We want to reconstruct the beautiful Prussian Palace which was damaged during the Second World War
York Stuhlemmer , architect After the fall of the Berlin Wall , it lay empty and campaigners fought to save the building from demolition .
For more than a decade , the Palace of the Republic stirred passions and it divided opinion .
Finally in 2003 , the Bundestag - lower house of the federal parliament - decided to demolish the building .
Instead of the communist - era Palace of the Republic , Berliners are now getting a version of a Prussian Palace , which once stood on the same site as the Palace of the Republic .
The Berlin City Palace ( " Berliner Stadtschloss " ) was originally opened in 1443 , and the palace , home to the Hohenzollern family , was rebuilt in baroque style in 1716 .
The Berliner Stadtschloss was badly damaged by Allied bombing during World War Two , and its remains were then destroyed by the communist authorities in 1950 .
" The ' People 's Palace ' was an ugly building , it was like an alien in the historic centre of Berlin , " said York Stuhlemmer , an architect who has designed the baroque facades of the new palace .
" We want to reconstruct the beautiful Prussian Palace which was damaged during the Second World War and then blown up by the communists in 1950 .
We would like to reconstruct the gorgeous architecture of the former royal palace and build a fantastic cultural centre on the site , " he said .
Construction of the new Berlin City Palace ( " Berliner Stadtschloss " ) and Humboldt Forum is expected to start in 2010 , with completion in 2013 , at the earliest .
But , as ever , there is controversy over the design of the new building .
Baroque facade
The German parliament decided that three ( out of four ) replica facades would be built , in baroque style , but the interior of the building , which would house a museum and library , would be " modern " .
More than 30 architects submitted entries to a competition to design the Humboldt Forum project on the Schlossplatz , which will cost the German government up to 550 m euros ( £ 460 m ; $ 710 m ) .
The project is a reconstruction of an old royal palace damaged in the war On 28 November , the winner of the architects ' competition was announced .
The Italian architect , Franco Stella , will design the new Humboldt Forum based on the old royal palace .
" I did n't want to create a counterpoint to the city architecture , but provide continuity , not replacement , " he said .
Behind the baroque façade of the new building , the interior will be modern and it will be used as a cultural centre .
There will be a cupola , but the chamber of the former East German parliament from the Palace of the Republic will not be rebuilt , which was originally envisaged .
Franco Stella , who is based in Vicenza near Venice , used to teach architecture at the University of Venice and he has described himself as a " classic modern rationalist in design . "
But opponents have criticised the project , claiming that a reconstruction would be a pastiche of architectural styles .
" I think at least parts of the Palace of the Republic should have been kept so that architects could have integrated it , " said Philipp Oswalt , an architect .
" It 's a bizarre idea - they want to reconstruct the facades of the old royal palace and have a modern interior .
It wo n't work , " he said .
For now , the debate continues , and the Palace of the Republic has been consigned to the history books .

Jennifer Aniston Covers The New York Times Magazine ( PHOTO )
will grace this week 's cover of The New York Times Magazine , Sunday newspaper supplement .
The actress has been making the rounds on the talk show circuit and sitting for interviews with the top magazines in anticipation of several movies that will hit theaters in the coming months .
Marley & Me will open on Christmas Day and He 's Just Not That Into You in February 2009 .
Aniston sat for an interview that will appear in the Sunday NYT in which she says she is really a very private person - no surprise there .
When asked if she would ever consider MySpace or Facebook to connect with her fans , she was quick to say she would not .
Aniston tries to shield herself from what is written about her and said , " It 's not for me .
If I look at it , I 'll be affected .
It 's like dancing with the devil . "
She has kept her silence about her divorce until recently allowing a little trash talk to slip during an interview for the December issue of Vogue .
She reportedly shocked Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie by dredging up the past after so much time had elapsed , referring to her ex-husband 's partner as " uncool " .
Even pal Oprah questioned Jen 's motivation during Aniston 's recent guest appearance .
Jen did admit to enjoying website 1stdibs.com because she loves looking at furniture .
She also likes to play Scrabble and poker and recently discovered Wii .
You can check out the entire interview on Sunday .
Find out what Alec Baldwin had to say about his recent kissing scenes with Jen on 30 Rock - photos and video here .

Politicians regularly turn public fear into votes .
President Bush proved a master at this in his 2004 reelection success .
Most presidents who do n’t win the popular vote the first time do n’t get a second term , but fear pushed Bush over the top in 2004 .
In the 2008 election , oil prices are high , and the presidential candidates from both parties are trying to get into the White House by fear mongering about U.S. dependence on foreign oil .
Barack Obama and John McCain both seem to think such dependence is a bad thing , and the American public wholeheartedly agrees .
Because almost everyone concurs ( except many economists ) on this questionable proposition , the debate on high oil prices and what to do about them degenerates from there .
The facts are that oil prices are high by historical standards ( although at this writing , they have declined somewhat from their peak , and the media has provided less coverage of this downward slide than it did of their upward movement ) and the United States imports about two - thirds of the crude oil that it consumes .
In the globalized world , however , the United States is heavily dependent on imports for many important necessities and products  for example , semiconductors .
International trade allows U.S. companies and the American public to take advantage of the world market to get better goods at cheaper prices .
Thus , when politicians generate fear of U.S. dependence on foreign oil , they are implicitly alleging that oil is somehow special .
Oil is heavily used in transportation and the manufacture of such industrial items as petrochemicals and plastics .
Yet to use the example of semiconductors mentioned above , imported semiconductors also are key component parts of important items throughout the economy  for example , computers , television sets , other electronic devices , cars , etc .
Therefore , the politicians are not only implying that oil is special , but that it is also “ strategic . ”
Oil is strategic , however , only in the narrow sense that its derivatives help run tanks , aircraft , ships , helicopters , and other vehicles that the U.S. military would use in a war .
( Of course , so do semiconductors . )
But the United States produces about 1.8 billion barrels of oil annually , almost 13 times what the U.S. military used at the height of its consumption during the latest simultaneous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ( 144 million barrels per year ) .
Thus , there is plenty of domestically produced oil to run the U.S. military in times of war .
With the probability of any worldwide conventional war among great powers escalating into a global thermonuclear holocaust being quite high  in which case nobody would be caring about the vaporized imported oil  such a widespread conventional conflict is very unlikely .
Thus , in any regional war , the U.S. economy would be able to get oil from the regions of the world not involved in the conflict .
The price might go up because of the war , but industrial economies are actually quite resilient to oil price increases .
For example , the U.S. economy has not collapsed in the wake of recent record oil prices , and from late 1998 to late 2000 , Germany maintained respectable economic growth rates in the face of a 211 percent price increase in oil .
But what if the war occurred in the volatile Persian Gulf region ?
The United States only gets 21 percent of its oil from the Persian Gulf .
Most of it comes from Canada , Mexico , Nigeria , and Venezuela .
Of course , a war anywhere in the world will cause the price of oil to go up .
But about 80 percent of U.S. semiconductor imports come from East Asia , yet the media does n’t constantly run hysterical stories on price spikes in semiconductors or on the horrible U.S. dependence on East Asian semiconductors .
And the politicians do n’t talk about using the U.S. military to safeguard such supplies from East Asia .
But ca n’t the world run out of oil , especially with developing nations , such as China and India , using more ?
Theoretically , the answer is yes because there are only finite deposits in the earth .
Yet because exploration and recovery technology is constantly improving , proven oil reserves have tended to increase over time .
Also , as oil prices go up , conservation increases and alternative energy sources  natural gas , solar , geothermal , etc.  become more attractive economically .
For example , the conventional wisdom was that U.S. natural gas fields were in irreversible decline , but the high price of oil has led to a drilling boom to find more of this substitute .
New technology to extract natural gas from shale beds has increased production in the U.S. dramatically and will probably also do so around the world .
So who knows , similar technological leaps might also increase the amount of recoverable oil around the world .
But one thing is sure : it ’s a myth that being dependent on imported oil is bad .
As a way to stump politicians who perpetuate this nonsense , perhaps we should ask them this question :
If oil is so critical and will become even more valuable when world supplies allegedly dwindle in the future , should n’t we use other countries ’ oil now and have the U.S. government require that our limited production be saved to use or sell as the shortages worsen and future prices go even higher ?
Diametrically opposed to the present time , with the prevalent fears of dependency on foreign oil , this “ conservation theory ” was all the rage in the late 1930s and 1940s when a slowdown in finding new oil deposits seemed to threaten chronic future shortages ( similar to the dire predictions after World War I and in the early 1920s before big oil discoveries were made late in the 1920s ) .
Of course , this is not the right policy prescription either .
We should instead treat oil as any other product and let the market provide ample supplies at the lowest cost to the consumer .
Neo -Nazi boss Bill
White , long given to swaggering threats and proposals for violence , this week went even further than normal — announcing plans for a magazine cover headlined “ Kill This N-----? ” with a photo of Barack Obama and , two days later , publishing the home address of a juror who helped convict another neo -Nazi leader in a federal conspiracy case .
White , who heads the Virginia - based American National Socialist Workers Party , has issued a series of Internet calls for violence in recent years , including his infamous September 2007 suggestion that followers “ Lynch the Jena 6 , ” a reference to black high school students in Jena , La .
But of late , his postings have become even more violent , possibly as a result of White ’s deliberate attempts to be provocative in the face of waning public attention .
On Tuesday , White posted on his Overthrow.com website a request for money to pay for a special issue of his National Socialist magazine .
The mocked - up cover , with a huge “ Kill This N-----? ” headline , shows Obama speaking to a crowd with a rifle ’s crosshairs superimposed on his head .
White said that the accompanying article would explain the Democratic presidential nominee ’s “ radical Communist politics and Jewish backers … and how he plans genocide against white working people . ”
Then , on Thursday , White posted the name , home address and several phone numbers for an allegedly “ Gay Jewish anti-racist ” juror who helped convict Matt Hale , then - leader of the neo - Nazi World Church of the Creator , of soliciting the murder of a federal judge .
Hale was sentenced in 2005 to 40 years in prison .
White does not directly propose violence against the juror .
But he told his readers that the man “ played a leading role in inciting both the conviction and the harsh sentence that followed . ”
He also described the conviction as wrongful and said that the prison term handed Hale was a “ criminally long sentence . ”
White , who lives in Roanoke , Va. , has a long history of issuing sneering threats and vulgar , racist attacks .
Earlier this summer , on July 22 , he verbally attacked what he called “ ‘ respectable ’ n------” in the NAACP and elsewhere in American society .
“ I am convinced , more and more each day , that the only solution to this problem is to kill all of the n------ involved , preferably with state sponsorship , ” he wrote .
“ When the death squads come , line me up as volunteer number one . ”
Are n’t you glad all those big progressive women ’s groups jumped on this issue ?
Oh wait , they did n’t .
We did ( with the help of a lot of other blogs ) .
From the NYT :
Even in tough budget times , there are lines that can not be crossed .
So I was startled by this tidbit reported recently by The Associated Press : When Sarah Palin was mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , the small town began billing sexual - assault victims for the cost of rape kits and forensic exams .
Ms. Palin owes voters an explanation .
What was the thinking behind cutting the measly few thousand dollars needed to cover the yearly cost of swabs , specimen containers and medical tests ?
Whose dumb idea was it to make assault victims and their insurance companies pay instead ?
Unfortunately , her campaign is shielding the candidate from the press , so Americans may still be waiting for answers on Election Day .
The rape - kit controversy is a troubling matter .
The insult to rape victims is obvious .
So is the sexism inherent in singling them out to foot the bill for investigating their own case .
And the main result of billing rape victims is to protect their attackers by discouraging women from reporting sexual assaults .
That ’s why when Senator Joseph Biden , the Democratic vice - presidential nominee , drafted the 1994 Violence Against Women Act , he included provisions to make states ineligible for federal grant money if they charged rape victims for exams and the kits containing the medical supplies needed to conduct them .
( Senator John McCain , Ms. Palin ’s running mate , voted against Mr. Biden ’s initiative , and his name has not been among the long list of co-sponsors each time the act has been renewed . )
That ’s also why , when news of Wasilla ’s practice of billing rape victims got around , Alaska ’s State Legislature approved a bill in 2000 to stop it ….
Her campaign would not answer questions about when she learned of the policy , strongly supported by the police chief : whether she saw it in the budget and if not , whether she learned of it before or after the State Legislature outlawed the practice … .
This page , like this one made by Randall Munroe of xkcd fame , which inspired it , is following the 2008 U.S. Presidential election based on data from Intrade .
com 's state - by - state prediction markets .
The map is shaded according to the states ' probability of going for Obama ( blue ) or McCain ( red ) .
As the Intrade markets converge toward their final values the map should likewise converge to each state being either bright blue or bright red .
The " Call state at " slider controls when a state 's electoral votes are assigned to a candidate .
At 50 % votes are assigned to whoever is more likely to win the state .
At 100 % it requires the Intrade market to have collapsed to certainty before they will be assigned .
The " Paranoia " slider tilts the results to account for any factors you think the Intrade traders have overlooked – Bradley Effect , Reverse Bradley Effect , vote stealing , unpolled cell - phone - only young voters , etc. Since I'm a Democrat , positive paranoia values increase McCain 's chance of winning .
When the slider is selected , hitting ' 0 ' will set the value back to 0 .
This page suffers from the same two weaknesses as the xkcd page : it assumes states ' individual probabilities are independent and ignores the potential splitting of the electoral vote in Nebraska and Maine .

Archaeologists discover earliest ever foundations at Hampton Court Palace from 800 years ago
Archaeologists working at Hampton Court Palace have uncovered the earliest foundations ever found at King Henry VIII 's famous royal residence .
The significant 13th century building remains predate any other finds made at the palace by nearly 200 years .
Archaeologists working at Hampton Court Palace have unearthed the earliest surviving building ever discovered at the historic site
The unexpected discoveries were made during excavations as part of a project to recreate Henry VIII 's Tudor 16th century courtyards .
Stone foundations and walls of a substantial medieval structure measuring 10 metres by 25 metres were found in Base Court , the largest interior courtyard of the Tudor palace .
A spokesman from heritage charity Historical Royal Palace said : ' While there is much speculation by archaeologists and curators about what the buildings were and how they were used , some very interesting possibilities are being considered .
' One theory is that the larger and earlier structure might be a simple barn , or more tantalisingly a hall or residential building that was part of the large manor of Hampton Court when the site was in the hands of Knights Hospitallers , a revered order of military monks . '
An archaeologist analyses a section of 14th Century wall
The impressive discoveries were made during the biggest excavation project ever undertaken at Hampton Court Palace
' The residential theory concurs with a story of a visit by Edward III and his entourage to Hampton Court in 1353 .
' During his stay a fire broke out - for which the King admitted blame - and he subsequently paid for the reconstruction work , bringing his carpenter from Windsor Chapel to oversee it . '
Archaeologists working on the site have unearthed evidence of a fire in this large building , possibly the very building destroyed by King Edward .
The building was subsequently rebuilt in the late 15th century to form part of a group , which were part of the estate of Giles Daubeney , Lord Chamberlain and favourite of Henry VII .
The excavations have revealed the stone foundations and walls of a substantial medieval structure
Experts also found a medieval water feature complete with 500 - year old lead plumbing still in situ .
This ostentatious feature is evidence of the wealth and status of residents of the manor estate who lived there including Giles Daubeney and Richard III 's servant John Wode .
The spokesman added that the exciting finds have been carefully excavated and recorded by a team from Oxford Archaeology who will continue to analyse and study the results with curators after the excavations have finished .
The project to represent Base Court for the 500th anniversary of King Henry VIII 's accession to the throne will be complete by March 2009 .
This will then herald the beginning of a series of exhibitions , events and activities to mark the historic anniversary .
From TPM Reader PM …
Speaking of McCain ’s temper , does anybody remember the whole 2006 ethics reform matter .
I have been thinking about this for days , ever since the first debate .
I did n’t remember all the details at first , only that McCain had responded to a cordial , inoffensive letter from Obama with some unhinged rant .
At the time Obama ’s star was definitely rising and I remember thinking this old guy is mad as hell that he is being shown - up by this “ young upstart ” .
Perhaps it was even more calculated than that .
Certainly in 2006 McCain already had this election in mind and the word presidential was being applied to Senator Obama .
I felt at the time it was a preemptive smear , trying to knock Obama down a few pegs before he became too much of a threat .
Thank God for Google , a search for “ Obama McCain letters ” brought up this :
Link
I did n’t remember Obama ’s reply but upon reading it all I could think was how consistent it was with the sort of campaign he has run .
Unfortunately it would seem McCain has been consistent as well .
Check out the link and relive the early days , when the bile was just beginning to rise .

Stu Rasmussen promised a new administration if he was elected , and he ’s as good as his word : Silverton residents not only are getting a new mayor ; they ’re also getting a new Stu .
Rasmussen , longtime manager of the local cinema , was also elected mayor in 1988 and 1990 , and served four years -- but that was when he was wearing slacks and sport shirts to council meetings .
The new Rasmussen -- who got breast implants a few years ago and began calling himself Carla Fong -- wears skirts , lipstick and high heels .
The thing is , Rasmussen ’s been a fixture in this small former lumber mill town so long , people tend not to pay much attention to what he ’s wearing .
Earlier this month , Rasmussen became America ’s first openly transgender mayor .
His constituents say they elected him not for his looks , but because he promised to put a halt to the rapid development that has threatened Silverton ’s small - town charm .
Advertisement
“ My first two terms , I was a very straight - looking guy , ” said Rasmussen , 60 , a software engineer who has written on transgender issues .
“ Now , I write under the name Carla Fong , but basically I ’m Stu in Silverton .
Honestly , it would be too much trouble to retrain the whole town . ”
Rasmussen walks down Silverton ’s Norman Rockwell - like main street in a plunging purple top revealing impressive cleavage , with a tight black miniskirt , flowing red locks and dagger - like red nails .
He is stopped every few feet by people who want to shake his hand and congratulate him on his victory , in which he took 52 % of the vote against 39 % for incumbent Mayor Ken Hector in the nonpartisan election .
“ To be perfectly candid , the incumbent . . . and I are not bosom buddies -- that was a bad choice in terms , ” deadpans Rasmussen .
“ Ken ’s heart is in the right place , but it ’s just when his mind ’s made up , that ’s it -- facts wo n’t change it .
Advertisement
“ What was it Alexis de Tocqueville said -- his mind is not like the fertile field onto which seeds fall .
Ken . . . had a council that was easy for him to get along with because , when he did n’t get his way -- well truthfully , his last name is Hector , and he just kind of lived up to it . ”
Rasmussen , who has served the last four years on the City Council , promises an era of “ reasoned discourse ” in the city “ where everybody ’s going to be participating for a change . ”
He has pledged to help control the rapid growth that has seen new homes and an industrial park spring up in this town of about 9,600 , and vowed to demand safety reviews of the dam upstream -- which he fears could fail during an earthquake and inundate the town .
Hector said that growth had slowed considerably in the last four years , and that the dam in question had been certified as being able to withstand an earthquake of 8.3 .
Advertisement
“ I grew up in Southern California , and you know as well as I do :
If you ’re in an 8.3 , you ’ve got bigger worries than just a dam breaking , ” he said .
In years past , Silverton has been known mainly as the home of Bobbie the Wonder Dog , who got lost on a road trip to Indiana in 1923 and showed up back home in Oregon six months later , apparently having walked the 2,800 miles in between .
Then there are the annual Davenport Races , in which residents propel customized couches down Main Street in honor of Homer Davenport , a political cartoonist in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , who was born just south of town .
“ I like to say we ’re 40 miles and 40 years from Portland .
Here ’s a place you dial the wrong number and you get in a conversation anyhow , ” Rasmussen says .
Advertisement
“ It ’s a bucolic little town , ” said City Manager Bryan Cosgrove .
“ We ’re doing a lot of investments in our downtown , and we have funding challenges like any other city .
As for the election , I ’ve kind of stayed out of all the publicity , because it ’s not really about the city per se ; it ’s about Stu . ”
Silverton appears to have come to terms long ago with Rasmussen ’s nebulous gender , which he describes as “ 25 % , maybe 30 % between ” man and woman , and his “ adoption of the twins , ” as the mayor - elect refers to his breast surgery .
But he still manages to catch some people off guard .
“ Guys come up to me in the bar and say , ‘ Hate to tell you this , but I saw this woman on the street the other day , and I ’m thinking , great legs , nice tan , and she turns around and I go , ‘ Oh , my God , it ’s Stu ! ’ ” Rasmussen recounts in the deep voice that seems always softened with a trace of humor .
“ If I could have a face transplant , it ’d be perfect .
A face like this , only a mother could love .
But people overlook the face now , ” he says , glancing discreetly down at his tank top , “ because there ’s all this other real estate . ”

Not long after Rasmussen debuted his new look , the City Council adopted a dress code mandating “ business casual ” at council meetings .
“ We ’re doing business for the city , and he ’s showing up in outfits that frankly were embarrassing .
. . .
Miniskirts and halter tops to a City Council meeting ?
Imagine that in Seattle or L.A. , ” Hector said .
“ When you ’re dressing , I ’m sorry , like a $ 3 hooker , it ’s disrespectful to your community . ”
“ He wanted no cleavage , no short skirts , no high heels , ” Rasmussen said , with a slight roll of the eyes .
“ He ’d made his point ; he ’d won the game .
So I just proceeded to ignore it . ”
Until he takes office in January , Rasmussen is focusing on drawing in patrons to his large , 1950s - style , 40 - foot - screen cinema with full digital sound , which at the moment is “ hemorrhaging cash . ”
He is also trying to market a coin - operated multi-player trivia game he designed for bars and restaurants .
Advertisement
Much of the rest of the time he spends with his girlfriend of 35 years , Victoria Sage , whom he describes as “ the light of my universe . ”
( The two split briefly after the breast augmentation and wardrobe change .
But Rasmussen , feeling he ’d been “ shot through the heart , ” managed to win her back . )
“ She tolerates it nicely .
She lets me be the pretty one , ” he said .
“ It ’s not her thing , but she ’s my biggest supporter , and she ’s a lovely woman . ”
Rasmussen already has earned Silverton a dubious measure of national notoriety among anti-homosexual activists .
The Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka , Kan. , known for its protests across the country targeting gays , plans to picket Monday in downtown Silverton “ to speak some words of truth to this 60 - year - old pervert , ” according to the church ’s website .
But in a part of the country where “ small town ” is often used as a synonym for redneck , Silverton appears inclined to let Stu and Victoria work out the details of their relationship as they please .

“ He ’s got a lot of supporters in this town .
He ’s super - available , and he ’s so sensible , ” said Brenda Marks , who helps run a downtown artists co-op gallery that recently sold a photo of Rasmussen decked out as Marilyn Monroe .
“ He ’s not an alarmist ; he ’s not an extremist . ”

Police managed to arrest two men suspected of murder after a teenager launched a website to find the murderers of his mother .
The young man from Great Britain was five when two unknown men murdered his mother near their home , located in Parsons Cross , Sheffield .
Now 16 , Daniel Grainger remembers very little about his mother .
After launching an Internet hunt for the killers of his mother , two men have been arrested and accused of murder .
His mother , Patricia , was sexually attacked , strangled and then stabbed when she was 25 .
Police found her body in a creek near her house under an old mattress .
It is believed that Daniel 's website whokilledmymum.com played an important role in finding the killers .
The website , which was launched two months ago , featured background of the case and several family pictures .
Over a two - month period the site was visited by 200,000 people .
On his website , Daniel asks visitors to provide any information they possess to police .
There 's also a clock that counts the days , hours , minutes and seconds since Daniel 's mother was found dead .
In addition , the boy posted links to a number of newspaper articles that were published shortly after his mother 's death and that are still being published on the case .
On October 15 , the police of South Yorkshire said that two men were being questioned on the case .
The two suspects are aged 51 and 59 .
" I 'm pleased that there has been an important development in the investigation because nothing seems to have happened for the last 11 years , " said the boy .
Currently the investigation is in its early stage and no additional details have been revealed .

ALL your hopes and dreams were shattered by bastard Americans last night , just as you suspected they always would be .
Along with six billion other humans you were forced to rethink your life plan as one set of bastards rejected a bail - out for another set of bastards because they were worried about losing their seats when a third set of bastards goes to the polls in November .
Emma Bradford , an office manager from Luton , said : " Whenever things were going well there was always this voice in the back of my mind saying , ' make the most of it because sooner or later it 's all going to be completely fucked by some bastard Americans ' .
" I just assumed I 'd be horribly maimed as a knock - on from one of their insane , catastrophic wars , but instead they have , in the most beautifully co-ordinated fashion , demolished the system that provides me with a job , a home and the vague hope that life may not an elaborate waste of time .
" I 'd applaud them , if only I was n't so weak from all the nauseating terror . "
Tom Logan , an engineer from Leeds , said : " I suppose I always knew America would eventually break the planet , like some ghastly , hyperactive toddler that gets hold of a mobile phone and then smashes it repeatedly against the edge of a table , but I never really thought it would affect me .
" But now , thanks to a combination of psychotic greed , political expediency and the sort of jaw dropping stupidity that makes you wonder if they actually know how to breathe in and out , I can look forward to a future of dysentry , burnt - out vans and an exciting range of low - fat meals , all of which – in some way or another – involve rodents . "
The Eurosceptic Czech president opposes the treaty A top Czech court has said the EU's Lisbon Treaty is compatible with the country 's constitution .
The parliament 's ratification of the controversial reform treaty was halted earlier this year pending the ruling by the Constitutional Court .
The Czech Republic is among a handful of countries that have not yet ratified the treaty .
It can not take effect unless all 27 member states do so .
The treaty was dealt a heavy blow in June , when Irish voters rejected it .
Signed in December 2007 , the treaty is aimed at streamlining decision - making in the enlarged 27 - nation EU .
Next month the Irish government is expected to present ideas for resolving the deadlock created by the Irish No vote .
The No lobby insist there can be no re-run of the June referendum and that " no means no " .
Czech President Vaclav Klaus has argued that the treaty would undermine Czech sovereignty .
The Czech court ruling on Wednesday is especially significant because the Czech Republic will take over the six - month rotating EU presidency in January .
" The Lisbon Treaty ... does not run counter to the constitutional order , " said court chairman Pavel Rychetsky .
But the treaty 's passage through the Czech parliament may not be smooth , as some Eurosceptic members of Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek 's party oppose it .
Mr Topolanek has said ratification is unlikely to be completed before next year .
The court did not consider the treaty as a whole , but only the articles disputed by critics in Mr Topolanek 's party .
The treaty was originally meant to be in place in January 2009 , well ahead of the European Parliament elections in June 2009 .
Critics see the treaty as further evidence of a federalist , pro-integration agenda at work in the EU .
They say the treaty is just a modified version of the EU constitution , rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
Even some of the architects of the defunct constitution say that the Lisbon Treaty is very similar to it .
One of them , Labour MP Gisela Stuart , says the Lisbon Treaty " is to all intents and purposes the old EU constitution under a different name " .
Poland 's President Lech Kaczynski has delayed signing the treaty until the deadlock over the Irish No vote is resolved .

In a blow to medical marijuana providers , the California Supreme Court ruled that defendants are not entitled to a defense as Prop 215 caregivers if their primary role is only to supply marijuana to patients .
Cal NORML Release - Nov. 24 , 2008 Cal Supreme Court Rules Prop 215 Caregivers Must Do More Than Just Supply MarijuanaIn a blow to medical marijuana providers , the California Supreme Court ruled that defendants are not entitled to a defense as Prop 215 caregivers if their primary role is only to supply marijuana to patients .
The court unanimously overruled an appellate court decision in the case People v Roger Mentch " , writing : " We hold that a defendant whose caregiving consisted principally of supplying marijuana and instructing on its use , and who otherwise only sporadically took some patients to medical appointments , cannot qualify as a primary caregiver under the Act and was not entitled to an instruction on the primary caregiver affirmative defense .
We further conclude that nothing in the Legislature 's subsequent 2003 Medical Marijuana Program ( Health & Saf. Code , § 11362.7 et seq. ) alters this conclusion or offers any additional defense on this record .
" Full text of the decision may be found at http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S148204.PDF
Prop 215 defines primary caregiver to be the " individual designated by the [ patient ] ... who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing , health , or safety of that person . "
According to the Court , these words " imply a caretaking relationship directed at the core survival needs of a seriously illpatient , not just one single pharmaceutical need .
" The Court concluded , " a defendant asserting primary caregiver status must prove at a minimum that he or she ( 1 ) consistently provided caregiving , ( 2 ) independent of any assistance in taking medical marijuana , ( 3 ) at or before the time he or she assumed responsibility for assisting with medical marijuana .
" The Court 's ruling effectively limits the caregiver defense to relatives , personal friends and attendants , nurses , etc .
In particular , it excludes its use by medical marijuana " buyers ' clubs , " retail dispensaries and delivery services .

Paul Ingrassia ’s essay in The Wall Street Journal takes a stab at a question which has preoccupied me for years .
How the hell did the American automotive industry , which once was the model of industrial might for the world , become a sickly embarrassment ?
Generally , blame is apportioned amongst these areas : management , labor unions , government , customers and bad luck .
Ingrassia comes down pretty hard on management , with a supporting role for the unions .
Ingrassia opens by pointing out the scant media attention paid to the opening of Honda ’s new 200k - Civics - per - year factory .
The Indiana opening stands in stark contrast to Motown automakers ’ seemingly endless factory closings and layoffs ( i.e. paying union workers not to work ) .
“ This situation does n’t stem from the recent meltdown in banking and the markets .
GM , Ford and Chrysler have been losing billions since 2005 , when the U.S. economy was still healthy .
The financial crisis does , however , greatly exacerbate Detroit ’s woes .
As car sales plunge — both in the U.S. and in Detroit ’s once - booming overseas markets — it ’s becoming nearly impossible for the companies to cut costs fast enough to keep pace with the evaporation of their revenue .
All three companies , once the very symbol of American economic might , need new capital , but their options for raising it are limited . ”
But how did we get here ?
Product is the key .
Ingrassia provides a good list of American post - war hits including the GTO , Caravan , Taurus and Explorer .
All were segment busters– and not a one of them was created in the last 17 years .
The Explorer launch of 1991 was Detroit ’s last breakthrough product .
But why ?
“ In all this lies a tale of hubris , missed opportunities , disastrous decisions and flawed leadership of almost biblical proportions .
In fact , for the last 30 years Detroit has gone astray , repented , gone astray and repented again in a cycle not unlike the Israelites in the Book of Exodus . ”
Ingrassia gives the transplants props for making allies out of their US workers .
In the 1970s , it was still popular to blame the quality problems of American cars on the workers who built them .
Honda tiptoed into these scary waters in 1979 , opening of a small motorcycle assembly plant in Ohio .
Workers were initially frustrated by their task of building a few motorcycles and then taking them back apart to evaluate quality and figure out how to make it better .
But they learned the Japanese way .
Motorcycle manufacturing proved to Honda that American workers were not the problem .
By 1982 , Honda Ohio was cranking - out new Accords .
And they never looked back .
Two years later , Toyota opened NUMMI joint venture plant in Fremont , California , which still builds Corollas , Tacomas and Pontiac Vibes .
“ Meanwhile , in the same year that Honda started building cars in Ohio , General Motors asked the UAW for wage concessions to help ease the company ’s financial straits .
But on the same day that UAW members voted approval , GM Chairman Roger B. Smith unveiled a new formula that made it easier for him and other executives to earn bonuses .
It was a historic blunder . ”
Amen to that .
Even so , those hit products of the late 1980s and the truck boom of the 1990s allowed Detroit to prosper .
But only if you measure success in terms of profits , rather than share .
Slowly , calmly , inexorably , the transplants continued eating Detroit ’s lunch .
By the beginning of the new millennium , Detroit was oblivious to the enemy within its gates .
Motown was flush with cash , embarking on a global buying spree .
“ In June 2000 , GM ’s confident new CEO , Rick Wagoner , invited journalists to a resort in Italy ’s Alpine lakes to describe a corporate future of ‘ fewer cars , more trucks , ’ as the Detroit Free Press wrote .
Ford ’s CEO Jacques
Nasser upgraded the décor on the corporate jets and removed the company ’s blue - oval logo from the outside of corporate headquarters while the Ford Taurus — once the best - selling car in America — was falling further behind the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord . ”
Easy money in trucks hid the rot within .
Who cared that the Taurus had gone from # 1 retail vehicle to rental car hell ?
One Lincoln Navigator made the profits of twenty or more Tauri .
But just a few short years later , Katrina sparked the first fuel price run-up in decades .
Not much later , the combined forces of growing demand and commodities market shenanigans sent fuel prices in a steep climb which has only recently started to turn around .
Suddenly , the truck boom went bust .
The Emperors of Detroit were revealed in all their naked glory .
( Well , at least to those outside the gates . )
Now , with gas prices are coming down , credit markets have imploded .
In these tough time , a Detroit management has long played badly with suppliers , employees and customers suddenly needs all the help it can find .
BUT you have to build strong partnerships in the good times to tap into them when the going gets tough .
Oops .
All those management bonuses for cost - cutting related profits and “ hard - headed negotiating techniques ” [ irony alert ] do n’t look so good anymore .
What now ?
Ingrassia gives a slight edge to Ford in the question of who has the best chances to make it out of the nightmare alive ; Chrysler is toast already .
GM is nearly out of cash .
Unfortunately , no one told the feds that only fools rush in .
The dramatic denouement of this sad saga– David Halberstram ’s long - predicted Reckoning , will be postponed for the forseeable future .
But no matter who– if anyone– emerges from Detroit ’s penultimate debacle , the simple truth is that Detroit has no one to blame for their plight but themselves .

Banksy pulled off an audacious stunt to produce what is believed to be his biggest work yet in central London .
The secretive graffiti artist managed to erect three storeys of scaffolding behind a security fence despite being watched by a CCTV camera .
Then , during darkness and hidden behind a sheet of polythene , he painted this comment on ' Big Brother ' society .
Scroll down for more ...
' One nation under CCTV ' : CCTV ( pictured top right ) failed to catch Banksy
Yesterday the scaffolding gang returned to remove all evidence - again without the camera operator stopping them .
The work , above a Post Office yard in Newman Street near Oxford Circus , shows a small boy , watched by a security guard , painting the words : ' One nation under CCTV . '
Andrew Newman , 35 , a businessman from Dulwich , who works locally , said : ' It was only on Sunday morning that the Post Offices guys realised what had happened . '
Firstly ,
If you are new to the world of SEO & Search Marketing , I ’d strongly advice you to read my Newbie Guide to SEO .
It has all the basic elements that you may need to get your blog / website to rank in the search engines .
In that article I briefly touched on “ finding a niche ” and “ … using keywords in Title ” and someone emailed me last week to ask – “ How to Find the Right Keyword (s ) for a Blog ? “ .
Well I basically gave her a brief answer already , but as promised I ’m covering the whole “ Keyword Research ” topic in more detail here in the blog .
If the post gets too lengthy please bear with me – I promise that by the end of the article you will become a Master of the Basics of Keyword Research & Optimization .
Before I continue , I advice you all to Subscribe to this blog ( Free ) by using the Email Subscription or RSS Subscription (.. Located on the top right hand corner of this page … ) .
The reason I want you to subscribe is , I ’ll be covering some great topics here and I do n’t really want you to miss anything !
What is Keyword Research ?
In regards to Organic / Natural / Paid Search , Keyword research basically means researching for words that are supposedly going to be used by your customers / readers / visitors to find your website / blog / business / product .
Why Is Keyword Research Important ?
Well ,
If you can know what your customer is looking for , its easy for you to sell them the right product .
If a person is looking for a Dish washer but ends up in an online tire store , he is less likely to make a purchase .
So if you are selling tires online you need to know what ‘ keywords ’ or ‘ search terms ’ searchers use to search for your product online .
For example are they searching for ‘ tires ’ or ‘ wheels ’ ?
– Car Tires <> Automobile Tiers ?
– Snow Tire <>
Winter Tire ?
– Bridgestone Tire <> Firestone Tire ?
How would you know ?
How can you differentiate between all these keywords ?
How can you tell which one is more “ important ” or better ( in terms of search volume ) .
Well all these questions can be answered when you will do a proper Keyword Research .
Now since my target audience is Bloggers & Small Business owners , I ’d like to give an example of how Keyword Research can actually help a blog to become successful .
Lets say you have a technology blog and you write about all sorts of technology news , tutorials , how - tos , tips & hacks .
You only get about 100 visitors a day and most of them are from your own community of friends .
You do n’t get any significant amount of traffic from search engines because most of the things that you write about are either “ too general or common ” ( there are thousands , if not millions of pages on the same topic ) , or you just do n’t know what people are interested in the technology arena .
You only write about things that ‘ you feel ’ is important , but not necessarily the whole blogosphere thinks the same .
So after you did some basic keyword research , you noticed that people in your area of expertise / interest are searching for the following – ( The amount of searches shown are from Google Alone !
The figure will be even bigger if you consider the other engines on the market )
facebook group – 18,000 + searches / mo
Vista
Theme for Xp – 33,100 + searches / mo
best free antivirus – 22,200 + searches / mo
backup iphone – 22,000 + searches / mo
And all these search phrases has “ minimal ” amount of competition in Paid +
Organic search .
( I ’ll write about how to determine competition later in the article ) .
Now with the above data you created few ‘ top - notch ’ blog posts ( I just made up some example titles ) -
Target Keyword : “ Facebook Group ”
– How to Join a Facebook Group ?
– How to Create a Facebook Group ?
– How to Make a Facebook Group Popular ?
Target Keyword : “ Vista Theme for Xp ”
– Top 20 Windows Vista Theme For Xp
– Beautiful Windows Vista
Theme for Windows XP
– Collection of Windows Vista
Theme for XP
Target Keyword : “ Best Free Antivirus ”
– Best Free Antivirus for Windows Vista
– Best Free Antivirus for Windows Xp
– The world ’s Best Free Antivirus Review
Target Keyword : “ backup iphone ”
– How to Backup My Iphone ?
– How to Backup your Iphone using Itunes ?
– How to Backup Iphone Data ?
– Iphone Backup Tutorial
– Free Iphone Backup Software
After writing the posts , you promoted them among your community and also via the social media and soon after they got indexed by google and some other major search engines , you got some decent ranking for some of those terms .
As a result you to get an additional 10 - 20 thousand visitors / per month from the search engines .
So from only an average of 100 visitors per day , you straight away jumped to 600 visitors per day !
Now just think what you can accomplish , if you are always doing keyword research when thinking about writing your next blog post .
How to do Keyword Research ?
Now that I have convinced you ( I hope~ ) that keyword research is very important , let me go straight to the steps that you need to perform in order to do some basic keyword research .
Step 1 : Brainstorm for Keyword Ideas & Topics
As easy and lame it may sound , the best keyword ideas can actually come from your own brain .
Because you are a human being and you would certainly know it better how another human thinks .
Try to put yourself in the shoes of a searcher and “ THINK ” , what type of queries he may use to search for ‘ things ’ that are under your hood .
Give attention to things that you yourself search for .
If it takes you little bit of ‘ extra ’ time than usual to find what you are looking for then – Wala !
You got yourself a keyword that is probably not very saturated .
Some other ways of generating keyword ideas may include :
– Looking at other blogs on your niche and tracking what they are writing about .
An easy way to do this would be to search for “ your - niche ” + blog in google and see who are ranking in the top 30 .
E.g .
If you write about gardening , you can search for gardening blog in google .
Some other nice keywords to find gardening related blogs would be to search for : gardening blog directory , blogs about gardening etc .
You can also search for “ gardening ” in the major blog directories like : BlogCatalog , MyBlogLog , BOTW , Yahoo Directory
A search for “ gardening blog ” returns over 631,000 + results
– Go to the popular Blog Search Engine & Networks like – Google Blog Search & Technorati and find out what is HOT in the blogosphere .
– Look at the respective categories in some of the big social media and bookmarking sites to find out what is popular and what is liked by the readers .
Some big social media & bookmarking sites includes : Stumbleupon , Digg , Delicious , Reddit , Mixx , Digg , Yahoo Buzz , Propeller etc .
– Go to the relevant category of some of the popular news providers and see what the media is talking about .
For example if you are have a Technology Blog , you can check out the following : e.g. Google News , Yahoo News , BBC News , MSN Tech , CNN Tech , CNET , NY Times Technology , BusinessWeek , Wired , Forbes etc .
– Go to the relevant category of some of the popular RSS aggregator portals that shows you posts of all the popular blogs in one single page .
Most of the time I use : PopUrls & Alltop .
– Look at the trends of a given topic / keyword in a trend engine like – Google Insights .
Input your term , choose a time frame of last 90 days and click on search and it will show you how popular the keyword is and most important it will also give you some related keywords at the bottom left and some raising searches at the bottom right .
For instance a search for “ Vista Themes ” shows me a nice list of some other related keywords that have good amount of searches :
– Use a Keyword Research Tool like : Google Adwords Keyword Tool , Wordtracker or SEObook Keyword Suggestion Tool .
Enter a general keyword and the system will automatically suggest you a lot of additional keyword along with the number of searches it receives every month .
For instances , I searched for “ mountain bike ” in Google ’s keyword tool and this is what I get :
Step 2 : Record Your Findings
So after going through all the various sources mentioned above , you must have gotten a hand full of keywords that you want you to optimize your site for .
But before even going into that , you should save everything that you found in a spreadsheet .
The advantages of using a spreadsheet for keyword research is just too many , but for now all you need to know that its easier to export yours keywords from a spreadsheet to external applications for further analysis and because of their structured tabular nature , its very easy to read keyword data from a spreadsheet rather than any other typical application .
Microsoft Excel is a popular choice of desktop spreadsheet application .
But my personal favourite is Google Docs and Spreadsheets .
You can also use Zoho Sheet which is very identical to MS Excel .
I have created a simple keyword research spreadsheet that you can look into and follow accordingly .
Do n’t worry about those additional columns ( Searches , Competition ) , I ’ll explain them later in the article .
Step 3 : Refine your Keyword List
Now that you have a list of keywords on your niche , you can further analyze them and bring out the cream .
So the main objective of this step is to figure out which keywords are most relevant for your blog and which are likely to bring you traffic / conversion and which keywords would be easier to rank for .
So this part will involve competitor analysis , checking for pay - per - click ads etc .
– Check for competition of each of your keyword in Google .
If a term is very competitive , it would be useless to optimize your new site / blog for that keyword because its likely to be very hard to rank well for the term .
So how do you check competition ?
Its very simple , Just go to google.com and type in your keyword in “ quotes ” and look at the number of results it returns .
Even though there is no magic number , but from my experience ( and only from my experience ) —
IF the number of results returned is less than 75,000 + , its a keyword that you can easily target with a brand new website / blog .
But of course
If you already have a reputable site with moderately high PageRank and good backlinks , you can even target a keyword that has over 500,000 + competition .
So lets check for the competition of a dummy keyword – Mountain Bike Gear .
According the Google , the keyword – Mountain Bike Gear has about 25,000 + competition thus it would be a relatively easy keyword to rank for .
Now how do we determine whether its a profitable keyword ?
Simply check the number of ads running on the right hand side of Google search when you search for “ mountain bike gear ” .
It seems like a lot of advertisers are actually paying money to show up their advertisement for this keyword so very likely its a profitable one .
But to get more accurate information , cross reference this with the result you get from Google ’s Keyword Tool .
If the keyword shows a lot of searches then definitely its a keyword that is worth ranking for .
– Complete your keyword research spreadsheet that you created in Step 2 .
Fill in the necessary columns like – searches , competition ( organic ) & competition ( paid ) .
You can always scrap out the keywords that are either too competitive or has very less amount of searches .
All keep this list up - to - date and check your rankings for these terms on a regular basis .
Step 4 : Keyword Optimization
So now that you have a list of solid keywords that you can easily rank for , you need to complete this final step which is – Keyword optimization .
Now how can you optimize your website / blog with the keywords that you just discovered ?
– Firstly , you need to determine your approach .
If you are doing this keyword research just to figure out what to write for your “ next blog post ” then apply the following :
Make sure your Post Title contains the keyword or Phrase .
The shorter the title the better
Try to mention the keyword at least once within the opening of your article ( first paragraph )
Do n’t stuff your article with the keyword (s ) – instead use synonyms and other keyword variations ( e.g. PS3 / Play Station 3 / Sony PS3 / Sony Play Station 3 – All refers to the same thing )
stuff your article with the keyword (s ) – instead use synonyms and other keyword variations ( e.g. PS3 / Play Station 3 / Sony PS3 / Sony Play Station 3 – All refers to the same thing )
If you add a relevant picture , make sure the picture “ title ” and “ alt ” tags have your keyword .
Add unique Meta Description for your Posts .
Include a short keyword rich opening of your article within 160 char or less .
– If the sole purpose of this Keyword Research was to find a niche for your new online business or blog then do all of the above and in addition do the following :
Make sure your site ’s title has your main keywords .
Do n’t stuff too many keywords !
Write a unique keyword rich meta description for your site
Add a lot of relevant categories on your site that can target each of your main keywords individually .
Make sure all the category pages has it ’s keyword title properly written
Start adding unique and useful content that are keyword optimized in all those respective categories
You have Now Mastered the Basics of Keyword Research & Optimization !
Yes finally , we have come to an end .
I know this post has been really very long and I actually wanted to break the whole post in smaller parts .
But I realized for any newcomer to the SEO world , it would be better if I put up everything in one place for easy referencing .
This is by no means a complete keyword research guide , but I believe this tutorial teaches you all the basics that you need to learn to start Keyword Research & Optimization .
There are lots of advanced stuffs that I plan to release later this month .
If you have any questions , dobuts or feedback , I ’d appreciate if you shoot them in comments .

Customer : “ Well , these movies are n’t working .
They are all scratched . ”
Me : “ Sorry about that .
Pick whatever you want and I ’ll exchange them . ”
Customer : “ Thank you . ”
( A few minutes later , a big , flannel clad man walks in . )
Customer ’s husband : “ My wife was just in here for half an hour ! ”
Me : “ I ’m sorry about that … ” * explains situation *
Customer ’s husband : “ I do n’t care !
You need to have more than one register open !
Where is your manager ? ! ”
Me : “ He is in the back .
We were suppose to close 45 minutes ago which is why I ’m the only one on the register . ”
Customer ’s husband : “ You idiot !
I need to see him now ! ”
Me : “ He ’ll be here … now calm down ! ”
Customer ’s husband : “ YOU MADE MY PREGNANT WIFE STAND IN LINE FOR HALF AN HOUR ! ”
Me : “ Well , sir … maybe you should have been a man and came in here instead of your wife . ”
Customer ’s husband : * speechless *
( My manager had to pretend to fire me in front of him , but we later joked about him in the back room . )

OBAMA & SCARY REVERSE SPEECH MESSAGES

OBAMA & SCARY REVERSE SPEECH MESSAGES
In the 1990s reverse speech analysis was discovered by David John Oats , a Nobel Laureate nominee for this discovery .
The process is simple .
When our forward speech is played in reverse at certain cyclic intervals our subconscience speaks in a discernable forward audible language .
This hidden speech is always truthful ; it is NEVER a lie .
It reveals the true concealed feelings and intent of the individual despite the incongruent and masking surface message being communicated in the forward speech .
In cases of the following example of a composed song , it goes beyond the individual and involves forces of influence outside the carnal mind and affecting the creative orchestration and final outcome .
Barack Obama - Reverse Speech Technology with YES WE CAN Song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMOpw3GY0Rk
Some hidden messages in the song :
SATAN HIM SATAN HERES THE ANNOUNCEMENT , HES OUR SOUL KRIST ( CHRIST ) [ i.e. False Christ & False Messiah ]
THE WORLD WILL FEAR TILL THE ENDS UP THE WORLD WILL SMOKE WORLD WAR III WAR
Inside the mind of Barack Obama with Reverse speech http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrgjDVhwoXM
Some hidden messages :
Health care speech : THIS HAS TO DAMN YOU ( Obamas health care plan will be a genocidal plan & genocidal bureaucracy ) Education speech : I FLASH , YOU BETTER FEEL ( sexual overture ) Political speech : PASS THAT THRONE ( Oval Office / Messianic quest ) Patriotic speech : BUT YOU F*CK IT UP
Barack Obama Speech Reversals - People Fainting http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daylkziIEYE...feature=related
The strangest messages of all are featured in this set :
WHAT SAY ANIMUS .
THATS THY ANIMUS .
I AM FORGIVENESS .
ANIMUS NAMES ME I CAN ALMOST HEAR MYSELF MISLEADING MARRY MY DEED .
I MUST SAVE YOU
NOTE :  Animus is an angry evil spirit , a demon , that has impregnated Obama ( HIS ANIMUS ) and is his true self , being the definition of animus in Jungian psychology .
Some people have witnessed this demonic spirit physically manifest in Obamas face , as I did so in early April of this year when Obamas face on the TV news morphed into a raging demon and then transformed back to his normal visage .
This was Animus .

In Dec. , 2007 , Donald Young , Choirmaster at Obamas church , was murdered .

Was it a hired assassination to extinguish , silence and conceal from the public Obamas homosexual history and activities on the threshold of possibly becoming President of the United States ?

They may have been the most disastrous dreamers , the most reckless gamblers , and the most vigorous imperial hucksters and grifters in our history .
Selling was their passion .
And they were classic American salesmen  if you ’re talking about underwater land in Florida , or the Brooklyn Bridge , or three - card monte , or bizarre visions of Iraqi unmanned aerial vehicles armed with chemical and biological weaponry let loose over the U.S. , or Saddam Hussein ’s mushroom clouds rising over American cities , or a full - scale reordering of the Middle East to our taste , or simply eternal global dominance .
When historians look back , it will be far clearer that the “ commander in chief ” of a “ wartime ” country and his top officials were focused , first and foremost , not on the shifting “ central theaters ” of the Global War on Terror , but on the theater that mattered most to them  the “ home front , ” where they spent inordinate amounts of time selling the American people a bill of goods .
Of his timing in ramping up a campaign to invade Iraq in September 2002 , White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card infamously explained : “ From a marketing point of view , you do n’t introduce new products in August . ”
Indeed .
From a White House where “ victory strategies ” meant purely for domestic consumption poured out , to the Pentagon where bevies of generals , admirals , and other high officers were constantly being mustered , not to lead armies but to lead public opinion , their selling focus was total .
They were always releasing “ new product . ”
And do n’t forget their own set of soaring inside - the - Beltway fantasies .
After all , if a salesman is going to sell you some defective product , it always helps if he can sell himself on it first .
And on this score , they were world champs .
Because events made it look so foolish , the phrase “ shock and awe ” that went with the initial attack on Iraq in March 2003 has now passed out of official language and ( together with “ mission accomplished ” ) into the annals of irony .
Back then , though , as bombs and missiles blew up parts of Baghdad  to fabulous visual effect in that other “ theater ” of war , television  the phrase was constantly on official lips and in media reports everywhere .
It went hand - in - glove with another curious political phrase : regime change .
Given the supposed unique technological proficiency of the U.S. military and its array of “ precision ” weapons , the warriors of Bushworld convinced themselves that a new era in military affairs had truly dawned .
An enemy “ regime ” could now be taken out  quite literally and with surgical precision , in its bedrooms , conference rooms , and offices , thanks to those precision weapons delivered long - distance from ship or plane  without taking out a country .
Poof !
You only had to say the word and an oppressive regime would be , as it was termed , “ decapitated . ”
Its people would then welcome with open arms relatively small numbers of American troops as liberators .
It all sounded so good , and high tech , and relatively simple , and casualty averse , and clean as a whistle .
Even better , once there had been such a demonstration , a guaranteed “ cakewalk ”  as , say , in Iraq  who would ever dare stand up to American power again ?
Not only would one hated enemy dictator be dispatched to the dustbin of history , but evildoers everywhere , fearing the Bush equivalent of the wrath of Khan , would be shock - and - awed into submission or quickly dispatched in their own right .
In reality ( ah , “ reality ”  what a nasty word ! ) , the shock - and - awe attacks used on Iraq got not a single leader of the Saddamist regime , not one of that pack of 52 cards ( including of course the ace of spades , Saddam Hussein , found in his “ spiderhole ” so many months later ) .
Iraqi civilians were the ones killed in that precise and shocking moment , while Iraqi society was set on the road to destruction , and the world was not awed .
Strangely enough , though , the phrase , once reversed , proved applicable to the Bush administration ’s seven - year post - 9/11 history .
They were , in a sense , the awe - and - shock administration .
Initially , they were awed by the supposedly singular power of the American military to dominate and transform the planet ; then , they were continually shocked and disbelieving when that same military , despite its massive destructive power , turned out to be incapable of doing so , or even of handling two ragtag insurgencies in two weakened countries , one of which , Afghanistan , was among the poorest and least technologically advanced on the planet .
The Theater of War
In remarkably short order , historically speaking , the administration ’s soaring imperial fantasies turned into planetary nightmares .
After 9/11 , of course , George W. and crew promised Americans the global equivalent  and Republicans the domestic equivalent  of a 36,000 stock market and we know just where the stock market is today : only about 27,000 points short of that irreality .
Once upon a time , they really did think that , via the U.S. armed forces , or , as George W. Bush once so breathlessly put it , “ the greatest force for human liberation the world has ever known , ” they could dominate the planet without significant help from allies or international institutions of any sort .
Who else had a shot at it ?
In the post - Soviet world , who but a leadership backed by the full force of the U.S. military could possibly be a contender for the leading role in this epic movie ?
Who else could even turn out for a casting call ?
Impoverished Russia ?
China , still rebuilding its military and back then considered to have a host of potential problems ?
A bunch of terrorists ?
I mean come on !
As they saw it , the situation was pretty basic .
In fact , it gave the phrase “ power politics ” real meaning .
After all , they had in their hands the reins attached to the sole superpower on this small orb .
And was n’t everyone  at least , everyone they cared to listen to , at least Charles Krauthammer and the editorial page of the Washington Post  saying no less ?
I mean , what else would you do , if you suddenly , almost miraculously ( after an election improbably settled by the Supreme Court ) , found yourself in sole command of the globe ’s only “ hyperpower , ” the only sheriff on planet Earth , the New Rome .
To make matters more delicious , in terms of getting just what you wanted , those hands were on those reins right after “ the Pearl Harbor of the twenty - first century , ” when Americans were shocked and awed and terrified enough that anything - goes seemed a reasonable response ?
It might have gone to anyone ’s head in imperial Washington at that moment , but it went to their heads in such a striking way .
After all , theirs was a plan  labeled in 2002 the Bush Doctrine  of global domination conceptually so un-American that , in my childhood , the only place you would have heard it was in the mouths of the most evil , snickering imperial Japanese , Nazi , or Soviet on - screen villains .
And yet , in their moment of moments , it just rolled right out of their heads and off their tongues  and they were proud of it .
Here ’s a question for 2009 you do n’t have to answer :
What should the former “ new Rome ” be called now ?
That will , of course , be someone else ’s problem .
The Cast of Characters
And what a debacle the Bush Doctrine proved to be .
What a legacy the legacy president and his pals are leaving behind .
A wrecked economy , deflated global stock markets , collapsing banks and financial institutions , soaring unemployment , a smashed Republican Party , a bloated Pentagon overseeing a strained , overstretched military , mired in an incoherent set of still - expanding wars gone sour , a network of secret prisons , as well as Guantanamo , that “ jewel in the crown ” of Bush ’s Bermuda Triangle of injustice , and all the grim practices that went with those offshore prisons , including widespread torture and abuse , kidnapping , assassination , and the disappearing of prisoners ( once associated only with South America dictatorships and military juntas ) .
They headed a government that could n’t shoot straight or plan ahead or do anything halfway effectively , an administration that emphasized “ defense ”  or “ homeland security ” as it came to be called in their years  above all else ; yet they were always readying themselves for the last battle , and so were caught utterly , embarrassingly unready for 19 terrorists with box-cutters , a hurricane named Katrina , and an arcane set of Wall Street derivatives heading south .
As the supposed party of small government , they succeeded mainly in strangling civilian services , privatizing government operations into the hands of crony corporations , and bulking up state power in a massive way  making an already vast intelligence apparatus yet larger and more labyrinthine , expanding spying and surveillance of every kind , raising secrecy to a first principle , establishing a new U.S. military command for North America , endorsing a massive Pentagon buildup , establishing a second Defense Department labeled the Department of Homeland Security with its own mini-homeland - security - industrial complex , evading checks and powers in the Constitution whenever possible , and claiming new powers for a “ unitary executive ” commander - in - chief presidency .
No summary can quite do justice to what the administration “ accomplished ” in these years .
If there was , however , a single quote from the world of George W. Bush that caught the deepest nature of the president and his core followers , it was offered by an “ unnamed administration official ”  often assumed to be Karl Rove  to journalist Ron Suskind back in October 2004 :
“ He ] said that guys like me were ‘ in what we call the reality - based community , ’ which he defined as people who ‘ believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . ’
I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism .
He cut me off .
‘ That ’s not the way the world really works anymore , ’ he continued .
‘ We ’re an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you ’re studying that reality  judiciously , as you will  we ’ll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that ’s how things will sort out .
We ’re history ’s actors and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . ' ”
“ We create our own reality .
We ’re history ’s actors . ”
It must for years have seemed that way , and everything about the lives they lived only reinforced that impression .
After all , the president himself , as so many wrote , lived in a literal bubble world .
Those who met him were carefully vetted ; audiences were screened so that no one who did n’t fawn over him got near him ; and when he traveled through foreign cities , they were cleared of life , turned into the equivalent of Potemkin villages , while he and his many armored cars and Blackhawk helicopters , his huge contingent of Secret Service agents and White House aides , his sniffer dogs and military sharpshooters , his chefs and who knows what else passed through .
Of course , the president had been in a close race with the reality principle ( which , in his case , was the principle of failure ) all his life  and whenever reality nipped at his heels , his father ’s boys stepped in and whisked him off stage .
He got by at his prep school , Andover , and then at Yale , a C - level legacy student and , appropriately enough when it came to sports , a cheerleader and , at Yale , a party animal as well as the president of the hardest - drinking fraternity on campus .
He was there in the first place only because of who he was n’t ( or rather who his relations were ) .
Faced with the crises of the Vietnam era , he joined the Texas Air National Guard and more or less went missing in action .
Faced with life , he became a drunk .
Faced with business , he failed repeatedly and yet , thanks to his dad ’s friends , became a multi-millionaire in the process .
He was supported , cosseted , encouraged , and finally  to use an omnipresent word of our moment  bailed out .
The first MBA president was a business bust .
A certain well - honed , homey congeniality got him to the governorship and then to the presidency of the United States without real accomplishments .
If there ever was a case for not voting for the guy you ’d most like to “ have a beer with , ” this was it .
On that pile of rubble at Ground Zero on Sept. 14 , 2001 , with a bullhorn in his hands and various rescuers shouting , “ USA ! USA ! ” he genuinely found his “ calling ” as the country ’s cheerleader in chief ( as he had evidently found his religious calling earlier in life ) .
He not only took the job seriously , he visibly loved it .
He took a childlike pleasure in being in the “ theater ” of war .
He was thrilled when some of the soldiers who captured Saddam Hussein in that “ spiderhole ” later presented him with the dictator ’s pistol .
( “ ‘ He really liked showing it off , ’ says a visitor to the White House who has seen the gun .
‘ He was really proud of it . ' ” )
He was similarly thrilled , on a trip to Baghdad in 2007 , to meet the American pilot “ whose plane ’s missiles killed Iraq ’s al - Qaeda leader , Abu Musab al - Zarqawi ” and “ returned to Washington in a buoyant mood . ”
While transforming himself into the national cheerleader in chief , he even kept “ his own personal scorecard for the war ” in a desk drawer in the Oval Office  photos with brief biographies and personality sketches of leading al - Qaeda figures , whose faces could be satisfyingly crossed out when killed or captured .
He clearly adored it when he got to dress up , whether in a flight suit landing on the deck of an aircraft carrier in May 2003 , or in front of hoo - aahing crowds of soldiers wearing a specially tailored military - style jacket with “ George W. Bush , Commander In Chief ” hand - stitched across the heart .
As earlier in life , he was supported ( Karl Rove ) , enabled ( Condoleezza Rice ) , cosseted ( various officials ) , and so became “ the decider , ” a willing figurehead ( as he had been , for instance , when he was an “ owner ” of the Texas Rangers ) , manipulated by his co-president Dick Cheney .
In these surroundings , he was able to take war play to an imperial level .
In the end , however , this act of his life , too , could lead nowhere but to failure .
As it happened , reality possessed its own set of shock - and - awe weaponry .
Above all , reality was unimpressed with history ’s self - proclaimed “ actors , ” working so hard on the global stage to create their own reality .
When it came to who really owned what , it turned out that reality owned the works and that possession was indeed nine - tenths of one law that even George Bush ’s handlers and his fervent neocon followers could n’t suspend .
Exit Stage Right
The results were sadly predictable .
The bubble world of George W. Bush was bound to be burst .
Based on fantasies , false promises , lies , and bait - and - switch tactics , it was destined for foreclosure .
At home and abroad , after all , it had been created using the equivalent of subprime mortgages , and the result , unsurprisingly , was a dismally subprime administration .
Now , of course , the bill collector is at the door and the property  the USA  is worth a good deal less than on Nov. 4 , 2000 .
George W. Bush is a discredited president ; his job approval ratings could hardly be lower ; his bubble world gone bust .
Nonetheless , let ’s remember one other theme of his previous life .
Whatever his failures , Bush always walked away from disastrous dealings enriched , while others were left holding the bag .
Do n’t imagine for a second that the equivalent is n’t about to repeat itself .
He will leave a country functionally under the gun of foreclosure , a world far more aflame and dangerous than the one he faced on entering the Oval Office .
But he wo n’t suffer .
He will have his new house in Dallas ( not to speak of the “ ranch ” in Crawford ) and his more than $ 200 million presidential “ library ” and “ freedom institute ” at Southern Methodist University ; and then there ’s always that 20 percent of America  they know who they are  who think his presidency was the greatest thing since sliced bread .
Believe me , 20 percent of America is more than enough to pony up spectacular sums , once Bush takes to the talk circuit .
As the president himself put it enthusiastically , ” ‘ I ’ll give some speeches , just to replenish the ol’ coffers . ’
With assets that have been estimated as high as nearly $ 21 million , Mr. Bush added , ‘ I do n’t know what my dad gets  it ’s more than 50 - 75 ’ thousand dollars a speech , and ‘ Clinton ’s making a lot of money . ' ”
This is how a legacy - student - turned - president fails upward .
Every disaster leaves him better off .
The same ca n’t be said for the country or the world , saddled with his “ legacy . ”
Still , his administration has been foreclosed .
Perhaps there ’s ignominy in that .
Now , the rest of us need to get out the brooms and start sweeping the stables .

My fellow Americans : With the November election just around the corner and both campaigns ramping up their rhetoric , there 's been a lot of talk in the media about the candidates , their qualifications ( or lack thereof ) , and what they might look like naked .
That 's all well and good - spirited discourse about prominent politicians ' genitalia is essential to a healthy democracy - but with all this talk about Obama , McCain , Sarah Palin and ( to a lesser extent ) Joe Biden , I can't help but feel that someone has been left out of the national dialogue .
I 'm talking , of course , about me , Ross Wolinsky .
I might not be a " Kennedyesque " senator with a gift for oration , nor have I ever been tortured as a POW in Hanoi ( I do n't even know what Hanoi is ! ) , but let me be clear : I , Ross Wolinsky , am going to be the next President of the United States .
Now I know what you 're thinking :
Who is this Ross Wolinsky fella , and why in the name of Krokus should I vote for him ?
What 's the Great Pizza Basket , and are those stink lines coming off of Florida ?
My agenda might be a little bit different than the other candidates ' , but that 's probably because I 'm not like the other candidates .
Let 's get into it , shall we ?
HOMELAND SECURITY
We live in troubled times , and the war we are waging against terrorists abroad will be our legacy for generations to come .
They hate us for our freedom , and they want to kill our pets and grandparents .
It 's no surprise that homeland security is on the minds of millions of Americans - we love our pets and grandparents .
That 's what America is all about .
Barack Obama wants to " base homeland security spending on risk rather than pork - barrel politics . "
John McCain says that " the highest priority for any President is protecting the lives of American citizens . "
This is spooky : A group of journalism students from City University of New York filed a Freedom of Information request and discovered that the FBI tracked the late Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist David Halberstam for more than two decades .
AP via Google News :
The FBI monitored Halberstam ’s reporting , and at times his personal life , from at least the mid-1960s until at least the late ’ 80s , the documents show .
The agency released only 62 pages of a 98 - page dossier on the writer , citing security , privacy and other reasons .
Halberstam won a Pulitzer in 1964 for his coverage of the Vietnam War while working as a reporter for The New York Times .
In 1972 , he wrote “ The Best and the Brightest , ” a best - selling book critical of U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia .
It ’s unclear when the FBI began monitoring Halberstam , though the first documents made public date from 1965 , when he was a Times correspondent in Poland during the Cold War .

To be is to be something as opposed to nothing , and to be something is to be something specific .
If a god is to have any characteristics ( which it must to exist ) , these characteristics must be specific - but to assign definite attributes , to say that a being is this as opposed to that , is to limit the capacities of that being and to subject it to the uniformity imposed by those capacities .
A supernatural being , if it is to differ in kind from natural existence , must exist without a limited nature - which amounts to existing without any nature at all ( p. 41 ) .
Theist : " I believe in god . "
Atheist : " What is ' god ' ? "
Theist : " I do n't know . "
Atheist : " But what is it that you believe in ? "
Theist : " I do n't know that either . "
I was rereading a portion of 's excellent Atheism :
The case against God recently and found a part I 'd like to summarize for the reader .
It deals with a core aspect of what many atheists ( this one included ) believe , namely that the god of the major monotheistic religions is logically impossible .
In a nutshell , Smith suggests that " ... the entire notion of a supernatural being is incomprehensible " because nothing can exist apart from that which exists naturally .
The theist who is not ready to concede defeat has one obvious place of retreat .
He or she will claim that his or her god is .
Of course !
Theists make this claim all the time .
Their god is not merely unknown in the present time but unknowable in principle .
The human mind simply cannot comprehend their god .
As Smith suggests , this shifts the discussion away from metaphysics and back to epistemology .
However , before making this shift , it is important to understand that the theist is now admitting that his or her god ( and any other supernatural entity ) is beyond comprehension of the human mind .
Is this really what theists believe ?
Perhaps it gets them around the many metaphysical problems with their god , but it may well come back to haunt them .
How might the concession that their god is unknowable haunt the theist ?
Consider the following dialogue which Smith provides :
The hole into which the theist has dug himself / herself should now be apparent .
The theistic belief claim ( i.e. , god exists ) has been effectively neutered and is now thoroughly void of meaning .
Update : Ashley Todd perpetrated a hoax .
We have that in a separate post by Allahpundit .
Be sure to read that in detail , but my overall reaction is that Todd is a very , very disturbed young woman .
— Ed
Original post :
A 20 - year - old woman got robbed at an ATM in a Pittsburgh suburb , and normally that would not make national news .
However , her robber wanted to make a political statement as well .
After seeing a McCain bumper sticker on her car , he beat the woman and scratched a “ B ” into her face :
A 20 - year - old woman who was robbed at an ATM in Bloomfield was also maimed by her attacker , police said .
Pittsburgh police spokeswoman Diane Richard tells Channel 4 Action News that the victim was robbed at knifepoint on Wednesday night outside of a Citizens Bank near Liberty Avenue and Pearl Street just before 9 p.m.
Richard said the robber took $ 60 from the woman , then became angry when he saw a McCain bumper sticker on the victim ’s car .
The attacker then punched and kicked the victim , before using the knife to scratch the letter “ B ” into her face , Richard said .
This is a horrible story , and if it happened as alleged , I hope the man gets life in prison for both the armed robbery and the maiming .
Our prayers go to the woman , who refused medical treatment at the scene , as well as our hopes for a quick and complete recovery .
However , despite the comments popping up in other threads , I do n’t think this says anything terribly significant about the election or either candidate .
Criminals are n’t known for their kindness , temperament , or intellect , and this particular criminal sounds like he ’s a couple of bricks short of a load even for that crowd .
The initial crime had nothing to do with politics at all , so it ’s not an example of partisan thuggery as one would expect some to paint it .
I ’m sure that the two campaigns will be sure to reach out to the woman .
Someone will undoubtedly press the Obama campaign for a reaction , and will get the obligatory and emphatic denunciation that everyone would expect .
We have many more important issues to debate , and many more cogent reasons to oppose Barack Obama than the offhand cruelty of one criminal in Pittsburgh .
Update ( AP ) : Good points from Ace .
I notice that Drudge has quietly moved the story from blaring red - font banner to upper - lefthand teaser .
Update II ( Ed ) :
The woman who was attacked has identified herself as Ashley Todd , who is a College Republican field representative .
Here ’s the photo :
It looks like Ashley did get beaten pretty badly , and she does have a ‘ B ’ scratched into her cheek .
It ’s not a rumor .
Hopefully , we ’ll get more from the local media as the story develops , or from Ashley herself .
Update III : I agree with people in the comments who say that the beating and maiming were political , and obviously so .
Ashley would n’t have that wound on her face otherwise .
What I am saying is that it ’s unfair to generalize about Obama supporters based on the actions of one nut .
I would also agree , though , that the media did n’t have any problems doing the same thing to the McCain campaign based on one comment allegedly yelled at a rally , and for that matter , neither did Barack Obama during the last debate .
Update IV : Let ’s remember that Bill Gwatney got shot to death in an Arkansas Democratic HQ in June .
It ’s dangerous to generalize on partisan lines when discussing one disturbing act of violence .
Update V : Some people are already saying “ hoax ” ; I think that ’s unlikely ( but still possible ) .
Thanks to the local news report , we know the attack occurred .
Not too many young women would scar their faces just to create a political hoax .
As for the reversed / upside - down B , all I can tell you is that I got this from a source close to Ashley , who assured me that she wanted to go public ( it was also on her Twitter page ) and that the photo came directly from her .
It could have gotten reversed on the computer , or the attacker may have had her on the ground with her head upside - down in relation to his .
Update VI : Here ’s a video report on the attack from KDKA - TV ( via the Newsbusters ) .
Update VII : I spoke with two executives at the College Republicans on the record about this story .
Charlie Smith , the National Chair , and Ethan Eilon , the Executive Director , both say the photo is legitimate and that it came from Ashley Todd , the victim in this case .
The attack began at 8:50 pm ET and Ashley called the police at 9:30 PM ET .
Initially , she was robbed , ran away after the robbery , and the robber followed her to her car .
At that point , he became enraged at the bumper sticker and began beating her and scratched the ‘ B ’ into her face .
Ashley went to the hospital early this morning after initially refusing medical attention last night , and had an MRI and / or a CAT scan .
Doctors believe her cheek will heal fully .
Eilon spoke with her personally today about the incident and confirmed the above with me .
He first met Ashley in June , when she came to DC for training with the College Republicans .
She works for them as a contract employee .
She does not work for the McCain campaign .
Both Eilon and Smith expressed revulsion over an attack on a young woman just getting involved in politics , but they consider this the act of a lone lunatic .
I ’m not going to blame people for keeping a healthy skepticism on this case , but so far , the two media reports appear to check out .
Update VIII : The police want to administer a polygraph :
Police planned to administer a polygraph test to Ashley Todd , 20 , because her statements about the attack conflict with evidence from the Citizens Bank ATM where she claims the incident occurred , police said .
But :
“ We are treating this as a credible report , ” he said .
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof .
- video encodings still in process -
Pamela Kurstin , a theremin virtuoso , plays " " Autumn Leaves . "
Wait till 2:30 when she kicks in the bass line .
RubyEncoder allows to protect Ruby and Ruby on Rails files by compiling and encrypting them .
The encoded scripts are then run by RubyEncoder 's loader .
RubyEncoder is developed by Inovica Ltd , which also created a smiliar tool for PHP : SourceGuardian .
RubyEncoder can also be used to only partly protect a project , allowing plaintext Ruby and configuration files ; or to limit an application to a certain host or only for a limited time period to create a trial version ( more scenarios can be found in the RubyEncoder FAQ section ) .
InfoQ talked to Alexander Belonosov RubyEncoder 's lead developer to learn more about the technical side of the project .
InfoQ : How does the encoding and the loading / running work ?
The Ruby source code is compiled into an intermediate internal format which is followed by encryption .
The original source code does not exist in protected scripts once they are encoded .
RubyEncoder Loader needs to be installed to run protected scripts .
The loader is a Ruby extension which decodes the protected script and runs it .
Protected scripts are platform independent which is very important and you may use protected scripts on any supported platforms .
Loaders differ for OS and platforms .
We support the following platforms for running RubyEncoder protected scripts - OSX , Linux , FreeBSD and we are just started Solaris x86 support .
We have plans to add support for Windows and other UNIX in the nearest future .
InfoQ : The source is translated to an intermediate format .
Do you have your own interpreter that runs it or do you restore the original Ruby source code ?
The original Ruby source code is never restored .
We use internal intermediate format . [..]
It is internal , binary , executable and never decodes back to original source code .
InfoQ :
If you have your own interpreter , how does this interact with metaprogramming and other dynamic behavior of Ruby ?
Or are there no restrictions whatsoever ?
Currently the loader passes the internal representation of the code back to Ruby for execution .
This lets us to keep maximum compatibility and a dynamic nature of the Ruby code .
But we also keep looking on other methods and possibly will change or implement a new schema in next versions of our product .
Anyway using of RubyEncoder protected products will be transparent to end -users and Ruby developers will get an updated and more effective encoder .
InfoQ : With the ParseTree gem , one can access the parse tree of a class or method .
Is this affected by RubyEncoder ?
ParseTree is a great extension for investigating internals of Ruby , code optimisation etc .
If you mean if we restrict to use ParseTree then the answer is no .
But what is important to understand when you use tools like ParseTree is what you need to extract from Ruby internals and how to find it .
I think it is also important to think of what is a reason for it , how much time will it take and what will be a final result :-)
InfoQ : Do you have plans to support other Ruby implementations , for example JRuby ?
Would it be possible to port the loader to Java to run JRuby code ?
Currently we support only standard Ruby .
JRuby is great project and it is growing .
Although it has a bit different market .
InfoQ : Using JRuby and compiled Ruby sources , would ByteCode obfuscation lead to the same protection that RubyEncoder provides ?
Using JRuby and compiled Ruby sources may produce a very good level of protection .
But it is oriented for a Java environment .
Our aim is to protect native Ruby and Ruby - on - Rails project initially and we may decide to look at enhancing or expanding the product later .
InfoQ : In what language is RubyEncoder written ?
Using Ruby and then self - encoded ?
No , I have nothing bad to say about Ruby meta programming :-)
But RubyEncoder and the loaders are written in C .
RubyEncoder is a commercial product , there 's also a 30 days trial version available .
Have you ever used such a code protection tool ?
What were your experiences with it ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices plummeted Friday , erasing the previous session 's spike , as the dollar strengthened and investors worried that a decline in demand will spread outside the United States .
U.S. crude for October delivery dropped $ 6.59 to settle at $ 114.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The drop in oil was the largest single - day slide in dollar terms since Jan. 17 , 1991 , when oil fell by $ 10.56 .
On that day , President George H.W. Bush withdrew oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ahead of the first Gulf War .
But in 1991 , oil was trading at just $ 32 a barrel , so the more than $ 10 slide in dollar terms represented a record 33 % drop .
Oil fell 5.4 % Tuesday , which does not even crack the top 50 price declines in percentage terms .
Oil 's second - largest slide on Friday comes a day after the second - largest gain on record .
Crude futures soared $ 5.62 a barrel Thursday to rise above $ 121 a barrel .
" We 're trending towards a lot of oil price volatility on the direction of the dollar , " said Peter Beutel , an oil analyst with Cameron Hanover .
" There are huge amounts of money involved , and the large moves have been based primarily on dollar strength . "
Dollar rebounds :
The dollar rose after a key measurement showed British economic growth stalled in the second quarter .
The U.K.'s gross domestic product between April and June showed zero growth , the country 's statistics office reported Friday .
The economic weakness in Britain signaled that falling demand for oil due to high fuel prices could spread to Europe , according to Kyle Cooper , director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston .
" Fewer trucks delivering packages , fewer people going to work ...
There 's a very strong correlation between GDP growth and oil usage , " said Cooper .
The U.K. report follows other reports this week showing weakness in the euro zone and Japanese economies , putting U.S. investment - and the dollar - in a more favorable light .
A stronger dollar makes crude more expensive for foreign investors , because crude futures are traded in U.S. currency .
Rising dollar values also pull investor money out of oil , since many use crude and other commodities as a hedge against inflation .
Georgia - Russia : Oil rose Thursday on tensions between NATO and Russia over the nation 's occupation of Georgia .
Georgia contains several vital pipeline links that carry crude oil and natural gas between Europe and Asia .
But those tensions appeared to ease Friday .
" There was the potential for some type of action across the Georgian border and we just have n't seen anything , " said Neal Dingmann , senior energy analyst with Dahlman Rose & Co .
Also easing supply worries , a BP - led consortium prepared to resume oil flow through the region 's Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline , a major oil link between Turkey and the Caspian Sea .
" We 're still integrity testing , " said BP spokesman Toby Odone , " We expect it will be back in normal operation next week . "
U.S. gasoline demand : Falling demand for petroleum - based fuels in the United States has been the main force behind oil 's fall from a record high of $ 147.27 in mid-July .
Demand for gasoline last week was about 9.5 million barrels a day , or 1.6 % lower than it was last year , according to an Energy Department inventory report released Wednesday .
Drivers were also spending less time on the road in June , according to a second report from the Transportation Department last week .
Drivers will even cut back over the Labor Day weekend , according to a projection from motorist group AAA .
The number of travelers avoiding cars and air travel , and using buses , trains , or other transportation will increase by 12.5 % this year , AAA said .
National gasoline prices are down more than 42 cents a gallon from the record high set last month , according to the AAA 's daily survey of service stations , falling below $ 3.70 a gallon .
“ Hey , Mark ! ” taunted my right - wing brother - in - law .
“ Who ya gonna vote for in the election ? ”
Dolton was seated opposite me at my parents ’ golden wedding anniversary celebration .
Why , oh why , had n’t they gotten divorced at some point ?
Teeth gritted , I plunged .
“ What makes you think there ’ll be one ? ”
“ Told ya ! ” he cackled to my sister Apolitica as he jabbed her , hard , in the ribs .
As much as I loved her , she ’d forfeited all potential sympathy years back with two words : “ I do . ”
Her beloved was just warming up .
“ I suppose now , Mark , you ’re gonna lecture us about rigged voting .
Hey , little Dolt , ” he snorted to my unfortunate ten - year - old nephew sitting beside him , “ seen yer uncle ’s tinfoil hat lyin ’ around anywhere ? ”
“ Though America ’s fixed elections are certainly a worthy topic , ” I replied evenly , “ I ’m not talking about that .
I ’m referring to all the executive orders and legislation your heroes in the White House have put in place that make it a cinch , if they so choose , to declare martial law , lock up dissenters and thus dispense with even faux balloting . ”
He looked puzzled .
“ Who ’d wanna vote for their enemies ? ”
“ What ? ”
“ ‘ Foe balloting . ’
That makes no sense . ”
He had me there .
I flashed my sister a quick look but she was already slinking away , dragging a bewildered Dolton , Jr. , behind her while I calculated the odds of successfully performing hari - kari with a cocktail weenie pick .
“ Besides just being plain crazy , ” Dolt pressed , “ there ’s an obvious problem with your hallucination :
There ’s nowhere to house thousands of traitors .
Oh , excuse me : ‘ dissenters , ' ” he snickered .
“ Try again , ” I replied .
“ In January 2006 , Halliburton ’s then - subsidiary KBR was handed a $ 385 million government contract to , per a crowing press release , build ‘ temporary detention and processing ’ facilities … ‘ in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S. , or to support the rapid development of new programs . ' ”
“ Good ! ” he exclaimed .
“ That ’ll make those terrorists think twice about rushing the border . ”
“ You mean the hordes of Canadians breathlessly poised to overrun America with their deadly hockey sticks ? ”
“ Hockey sticks ? ? ” he gasped , horrified .
“ They really will stop at nothing ! ”
Or , perhaps I could choke myself with a dinner roll .
“ Look , Dolt , do n’t you get it ? ” I asked pointlessly .
“ Forget the ’emergency influx of immigrants ’ ruse .
What ’s this ‘ rapid development of new programs ’ ?
The swift incarceration of thousands of Americans protesting the imposition of martial law , perhaps ? ”
“ Man ! ” he guffawed .
“ You ’re even more paranoid than I thought . ”
“ I wish I were imagining things .
Unfortunately , horrors like domestic detention facilities are but one verifiable piece of an all - encompassing , all - intrusive system Bushco has methodically installed to take unchallenged control of America instantly . ”
“ Name another . ”
“ OK .
You like your co-worker Ahmed , right ? ”
“ He ’s not bad , I guess — you know , for an Iraqi .
I even loaned him five bucks the other day , ” Dolt beamed , proud of his hefty contribution toward cultural tolerance .
“ Then you ’d better hope his views of what the Bushies are doing to his country are in line with theirs .
Otherwise , under Dubya ’s executive order of July 17 , 2007 , your and Apolitica ’s property is ripe for confiscating if those five dollars are construed in any way as ‘ financial … support for ’… ‘ an act or acts of violence that have the purpose or effect of threatening the peace or stability of Iraq or the Government of Iraq , or undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq or to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people . ' ”
“ Damn , ” he mumbled .
“ I knew he looked shifty . ”
“ That ’s your concern ?
Ahmed ’s suddenly suspect appearance , rather than an insanely vague executive order ? ”
Dolt glared .
“ Your anti-Americanism , Mark , blinds you to seeing that anyone could be a terrorist .
You just never know and , unfortunately , there ’s no machine that can look into people ’s hearts . ”
“ How ’ bout under their clothes ? ”
“ Huh ? ”
“ In June , the Transportation Security Administration installed body scanner devices in ten major U.S. airports that produce , essentially , naked photographs of travelers . ”
He brightened .
“ Maybe I should call and apply as a scanner operator , heh - heh . ”
“ Knock yourself out .
Just pray TSA has n’t out - sourced its call center to , say , India , because under the new FISA bill , any message you send to , or receive from , overseas is fair game for the government , warrant or probable cause be damned .
I ’ll bet Apolitica would love to hear that tape played in court . ”
He looked around quickly .
“ Well , um , they , uh — so what ? ” he stammered .
“ No one can be arrested for what they ’re thinking . ”
“ If the pending Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention
Act becomes law , banish that thought from your mind , as well as many others . ”
I refrained from noting he had a clear leg up on the process .
“ This bill is thought - crime codified , establishing a national commission to provide ‘ legislative recommendations ’ for stopping those peskily ubiquitous homegrown terrorists from , among other things , ‘ developing and spreading within the United States ’… ‘ the use , planned use , or threatened use of force or violence by a group or individual to promote the group or individual ’s political , religious , or social beliefs . ' ”
“ What ’s wrong with that ? ”
“ Not much , I guess , other than it ’s so broadly and absurdly written that anyone at a demonstration , for example , could be deemed a terrorist . ”
“ You mean , ” he said , smiling slowly , “ like all those ones you ’ve attended ?
I think I ’ll call my senator tomorrow to push that bill .
Unlike certain America haters I know , I believe in doing everything possible to defeat evildoers . ”
“ Why wait ?
Why not instead ask your boss if he ’s one of the 23,000 FBI - deputized private industry members of ‘ InfraGard ’ who , according to Matthew Rothschild of The Progressive , preferentially ‘ receive secret warnings of terrorist threats before the public does … ’
If so , then maybe you , too , could attend InfraGard meetings like that at which one participant reported he and others were told by Homeland Security and the FBI that ‘ when — not if — martial law is declared , it was our responsibility to protect our portion of the infrastructure , and if we had to use deadly force to protect it , we could n’t be prosecuted . ’
Does that not get your attention ? ”
“ Absolutely !
It sounds like an even better gig than eyeballing nudie shots of airline passengers , uh , I mean , performing confidential inspections in the name of national security .
OK , you two , let ’s go ! ” he said to my sister and nephew returning to the table .
“ You ’re leaving ? ” Apparently , there was a God .
“ Sorry to ruin your day , but I gotta help my boss install a new grill over at The Sloppy Burger . ”
Hmm .
“ Hey , Dolt , do you think after you two hook that thing up , you ’ll eventually end up cooking burgers on it ? ”
“ Boy , you are nutty , ” he smirked .
“ Of course !
Why would anyone go to all the trouble to put something in place and then not use it ? ”
Indeed .

Many Gazans are dependent on food aid " People in Gaza are waiting in lines for almost everything , and that 's if they 're lucky enough to find something to wait for , " says Bassam Nasser , 39 .
An aid worker in Gaza City , he , like so many others there , including the UN relief agency , says living conditions are the worst he has ever seen in the strip .
" People queue for two or three hours for bread , but sometimes there 's no cooking gas or flour , so no bread .
" People wait in line for UN food handouts , but sometimes there are n't any .
The suffering is reaching every aspect of life . "
As well as working for an American development agency , Mr Nasser is a Gazan , and a father .
" I 've got three young children .
It 's difficult to explain to them that it 's not my fault we do n't have electricity and that it 's not in my control . "
' Severely stretched ' Since June 2007 , Israel has allowed little more than basic humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip .
Many there hoped that policy would change , five months ago , when Hamas and Israel agreed to a truce .
Gazans describe life under blockade
But while there were some increases in the amount of aid allowed in , Israel 's strict restrictions on the movement of goods and people into and out of Gaza largely remained .
Two weeks ago , an already fragile humanitarian situation resulting from the mounting effects of months of shortages , saw a dramatic downturn .
The fighting resumed , with an Israeli army incursion into Gaza and a retaliatory barrage of militant rocket fire .
With that , Israel all - but shut the Gaza Strip .
Although there are some goods being smuggled into Gaza through tunnels from Egypt , little else is reaching the territory .
Serious fuel shortages have led to widespread power cuts across Gaza City .
That , in turn , has caused problems in pumping water to homes , and sewage to treatment plants .
Israel is preventing many aid workers , and all journalists from entering Gaza too , so our interviews have had to be conducted over the telephone .
It 's so hard to see where the hope is , and so hard to stop these conditions breeding more hatred
Bassam Nasser , aid worker , Gaza " I never thought we would see days like this , " says Monther Shublak , head of Gaza 's water authority .
" The water system was severely stretched even before this crisis , but now , things are much worse .
" For the last four days , around 40 % of people in Gaza City have had no access to running water in their homes at all . "
" People ask me ' When will we get water ? '
I simply can't answer them , " Mr Shublak says .
" But we are putting all of our resources into sewage pumping .
The health consequences of that system totally failing are too worrying to think about , but it could happen unless things change . "
Alongside attacks by its military , Israel 's government says its Gaza closure strategy aims to deter Palestinian militants from firing rockets across the border at Israeli towns .
It also wants to choke Hamas , the Islamist faction in charge of Gaza , an enemy Israel sees as one of its most deadly .
But the rockets keep being launched and Hamas shows few signs of losing its grip on power .
Question of blame
There is much discussion among Palestinians as to why this sudden increase in pressure on Gaza is happening now .
Some say Israel is preparing for a big invasion ; others feel there is an element of political posturing ahead of an Israeli general election in February .
Guide : Gaza under blockade
Many will tell you that they feel a time of deep division in Palestinian society is being taken advantage of .
Few take Israel 's explanation , that it is only protecting its citizens from the horror of rocket attacks , at face value .
" Is n't it enough that their army kills the people who fire rockets ? " asks Mr Nasser .
" We are not responsible , so why are we all being punished ?
It makes no sense . "
He talks of the long - term impact on children in Gaza , including his own , aged six , five and two .
" It 's getting harder for us to answer our childrens ' questions about the situation , without instilling hatred in their minds about the people responsible for our suffering , " he says .
He does not just mean the Israeli government .
" People here see everyone as responsible for their miserable lives .
They see Israel closing Gaza , but they also see people around the world doing nothing .
" They see Hamas making things worse by using the blockade as an excuse not to be accountable , and they do whatever they like .
" People see the silence of the PA , [ the Fatah - dominated Palestinian government in the West Bank ] and blame them too , " he says .
" It 's so hard to see where the hope is , and so hard to stop these conditions breeding more hatred . "

The other day , I found this at WeirdStuff :
Transactor November 1987 : Volume 8 , Issue 3
( 27MB )
Click on the image above for the PDF .
It is the original scan , but it is fully searchable in your favorite PDF reader , you can extract text , and the entries in the table of contents are hyperlinks .
I know Craig Bruce has scans online , but I find searchable PDFs a lot more useful than single images on a website .
Search engines are even going to index this issue !
Some background :
The pages have been downsampled to 196 dpi ( which was the native resolution of the press ) to get rid of MoirĂŠ patterns .
The color pages have been converted into CMYK , and every channel ’s curve has been adjusted to get rid of unwanted parts of the histogram .
All images are JPEG compressed greyscale – while this is not optimal for printing ( although you can scale the images up and then convert them to B / W with quite good results ) , it looks better than monochrome / G4 in most viewers , and works well with pages that combine text and graphics .
I ’m open to input on how to improve the quality or get the size down more .
When talking about productivity , we often talk about how to do things efficiently to save time .
While doing things efficiently could save you time in the short term , you may still lose time in the long term .
The reason is that you lose more time not by how you do things but by what you do n’t do .
Not doing things efficiently could cost you hours or days , but not doing things at all could cost you months or years .
Why does it happen ?
Why do n’t people do what is right to do ?
There are three reasons for that :
They do n’t know what is right to do .
They know what is right to do but underestimate its importance .
They know it ’s important but procrastinate doing it .
In this post I will focus on the first and second reasons .
For the third reason you can read defeating procrastination habit or my review of The Now Habit .
The first and second reasons have cost me time again and again .
One example in blogging is regarding Amazon Associates program .
Since the early days of my blogging I often write about the books I read .
Some of the posts ( like 37 Lessons to Help You Live a Life that Matters and 106 Tips to Become a Master Connector ) became popular and attracted a lot of visitors .
But I did n’t know that I could earn commissions by referring people to Amazon through those post .
Only after blogging for almost one year did I realize that and join Amazon Associates .
Experiences like this teach me that to save time I need to prevent such things from happening again in the future .
I must find the right things to do and do them .
Here are some tips to save time by finding the right things to do :
1. Expand your knowledge
The first thing you should do is expanding your knowledge .
If you do n’t even know that something exists then there is nothing you can do about it .
That ’s why it ’s important that you get as many options as possible on your radar .
You can do this by regularly reading books , magazines , and blogs in your field .
You can also read materials from other fields – whether they are related or not – so that you can cross-pollinate ideas .
Of course , reading is just one way to expand knowledge .
There are other ways like watching videos , attending seminars , and joining professional organizations .
2. Write down all potential ideas
While expanding your knowledge , you will find potential ideas along the way .
Write down all of them in your idea journal .
The act of writing makes the ideas sink deeper into your mind .
You should write not only the ideas that incrementally improve your way of doing things but also the ideas that could radically change the way you do things .
I often get such ideas from unrelated fields and experiences .
3 . Take the ideas seriously
This is where I often make mistakes .
It deals with the second reason above : knowing what is right to do but underestimating its importance .
To overcome it , whenever you encounter an idea ask yourself : what if the idea is right ?
What consequences will it have on my way of doing things ?
Perhaps there is no consequences right now , but what are the potential consequences five or ten years from now ?
4 . Find the ideas that have the biggest potential regret for you
Since you have only limited resources ( whether they are time , money , or energy ) and most likely many potential ideas , you should choose only a few of them that are most promising to implement .
My favorite way of doing this is by assessing the potential regret I would have if I did n’t implement an idea .
Imagine yourself years from now looking back .
What can you potentially regret if you do n’t implement the idea ?
Questioning potential consequences as you do in # 3 should help you find the regret level you could have if you do n’t implement it .
So here is a key question to choose the few ideas to look deeper into :
Which ideas – assuming the ideas are right – could make you regret the most if you do n’t implement them ?
5. Investigate the ideas
Now that you have a few promising ideas , you should look deeper into them .
Get as much information as possible about them .
Ask or learn from people who already apply them .
Use the questions what , why , when , where , who , and how to guide your investigation :
What is the idea ?
Why should I apply the idea ?
Why is it good ?
When should I apply the idea ?
Where can I apply the idea ?
Who should apply the idea ?
To whom should the idea be applied ?
How should I apply the idea ?
If possible , find multiple viewpoints for the questions so that you get complete view of the idea .
6 . Test the most promising ideas
From your investigation you will get one or two most promising ideas .
Now what you need to do is testing them in the real world .
Apply the ideas .
Incorporate them into what you do .
Find out by yourself whether or not the ideas work .
Some of them will fail but that ’s how you improve yourself to save time in the future .
***
These tips will help you save time in the long term .
As you ’ve seen , the idea is to minimize your potential regret .
Minimizing your potential regret has nothing to do with playing safe .
Instead , it requires you to take risks here and there .

In modern days , transvestitism ( dressing as a member of the opposite sex ) has become a fairly commonplace occurrence .
But in the past it was not only frowned upon , it was often seen as sinful .
Due to laws which prevented women from performing in various parts of society , some women decided to live their lives as men .
Some had successful lives , while others suffered as a consequence .
Saint Joan of Arc dressed as a man to protect her virginity whilst living amongst soldiers and it proved to be her downfall when a kangaroo court found her guilty of heresy and executed her .
But Saint Joan was not out to deceive and her trial was overturned and her good name restored .
Unfortunately this was not true for some women in the past .
For this list I have selected women who sought to disguise their true sex completely ; that excludes the likes of George Sands who was known to be a woman and caused scandal by her transvestitism , and the female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read as their crews knew they were women .
10 Brandon Teena
Teena Brandon was born in 1972 in Lincoln , Nebraska .
As a child she was regarded as a tomboy and everyone called her Brandon .
After being sexually abused by a male relative , she moved to Richardson County , Nebraska and began to live entirely as a male .
She became friends with two ex convicts John Lotter and Marvin “ Tom ” Nissen .
She also began dating a woman ( Lana Tisdel ) .
None of her friends knew she was female .
On December 15th , Brandon was jailed for forging checks and his girlfriend , Lana , bailed him out .
Because Brandon was in the women ’s section of the prison , Lana discovered her true sex .
According to Lana she stopped “ dating ” Brandon at this time .
When Brandon ’s arrest was published in the paper under her proper name , Lotter and Nissen discovered the truth .
They raped Brandon and beat her .
Brandon went to the police but a large number of administrative errors resulted in her case not being investigated .
Eventually Lotter and Nissen would go on to shoot Brandon and two others who were hiding her .
Lotter was sentenced to death and Nissen to life imprisonment .
The story of Brandon Teena became the subject of the Academy award winning film , Boys Do n’t Cry.
Brandon is pictured above on the right .
9 James Gray
James Gray was born Hannah Snell in 1723 in Worcester , England .
As a child she played soldiers , but was otherwise seen as a normal young girl .
In 1744 she married James Summs , and two years later gave birth to a daughter .
Within a year her daughter had died and her husband had deserted her .
She borrowed a man ’s suit from her brother - in - law James Gray whose name she assumed .
She began to travel , trying to find her husband who she later discovered had been executed for murder .
She traveled to Portsmouth and joined the Royal Marines .
She was sent in to battle twice , during which time she was wounded 11 times in the legs and once in the groin .
It is not known how she concealed her sex when her groin wound was treated .
In 1750 her unit returned to England and she revealed her true sex to her shipmates .
She told her story to the papers and petitioned for a military pension which was , surprisingly , granted .
Her military service was officially recognized and she eventually opened a pub called the “ The Female Warrior ” .
She eventually remarried and had two children .
Hannah died in 1792 .
8 Petter Hagberg
Petter Hagberg ( Brita Nilsdotter ) was born in 1756 in Finnerödja , Sweden .
In 1785 she married Anders Peter Hagberg who was a soldier of the guard .
Shortly after the marriage he was called away to participate in the Russo - Swedish war ( 1788 – 1790 ) .
At a loss without her husband , Brita dressed herself as a man and enlisted in the army to find him .
She participated in the Battle of Svensksund ( pictured above ) and the Battle of Vyborg Bay as a marine .
During her time there her commanding officer called out the name “ Hagberg ” and both she and her husband stepped forward – she found him at last .
The two kept her sex a secret .
Later , at the battle of Björkö Sund , Brita was wounded and ordered below deck to have her wounds taken care of .
She went unwillingly and her sex was revealed .
After the war she was given a pension ( unheard of at the time ) and was granted a license to trade ( also unheard of for a married woman ) .
She was awarded a medal of bravery and given a military funeral .
7 Albert Cashier
Albert Cashier was born Jennie Irene Hodgers in 1843 .
In 1862 , Hodgers disguised herself as a man and enlisted in the 95th Illinois Infantry Regiment under the name Albert Cashier .
The regiment was under Ulysses S. Grant and fought in over 40 battles .
Cashier managed to remain undetected as the other soldiers thought she was just small and preferred to be alone .
Cashier was captured in battle but managed to escape back to Union lines after overpowering a guard .
She fought with the regiment through the war until 1865 .
After the war , Cashier continued to live as a male , convincing everyone around her .
For forty years Cashier worked as a church janitor , cemetery worker and street lamplighter , she voted as a man , and claimed a veterans pension .
In 1910 , she was hit by a car and broke her leg .
A doctor discovered her secret but agreed to keep quiet .
in 1911 , Cashier moved to a soldier ’s retirement home .
After her mind began to deteriorate , attendants gave her a bath and discovered her true sex .
She was forced to wear a dress from that time on .
Cashier died in 1915 and was buried in her military garb .
Her tombstone carried the words : “ Albert D. J. Cashier , Co. G , 95 Ill. Inf. ” – when she was finally traced back to Jennie Hodgers , a second tombstone was erected with both names on it .
6 Marinus
Marinus was born Marina in the 6th century .
Her father wanted to join a monastery ( Monastery of Qannoubine , in the Holy Valley , Lebanon ) so he took his daughter – disguised as a boy – with him .
Both were admitted and became monks .
After living in the monastery for a number of years , it became necessary for both father and daughter to travel .
Whilst staying at an inn , the innkeeper ’s wayward daughter was attracted to Brother Marinus and tried to seduce her .
When Marinus refused the advances , the innkeeper ’s daughter claimed that “ he ” had seduced her and she was pregnant .
Marinus refused to debunk the claims by showing that she was , in fact , female , and she was kicked out of the monastery .
She lived outside the monastery walls begging .
To make matters worse , Marinus was forced to take custody of the child and raise him .
She remained there , raising the child , performing harsh penances , and undertaking menial jobs .
It was not until her death that her sex was finally revealed .
Marinus is revered as a saint in the Roman Catholic , and Orthodox Churches .
She is known as Saint Marina the Monk .
St Marina is pictured above in red .
5 Denis Smith
Denis Smith ( Born Dorothy Lawrence ) was an English reporter who disguised herself as a man to go undercover during World War I .
Dorothy , 19 , was living in Paris and wanted to be a war reporter – something that was impossible due to her sex , and the difficulty that even males were having at the time getting to the front lines as journalists .
She persuaded two young English soldiers to give her a uniform ; she had her hair cut short in a military style , and colored her skin with diluted furniture polish to give it a bronzed look .
With forged identity papers as Private Denis Smith of the 1st Bn , Leicestershire Regiment , she cycled to the Somme – and the front lines .
A friend found her work as a Sapper with the British Expeditionary Force – laying mines under constant fire .
He also found her an abandoned cottage to sleep in at night .
After 10 days , she became worried that if her sex were discovered , the men who had helped her would be in danger .
She presented herself to the company chiefs and was placed under arrest .
She was interrogated as a spy and declared a prisoner of war .
The military were concerned that if her story got out , other women would try to enter the army in disguise .
Dorothy was compelled to sign an affidavit that she would not tell her story .
When she returned to London she was unable to work due to the affidavit .
When the war ended she wrote her story but the war office censored it and it would not come out until many years later .
In 1925 , Dorothy was institutionalized as insane and she died at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum in 1964 .
4 Malinda Blalock
Malinda Blalock was a female soldier during the American Civil War who fought bravely on both sides .
When the war started , rather than be separated from her husband Keith , she decided to disguise herself as a man and join the army too .
She was officially registered on March 20 , 1862 , as “ Samuel ‘ Sammy ’ Blalock ” – claiming to be the older brother of her husband .
Her registration papers are one of the few surviving records of female soldiers in the Civil War.
Malinda was a good soldier and her identity was never revealed .
One of the army surgeons said of her : “ She drilled and did the duties of a soldier as any other member of the Company , and was very adept at learning the manual and drill . ”
Eventually the couple deserted from the army .
3 James Barry
James Barry ( born 1792 - 1795 ) was a military surgeon in the British Army , and by the end of his career was Inspector General in charge of military hospitals .
He served in South Africa and India .
Among his accomplishments was the first successful cesarean section in Africa by a British surgeon , in which both the mother and child survived the operation .
James Barry was born Margaret Ann Bulkley and is , therefore , the first female Briton to become a qualified medical doctor .
It is believed that Bulkley took on the role of a man in order to achieve her dreams of working in medicine – a dream that could not be fulfilled if she remained a woman .
Letters reveal that there may have been a conspiracy by Barry ’s mother and uncles to get him in to medical school .
He died from dysentery July 25 , 1865 and apparently the charwoman who took care of the body , Sophia Bishop , was the first to discover his female body , and revealed the truth after the funeral .
Afterwards many people claimed to “ have known it all along ” .
The British Army sealed his records for 100 years .
James is pictured above on the left .
2 Chevalier d’Eon
Charles - Geneviève - Louis- Auguste - André-Timothée d’Éon de Beaumont ( try saying that three times fast ! ) was born in 1728 in France .
D’Eon was born a female but lived the first half of her life as a man .
D’Eon ’s autobiography states that she was raised as a boy because her father could only inherit money from his in - laws if he had a son .
As was usual for the day , because her family were nobles without a title , they styled themselves as “ Chevalier ” – meaning “ Knight ” .
In 1756 , d’Eon joined the spy service of King Louis XV and traveled on a secret mission to Russia to meet the Empress Elizabeth .
In 1761 , d’Éon returned to France .
The next year she became a captain of dragoons under the Marshal de Broglie and fought in the later stages of the Seven Years ’
War .
She was wounded and received the Order of Saint - Louis .
She was eventually granted a pension and lived in political exile in London .
As part of her negotiation with the crown of King Louis XVI , she was told she could return to France but would have to live as a woman – an offer she accepted because the King offered to pay for her new clothes .
She lived out the rest of her life as a woman .
1 Billy Tipton
Billy Tipton ( born Dorothy Lucille Tipton in 1914 ) was an American jazz pianist and saxophonist .
In 1933 , she began her career as a musician in various small Oklahoma bars .
As time passed Tipton began to associate with her father ’s name Billy and eventually she began to present herself as male by breast - binding and packing .
At first Tipton appeared male only in performances , but by 1940 she was living entirely as a male .
She ultimately gained great success as a musician and went on to record a series of very popular albums .
Tipton had a number of lesbian relationships during which he was able to keep his sex concealed .
She eventually had a long term relationship with a woman – concealing his sex the whole time – and they adopted three sons .
She was described as “ a good father who loved to go on scouting camps ” .
In 1989 , at the age of 74 , Tipton died .
It was not until then that the coroner revealed to her family and friends that she was , in fact , a woman .

Shortly after the bailout vote , a statement from the campaign of Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) blamed the loss on " the Democratic leadership : Senators [ Barack ] Obama and [ Harry ] Reid , Speaker [ Nancy ] Pelosi and others .

Here is the text of the statement :
“ From the minute John McCain suspended his campaign and arrived in Washington to address this crisis , he was attacked by the Democratic leadership : Senators Obama and Reid , Speaker Pelosi and others .
Their partisan attacks were an effort to gain political advantage during a national economic crisis .
By doing so , they put at risk the homes , livelihoods and savings of millions of American families .
“ Barack Obama failed to lead , phoned it in , attacked John McCain , and refused to even say if he supported the final bill .
“ Just before the vote , when the outcome was still in doubt , Speaker Pelosi gave a strongly worded partisan speech and poisoned the outcome .
“ This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put politics ahead of country . ” — McCain - Palin senior policy adviser Doug Holtz - Eakin
Before McCain Came To Washington , Senate Democrats Called On McCain For Leadership In Economic Crisis
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) : " We Need The Republican Nominee For President To Let Us Know Where He Stands And What We Should Do . " Reid : " We need , now , the Republicans to start producing some votes for us .

Speaker Pelosi’s Partisan Speech From Well Of House
Speaker Pelosi's Partisan Speech From The Well Of The House Of Representatives Attacking Republicans Turned Off Potential Republican Votes .
" Opponents said part of the reason for the opposition from Republicans was what they termed a partisan speech by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , said one GOP source .
' Pelosi 's partisan speech has caused our members to go berserk and may cost us any remaining chance to pass the bill , ' the source said .
Pelosi had said that Congress needed to pass the bill , even though it was an outgrowth of the ' failed economic policies ' of the last eight years .
' When was the last time someone asked you for $ 700 billion ? ' she asked .
' It is a number that is staggering , but tells us only the costs of the Bush administration 's failed economic policies — policies built on budgetary recklessness , on an anything goes mentality , with no regulation , no supervision , and no discipline in the system . ' "

He did n't use John McCain 's name , but he said things were proceeding along ' swimmingly , ' essentially .
And then he said a certain person came to Washington and then wheels fell off .
Is that an accurate description of what happened ? " Fox News ' Carl Cameron : " No .
There was n't a deal .
You first have to accept a predicate that there was an arrangement agreed to by all the necessary lawmakers and authorities — that was essentially a piece of paper and a proposal that had been discussed and agreed to buy one senate committee — that 's not the same as a deal .
A deal in budget parlance and bailout parlance requires the White House , the regulators , the House and Senate Republicans and Democrats .
And because House Republicans were not given an adequate seat at the table , Republicans had great misgivings about this — the American people have great misgivings about this — I mean 60 % and more in many polls say that the public just does n't like this . "

The latest example of the fracture within the McCain / Palin campaign came this morning when an unnamed McCain advisor called Palin , “ a whack job . ”
This comes after another member of the McCain campaign labeled her a diva who is only looking out for herself .
It seems as if Sarah is no longer McCain ’s favorite gimmick .
As was reported a couple of days ago , Palin has gone completely off message , and is now doing her own thing .
This led a McCain advisor to say , “ She is a diva .
She takes no advice from anyone .
She does not have any relationships of trust with any of us , her family or anyone else .
Also , she is playing for her own future and sees herself as the next leader of the party .
Remember : Divas trust only unto themselves , as they see themselves as the beginning and end of all wisdom . ”
Mike Allen of Politico reported the whack job comment in his column this morning , and it seems that this is the latest attempt to throw Palin under the bus , and blame her for what looks like it will be a loss to Barack Obama next week .
The truth is that the economy and George W. Bush have hurt McCain more than Palin .
A bigger problem for McCain is that his campaign has no message , except Barack Obama is bad .
Palin is the embodiment of everything that is wrong with the McCain campaign .
She is style over substance , and narrative over issues .
Advertisements
Palin ’s future in Republican politics is bright , but her future in national politics is likely non-existent .
Being able to rally the neo-con and social conservative base of the GOP is one thing , but she has already demonstrated no appeal to the Independents and conservative Democrats that the Republicans need to sway in order to win elections .
The Republican base is radical and shrinking , and the only thing certain about Sarah Palin is that she drives people away from her party .
Is Sarah Palin a whack job ?
Maybe , but it was the McCain campaign who chose to add her to the ticket .
They brought all of this on themselves .
These advisors chose a running mate without vetting her .
They did n’t sit down and talk to her to see what she knew , or if she could handle the spotlight .
All they knew was that Palin fit their narrative , which was good enough for them .
History tells us that it is tough for sitting vice presidents , much less the running mate on the losing ticket to ascend to the White House .
Usually , the running mate on the losing ticket is hurt politically by their national defeat .
Even vice presidents have trouble being elected president .
The only sitting vice president to win an election for the presidency in recent history was George H.W. Bush in 1988 .
The number two slot is not a great place to launch a national political career .
I think Palin will be back , but she has already been defined and labeled .
I suspect that Palin will fight for control of the social conservative and neo -con wings of the party , but it seems that the battle between the fiscal conservatives and the social conservatives over the future direction of the GOP has already begun .
I think Palin will probably be fighting it out with Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney for control of the party , but nationally she has been turned into a joke , and this is something that most politicians never recover from .

Today , I 'm going to wrap up the summary of the Project SocialSite Web Services that I started in Part 1 of this series .
I 'll cover the new APIs we 've added for managing Gadgets , for Messaging and for Search .
These are not quite as solid as the other services I 've covered ; they 're still in - flux and under development .
Gadget installation and management
When you add the Project SocialSite Gadetizer Widget to your site , you give your end -users get the ability to install OpenSocial Gadgets .
To support this , whe Gadgetizer Widget needs to be able to get the list of Gadgets available for install , get the list of Gadgets that each user has installed , install Gadget and uninstall Gadgets .
Since those features are no supported in the standard OpenSocial APIs , we added them as SocialSite extensions .
Below are the Gadget installation and management URIs we support ; you can probably tell that there are some missing pieces to this puzzle that we 're still working on .
Gadgets / gadgets/@all/{searchString}
Gadgets GET - all gadgets available in the system , with optional search string / gadgets/@user/{userId}/{destination}
Gadgets GET - all user 's installed gadgets , ( optionally ) within a destination / gadgets/ @user/{userId}/{destination} Gadget POST - install a gadget for user in a specific destination / gadgets / @group/{groupId}/{destination}
Gadget GET - all group 's installed gadgets , ( optionally ) within a destination
/ gadgets/@group/{groupId}/{destination}
Gadget POST - install a gadget for group in a specific destination
Messaging
Messaging is included in OpenSocial , but it did not completely meet our needs so we 're working with the OpenSocial community to adjust the specification and with the Apache Shindig community to create an open source implementation .
Here are the messaging URIs we are working on :
Messages / messages / {userId}/{box}/
Messages GET - messages for box ' inbox ' or ' outbox '
POST - to ' outbox ' to send a new message / messages / {userId}/{box}/{messageId}
Message GET - get specific message from ' inbox ' or ' outbox '
Search
And finally , there 's search .
The SocialSite Widgets must provide the ability to search people , groups and gadgets so we 've added an API for searching those as well .
Search / search / {searchString} /{type} List of Persons , Groups or Gadgets GET - search results for type gadget , group or profile
In Part 3 , I 'll cover the corresponding JavaScript APIs .
After that , in parts 4 and 5 , I 'll provide some examples that show how to use the REST , JSON - RPC and JavasScript flavors of our APIs .

India sends probe on to the Moon
The lunar surface viewed by the Moon Impact Probe on its descent India 's first unmanned lunar spacecraft , Chandrayaan 1 , has sent a probe on to the surface of the Moon .
The probe , painted with the Indian flag , crashed into the Moon 's surface at 2034 ( 1504 GMT ) , the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) said .
During its controlled plunge , it took readings including measurements of the composition of the Moon 's atmosphere .
The mission is regarded as a major step for India as it seeks to keep pace with other space - faring nations in Asia .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says the success of the mission has been hailed in India where many see it as another sign of the country 's emergence as a global power .
Video journey Earlier this week Chandrayaan 1 began orbiting the Moon some three weeks after it was launched from a space centre in southern India .
CHANDRAYAAN 1 1 - Chandrayaan Energetic Neutral Analyzer ( CENA ) 2 - Moon Impact Probe ( MIP ) 3 - Radiation Dose Monitor ( RADOM ) 4 - Terrain Mapping Camera ( TMC ) 5 - Moon Mineralogy Mapper ( M3 ) 6 - Chandrayaan 1 X-ray Spectrometer ( C1XS ) 7 - Solar Panel
India sets its sights on the Moon In Pictures : India Moon mission
The dropping of the Moon Impact Probe ( MIP ) , weighing about 30kg , concludes the first phase of the mission .
" During its descent from Chandrayaan 1 , an onboard video camera transmitted lunar pictures to the ISRO command centre , " spokesman S Satish said , AFP news agency reports .
For the next two years , Chandrayaan 1 will map a three - dimensional atlas of the Moon and also check for the presence of water - ice with the help of instruments built by India and other countries including the US , Britain and Germany .
The chairman of India 's space programme , Madhavan Nair , has described the mission as 95 % successful so far and has announced a second lunar mission to be launched by 2012 .
" We have now successfully put our national flag on the lunar surface , " he told a news conference .
Mr Nair has also said India is considering sending a satellite to Mars .

False Memories Can Influence Behaviour
Even when human memory is working normally , it is still frequently unfaithful .
Instead of the total recall of , say , a video camera we get something more like a symbolist , or even abstract painting .
Sights , sounds and smells are refracted by our minds into memories that often tell more about us than the original events they apparently record .
Psychologists have found many processes that act like lenses , creating distorted memories of original events .
These processes include things like cognitive dissonance , the consistency bias and misattribution .
But what power do these distorted or false memories hold over the mind ?
How far are they able to weave themselves into the tapestry of our lives ?
In short : can false memories affect our everyday thought and behaviour ?
According to the results of a new experiment reported in Psychological Science , false memories could have many and varied behavioural consequences : just like ‘ real ’ memories , they may well be able to reach forward to the present and dramatically change how we think and behave .
Implanting false memories
To investigate the power of false memories Dr Elke Geraerts and colleagues ( Geraerts et al. , 2008 ) first had to induce false memories in participants : in this case that egg salad made them feel sick .
To achieve this , participants were invited to take part in a study they were told was about ‘ food and personality ’ .
They answered a number of questions about food which were apparently to be entered into a computer programme to produce a profile of their early childhood experiences with food .
A week later two - thirds of the participants were told in this profile that they had got sick after eating egg salad at an early age , while the remainder – the control group – were not .
The experimenters then had to check who had accepted this false memory as one of their own , and who had not .
Using questionnaires they discovered that almost half of the experimental group had taken the bait and created a false memory while the rest were ‘ non- believers ’ .
This demonstrates , once again , just how easy it is to induce false memories in some people .
Avoiding egg salad
The second stage of this experiment took place four months later when the participants were contacted by a different experimenter apparently about a different study – of course this was just a ruse .
Participants were told this study was about people ’s preferences for different types of foods .
A variety of different types of sandwiches and drinks were on offer for participants to test and rate , but most of these were a distraction as the experimenters were most interested in those egg salad sandwiches .
After the participants had left they tallied up how many of each type of sandwich had been consumed .
They found that those who had accepted the false memory about getting sick after eating egg salad sandwiches ate far fewer of these sandwiches than those in the control group or those who were ‘ non- believers ’ .
While the non-believers and control group ate , on average , about 0.4 egg salad sandwiches , the false memory group ate only about 0.1 .
They were certainly avoiding the egg salad as this pattern of consumption was n’t seen in any of the other types of sandwiches .
Re-imagining the past
What this study clearly shows is that not only is it possible to instil false memories in a significant minority of people , but that these false memories can have a marked effect on behaviour .
Naturally this should make us wonder which of our preferences , attitudes , or phobias even , might be based on false recollections .
Could that distaste for yellow peppers have stemmed from a false memory of getting sick after eating them ?
Or could that desire for a seaside home be built on childhood beach trips misremembered as enjoyable ?
What this experiment underlines is the idea that the way we remember , interpret and , perhaps , re-imagine the past has a profound effect on how we think and behave in the present .

Any of you planning to submit some ideas ?
Lush plant life and exotic wild animals .
Formal dinners and luxury accommodations .
Twenty five adventurous days in 11 different countries , all reached by private jet .
Sounds like a great vacation , sure , but also an expensive exercise in hypocrisy by the World Wildlife Fund .
The organization does an admirable job protecting the world 's flora and fauna from the impact of human development and global climate change .
We applaud so noble a cause , but it is hard to take the WWF seriously when it organizes a fundraising trip that will spew 1,200 tons of carbon dioxide shuttling well - heeled donors around the globe on a private jet .
The WWF says the tour allows adventurous travelers — those who can pony up the $ 64,950 ticket price , anyway — to " touch down in some of the most astonishing places on the planet to see the top wildlife , including gorillas , orangutans , rhinos , lemurs and toucans . "
Good thing they are n't planning to visit any glaciers .
While the whole thing is way over the top , it 's the private jet that really gets us .
The 88 - seat , luxuriously appointed jet will transport passengers on a whirlwind tour with stops in such far - flung places as the Amazon , Easter Island , Chile , Malaysia , Laos , Nepal and London .
We 're not sure what kind of plane the WWF is using — the sales pitch says only that it is " a specially outfitted private jet . "
But an excellent piece by Steven Milloy in JunkScience notes that flying the 36,000 mile route in a Boeing 757 would burn about 100,000 gallons of jet fuel and produce more than 1,200 tons of CO2 .
Milloy says that 's the same as putting 1,560 SUVs on the road for the three weeks the eco-adventurers are jetting around the world .
He uses the WWF 's carbon footprint calculator to estimate it would cost $ 44,000 to offset the emissions — though the WWF 's brochure ( . pdf ) does n't say anything about offsets .
It gets even harder to take once you read the WWF 's mission statement , which states it is committed to " protecting natural areas and wild populations of plants and animals , including endangered species ; promoting sustainable approaches to the use of renewable natural resources ; and promoting more efficient use of resources and energy and the maximum reduction of pollution . "
Um , hello ?
We disagree with a lot of what Milloy has said in the past — he 's dedicated an entire page of his website to debunking the myth of climate change — but in this case he 's spot on .
An organization that implores us to do our part by carpooling , embracing fluorescent bulbs , replacing our old appliances and taking other steps toward eco-friendliness should n't be taking wealthy donors on a 25 - day pollution - fest .
The WWF does good work , and like every other nonprofit , it needs money to carry out that work .
But a fundraising trip like this is a bad idea .
There must be a better way .

The ReviewJournal is reporting Reid says " no blank check " for Wall Street bailout .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said today that Democrats in Congress will not grant President Bush " a blank check " $ 700 billion financial bailout bill without debate over amendments to " protect taxpayers . "
Reid , a Democrat from Nevada , stopped short of saying that Democrats will hold up the bill that most everyone has said is urgent to steady the economy .
" We are prepared to do what is necessary , but we will not let haste abandon good judgment in the process , " Reid said .
" The Bush administration has called on Congress to rubber - stamp its bailout legislation without serious debate or efforts to improve it , " Reid said .
" That will not happen .

OPIUM production in Afghanistan will contribute $ US500 million ( $ 770 million ) to drug lords and the Taliban this year and has increased in the south - where Australia 's troops are based - despite a drop across the rest of the country , a United Nations report says .
The report , to be released today by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime , says opium production has dropped 6 per cent across the country this year and has been eradicated from 18 of 34 provinces .
Production has been restricted almost exclusively to the troubled southern provinces , including Oruzgan , where Australia 's 1000 - plus troops are based and where production rose 26 per cent .
The report says the rises in the south indicate the continued strength of the Taliban which - along with drug lords and corrupt authorities - imposes a tax , or ushr , for protecting opium farmers and traffickers .

Did you know that some blogs receive over one million visitors each month ?
Have you ever wondered how they do it ?
This kind of traffic is n’t easy to attain , but the pay - off for a high traffic blog with hundreds of thousands of page views each month ( or more ) are considerable .
With that kind of traffic it ’s hard not to make good money !
Most blogs with huge amounts of traffic are in fact run by a dedicated staff of writers who can churn out content much faster than a single blogger could ever hope to manage .
Part of the reason these blogs are so highly trafficked is because a repeat visitor knows there ’s likely to be something new every few hours or so .
They have reason to visit multiple times during the day .
Examples of blogs like this are the Gawker Media blogs , such as Lifehacker and Kotaku .
Most of us do n’t have the money or the desire to take on a large contingent of writers to keep our blogs updated every few hours .
The good news is that huge traffic is still possible at a single - author blog .
Look to StevePavlina.com , Zen Habits , Entrepreneur ’s Journey , even ProBlogger itself ( I pick these examples because you ’re likely to be familiar with them , but there are so many others ) .
These are just a few examples where a single - author blog is receiving hundreds of thousands of page views each month , and in some cases , over a million .
Can we do the same ?
These are the kind of stats we dream of for our own blogs , but most of us doubt that this would be possible for us .
This is probably because the steps involved in getting there seem very blurry .
You ’re producing great content , growing in size slowly but surely , gathering new loyal readers and increasing your traffic , but you ’re still miles away from the kind of huge audience those blogs experience .
What are the factors that separate the average blog from these super high traffic blogs ?
This is the point where you expect a cop-out — for me to say that it is , of course , great content that separates those blogs from the average .
Unfortunately , your expectations wo n’t be met here .
I ’m not interested in content right now .
At least , not directly .
In fact , your content may be just as good , or better , than any one of the blogs I ’ve mentioned , or any other successful single - author blogs you can think of .
What I am interested in , and I hope you will be too , is to know where that traffic is coming from .
On a multi- author blog producing reams of content it ’s likely to receive many of its ‘ visits ’ from single visitors who make multiple return visits each day , in addition to high search traffic due to the vast amount of content archived at the blog , and social media traffic , because multi-author blogs generally have the resources to break important stories .
When we look at single - author blogs , however , traffic sources are going to be coming from very different places .
Instead of producing dozens of posts each day a blog run by one person is probably going to be producing , at most , a handful of posts per day .
The average level will probably be one post per day .
For this reason , single - author blogs probably can’t expect visitors to return five or ten times a day to check for new updates .
So , we knock out that traffic source .
I want to suggest that very highly trafficked single - author blogs are knocking the ball out of the park in at least two of the following three core areas :
Search
Social media
Evangelism
The last one is a must .
Waves of social media traffic come and go and search engine traffic can disappear with the next Google algorithm update .
If readers evangelize your content , as they do for Steve Pavlina , Leo Babauta , Yaro Starak , and you have probably done for Darren Rowse ( by recommending him to a friend , or linking to one of his articles with a glowing recommandation ) you will find it difficult to receive anything but huge traffic .
Performing exceptionally with at least one of the others is also very important , and it ’s particularly useful if you can master both .
SEO
Most single - author blogs with huge traffic are getting a lot of that from search ( sometimes as high as 20 % ) .
Some blogs , however , will never receive exceptional search traffic , no matter how popular they get or how much SEO work is done on them .
After all , most people use search to solve a problem .
They want to know how to do such and such thing , and the problem is that they do n’t .
So they search .
However , some blogs are not so much about providing answers as they are about asking questions .
Others might provide answers to questions you did n’t know you had .
If you ’re seeking to be entertained , they might entertain you in a way you never would have searched for on your own .
One of the best blog posts I ’ve read in recent memory was Errol Morris ’s dissection of two pieces of war - time photography in an effort to decide whether one of the pictures was faked .
It was called ‘ Which Came First , the Chicken or the Egg ? ’ and generated over 900 comments .
Were people searching for this content before they found it ?
Very unlikely .
Even putting the photographer ’s name in the headline probably would n’t have improved the SEO situation very much , but it still did n’t hurt the story any .
In fact , it went on to become a viral sensation .

Social media
I relate the above example to show that some topics suit high levels of search traffic much better than others .
If you feel you ’re in the latter camp it ’s still very possible to receive high levels of traffic , but you ’ll find it much easier to so with the help of social media .
If you ’re not setting StumbleUpon on fire with your posts you should aim to get some love from Digg or Reddit .
If you do n’t know how to do that , hire someone who does and get them to write for you once a week .
There are plenty of talented writers out there , looking for work , who really ‘ get ’ social media .
Look for for an excellent front - page story on Digg that relates to your blog topic and then find out who wrote it .
If you ’re lucky , that person may be looking for more work .
Once you ’ve produced a great post , get a top user to submit the content before anyone else .
You ’d be surprised at how easy this is if they think the content is good .
Once it ’s done , let their network take over .
With a talented writer and a bit of audacity it ’s surprisingly easy to go popular on social media pretty much , well , whenever you want to .
But that ’s material for another post , another time .
Case studies
Let ’s examine three blogs that I ’ve mentioned above .
First , this one , ProBlogger .
I ’m pretty certain most of Darren ’s traffic comes from direct links ( evangelism ) , search ( a high percent , due to practical topics and clever SEO ) , and StumbleUpon ( a whole lot of it ) .
While most of us are receiving traffic from these sources , high - traffic blogs take this to another level .
The importance of evangelism from the reader base is the driving force behind all these things .
ProBlogger would n’t rank as high in search if thousands of people had n’t linked to it using juicy keywords .
It would n’t receive loads of StumbleUpon traffic if its readers were n’t motivated to vote for it .
Next , let ’s think about where Zen Habits is getting its traffic from .
I ’m not sure about the level of search traffic it gets , but I know it receives an exceptional amount of social media traffic from StumbleUpon and Digg .
I also know the reader base is highly evangelical and links to Leo ’s articles regularly .
The blog is also spread through word of mouth networks .
Once again , the success on social media probably would n’t have progressed as far as it has without an evangelical reader base .
That factor is essential for the other factors to exist .
Evangelism
By now you will have noticed I ’ve been throwing the word ‘ evagelical ’ around a whole lot without really explaining what I mean by it .
The word comes from religious evangelicals , so it ’s best to start there .
While the word has been appropriated to describe a particular group of religious people , it has also been absorbed into the language of marketing .
To evangelize something really just means that you are passionate about it and try to get others to be passionate about it too ( in a religious context , this would be a particular understanding of God ) .
In fact , I want to suggest that you ’ve done some evangelizing whether you are religious or not .
If you ’ve forced a tattered copy of your favorite book into the hands of a friend , you ’re evangelizing it .
If you told someone their next laptop should be a MacBook Pro because you love yours , you ’re evangelizing the product .
When you tell an aspiring blogger that they really should be reading ProBlogger , you evangelize this blog .
When you link to it , vote for it or recommend it via word of mouth , you are evangelizing it , and the same goes for any blog you enjoy and try to share with others .
The key difference between the average blog and a high traffic blog is that the high traffic blog has an evangelical following : people who think , “ My God , more people have to see this ! ”
Someone who only skims your posts will register on your stat counter but they are not going to spread the ‘ gospel ’ of your blog to others , so to speak .
An evangelical reader might stumble every post they read and link to you every week .
They do the kind of things that allow you to rank highly in search , and to get torrents of traffic from social media .
In other words , to build a high traffic blog you need to create a highly evangelical audience .
What makes someone passionate and evangelical about a blog ?
It ’s not fluff .
It ’s not controversy for its own sake .
It ’s not self - indulgence .
It ’s not stale formulas .
It ’s knowing deeply the kind of individuals your audience is made up of , what their needs and wants and dreams are , how you fit into that , and how much you can make their lives better , whether it ’s by making them smile , laugh , cry , go ‘ Ah - ha ! ’ , feel empowered , feel informed , entertained or more skillful .
The amount of improvement you make in the lives of your readers will be in proportion to the amount of effort they put into evangelizing your blog and helping it become more popular than you may ever have imagined .

A federal judge could decide next week whether or not Canada is in the midst of an illegal federal election , but either way , it 's likely too late to stop the show .
Democracy Watch has brought a case before the federal court , arguing that Stephen Harper violated the Canada Elections
Act when he dissolved parliament on September 7 because there had n't yet been a non-confidence vote in the House of Commons .
Such a vote is required under Bill C - 16 of the act , legislation that Harper himself pitched as a means of preventing prime ministers from calling snap elections .
Democracy Watch is in court in Ottawa tomorrow to request that the hearing be expedited .
If it is , said the group 's lawyer Peter Rosenthal , a judge could rule on the legality of the election call sometime next week .
Even if the ruling determines there was in fact a violation , Rosenthal said it 's " quite unlikely " that it will affect the upcoming election .
Doug McArthur , a professor of public policy at Simon Fraser University said while there is a very good case to be made , it 's likely too late to make a difference .
" Given that we 're over two weeks into the election campaign , I think a judge is going to be much more reluctant to issue an injunction stopping the election , " McArthur said , adding that the consequences will likely be a " slap on the wrist " and clarification that this should n't happen again .
" I was astounded that no media , no academics , no organizations got out on this one , " McArthur said when asked why no one addressed the issue earlier .
" But I do n’t think you can expect political parties to move off their campaign and onto something that seems to technically obscure for media and others . "

In very disappointing news proper tail calls are out of ES4 .
It seems that a justification for tail calls could not be found .
For example , here is Adobe 's position on tail calls :
A more serious point is that we can't avoid adding tail calls at some point if we cater to the functional programming crowd .
However , if we really intend to cater to them then we need to provide data structures that are functional too , like lists and operations on themâ € ” unlike ES arrays , which are entirely imperative .
Of course users can implement those data structures themselves , if they have tail calls , but right now just adding tail calls â€ œfor functional programmingâ€ seems like a half solution .
Finally , tail calls preclude the use of straightforward implementation techniques for procedure calls .
To be sure they are less limiting than generators , as one - shot continuations or longjumps are sufficient to handle tail calls in a non-tail - calling implementation language , but implementations that want good - performance tail calls must necessarily switch to a code generation technique .
This seems misguided .
The user can implement functional data structures but not tail calls ( without whole program transformation ) , so the later are much more valuable than the former .
Furthermore , as a functional programmer I 'm quite happy to use mutable data structures but I would certainly miss tail calls .
Finally , every JS implementation is already shifting to code generation because straightforward implementation techniques are too slow for the existing idioms used in JS code .
The ES4 Wiki still indicates that tail calls are in , so perhaps they 'll yet make it .
For laughs you might want to look at the Ecmascript progress spreadsheet .
Apple sure do n't like change .
Any article with the line “ it was a remarkably bad day for Republicans ” in the first paragraph is going to pique my interest :
Even for a party whose president suffers dismal approval ratings , whose legislative wing lost control of Congress and whose presidential nominee trails in the polls , it was a remarkably bad day for Republicans .
The drama that unfolded yesterday was n’t as much about the underlying policy , but on the underlying politics — internal Republican politics .
Neither Bush or McCain have any leadership abilities :
By midnight , it was hard to tell who had suffered a worse evening , Bush or McCain .
McCain , eager to shore up his image as a leader who rises above partisanship , was undercut by a fierce political squabble within his own party ’s ranks .
The consequences could be worse for Bush , and for millions of Americans if the impasse sends financial markets tumbling , as some officials fear .
Closed - door negotiations were to resume Friday , but it was unclear whether House Republicans would attend .
Republicans and Democrats alike seemed unsure which way McCain was leaning .
His campaign ’s statement late Thursday shed little light .
“ At this moment , the plan that has been put forth by the administration does not enjoy the confidence of the American people , ” it said .
It was unclear whether McCain would attend Friday night ’s scheduled debate against Democratic nominee Barack Obama in Oxford , Miss .
So , get this straight : McCain made a big announcement that he was suspending his campaign ( which he did n’t do ) and planning to bag the first debate because of the economic crisis .
He swooped into D.C. , caused a stir — but no one knows what his position is .
That ’s some kind of crazy .
He has n’t solved the problem .
It ’s no kind of leadership .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A rock - bottom price just is n't enough for buyers these days - it 's a starting point .
If the furnace is out of date , they 'll demand a new one .
Cracked driveways have to be repaved , and dirty carpeting torn out and replaced .
All at the seller 's expense .
Buyers are in the driver 's seat and they know it .
They 're using that leverage to pry more concessions out of desperate sellers than they ever dreamed of during the bubble .
" ' Now it 's my turn , ' is the attitude , " said Mike Byrd , a real estate agent with SLO Home Store in San Luis Obispo , Calif .
" Some buyers are really putting the screws on . "
In New England , buyers are demanding that sellers pay to fill up a home 's heating oil tank .
In California , sellers are forking over closing costs .
Nearly everywhere , buyers are insisting that sellers purchase a home service contract providing a one year warranty on all of a home 's appliances .
New central air - conditioning systems , a year of condo association fees and even two weeks in Hawaii are just a few of the incentives that sellers are having to employ these days , according to Byrd .
And buyers are getting it all in writing .
" [ During the boom ] buyers usually accepted the property as - is , and we even occasionally offered to pay the seller 's state and county transfer taxes , " said Washington D.C. based agent John Sullivan , who is also president elect of the National Association of Exclusive Buyer 's Agents .
" No more . "
Upon closer inspection
It used to be that sales contracts had clauses that made a purchase contingent upon whether a home passed inspection , if a buyer was able to get a mortgage , or even if they could sell their own house .
Those safeguards fell by the wayside during the bubble ; if a buyer balked , the seller just moved on to the next highest bidder .
Buyers who signed deals without these protections and had to back out often lost their deposits .
But lately , buyers have expanded the number of clauses they put into contracts , according to Benjamin Clark , an agent in Salt Lake City with Homebuyer Representation .
" Some of these items include availability of high speed Internet , cost and availability of homeowners insurance , " he said .
" They cover environmental aspects of the home and neighborhood , as well as local services and amenities . "
Instead of a single inspector , the home inspection now includes specialists in radon , lead - based paint , roofs and masonry , as well as fireplaces .
Sellers must fix any flaw or pay for the buyer to correct it .
" Sellers are much more flexible on issues that come up on the home inspection - and I mean big ticket items like roofs and furnaces , " said Ed Bartlett of Spokane Home Buyers in Washington State .
" And this is after they have already been flexible on the price . "
A detailed inspection was a lifesaver for clients of Clark's , who were buying a six - bedroom , four - bath rambling ranch in Bountiful , Utah , that was listed $ 344,900 .
After the buyers got the price down several thousand dollars and signed a contract , the home inspectors went to work .
They turned up some minor issues , which the sellers agreed to fix , including $ 875 for some electric work , $ 150 for plumbing , $ 242 for a new kitchen faucet and $ 735 for chimney pointing and repair .
But bigger problems emerged .
" There were termites , " said Clark , " and masonry issues .
The deck needed to be demolished . "
Based on these findings , he got the price down to $ 324,000 .
For some buyers , the negotiations do n't stop right up until the closing .
Don Plourde , a Coldwell Banker broker in Waterville , Maine , recently had a client squeeze a last minute concession out of a seller on a three bedroom starter home that needed some work .
The asking price was very low - just $ 75,000 - but even so , the buyer was able to negotiate that down to $ 72,500 .
But just before the closing , the buyer demanded that the seller leave behind three quarters of a tank of heating oil - 200 gallons worth $ 800 - for free .
The seller caved .
" He just wanted to move on , " said Plourde .
Free closing
These days , sellers almost always pay the closing costs instead of the buyers , according to John Rygiol , an Exclusive Home Buyer Brokerage agent in Orange County , Calif .
" It 's hard to ask for that after already getting a price reduction , " said the agent , who recently got a seller to pony up $ 10,000 for closing .
" But it 's a buyer 's market and sellers are attuned to that . "
Even local taxes are on the table these days , according to Adele Hrovat , the owner of The Buyer 's Realty of Las Vegas .
She got the bank that was selling a four - bedroom , three - bath , house to pay an $ 11,000 tax assessment on top of $ 6,000 in closing costs .
And that was after the price was slashed from $ 489,900 to $ 399,000 .
With the housing market bad as it is - slow sales , dropping prices and inventories rising - sellers are going to have to stay flexible .
" We 're finding that buyers make an offer and if it 's not accepted , they just go on to the next seller , " said Don Plourde .

Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama has won in the two US towns that traditionally open US election voting .
In Dixville Notch , New Hampshire , he won 15 votes to his Republican rival John McCain 's six , becoming the first Democrat to win there since 1968 .
In Hart 's Location he won 17 votes , while Mr McCain won 10 , and Ron Paul two , showing 100 % voter turnout .
Results from the rest of the US are expected from 2300 GMT as citizens elect their 44th president .
Hart 's Location began the practice of voting early in 1948 so that railroad employees could vote before going to work .
Dixville Notch 's first voter cast his ballot just after midnight
The nation 's first 18 - year - old to cast his vote , Arron Dindorf of Hart 's Location , said : " It 's one of the few times the town gets together all at once .
" It 's neat to see how into it people are , and they want to keep the tradition alive . "
Obama supporter Tanner Nelson Tillotson became Dixville Notch 's first voter when his name was drawn from a bowl .
Of his chosen candidate 's win , he said : " I 'm not going to say I was n't surprised . "
Dixville Notch began its tradition of midnight voting soon after Hart 's Location , but with increasing media attention the practice was stopped in 1964 .
It resumed for the 1996 election .
Australia ’s ongoing debate over internet censorship has taken an interesting turn , with the Minister in charge of implementing internet censorship attempting to censor a critic of the Government ’s proposal .
The Labor Government elected in late 2007 promoted a policy that would make it mandatory for internet service providers to offer a “ clean feed ” to homes , that blocked content deemed illegal , pornographic and inappropriate .
Until recently , Minister Conroy had publicly stated that internet users would be able opt - out of the filter , but in a backflip has since disclosed that the filter will be compulsory , with two levels : one for children , and one for adults .
Australia ’s strict and sometimes bizarre censorship regime would see online adult games blocked ( such as Second Life ) because Australia does n’t offer an R ( adult ) classification for games , and would also see soft pornography banned online despite being freely available a petrol ( gas ) stations .
The latest drama was reported by the Fairfax newspapers , who obtained copies of an email , and details of a phone call from the Ministers office directed towards a critic of the Government ’s plan .
Mark Newton , an engineer at Australia ISP Internode , has heavily criticized the Government and its filtering policy on popular Australian broadband forum Whirlpool , and went as far as saying that the censorship regime would enable child abuse by ignoring non-web applications which are will not be censored under the plan ( the tech behind the censorship plan does n’t block P2P and chat for example ) .
The Ministers office wrote to the Internet Industry Association ( IIA ) board member Carolyn Dalton based on Newton working for Internode , despite his criticism being offered in a personal capacity .
“ In your capacity as a board member of the IIA I would like to express my serious concern that a IIA member would be sending out this sort of message .
I have also advised [ IIA chief executive ]
Peter Coroneos of my disappointment in this sort of irresponsible behaviour , ”
The email was accompanied by a phone call demanding that the message be passed on to senior Internode management .
As Asher Moses points out in The Age , the irony in the Ministers response is that the Minister himself has constantly branded critics of the censorship plan as being in favor in child pornography .
Although this should n’t come as a great surprise , it is none the less unacceptable in a democratic country that a Minister would seek to censor critics who are doing nothing more than exercising their rights to publicly disagree .
Enough is enough .
I call on the Minister to resign , or should he not do so , I call on the Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , to sack the Minister at the first available opportunity .
This abuse of power has no place in a modern , free and democratic society in the 21st century .
" I would have to say the best part was that everyone involved in this project was an artist in their own right and seeing everyone work come together to realise the vision we had conceived was amazing . "

Why are diamonds , which are little more than decorative baubles , so much more valuable than water , without which we would die ?
The answer is that value is determined at the margin , meaning that we value not " diamonds " as a category compared to " water " as a category , but one more diamond compared to one more unit of water .
Water is super - abundant while diamonds are not ; this is one reason why a diamond is so expensive while water is not .
This also illustrates an important point about decision making .
Instead of " setting priorities " and viewing things in terms of all - or - nothing decisions , we should look at trade - offs .
One of the most important principles of economics is that decisions are made at the margin , and one of the key problems in classical economics concerned the source of value .
The law of diminishing marginal utility is a fundamental tenet of economics , and it is every bit as much a scientific law as the law of gravity ( more so , perhaps , as it can be deduced from an axiom — man acts — that is self - evidently true ) .
Marginal utility is not decreasing just because we assume it is .
The law of marginal utility is an implication of the action axiom , not merely an ad hoc assumption .
The " utility " one derives from consuming a good or undertaking an activity is best understood as a set of wants that can be satisfied by employing means , not as the output of a function mapping from an agent 's consumption set into the real number line .
Following this definition , the " marginal utility " of employing another unit of a homogeneous supply of goods or services must be understood as the additional set of wants that can be satisfied by employing that marginal unit .
From the fundamental axiom of praxeology — that " human action is the use of means to arrive at preferred ends " [ 1 ] — we can see that the marginal utility of employing unit n is preferred to the marginal utility of employing unit n+1 ; in the language of mainstream economics , marginal utility must be decreasing .
In his classic article " Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics " and in his treatise Man , Economy , and State , Murray Rothbard asks us to consider eggs as an example .
( I alter the example slightly here . )
Consider Joe , who has a wife , a daughter , a dog , and the following value scale :
Feed his family with cake Feed his daughter with scrambled egg Feed his wife with scrambled egg Feed himself with scrambled egg Feed his dog with scrambled egg
Suppose he needs four eggs to bake a cake .
With his first egg , he will feed his daughter because he prefers this to all other sets of wants he can satisfy with one egg .
With his second egg , he will feed his wife , and with his third egg , he will feed himself .
Now , suppose Joe purchases a fourth egg .
This leads us to a possible misconception : one might be tempted to look at the situation and exclaim , " Aha !
With the fourth egg , Joe can feed his family with cake , which he clearly prefers to feeding them with scrambled eggs !
Clearly , then , the marginal utility of the fourth egg is higher than the marginal utility of the third egg ; therefore , marginal utility is increasing ! "
This line of reasoning neglects a crucial point : the fourth egg can only be used to bake a cake in the presence of the first three eggs .
Since " marginal utility " is a concept that can only be applied to homogeneous units of a given supply , " one egg " is no longer the relevant unit of analysis .
The homogeneity of units is determined by the set of wants that can be satisfied with a unit of a good ; in this case , the relevant unit of analysis becomes " 1 unit=a set of four eggs . "
Thus , Joe 's value scale may now be
Feed his family with cake Feed his family with scrambled eggs
He will clearly choose to feed his family with cake and , should he happen upon a second set of four eggs , scrambled eggs as well .
The astute reader will notice that the value scales listed above were listed according to the wants satisfied by the marginal unit of a given good , not by the good itself after the fashion of Rothbard in " Toward A Reconstruction . "
Our hero
Joe did n't prefer the first egg to the second in and of itself ; he preferred feeding his daughter to feeding his wife .
If only one egg is available , he must choose between competing ends , and the end that satisfies him most is feeding his daughter .
It should be evident that the law of marginal utility should be accorded just that epistemological status : a law .
As Rothbard explains ( and as Carl Menger and others showed before him ) , this theorem , which can be deduced from the action axiom , is more than merely empirically demonstrable : it is irrefutably true .

Why does the price of gas increase immediately when a hurricane threatens supplies , even though the gas at the pump has already been paid for ?
Why does the price of gas in Seattle increase immediately when a hurricane threatens New Orleans or Houston ?
A popular explanation for rising gas prices is that it happens because unscrupulous , hard - hearted merchants see disasters as opportunities to take advantage of people in their time of need .
It s an emotionally attractive explanation that fuels popular outrage and inspires laws against price gouging .
It s also an explanation that is completely wrong .
We can save ourselves a lot of angst , many of the pains associated with disaster recovery , and a lot of money in law enforcement resources by understanding why gas prices rise in the midst of disaster and by repealing laws against price gouging . 
Evil people dont cause high prices .
Supply and demand cause high prices .
In the face of an impending disaster , consumers want more gas at any given price , which means that the demand curve has shifted .
At the same time , disasters like hurricanes usually mean that the amount of gas merchants are willing to sell at any given price will fall .
This is due in part to the fact that they will have their own disaster - related problems to deal with .
Also , if energy infrastructure is harmed it means that the cost of acquiring fuel will rise .
An increase in demand coupled with a reduction in supply means an increase in price .
Increasing the price is an appropriate response to long gas lines rather than a cruel attempt to stick it to the helpless .
When people begin lining up to get something at the going price , this tells merchants that the price is too low .
Raising the price corrects the imbalance and sends consumers an important signal : specifically , it tells them to redouble their efforts to conserve the resources that have rising prices .
One person quoted in the Memphis Commercial - Appeal mentioned that she would not be attending the Cooper - Young festival because of rising gas prices in the wake of Hurricane Ike .
My wife and I have cut back on unnecessary driving in response to rising gas prices .
It is nt pleasant , but its a pretty small sacrifice when one considers the role of rising prices in expediting recovery from disasters .
Pundits and politicians are quick to criticize oil companies and gas stations for earning windfall profits  during times of disaster .
And it is true that an oil company or a gas station will book a higher profit if prices increase during disasters .
First , though , this profit is a reward to the merchant for correctly anticipating that the price would be higher .
It also sends a signal into the marketplace that attracts other profit - seeking suppliers into the marketplace .
A lot of the confusion stems from a misunderstanding of cost .
The cost of a gallon of gas is not what the merchant paid for it .
The cost of a gallon of gas is the merchants next - best opportunity .
If a gas station paid $ 3 for a gallon of gas yesterday and expects to be able to sell it for $ 5 tomorrow , the cost of that gallon is not $ 3 .
It s $ 5 .
By selling the gas today , the gas station owner gives up the opportunity to sell it tomorrow for $ 5 .
Therefore , we can expect the gas station owner to charge $ 5 for the gallon of gas today .
The same reasoning explains why the price of gas in Seattle would increase after a hurricane in Texas even if that hurricane did nothing to disrupt supply .
The cost to the Seattle gas station owner is not what he paid for the gas , but what he could get for the gas if he decided to sell it in Texas instead .
This is one of my favorite topics to cover in economics 101 because it uses some very simple principles to show why prices rise after disasters and because it illustrates the disastrous unintended consequences of well - intentioned government interventions .
It also has implications for appropriate policy responses to disasters : when we leave the market to its own devices , prices tend toward uniformity across space and time .
The price rises , but at least everyone who wants gas can get it .
When the government steps in , ostensibly to help  people by outlawing price - gouging , they create shortages .
With friends like these , disaster victims do not need enemies .
2019 -05 -02 In FAQ .
If you have questions , comments or concerns about the F.A.Q. please contact us at webmaster@kernel.org .
Is Linux Kernel Free Software ?
Linux kernel is released under GNU GPL version 2 and is therefore Free Software as defined by the Free Software Foundation .
You may read the entire copy of the license in the COPYING file distributed with each release of the Linux kernel .
What does " stable / EOL " and " longterm " mean ?
As kernels move from the " mainline " into the " stable " category , two things can happen :
They can reach " End of Life " after a few bugfix revisions , which means that kernel maintainers will release no more bugfixes for this kernel version , or They can be put into " longterm " maintenance , which means that maintainers will provide bugfixes for this kernel revision for a much longer period of time .
If the kernel version you are using is marked " EOL , " you should consider upgrading to the next major version as there will be no more bugfixes provided for the kernel version you are using .
Please check the Releases page for more info .
Why is an LTS kernel marked as " stable " on the front page ?
Long - term support ( " LTS " ) kernels announced on the Releases page will be marked as " stable " on the front page if there are no other current stable kernel releases .
This is done to avoid breaking automated parsers monitoring kernel.org with an expectation that there will always be a kernel release marked as " stable . "
Linus has tagged a new release , but it 's not listed on the front page !
Linus Torvalds PGP - signs git repository tags for all new mainline kernel releases , however a separate set of PGP signatures needs to be generated by the stable release team in order to create downloadable tarballs .
Due to timezone differences between Linus and the members of the stable team , there is usually a delay of several hours between when the new mainline release is tagged and when PGP - signed tarballs become available .
The front page is updated once that process is completed .
Is there an RSS feed for the latest kernel version ?
Yes , and you can find it at https://www.kernel.org/feeds/kdist.xml.
We also publish a . json file with the latest release information , which you can pull from here : https://www.kernel.org/releases.json.
Can I get an account on kernel.org ?
Kernel.org accounts are usually reserved for subsystem maintainers or high - profile developers .
It is absolutely not necessary to have an account on kernel.org to contribute to the development of the Linux kernel , unless you submit pull requests directly to Linus .
If you are listed in the MAINTAINERS file or have reasons to believe you should have an account on kernel.org because of the amount of your contributions , please refer to the accounts wiki page for the procedure to follow .
I have cool project X , can you guys mirror it for me ?
Probably not .
Kernel.org deals with the Linux kernel , various distributions of the kernel and larger repositories of packages .
We do not mirror individual projects , software , etc as we feel there are better places providing mirrors for those kinds of repositories .
If you feel that kernel.org should mirror your project , please contact ftpadmin@kernel.org with the following information : name
project name
project website
detailed project description
reason for wanting us to mirror
The Kernel.org admin team will then review your request and talk to you about it .
As with any kind of account on kernel.org it 's up to the discretion of the admin team .
How does kernel.org provide its users access to the git trees ?
We are using an access control system called gitolite , originally written and maintained by Sitaram Chamarty .
We chose gitolite for a number of reasons : Limiting of ssh access to the system
Fine grained control over repository access
Well maintained and supported code base
Responsive development
Broad and diverse install base
As well at the time of deployment the code had undergone an external code review .
How do I create an - rc kernel ?
I get " Reversed patch detected ! " - rc kernel patches are generated from the base stable release .
For example : to create the 2.6.14 - rc5 kernel , you must : download 2.6.13 ( not 2.6.13.4 )
and then apply the 2.6.14 - rc5 patch .
Yes , you want 2.6.13 , not 2.6.14 .
Remember , that 's an -rc kernel , as in , 2.6.14 does n't exist yet . :)
Where can I find kernel 2.4.20 - 3.16 ?
Kernel version numbers of this form are distribution kernels , meaning they are modified kernels produced by distributions .
Please contact the relevant distributor ; or check out https://mirrors.kernel.org/.
See the Releases page for more info on distribution kernels .
I need help building / patching / fixing Linux kernel / modules / drivers !
Please see the Kernel Newbies website .
There is also a wealth of knowledge on many topics involving Linux at The Linux Documentation Project ( http://www.tldp.org)
For finding or reporting bugs , look through the archives for the various Linux mailing lists , and if no specific list seems appropriate , try the browsing the Linux Kernel Mailing List .
What happened to ftp.kernel.org ?
FTP service was terminated on March 1 , 2017 .
All content that used to be available via ftp.kernel.org can be accessed by browsing https://www.kernel.org/pub/.
If you would like to use a command - line tool for accessing these files , you can do so with lftp : lftp https://www.kernel.org/pub
When will the next kernel be released ?
The next kernel will be released when it is ready .
There is no strict timeline for making releases , but if you really need an educated guess , visit the Linux kernel PHB Crystal Ball -- it tries to provide a ballpark guess based on previous kernel release schedule .
In the 150 - acre terminal where Toyotas are unloaded , there is a sea of Corollas , Camrys and RAV4s .
The mere presence of so many cars is not unusual , given that Toyota brings in 250,000 cars a year in biweekly shipments .
But in a sign that something is amiss , dozens of tractor - trailers that transport new cars to dealers sat empty last week amid the rows of Toyotas .
Kurt Golledge , 48 , was one of just two truckers loading his green , 75 - foot - long hauler with cars last week .
Mr. Golledge said eight of his colleagues were laid off this month because Toyota dealers did not want more deliveries .
“ I was dropping cars in Henderson , Nev. , about a month ago and the dealer told me : ‘ Take ’em somewhere else and dump ’em , ’ ” said Mr. Golledge , who works for a company called Allied Systems .
“ All the dealers are telling us the same thing . ”
Auto dealers typically place orders with manufacturers months in advance , but they can modify their orders to receive fewer vehicles .
“ The ships keep coming , but there ’s nowhere for the cars to go , ” Mr. Golledge said .
He said he believed the vehicles he was loading would be his last before he was laid off , and he was already considering where he might find a new job .
While shipments for some items have slowed , the cars have kept coming in at their regular pace partly because the auto factories can take months to adjust to changes in demand .
Toyota is wrapping up a deal to use six acres to park cars at the port , and is seeking more space .

Solar ’s got a few dark secrets : Sometimes toxic materials are used in panels and sometimes chemicals get dumped in the manufacturing process .
But what ’s the real dirty secret ?
According to OCS Energy , a startup based in Petaluma , Calif. , it ’s actually , well , dirt — and tree sap , bugs , moss or anything that can grime up the panel and dampen its energy output .
OCS Energy ’s answer is an automated cleaning system , dubbed SolarWash , that attaches to the array of panels and can wash the system ( Update : targeting 100 kw installations or larger ) on a weekly basis .
This morning the company is announcing its system , which it says is “ the first commercially available automated photovoltaic panel cleaning system . ”
It uses nozzles to spray down one side and a washing process that is controlled by a microprocessor .
OCS says if the solar installation is experiencing a loss of energy of 5 percent or more due to dirt , then the system can pay back within 3 to 5 years .
( Update :
The company ’s CEO Richard O’Connell tells us that the system costs $ 0.30 per watt DC to install , and that the company is in the process of bringing those costs down . )
That energy loss estimate is actually a pretty conservative claim from a solar panel maintenance company .
Many of the service - oriented companies in the solar panel maintenance market say dirt and grim can reduce a panel ’s energy output by 15 to 25 percent .
But OCS says its automated solution is better than service - oriented solutions , because having employees manually wash solar systems is a safety hazard .
The washing system seems pretty straight forward ( see video below ) , but our big question is :
Will major commercial solar installers see a need for this ?

In a bit political symmetry , John McCain put out a statement today , endorsing the Democratic governor of his home state of Arizona , Janet Napolitano to be Barack Obama ’s head of the Department of Homeland Security .
The statement said that McCain commended the announcement , and called the governor to congratulate her .
Governor Napolitano ’s experience as the former U.S. Attorney for Arizona , Arizona ’s Attorney General and as Governor warrants her rapid confirmation by the Senate and I hope she is quickly confirmed , ” McCain said .
He also added that he is looking forward to working with her during the confirmation process .
As McCain ’s statement points out , Napolitano has a wealth of experience prosecuting cases , which provides some clues into what could be the changing role Obama sees for Homeland Security .
Currently , Homeland Security is a department without a clear jurisdiction .
It is more of figurehead organization without any real power or authority over the intelligence agencies and the Justice Department .
It does n’t have any budgetary authority , and technically its role is to prevent and respond to domestic emergencies .
Advertisements
Its primary mission was originally supposed to be the prevention and the response to a domestic terrorist attack , but most of the department ’s duties have been focused on responses to natural disasters through FEMA , which was absorbed into Homeland Security .
The Department also absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service .
Since is the Department itself was created through the merging of 22 different agencies , it has been rough sailing in terms of leadership and function .
One of the things that Democrats have long sought to do is remove FEMA from Homeland Security and return to being a standalone agency .
I think the selection of Napolitano is a signal that Obama is looking to give Homeland Security more leadership , direction , and a clear mission .
Being from a border state , Napolitano understands the immigration issue .
She has nice blend of experiences that should fit this position well .
There is a growing trend in these Obama appointments that might not bode well for those who want see Hillary Clinton become Secretary of State .
Thus far , Obama has chosen people who played a critical role in his campaign .
Napolitano was frequent campaign surrogate .
Daschle and Holder both played critical roles on the campaign , and Emanuel is fellow Chicago politician .
All of these people have ties to Obama , and experience in their fields .
These are two qualities that Hillary Clinton lacks .
Napolitano is a solid choice , and it is easy to see why John McCain would endorse her .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .'s list of problem banks ballooned nearly 50 % as banks profits nearly evaporated in the third quarter , as the credit crisis reached its boiling point , the agency said Tuesday .
Net earnings of commercial bank and savings institutions under the FDIC 's protection totaled just $ 1.7 billion in the third quarter , down 94 % from a year earlier , according to the FDIC 's quarterly banking report , which was released Tuesday .
The quarter was the second weakest , following the fourth quarter of 2007 , since 1990 , according to the agency .
There are roughly 171 banks , up from 117 institutions , with a combined total of $ 115.6 billion in assets under the FDIC 's watch currently , according to the report .
But FDIC Chairwoman Shelia Bair said at a press conference in Washington , D.C. that " most banks remain well - capitalized , profitable , and sound . "
" It 's not news to any of us that we 've had profound problems in our financial markets that are taking a rising toll on the real economy , " Bair said . "
Tuesday 's report reflects those challenges .
As we had expected industry earnings for the third quarter were substantially below the prior year . "
Bair continued that while many large institutions continue to post losses " due to weaknesses in their portfolios , " the FDIC is " now seeing losses spread to a growing number of smaller institutions . "
Of the 22 failed institutions this year , nine of which occurred in the third quarter .
The list includes
Washington Mutual
-- the largest failure on record -- which was seized by regulators in September .
WaMu , which had $ 307 billion in assets , was sold to
JPMorgan Chase
( JPM ) - Get Report
for roughly $ 2 billion .
Another 73 institutions were acquired , bringing the total number of firms protected by the FDIC to 8,384 as of Sept. 30 .
Last month , the wave of acquisitions of troubled banks continued .
Several other banks also on the brink of failure agree to be sold .
Wachovia
( WB ) - Get Report
agreed to sell itself to
Wells Fargo
( WFC ) - Get Report
, after the San Francisco - based bank trumped
Citigroup's
( C ) - Get Report
original offer for the Charlotte , N.C. lender 's banking operations .
Late last month , another troubled bank ,
National City
( NCC ) , sold itself to
PNC Financial Services
( PNC ) - Get Report
.
Citigroup
on Monday joined the widening list of banks to require a government bailout , when Treasury agreed to inject another $ 20 billion in preferred equity from the Troubled Assets Relief Program , on top of an earlier $ 25 billion investment .
Federal regulators also agreed to backstop $ 306 billion in risky assets .
Banks continued to increase their provisioning for problem loans in both consumer and commercial portfolios .
The FDIC said loss provisions totaled $ 50.5 billion , compared to $ 16.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007 .
" The latest loss provisions absorbed a third of the industry 's net operating revenue , " according to the FDIC .
Charge - offs totaled $ 27.9 billion in the third quarter , or 1.42 % of loans , was the highest quarterly average since 1991 , the FDIC said .
Approximately two - thirds of the losses were loans tied to real estate , the FDIC said .
The FDIC warned that a " significant amount " of charge - off activity in the third quarter due to the failure of WaMu was not reflected in the quarterly numbers , due to purchase accounting rules applied by JPMorgan Chase .
" At this stage of the credit cycle , loan performance problems are spreading to a much wider range of lenders and categories of loans , " Bair said .
" This trend is linked to a weakening economy and uncertainty in financial markets . "
The FDIC 's insurance fund fell to $ 34.6 billion in the third quarter , from $ 45.2 billion at the end of June due to higher loss provisions for bank failures , the FDIC said .
Bair said the fund " may decline further " as the agency expects more banks to fail .
The FDIC said it has " ample authority to raise assessments to ensure that banking industry resources absorb all losses from bank failures and to protect insured depositors . "
The capital of the banking industry will support the FDIC fund .
So - called " well - capitalized " institutions held $ 1.25 trillion in total capital at Sept. 30 .
I have wondered , time and again why Senator John McCain has chosen , from among the many well - qualified female Republican politicians in the country , the least - qualified of women Sarah Palin .
Now , I think I finally understand his motives .
Governor Palin is a fundamentalist - Evangelical .
These women are trained or brainwashed early in life that they are " required " - to follow the directions given to them by the men in their lives .
Just as children are forced to obey , so are they .
Sarah Palin has been living this way her whole life .
When she was Mayor of Wasilla or Governor of Alaska , her husband Todd was right there guiding her .
He spent most of his time in her office and was sent all official emails , even though he was not a city or state employee .
Sarah never made a move without his strict instructions .
And so when she was selected by John McCain as his running mate , he had little training to do .
He simply gave her orders and she carried them out like a good little Christian soldier .
She is a neo - con 's delight and fulfills the dreams of those right - wingers to a " tee . " -
Her religious mind - set is programmed to accept any violence in the Middle East as God 's plan and any interference as being counter - productive to the inevitable " end times " - and the much anticipated " rapture . " -
This fits neatly into the right - wing 's abhorrence of diplomacy and the group 's salivation about and longing for a " bombing of Iran . " -
They honestly see aggression towards Israel as prophecy and current events as hard evidence of it .
But the only way all of their dreams can come true is if the Republicans can stay in power in the White House .
And since the McCain - Palin ticket , due in part to the financial crisis , as well as total incompetence and a country disgusted by Bush - Cheney and Republicans in general , seems to be sinking like a stone , Sarah Palin has been given her orders and Cindy McCain is being required to do her wifely dirty work as well .
Mrs. McCain at a recent rally , got up in front of the crowd and ranted , " The day Senator Obama decided to cast a vote to not fund my son when he was serving sent a cold chill through my body , " - the Washington Post reported .
Mrs. McCain failed to tell the crowd that her husband has also voted against funding the troops on more than one occasion .
I wonder how that made her body feel ?
Obama voted against a particular bill because it did not include a timeline for withdrawal .
What was McCain 's excuse ?
At this same rally the chairman of the Republican Party of Lehigh County Pennsylvania , William Platt , warmed up the crowd by encouraging them to work hard to elect McCain or to wake up on Nov. 5 to see " Barack Obama , Barack Hussein Obama as president , " - the Washington Post reported .
At another Palin rally , a man wearing a sheriff 's uniform repeated the name Barack Hussein Obama , and once again the intention was clear .
That man is now under federal investigation for using his position politically , although I must say that the Sheriff 's uniform made it much more official looking and scary to the crowd .
Sarah Palin is allowing and even inciting race - baiting at her rallies .
The use of Obama 's middle name is purposefully being repeated over and over again in an attempt to make him sound dangerous and foreign , or Muslim and un-American , despite the fact that Barack Obama is a born - in - the - USA Christian .
Palin has told crowds of supporters that Obama " pals - around with terrorists , " - a reference to his slight acquaintance with Bill Ayers - a '60s radical once involved with the Weather Underground .
Ayers was never convicted on any charges and Obama has condemned this group and its actions repeatedly .
But because of this exaggerated connection by a desperate GOP , Palin warns voters that they should be very suspicious and afraid of Barack Obama .
Palin informs her supporters that " I am just so fearful that this is not a man who sees America the way that you and I see America , as the greatest source for good in this world .
I 'm afraid this is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to work with a former domestic terrorist who has targeted his own country , "- CNN reported .
Palin and her husband
Todd might be seen as truly un-American because of their very real connection to a radical and traitor .
Both have close ties with the Alaskan Independence Party , a secessionist group whose founder Joe Vogler constantly railed about his hatred for the United States and its government , and desperately wanted Alaska to be a separate country .
Todd Palin was a member until 2002 , and Sarah attended conventions and gave supportive speeches to this anti-American group .
Maybe Sarah should be judged by her " real relationship " - to this group .
Until very recently , the official view of the pro-Republican supply - side camp was that while there may be some problems in the housing sector , the overall economy was doing great .
The talk of a recession was , to use the words of former McCain economic advisor Phil Gramm , merely reflecting a " mental recession " .
The fact that most Americans said they experienced economic hardship merely reflected how America had become " a nation of whiners " .
Others came up with an interpretation somewhat less dismissive of regular people .
While the economy was really doing great , the fact that many people thought otherwise simply reflected how it was being slandered by the liberal media .
If only the media had said that everything was going great , this view implicitly argued , then everyone would have thought the economy was going great and if they had simply argued that , then there would n't have been any problems .
In reality , the economy was not doing great , and the media was hardly slandering it .
It was if anything depicting it in a too positive way by consistently underestimating or failing to recognize the problems .
But more important , while the media depiction of the economy is not unimportant , it can't prevent problems from happening simply by lying and pretending the underlying causes of the inevitable problems do n't exist .
This theory is now being tested in Russia .
The Russian economy has been hit hard by the dramatic decline in the price of oil , its by far most important exports .
The rouble has therefore fallen significantly and the stock market is down 75 % .
Yet as the universally state - controlled medias have banned the use of words like " crisis " and " decline " with regard to the Russian economy , it continues to say that the Russian economy remains strong - and no dissenting opinion is allowed .
That alleged strength is of course universally credited to Vladimir Putin 's leadership .
We will now see in Russia whether or not the media can really prevent an economic downturn simply by not reporting bad news and pretending that everything is going great .
Since first of all many Russians can access foreign news sources and since secondly and far more importantly , economic downturns are not caused by psychology , I do n't think it will succeed .
In the early days of PHP programming , PHP code was limited to being procedural in nature .
Procedural code is characterized by the use of procedures for the building blocks of the application .
Procedures offer a certain level of reuse by allowing procedures to be called by other procedures .
However , without object - oriented language constructs , a programmer can still introduce OO characteristics into PHP code .
It ’s a tad more difficult and can make the code more difficult to read because it ’s mixing paradigms ( procedural language with pseudo - OO design ) .
OO constructs in PHP code — such as the ability to define and use classes , the ability to build relationships between classes that use inheritance , and the ability to define interfaces — make it much easier to build code that adheres to good OO practices .
While purely procedural designs without much modularity run just fine , the advantages of OO design show up in the maintenance .
Because a typical application will spend the bulk of its lifetime in maintenance , code maintenance is a large expense over the lifetime of an application .
It can also be easily forgotten during development .
If you ’re in a race to get your application developed and deployed , long - term maintainability can take a back seat to getting something to work .
Modularity — one of the key characteristics of good OO design — helps with this maintenance .
Modularity helps encapsulate change , which will make it easier to extend and modify the application over time .
While there are more than seven habits to building OO software overall , the seven habits here are what you need to make your code fit basic OO design criteria .
They give you a firm foundation upon which you can add more OO habits and build software that is easily maintained and extended .
These habits target a couple of the key characteristics of modularity .
For more information about the benefits of OO design that are language - independent , see Related topics .
The seven good PHP OO habits are :
Be modest .
Be a good neighbor .
Avoid looking at Medusa .
Embrace the weakest link .
You ’re rubber ; I ’m glue .
Keep it in the family .
Think in patterns .
Be modest
To be modest is to avoid exposing yourself in your implementations of classes and functions .
Hiding your information is a foundational habit .
You will have a difficult time building any of the other habits until you have developed the habit of hiding the details of your implementations .
Information - hiding is also known as encapsulation .
There are many reasons why exposing public fields directly is a bad habit , the most important of which is that it leaves you with no options should something in your implementation change .
You use OO concepts to isolate change , and encapsulation plays an integral role in making sure that any changes you make are n’t viral in nature .
Viral changes are those that start small — like changing an array that holds three elements to one that contains only two .
Suddenly , you find that you ’re changing more and more of your code to accommodate a change that should have been trivial .
One simple way to begin hiding your information is to keep fields private and to expose them with public accessors , which are like windows in your house .
Instead of having an entire wall open to the outside , you have only a window or two .
( I talk more about accessors in “ Good habit : Use public accessors . ” )
In addition to allowing your implementation behind the curtain to change , using public accessors instead of directly exposing fields allows you to build upon your base implementation by overriding the implementation of an accessor to do something slightly different from the behavior of the parent .
It also allows you to build an abstract implementation that defers the actual implementation to classes that override the base .
Bad habit : Expose public fields
In the bad code example in Listing 1 , the fields of the Person object are exposed directly as public fields instead of with accessors .
While this behavior is tempting , especially for lightweight data objects , it limits you .
Listing 1 .
Bad habit of exposing public fields
<? php class Person { public $ prefix ; public $ givenName ; public $ familyName ; public $ suffix ; } $ person = new Person ( ) ; $ person -> prefix = " Mr. " ; $ person-> givenName = " John " ; echo ( $ person -> prefix ) ; echo ( $ person-> givenName ) ; ?>

Show more icon
If anything changes with the object , any code that uses it needs to change as well .
For instance , if the person ’s given , family , and other names were to be encapsulated in a PersonName object , you would need to modify all your code to accommodate the change .
Good habit : Use public accessors
By using good OO habits ( see Listing 2 ) , the same object now has private fields instead of public fields , and the private fields are carefully exposed to the outside world by public get and set methods , called accessors .
These accessors now provide a public way of getting information from your PHP class so that if something in your implementation changes , the likelihood is lessened that you need to change all the code that uses your class .
Listing 2 . Good habit of using public accessors
<? php class Person { private $ prefix ; private $ givenName ; private $ familyName ; private $ suffix ; public function setPrefix ( $ prefix ) { $ this -> prefix = $ prefix ; } public function getPrefix ( ) { return $ this -> prefix ; } public function setGivenName ( $ gn ) { $ this -> givenName = $ gn ; } public function getGivenName ( ) { return $ this -> givenName ; } public function setFamilyName ( $fn ) { $ this -> family Name = $ fn ; } public function getFamilyName ( ) { return $ this -> family Name ; } public function setSuffix ( $ suffix ) { $ this -> suffix = $ suffix ; } public function getSuffix ( ) { return $ suffix ; } } $ person = new Person ( ) ; $ person->set Prefix ( " Mr. " ) ; $ person->setGivenName ( " John " ) ; echo ( $ person-> getPrefix ( ) ) ; echo ( $ person->getGivenName ( ) ) ; ?>

At first glance , this may seem like a lot more work , and it may actually be more work on the front end .
Typically , however , using good OO habits pays off in the long run , as future changes are greatly solidified .
In the version of the code shown in Listing 3 , I ’ve changed the internal implementation to use an associative array for the name parts .
Ideally , I ’d have more error handling and would be more careful with checking whether the element exists , but the purpose of this example is to show how the code using my class does n’t need to change — it is blissfully unaware of my class changes .
Remember that the reason for adopting OO habits is to carefully encapsulate change so your code is more extensible and maintainable .
Listing 3 .
Another twist on this good habit with a different internal implementation
<? php class Person { private $ personName = array ( ) ; public function setPrefix ( $ prefix ) { $ this -> personName [ ' prefix ' ] = $ prefix ; } public function getPrefix ( ) { return $ this -> personName [ ' prefix ' ] ; } public function setGivenName ( $ gn ) { $ this ->personName [ ' givenName ' ] = $ gn ; } public function getGivenName ( ) { return $ this ->personName [ ' givenName ' ] ; } /* etc... */ } /* *
Even though the internal implementation changed , the code here stays exactly * the same .
The change has been encapsulated only to the Person class .
*/ $ person = new Person ( ) ; $ person->set Prefix ( " Mr. " ) ; $ person->setGivenName ( " John " ) ; echo ( $ person-> getPrefix ( ) ) ; echo ( $ person->getGivenName ( ) ) ; ?>

Be a good neighbor
When you build a class , it should handle its own errors appropriately .
If the class does n’t know how to handle the errors , it should package them in a format that its caller understands .
In addition , avoid returning objects that are null or in an invalid state .
Many times , you can do this simply by verifying arguments and throwing specific exceptions that tell why the supplied arguments are invalid .
When you build this habit , it can save you — and people maintaining your code or using your objects — a lot of time .
Bad habit :
Not handling errors
Consider the example shown in Listing 4 , which accepts some arguments and returns a Person object with some of the values populated .
However , in the parsePersonName ( ) method , there is no validation to see whether the supplied $ val variable is null , a zero - length string or perhaps a string in a unparsable format .
The parsePersonName ( ) method does not return a Person object , but returns null .
Administrators or programmers using this method might be left scratching their heads and — at the very least — be in a place where they need to start setting breakpoints and debugging the PHP script .
Listing 4 .
Bad habit of not throwing or handling errors
class PersonUtils { public static function parsePersonName ( $ format , $ val ) { if ( strpos ( " , " , $ val ) >
0 ) { $ person = new Person ( ) ; $ parts = split ( " , " , $ val ) ; //
Assume the value is last , first $ person->setGivenName ( $ parts [ 1 ] ) ; $ person ->setFamilyName ( $ parts [ 0 ] ) ; } return $ person ; } } Show more Show more icon
The parsePersonName ( ) method in Listing 4 could be modified to initialize the Person object outside the if condition , ensuring that you always get a valid Person object .
However , you get a Person with no set properties , which does n’t leave you in a much better position .
Good habit : Each module handles its own errors
Instead of leaving your callers guessing , be proactive about validating arguments .
If an unset variable can’t produce a valid result , check for the variable and throw an InvalidArgumentException .
If the string ca n’t be empty or must be in a specific format , check for the format and throw an exception .
Listing 5 demonstrates how to create your own exceptions , as well as some new conditions in the parsePerson ( ) method that demonstrate some rudimentary validations .
Listing 5 . Good habit of throwing errors
<? php class InvalidPersonNameFormatException extends LogicException {} class PersonUtils { public static function parsePersonName ( $ format , $ val ) { if (! $ format ) { throw new InvalidPersonNameFormatException ( " Invalid PersonName format . " ) ; } if ( (! isset ( $val ) ) || strlen ( $ val ) == 0 ) { throw new InvalidArgumentException ( " Must supply a non-null value to parse . " ) ; } } } ?>

The bottom line is that you want people to be able to use your class without having to know the inner workings of it .
If they use it incorrectly or in a way you did n’t intend , they should n’t have to guess why it did n’t work .
As a good neighbor , you understand that people reusing your class are not psychic , and , therefore , you take the guesswork out .
Avoid looking at Medusa
When I was first learning about OO concepts , I was doubtful that interfaces were really helpful .
A colleague of mine drew the analogy that not using interfaces is like looking at the head of Medusa .
In Greek mythology , Medusa was a female character with snakes for hair .
Any person who looked at her directly turned to stone .
Perseus , who killed Medusa , was able to confront her by looking at her reflection in his shield , thus avoiding being turned to stone .
Interfaces are your mirror in dealing with Medusa .
When you use a specific , concrete implementation , your code must change if your implementation code changes .
Using implementations directly limits many of your options , as you ’ve essentially turned your classes to stone .
Bad habit :
Not using interfaces
Listing 6 shows an example that loads the Person object from a database .
It takes the person ’s name and returns the Person object in the database that matches .
Listing 6 . Bad habit of not using interfaces
<? php class DBPersonProvider { public function getPerson ( $ givenName , $ familyName ) { /* go to the database , get the person ... */ $ person = new Person ( ) ; $ person ->set Prefix ( " Mr. " ) ; $ person->setGivenName ( " John " ) ; return $ person ; } } /* I need to get person data ... */ $ provider = new DBPersonProvider ( ) ; $ person = $ provider -> getPerson ( " John " , " Doe " ) ; echo ( $ person -> getPrefix ( ) ) ; echo ( $ person->getGivenName ( ) ) ; ?>

The code for loading Person from the database is fine until something changes in the environment .
For example , loading Person from the database may be fine for the first version of the application , but for the second version , you may need to add the ability to load a person from a Web service .
In essence , the class has turned to stone because it is directly using the implementation class and is now brittle to change .
Good habit : Use interfaces
Listing 7 shows an example of code that does not change as new ways of loading users become available and are implemented .
The example shows an interface called PersonProvider , which declares a single method .
If any code uses a PersonProvider , the code restrains from using the implementation classes directly .
Instead , it uses PersonProvider as if it were a real object .
Listing 7 .
Good habit of using interfaces
<? php interface PersonProvider { public function getPerson ( $ givenName , $ familyName ) ; } class DBPersonProvider implements PersonProvider { public function getPerson ( $ givenName , $ familyName ) { /* pretend to go to the database , get the person ... */ $ person = new Person ( ) ; $ person ->set Prefix ( " Mr. " ) ; $ person->setGivenName ( " John " ) ; return $ person ; } } class PersonProviderFactory { public static function createProvider ( $ type ) { if ( $ type == ' database ' ) { return new DBPersonProvider ( ) ; } else { return new NullProvider ( ) ; } } } $ config = ' database ' ; /* I need to get person data ... */ $ provider = PersonProviderFactory :: createProvider ( $ config ) ; $ person = $ provider -> getPerson ( " John " , " Doe " ) ; echo ( $ person -> getPrefix ( ) ) ; echo ( $ person->getGivenName ( ) ) ; ?>

When you use interfaces , try to avoid ever referring to the implementation classes directly .
Instead , use something external to your object to give you the correct implementation .
If your class loads the implementation based on some logic , it still needs to require the definitions of all the implementation classes , and that does n’t get you anywhere .
You can use a Factory pattern to create an instance of an implementation class that implements your interface .
A factory method , by convention , begins with create and returns the interface .
It can take whatever arguments are necessary for your factory to figure out which implementation class is the correct one to return .
In Listing 7 , the createProvider ( ) method simply takes a $ type .
If the $ type is set to database , the factory returns an instance of DBPersonProvider .
Any new implementation for loading people from a store does not require any changes in the class that uses the factory and interface .
The DBPersonProvider implements the PersonProvider interface and has the actual implementation of the getPerson ( ) method in it .
Embrace the weakest link
Loosely coupling your modules is a good thing ; it ’s one of the properties that allows you to encapsulate change .
Two of the other habits — “ Be modest ” and “ Avoid looking at Medusa ” — help you work toward building modules that are loosely coupled .
To loosely couple your classes , develop the final characteristic by building the habit of lowering the dependencies of your classes .
Bad habit : Tight coupling
In Listing 8 , lowering dependencies is not necessarily lowering the dependencies for the client using an object .
Rather , the example demonstrates lowering your dependencies on the correct class and minimizing them elsewhere .
Listing 8 .
Bad habit of tight coupling from Address
<? php require_once " ./AddressFormatters.php " ; class Address { private $ addressLine1 ; private $ addressLine2 ; private $ city ; private $ state ; // or province ... private $ postalCode ; private $ country ; public function setAddressLine1 ( $ line1 ) { $ this ->addressLine1 = $ line1 ; } /* accessors , etc ... */ public function getCountry ( ) { return $ this -> country ; } public function format ( $ type ) { if ( $ type == " inline " ) { $ formatter = new InlineAddressFormatter ( ) ; } else if ( $ type == " multiline " ) { $ formatter = new MultilineAddressFormatter ( ) ; } else { $ formatter = new NullAddressFormatter ( ) ; } return $ formatter -> format ( $ this ->getAddressLine1 ( ) , $ this ->getAddressLine2 ( ) , $ this -> getCity ( ) , $ this -> getState ( ) , $ this ->getPostalCode ( ) , $ this ->getCountry ( ) ) ; } } $ addr = new Address ( ) ; $ addr->setAddressLine1 ( " 123 Any St. " ) ; $ addr->setAddressLine2( " Ste 200 " ) ; $ addr->setCity ( " Anytown " ) ; $ addr->setState ( " AY " ) ; $ addr->setPostalCode ( " 55555-0000 " ) ; $ addr->setCountry ( " US " ) ; echo ( $ addr - > format ( " multiline " ) ) ; echo ( "
" ) ; echo ( $ addr - > format ( " inline " ) ) ; echo ( "
" ) ; ?>

The code that calls the format ( ) method on the Address object might look great — all it does is use the Address class , call format ( ) , and it ’s done .
In contrast , the Address class is not so lucky .
It needs to know about the various formatters used to properly format it , which might not make the Address object very reusable for someone else , particularly if that someone else is n’t interested in using the formatter classes in the format ( ) method .
Although the code using Address does n’t have many dependencies , the Address class does have quite a few when it probably should just be a simple data object .
The Address class is tightly coupled with the implementation classes that know how to format the Address object .
Good habit : Loose coupling between objects
When building good OO designs , it ’s necessary to think about a concept called Separation of Concerns ( SoC ) .
SoC means that you try to separate objects by what they should be really concerned about , thus , lowering the coupling .
In the original Address class , it had to be concerned about how to format itself .
That ’s probably not a good design .
Rather , an Address class should think about the parts of the Address , while some type of formatter should worry about how to properly format the address .
In Listing 9 , the code that formatted the address is moved to interfaces , implementation classes , and a factory — building the “ use interfaces ” habit .
Now , the AddressFormatUtils class is responsible for creating a formatter and formatting an Address .
Any other object now can use an Address without having to worry about also requiring the definitions of the formatters .
Listing 9 .
Good habit of loose coupling between objects
<? php interface AddressFormatter { public function format ( $ addressLine1 , $ addressLine2 , $ city , $ state , $ postalCode , $ country ) ; } class MultiLineAddressFormatter implements AddressFormatter { public function format ( $ addressLine1 , $ addressLine2 , $ city , $ state , $ postalCode , $ country ) { return sprintf ( " %s
%s
%s , %s %s
%s " , $ addressLine1 , $ addressLine2 , $ city , $ state , $ postalCode , $ country ) ; } } class InlineAddress Formatter implements AddressFormatter { public function format ( $ addressLine1 , $ addressLine2 , $ city , $ state , $ postalCode , $ country ) { return sprintf ( " %s %s , %s , %s %s %s " , $ addressLine1 , $ addressLine2 , $ city , $ state , $ postalCode , $ country ) ; } } class AddressFormatUtils { public static function formatAddress ( $ type , $ address ) { $ formatter = AddressFormatUtils :: createAddressFormatter ( $type ) ; return $ formatter -> format ( $ address->getAddressLine1 ( ) , $ address->getAddressLine2 ( ) , $ address ->getCity ( ) , $ address -> getState ( ) , $ address->getPostalCode ( ) , $ address -> getCountry ( ) ) ; } private static function createAddressFormatter ( $type ) { if ( $ type == " inline " ) { $ formatter = new InlineAddressFormatter ( ) ; } else if ( $ type == " multiline " ) { $ formatter = new MultilineAddressFormatter ( ) ; } else { $ formatter = new NullAddressFormatter ( ) ; } return $ formatter ; } } $ addr = new Address ( ) ; $ addr->setAddressLine1( " 123 Any St. " ) ; $ addr->setAddressLine2( " Ste 200 " ) ; $ addr->setCity ( " Anytown " ) ; $ addr->setState ( " AY " ) ; $ addr->setPostalCode ( " 55555-0000 " ) ; $ addr->setCountry ( " US " ) ; echo( AddressFormatUtils :: formatAddress ( " multiline " , $ addr ) ) ; echo ( "
" ) ; echo( AddressFormatUtils : : formatAddress ( " inline " , $ addr ) ) ; echo ( "
" ) ; ?>

The drawback , of course , is that whenever patterns are used , it often means the amount of artifacts ( classes , files ) goes up .
However , this increase is offset by the decreased maintenance in each class and can be decreased even more when proper reusability is gained .
You ’re rubber ; I ’m glue
Highly cohesive OO designs are focused and organized in related modules .
Learning about “ concerns ” is important in determining how to organize functions and classes to be tightly cohesive .
Bad habit : Low cohesion
When a design has low cohesion , it has classes and methods that are not grouped well .
The term spaghetti code is often used to describe classes and methods that are bunched together and have low cohesion .
Listing 10 provides an example of spaghetti code .
The relatively generic Utils class uses many different objects and has many dependencies .
It does a bit of everything , making it difficult to reuse .
Listing 10 .
Bad habit of low cohesion
<? php class Utils { public static function formatAddress ( $ formatType , $ address1 , $ address2 , $ city , $ state ) { return " some address string " ; } public static function formatPersonName ( $ formatType , $ givenName , $ familyName ) { return " some person name " ; } public static function parseAddress ( $ formatType , $ val ) { // real implementation would set values , etc ... return new Address ( ) ; } public static function parseTelephoneNumber ( $ formatType , $ val ) { // real implementation would set values , etc... return new TelephoneNumber ( ) ; } } ?>

Good habit : Embrace high cohesion
High cohesion means that classes and methods that are related to each other are grouped .
If methods and classes are highly cohesive , you are able to easily split off entire groups without affecting the design .
Designs with high cohesion offer the opportunity for lower coupling .
Listing 11 shows two of the methods that are better organized into classes .
The AddressUtils class contains methods for dealing with Address classes and shows high cohesion among the address - related methods .
Likewise , PersonUtils contains methods that deal specifically with Person objects .
These two new classes with their highly cohesive methods have low coupling because they can be used completely independently of one another .
Listing 11 .
Good habit of high cohesion
<? php class AddressUtils { public static function formatAddress ( $ formatType , $ address1 , $ address2 , $ city , $ state ) { return " some address string " ; } public static function parseAddress ( $ formatType , $ val ) { // real implementation would set values , etc ... return new Address ( ) ; } } class PersonUtils { public static function formatPersonName ( $ formatType , $ givenName , $ familyName ) { return " some person name " ; } public static function parsePersonName ( $ formatType , $ val ) { // real implementation would set values , etc... return new PersonName ( ) ; } } ?>

Keep it in the family
I often tell people on the software teams on which I ’ve been a technical lead or architect that the greatest enemy of OO languages is a copy - and - paste operation .
When used in the absence of an up - front OO design , nothing creates more havoc than copying code from one file to the next .
Wherever you ’re tempted to copy code from one class to the next , stop and consider how you can use class hierarchies to leverage similar or identical functionality .
You will find that in most cases , with good design , copying code is completely unnecessary .
Bad habit :
Not using class hierarchies
Listing 12 shows a simple example of partial classes .
They start with duplicate fields and methods — not good in the long term when the application might need to change .
If there was a defect in the Person class , there would most likely be a defect in the Employee class as well because it appears as though the implementation was copied between the two .
Listing 12 .
Bad habit of not using hierarchies
<? php class Person { private $ givenName ; private $ familyName ; } class Employee { private $ givenName ; private $ familyName ; } ?>

Inheritance is a difficult habit to start using because often , the analysis to build proper inheritance models can take a lot of time .
Conversely , using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to build new implementations takes only seconds .
But the time is usually offset rather quickly in maintenance , where the application will actually spend most of its time .
Good habit : Leverage inheritance
In Listing 13 , the new Employee class extends the Person class .
It now inherits all the common methods and does n’t reimplement them .
Additionally , Listing 13 shows the use of an abstract method to demonstrate how basic functionality can be put into a base class and specific functionality can be deterred to an implementation class .
Listing 13 .
Good habit of leveraging inheritance
<? php abstract class Person { private $ givenName ; private $ familyName ; public function setGivenName ( $ gn ) { $ this -> givenName = $ gn ; } public function getGivenName ( ) { return $ this -> givenName ; } public function setFamilyName ( $fn ) { $ this -> family Name = $ fn ; } public function getFamilyName ( ) { return $ this -> familyName ; } public function sayHello ( ) { echo ( " Hello , I am " ) ; $ this ->introduceSelf ( ) ; } abstract public function introduceSelf ( ) ; } class Employee extends Person { private $ role ; public function setRole ( $r ) { $ this -> role = $ r ; } public function getRole ( ) { return $ this -> role ; } public function introduceSelf ( ) { echo ( $ this -> getRole ( ) . " " . $ this ->getGivenName ( ) . " " . $ this ->getFamilyName ( ) ) ; } } ?>

Think in patterns
Design patterns are common interactions of objects and methods that have been proven over time to resolve certain problems .
When you think in design patterns , you ’re forcing yourself to be aware of how classes interact with each other .
It ’s an easy way to build classes and their interactions without having to make the same mistakes other people have made in the past and to benefit from proven designs .
Bad habit : Consider one object at a time
There is really no adequate code example that demonstrates thinking in patterns ( although there are plenty of good examples showing pattern implementations ) .
However , generally speaking , you know you ’re considering only one object at a time when the following criteria are met :
You do n’t diagram an object model ahead of time .
You start coding the implementation of single methods without much of the model stubbed out .
You do n’t use design pattern names when talking and would rather talk about implementation .
Good habit : Adding objects , in concert , composed in patterns
Generally speaking , you are thinking in patterns when you :
Model classes and their interactions ahead of time .
Stereotype classes according to their patterns .
Use pattern names , like Factory , Singleton , and Facade .
Stub out large portions of the model , then start adding implementation .
Conclusion
Building good OO habits in PHP helps you build more stable , easily maintainable , and more easily extensible applications .
Remember :
Be modest .
Be a good neighbor .
Avoid looking at Medusa .
Embrace the weakest link .
You ’re rubber , I ’m glue .
Keep it in the family .
Think in patterns .
As you build and get into these habits , you ’re likely to be surprised at the changes in the quality of your applications .
Der Chaos Computer Club ( CCC ) hat mit Hilfe freiwilliger Wahlbeobachter am 28 .
September 2008 in zehn brandenburgischen Kommunen eine weitere Wahlbeobachtung durchgeführt .
Ziel war es , den tatsächlichen Einsatz von Wahlcomputern bei den Kommunalwahlen zu dokumentieren und die Behauptungen des Wahlcomputer - Herstellers sowie der zuständigen Bundes - und Landeswahlbehörden zur Sicherheit , Akzeptanz und Bedienerfreundlichkeit zu überprüfen .
Der CCC veröffentlicht heute einen umfänglichen Wahlbeobachterbericht . [ 1 ]
Nach den Beobachtungen in den Wahllokalen ist klar , daß wichtige Regeln beim Einsatz der manipulationsanfälligen Wahlcomputer weiterhin mißachtet wurden .
Im Detail wurden die schon bei früheren Wahlbeobachtungen [ 2 ] festgestellten Sicherheitsprobleme sowie Schwierigkeiten bei Aufbau , Betrieb , Auszählung und der eigentlichen Wahlhandlung bestätigt .
Auch die Versprechen der Hersteller und Verkäufer der Wahlcomputer , daß Personal und damit Kosten gespart würden , wurden eindeutig widerlegt .
Es zeigte sich weiterhin , daß auch nach der breiten Debatte in der Öffentlichkeit sowie der unmittelbar bevorstehenden mündlichen Anhörung vor dem Bundesverfassungsgericht am Dienstag , den 28 .
Oktober , in den Gemeinden kaum ausreichende Sensibilität für die Probleme und Gefahren des Wahlcomputereinsatzes besteht .
Die Vertrauensseeligkeit der Wahlhelfer ist ungebrochen , sagte CCC - Sprecher Dirk Engling , doch das bereits unterminierte Vertrauen der Wähler in die Korrektheit des Wahlergebnisses schwindet zusehends .
Die Schwierigkeiten im Umgang mit den Nedap - Wahlcomputern betrafen nicht nur die Wahlvorsteher und Wahlhelfer , die mit Technikausfällen und der komplexen Benutzerführung zu kämpfen hatten .
Auch die Wähler mußten häufig bei der Stimmabgabe unterstützt werden , benötigten aufgrund der mangelhaften Beschriftung eigens bereitgehaltene Leselupen und mußten zudem vielerorts lange Wartezeiten in Kauf nehmen .
Einige Wähler wurden dadurch sogar von der Wahl ausgeschlossen .
Wer geglaubt hatte , bei den bisherigen Beobachtungen schon alle Möglichkeiten des Versagens dieser Risikotechnik gesehen zu haben , konnte noch unangenehm überrascht werden , sagte CCC - Sprecher Dirk Engling .
Die Wahlcomputer waren eine Zumutung für die Wähler und eine Nervenprobe für die Wahlhelfer .
Von der Illusion " geschützter Umgebungen " bei Lagerung und Transport hatten sich die Wahlbeobachter schon bei früheren Einsätzen verabschiedet .
Auch diesmal wurde allzu leichtfertiger Umgang mit den manipulationsanfälligen Computern beobachtet : Von der Lagerung über Nacht in ungesicherten Hinterzimmern , über fehlende Versiegelungen bis hin zu unbeaufsichtigtem Transport der Speichermodule mit den elektronischen Wahlergebnisse boten sich Möglichkeiten zur Manipulation zuhauf .
Es ist nun das Gebot der Stunde , Konsequenzen aus dem multiplen Versagen der Technik zu ziehen .
Die Bundesrepublik sollte dem Beispiel der Niederlande folgen und Wahlcomputer grundsätzlich abschaffen , bevor wir hier Verhältnisse wie in Florida oder Ohio bekommen , kommentierte Engling die Ergebnisse der Beobachtung .
Auch in den USA werden bei den anstehenden Präsidentenwahlen zum wiederholten Male massive Probleme mit defekten oder manipulierten Wahlcomputern erwartet .
Bei der Wahl in Brandenburg war es nicht möglich , die vom Computer errechneten Ergebnisse unabhängig zu überprüfen , da Nedap - Wahlcomputer keine solche Prüfung zulassen .
Selbst die alten Nedap - Computer ohne Schutz vor dem Ausspionieren der Wählerstimme durch Funkabstrahlung waren weiter zulässig und im Einsatz .
Der CCC bedankt sich herzlich bei allen Freiwilligen !

Of the two big Fed loans , the smaller one , the $ 38 billion supplementary lending facility , was extended solely to prevent further losses in the securities - lending business .
So far , $ 18 billion has been drawn down for that purpose .
For securities lending , an institution with a long time horizon makes extra money by lending out securities to shorter - term borrowers .
The borrowers are often hedge funds setting up short trades , betting a stock ’s price will fall .
They typically give A.I.G. cash or cashlike instruments in return .
Then , while A.I.G. waits for the borrowers to bring back the securities , it invests the money .
In the last few months , borrowers came back for their money , and A.I.G. did not have enough to repay them because of market losses on its investments .
Through the secondary lending facility , the insurer is now sending those investments to the Fed , and getting cash in turn to repay customers .
A spokesman for the insurer , Nicholas J. Ashooh , said A.I.G. did not anticipate having to use the entire $ 38 billion facility .
At midyear , A.I.G. had a shortfall of $ 15.6 billion in that program , which it says has grown to $ 18 billion .
Another spokesman , Joe Norton , said the company was getting out of this business .
Of the government ’s original $ 85 billion line of credit , the company has drawn down about $ 72 billion .
It must pay 8.5 percent interest on those funds .
An estimated $ 13 billion of the money was needed to make good on investment accounts that A.I.G. typically offered to municipalities , called guaranteed investment contracts , or G.I.C.’s .
When a local government issues a construction bond , for example , it places the proceeds in a guaranteed investment contract , from which it can draw the funds to pay contractors .
After the insurer ’s credit rating was downgraded in September , its G.I.C. customers had the right to pull out their proceeds immediately .
Regulators say that A.I.G. had to come up with $ 13 billion , more than half of its total G.I.C. business .
Rather than liquidate some investments at losses , it used that much of the Fed loan .
When you approached me and insisted that despite your leadership 's preference to use the issue to gain a political advantage in the 2006 elections , you were personally committed to achieving a result that would reflect credit on the entire Senate and offer the country a better example of political leadership , I concluded your professed concern for the institution and the public interest was genuine and admirable .
Thank you for disabusing me of such notions with your letter .
...
I 'm embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics I failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in political to make self - interested partisan posturing appear more noble .
Again , sorry for the confusion , but please be assured I wo n't make the same mistake again …
I understand how important the opportunity to lead your party 's effort to exploit this issue must seem to a freshman Senator , and I hold no hard feelings over your earlier disingenuousness .
Again , I have been around long enough to appreciate that in politics the public interest is n't always a priority for every one of us .
Good luck to you , Senator .
McCain having directed this level of rancor at Obama two and a half years ago further contextualizes his refusal to even look at Obama during the debate ( which I 've no doubt is attributable to a number of other things , too ) .
McCain basically told Obama in official correspondence he 's got no respect for him — and now he finds himself two years later going toe - to - toe in a campaign for the presidency with the freshman senator he deemed disingenuous and un-admirable — and he 's losing to him .
It 's no wonder he can't look him in the eye .

Mustang Bobby 's earlier post about Obama , McCain , and the dichotomy of their individual willingness to engage in bipartisanship , put me in mind of an incident from February of 2006 , before the Democrats regained control of Congress , that I 'm surprised has n't received more play during this campaign : Obama asked McCain if he would consider co-sponsoring a Democratic proposal on ethics reform , instead of appointing a separate task force on the issue , as McCain wanted to do .
The Dems , you see , had already introduced legislation , the Honest Leadership Act , which addressed many of the things McCain was saying he wanted to appoint a task force to explore ; ergo , Obama was hoping that McCain would instead just sign on with the Dems ' instead of wasting time with a task force .
Obama 's letter ( pdf ) was extremely polite and professional — but , reading between the lines , one can see Obama was also essentially calling McCain 's bluff and testing his claims of being a wild and crazy maverick who knows how to reach across the aisle and shit , as calling for a task force is often a strategy employed by a senator who only wants toto care about an issue without actually having to take a stand , as the task force " investigation " indefinitely delays establishing a firm position .
Here was an ethics reform package ready to rock and roll — so Obama asked ( again , politely and professionally ) for McCain to sign on .
McCain 's response ( pdf ) , which Matt Stoller called " the single most bitter , nasty letters I have ever seen from any Senator , " was not only shocking in its tenor , but put paid the lie that McCain cares about reform and bipartisanship .
( Newser ) – Japan has one of the lowest birth rates in the world , thanks , health experts say , to an overworked populace too tired to have much sex .

New pictures of never - before - seen parts of Mercury taken by NASA ’s Messenger spacecraft are revealing surprises about the solar system ’s innermost planet .
Usually the deepest craters are the biggest , but on Mercury there are two craters right next to each other that are about the same size even though one is four times deeper than the other .
What ’s going on ?
The shallow crater basin , which is about the size of the greater Washington , D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan area , has been filled in with a massive amount of lava , according to Maria Zuber of MIT , one of the leaders of the Messenger mission .
The 3,600 cubic miles of lava would be enough to cover the cities in a 1.5 - miles thick layer .
The lava comes from volcanoes that were first discovered on Messenger ’s first flyby of the planet in January .
" The surprise is that it appears to be more volcanic than the moon , " Zuber said at a press conference .
" Very few people would have thought that before the first Messenger flyby . "
The latest images were taken during Messenger ’s second flyby of Mercury on Oct.
6 . Combining the images with Zuber ’s altimetry data gave the features depth and yielded a wealth of new information about the planet .
The spacecraft will make one more flyby in the future and eventually settle into orbit around the planet in 2011 .
But scientists are already poring over the data they ’ve collected .
" I am just absolutely thrilled with the result , " Zuber told Wired.com ,
" for somebody who does tectonic and volcanic modeling , I am in my element . "
Our first glimpses of Mercury came from three flybys by Mariner 10 in the 1970s that captured 45 percent of the surface of the planet .
Messenger ’s first flyby took the first - ever pictures of Mercury ’s western hemisphere , adding an additional 21 percent to the viewed surface .
After the second flyby on Oct. 6 , 90 percent of the planet has been imaged at 1 km ( 3,280 feet ) resolution .
Once in orbit , Messenger will boost the resolution to 850 feet .
The double image at the top of the post shows Mercury ’s true colors on the left , and an exaggerated false - color image on the right taken using 11 different color filters .
The video was made the same way .
Bringing out the color this way can help geologists make guesses about the age and composition of the terrain .
Younger , rougher ground , such as the ejecta from a meteorite impact , shows up yellow .
Over time , smaller impacts and the solar wind will wear it down and turn it more red .
Orange areas are likely from volcanic eruptions , and the blue areas are still somewhat of a mystery .
Once in orbit , Messenger will pass over the surface more slowly and gather detailed data that will help scientists understand the mineral composition of the different areas .

" Charlie would have thought it ridiculous . "
" The family is very happy and relieved that this ordeal is over . "
" The coffin containing the body of Charlie Chaplin - missing since his grave was robbed 11 weeks ago - has been found .
It was dug up from a field about a mile away from the Chaplin home in Corsier near Lausanne , Switzerland .
The legendary comedian died on Christmas Day last year , aged 88 .
He was buried two days later in the village of Corsier in the hills above Lake Geneva .
- Lady Oona ChaplinSwiss police have arrested two men - a Pole aged 24 and a Bulgarian aged 38 - and say they have confessed to stealing the coffin and reburying it .
Names of the accused have not been released , but police say they are both motor mechanics .
They were traced after police kept a watch on 200 phone kiosks and tapped the Chaplins ' phone after the family received ransom demands of £ 400,000 for return of the body after it went missing in March .
Sir Charles ' 51 - year - old widow , Lady Oona Chaplin , refused to pay up saying : " Charlie would have thought it ridiculous . "
In further calls the kidnappers made threats to harm her two youngest children .
The family kept silent about the ransom demands and various rumours circulated about the missing coffin .
One Hollywood report suggested it had been dug up because Sir Charles was a Jew buried in a gentile cemetery .
Lady Chaplin , daughter of playwright Eugene O'Neill inherited about £ 12 m after the death of her husband .
The couple and their eight children have been living in Lausanne since 1952 .
A spokesman for the Chaplins said : Superintendent Gabriel Cettou , the head of the Geneva police , said the two men would be charged with attempted extortion and disturbing the peace of the dead .

Effect of the Great Principles Proclaimed by the French Revolution .
From the time when the Revolution brought down to the masses its Gospel - not the mystic but the rational , not the heavenly but the earthly , not the divine but the human Gospel , the Gospel of the Rights of Man - ever since it proclaimed that all men are equal , that all men are entitled to liberty and equality , the masses of all European countries , of all the civilized world , awakening gradually from the sleep which had kept them in bondage ever since Christianity drugged them with its opium , began to ask themselves whether they too , had the right to equality , freedom , and humanity .
As soon as this question was posed , the people , guided by their admirable sound sense as well as by their instincts , realized that the first condition of their real emancipation , or of their humanization , was above all a radical change in their economic situation .
The question of daily bread is to them justly the first question , for as it was noted by Aristotle , man , in order to think , in order to feel himself free , in order to become man , must be freed from the material cares of daily life .
For that matter , the bourgeois , who are so vociferous in their outcries against the materialism of the people and who preach to the latter the abstinences of idealism , know it very well , for they themselves preach it only by word and not by example .
The second question arising before the people - that of leisure after work - is the indispensable condition of humanity .
But bread and leisure can never be obtained apart from a radical transformation of existing society , and that explains why the Revolution , impelled by the implications of its own principles , gave birth to Socialism .
Socialism Is Justice ... Socialism is justice .
When we speak of justice , we understand thereby not the justice contained in the Codes and in Roman jurisprudence - which were based to a great extent upon facts of violence achieved by force , violence consecrated by time and by the benedictions of some church or other ( Christian or pagan ) , and as such accepted as absolute principles , from which all law is to be deduced by a process of logical reasoning - no , we speak of that justice which is based solely upon human conscience , the justice to be found in the consciousness of every man - even in that of children - and which can be expressed in a single word : equity .
This universal justice which , owing to conquests by force and religious influences , has never yet prevailed in the political or juridical or economic worlds , should become the basis of the new world .
Without it there can be neither liberty , nor republic , nor prosperity , nor peace .
It then must govern our resolutions in order that we work effectively toward the establishment of peace .
And this justice urges us to take upon ourselves the defense of the interests of the terribly maltreated people and demand their economic and social emancipation along with political freedom .
The Basic Principle of Socialism .
We do not propose here , gentlemen , this or any other socialist system .
What we demand now is the proclaiming anew of the great principle of the French Revolution : that every human being should have the material and moral means to develop all his humanity , a principle which , in our opinion , is to be translated into the following problem :
To organize society in such a manner that every individual , man or woman , should find , upon entering life , approximately equal means for the development of his or her diverse faculties and their utilization in his or her work .
And to organize such a society that , rendering impossible the exploitation of anyone 's labor , will enable every individual to enjoy the social wealth , which in reality is produced only by collective labor , but to enjoy it only in so far as he contributes directly toward the creation of that wealth .
State Socialism Rejected .
The carrying out of this task will of course take centuries of development .
But history has already brought it forth and henceforth we cannot ignore it without condemning ourselves to utter impotence .
We hasten to add here that we vigorously reject any attempt at social organization which would not admit the fullest liberty of individuals and organizations , or which would require the setting up of any regimenting power whatever .
In the name of freedom , which we recognize as the only foundation and the only creative principle of organization , economic or political , we shall protest against anything remotely resembling State Communism , or State Socialism .
Abolition of the Inheritance Law .
The only thing which , in opinion , the State can and should do , is first to modify little by little inheritance law so as to arrive as soon as possible at its complete abolition .
That law being purely a creation of the State , and one of the conditions of the very existence of the authoritarian and divine State can and should be abolished by freedom in the State .
In other words , State should dissolve itself into a society freely organized in accord with the principles of justice .
Inheritance right , in our opinion , should abolished , for so long as it exists there will be hereditary economic inequality , not the natural inequality of individuals , but the artificial man inequality of classes - and the latter will always beget hereditary equality in the development and shaping of minds , continuing to be source and consecration of all political and social inequalities .
The task of justice is to establish equality for everyone , inasmuch that equality will depend upon the economic and political organization society - an equality with which everyone is going to begin his life , that everyone , guided by his own nature , will be the product of his own efforts .
In our opinion , the property of the deceased should accrue to social fund for the instruction and education of children of both sexes including their maintenance from birth until they come of age .
As Slavs and as Russians , we shall add that with us the fundamental social idea , bas upon the general and traditional instinct of our populations , is that las the property of all the people , should be owned only by those who cultivate it with their own hands .
We are convinced gentlemen , that this principle is just , that it is essential and inevitable condition of all serious social reform , and consequently Western Europe in turn will not fail to recognize and accept this principle , notwithstanding the difficulties of its realization in countries as in France , for instance where the majority of peasants own the land which they cultivate , but where most of those very peasants will soon end up by owning next to nothing , owing to the parceling out of land coming as the inevitable result of the political and economic system now prevailing in France .
We shall , however , refrain from offering any proposals on the land question ... We shall confine ourselves now to proposing the following declaration :
The Declaration of Socialism .
" Convinced that the serious realization of liberty , justice , and peace will be impossible so long as the majority of the population remains dispossessed of elementary needs , so long as it is deprived of education and is condemned to political and social insignificance and slavery - in fact if not by law - by poverty as well as by the necessity of working without rest or leisure , producing all the wealth upon which the world now prides itself , and receiving in return only such a small pan thereof that it hardly suffices to assure its livelihood for the next day ;
" Convinced that for all that mass of population , terribly maltreated for centuries , the problem of bread is the problem of mental emancipation , of freedom and humanity ;
" Convinced that freedom without Socialism is privilege and injustice and that Socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality ;
" The League [ for Peace and Freedom ] loudly proclaims the necessity of a radical social and economic reconstruction , having for its aim the emancipation of people 's labor from the yoke of capital and property owners , a reconstruction based upon strict justice - neither juridical nor theological nor metaphysical justice , but simply human justice - upon positive science and upon the widest freedom . "
Organization of Productive Forces in Place of Political Power .
It is necessary to abolish completely , both in principle and in fact , all that which is called political power ; for , so long as political power exists , there will be ruler and ruled , masters and slaves , exploiters and exploited .
Once abolished , political power should be replaced by an organization of productive forces and economic service .
Notwithstanding the enormous development of modern states - a development which in its ultimate phase is quite logically reducing the State to an absurdity - it is becoming evident that the days of the State and the State principle are numbered .
Already we can see approaching the full emancipation of the toiling masses and their free social organization , free from governmental intervention , formed by economic associations of the people and brushing aside all the old State frontiers and national distinctions , and having as its basis only productive labor , humanized labor , having one common interest in spite of its diversity .
The Ideal of the People .
This ideal of course appears to the people as signifying first of all the end of want , the end of poverty , and the full satisfaction of all material needs by means of collective labor , equal and obligatory for all , and then , as the end of domination and the free organization of the people 's lives in accordance with their needs - not from the top down , as we have it in the State , but from the bottom up , an organization formed by the people themselves , apart from all governments and parliaments , a free union of associations of agricultural and factory workers , of communes , regions , and nations , and finally , in the more remote future ; the universal human brotherhood , triumphing above the ruins of all States .
The Program of a Free Society .
Outside of the Mazzinian system which is the system of the republic in the form of a State , there is no other system but that of the republic as a commune , the republic as a federation , a Socialist and a genuine people 's republic - the system of Anarchism .
It is the politics of the Social Revolution , which aims at the abolition of the State , and the economic , altogether free organization of the people , an organization from below upward , by means of a federation .
... There will be no possibility of the existence of a political government , for this government will be transformed into a simple administration of common affairs .
Our program can be summed up in a few words :
Peace , emancipation , and the happiness of the oppressed .
War upon all oppressors and all despoilers .
Full restitution to workers : all the capital , the factories , and all instruments of work and raw materials to go to the associations , and the land to those who cultivate it with their own hands .
Liberty , justice , and fraternity in regard to all human beings upon the earth .
Equality for all .
To all , with no distinction whatever , all the means of development , education , and upbringing , and the equal possibility of living while working .
Organizing of a society by means of a free federation from below upward , of workers associations , industrial as well as a agricultural , scientific as well as literary associations - first into a commune , then a federation communes into regions , of regions into nations , and of nations into international fraternal association .
Correct Tactics During a Revolution .
In a social revolution , which in everything is diametrically opposed to a political revolution , the a of individuals hardly count at all , whereas the spontaneous action of masses is everything .
All that individuals can do is to clarify , propagate , and work out ideas corresponding to the popular instinct , and , what is more , to contribute their incessant efforts to revolutionary organization of the natural power of the masses - but nothing else beyond that ; the rest can and should be done by the people themselves .
Any other method would lead to political dictatorship , to the re-emergence of the State , of privileges of inequalities of all the oppressions of the State - that is , it would lead in a roundabout but logical way toward re-establishment of political , social , and economic slavery of the masses of people .
Varlin and all his friends , like all sincere Socialists , and in general like all workers born and brought up among the people , shared to a high degree this perfectly legitimate bias against the initiative coming from isolated individuals , against the domination exercised by superior individuals , and being above all consistent , they extended the same prejudice and distrust to their own persons .
Revolution by Decrees Is Doomed to Failure .
Contrary to the ideas of the authoritarian Communists , altogether fallacious ideas in my opinion , that the Social Revolution can be decreed and organized by means of a dictatorship or a Constituent Assembly - our friends , the Parisian Social - Socialists , held the opinion that that revolution can be waged and brought to fits full development only through the spontaneous and continued mass action of groups and associations of the people .
Our Parisian friends were a thousand times right .
For , indeed , there is no mind , much as it may be endowed with the quality of a genius ; or if we speak of a collective dictatorship consisting of several hundred supremely endowed individuals - there is no combination of intellects so vast as to be able to embrace all the infinite multiplicity and diversity of the real interests , aspirations , wills , and needs constituting in their totality the collective will of the people ; there is no intellect that can devise a social organization capable of satisfying each and all .
Such an organization would ever be a Procrustean bed into which violence , more or less sanctioned by the State , would force the unfortunate society .
But it is this old system of organization based upon force that the Social Revolution should put an end to by giving full liberty to the masses , groups , communes , associations , and even individuals , and by destroying once and for all the historic cause of all violence - the very existence of the State , the fall of which will entail the destruction of all the iniquities of juridical right and all the falsehood of various cults , that right and those cults having ever been simply the complaisant consecration , ideal as well as real , of all violence represented , guaranteed , and authorized by the State .
It is evident that only when the State has ceased to exist humanity will obtain its freedom , and the true interests of society , of all groups , of all local organizations , and likewise of all the individuals forming such organization , will find their real satisfaction .
Free Organization to Follow Abolition of the State .
Abolition of the State and the Church should be the first and indispensable condition of the real enfranchisement of society .
It will be only after this that society can and should begin its own reorganization ; that , however , should take place not from the top down , not according to an ideal plan mapped by a few sages or savants , and not by means of decrees issued by some dictatorial power or even by a National Assembly elected by universal suffrage .
Such a system , as I have already said , inevitably would lead to the formation of a governmental aristocracy , that is , a class of persons which has nothing in common with the masses of people ; and , to be sure , this class would again turn to exploiting and enthralling the masses under the pretext of common welfare or of the salvation of the State .
Freedom Must Go Hand - in - Hand With Equality .
I am a convinced partisan of economic and social equality , for I know that outside of this equality , freedom , justice , human dignity , morality , and the well - being of individuals as well as the prosperity of nations are all nothing but so many falsehoods .
But being at the same time a partisan of freedom - the first condition of humanity - I believe that equality should be established in the world by a spontaneous organization of labor and collective property , by the free organization of producers ' associations into communes , and free federation of communes - but nowise by means of the supreme tutelary action of the State .
The Difference Between Authoritarian and Libertarian Revolution .
It is this point which mainly divides the Socialists or revolutionary collectivists from the authoritarian Communists , the partisans of the absolute initiative of the State .
The goal of both is the same : both parties want the creation of a new social order based exclusively upon collective labor , under economic conditions that are equal for all - that is , under conditions of collective ownership of the tools of production .
Only the Communists imagine that they can attain through development and organization of the political power of the working classes , and chiefly of the city proletariat , aided by bourgeois radicalism - whereas the revolutionary Socialists , the enemies of all ambiguous alliances , believe , on the contrary , that this common goal can be attained not through the political but through the social ( and therefore anti-political ) organization and power of the working masses of the cities and villages , including all those who , though belonging by birth to the higher classes , have broken with their past of their own free will , and have openly joined the proletariat and accepted its program .
The Methods of the Communists and the Anarchists .
Hence the two different methods .
The Communists believe that it is necessary to organize the forces of the workers in order to take possession of the political might of the State .
The revolutionary Socialists organize with the view of destroying , or if you prefer a more refined expression , of liquidating the State .
The Communists are the partisans of the principle and practice of authority , while revolutionary Socialists place their faith only in freedom .
Both are equally the partisans of science , which is to destroy superstition and take the place of faith ; but the first want to impose science upon the people , while the revolutionary collectivists try to diffuse science and knowledge among the people , so that the various groups of human society , when convinced by propaganda , may organize and spontaneously combine into federations , in accordance with their natural tendencies and their real interests , but never according to a plan traced in advance and imposed upon the ignorant masses by a few " superior " minds .
Revolutionary Socialists believe that there is much more of practical reason and intelligence in the instinctive aspirations and real needs of the masses of people than in the profound minds of all these learned doctors and self - appointed tutors of humanity , who , having before them the sorry examples of so many abortive attempts to make humanity happy , still intend to keep on working in the same direction .
But revolutionary Socialists believe , on the contrary , that humanity has permitted itself to be ruled for a long time , much too long , and that the source of its misfortune lies not in this nor in any other form of government but in the principle and the very existence of the government , whatever its nature may be .
It is this difference of opinion , which already has become historic , that now exists between the scientific Communism , developed by the German school and partly accepted by American and English Socialists , and Proudhonism , extensively developed and pushed to its ultimate conclusions , and by now accepted by the proletariat of the Latin countries .
Revolutionary Socialism has made its first brilliant and practical appearance in the Paris Commune .
On the Pan - German banner is written : Retention and strengthening of the State at any cost .
On our banner , the social - revolutionary banner , on the contrary , are inscribed , in fiery and bloody letters : the destruction of all States , the annihilation of bourgeois civilization , free and spontaneous organization from below upward , by means of free associations , the organization of the unbridled rabble of toilers , of all emancipated humanity , and the creation of a new universally human world .
Before creating , or rather aiding the people to create , this new organization , it is necessary to achieve a victory .
It is necessary to overthrow that which is , in order to be able to establish that which should be ...

Regulators are preparing to draft rules for the development of offshore wind projects in the Great Lakes , even though no official projects have been proposed just yet .
Cuyahoga County in Ohio is spending $ 1 million on an offshore wind task force to create a feasibility study on the potential for a wind farm in Lake Erie near Cleveland .
But before any turbines go up , regulators and lawmakers will have figure out zoning and leasing rights , and with eight states and two Canadian provinces bordering the lakes , it will take a coordinated interstate and international effort to lay the ground rules .
Regulators and wind energy companies have been eying the Great Lakes for years .
In 2006 , the U.S. Department of Energy hosted the Great Lakes Offshore Wind Technical Gathering , and just last month a study from the Michigan State University Land Policy Institute estimated that 100,000 turbines in Lake Michigan could generate 321,000 megawatts of energy .
But if the progress of offshore wind projects in Rhode Island , New Jersey and Massachusetts is any indication , it will be years before any turbines start spinning up on the Great Lakes .
The AP reports that Michigan ’s Department of Environmental Quality processed a mock offshore wind farm application earlier this year , which brought up questions that will likely have to be addressed by new laws and regulations .
Siting turbines will have to cleared with fishery managers , shipping lane managers and the regulators of the Lakes ’ bottomlands , which are currently held in public trust .
Calls to the Department of Environmental Quality and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources regarding how offshore wind will be regulated were greeted with chuckles and the same response : “ That is a good question . ”
Clearly the regulatory entities are still figuring out jurisdictions .
Further complicating matters is the international border running through the Great Lakes , which brings the U.S. Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers into the mix .
The Great Lakes and Rust Belt states are primed to supply the potential regional offshore wind business with turbines from a growing number of manufacturing centers that are filling the void left behind by the slow collapse of the auto and steel industries .
We mapped out nearly a dozen new wind turbine manufacturing plants opening up across the Midwest and Great Plains and the NYTimes recently picked up on the trend with a story about wind companies revitalizing the Rust Belt .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain said on Wednesday he will break off from campaigning to help on a Wall Street rescue plan and asked that a Friday debate with Democrat Barack Obama be postponed .
U.S. Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) makes a statement in New York September 24 , 2008 , announcing he is suspending his campaign because of the economic crisis in the United States .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
McCain , in a statement to reporters , said he would suspend his campaign on Thursday to return to Washington .
He added he did not believe the Bush administration ’s proposed legislation on a $ 700 billion bailout plan for the financial industry would pass the U.S. Congress in its current form .
McCain , an Arizona senator , called on Obama to join him in working together on a plan and said he had spoken to the Democrat about doing so .
He said a consensus agreement on a bailout plan is needed by the time the financial markets open on Monday .
Obama , an Illinois senator , planned to make a statement on the issue shortly .
“ It ’s time for both parties to come together to solve this problem , ” McCain said .
“ We must meet as Americans , not as Democrats or Republicans , and we must meet until this crisis is resolved . ”
The Bush administration is pushing the plan hard in Congress .
The White House welcomed McCain ’s announcement .
Dana Perino said , “ We are making progress in negotiations on the financial markets rescue legislation , but we have not finished it yet . ”
McCain ’s dramatic move , aimed at projecting leadership during the greatest U.S. financial crisis since the Great Depression , came at a time when Americans have been telling pollsters they believed Obama could handle the economy better than McCain .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said Obama had called McCain on Wednesday morning to ask if he would join him in issuing a joint statement aimed at taking a bipartisan approach to the endangered $ 700 billion bailout .
The aim , said Burton , would be to act in a bipartisan manner to pass a proposal .
“ At 2:30 this afternoon , Senator McCain returned Senator Obama ’s call and agreed to join him in issuing such a statement .
The two campaigns are currently working together on the details , ” Burton said .
McCain urged President George W. Bush to call for a bipartisan meeting of congressional leaders , including him and Obama , to try to find an agreement .
The debate scheduled on Friday in Oxford , Mississippi , is supposed to be the first of three face - to - face sessions between McCain and Obama , who face off in the presidential election on November 4 .
“ I am directing my campaign to work with the Obama campaign and the Commission on Presidential Debates to delay Friday night ’s debate until we have taken action to address this crisis , ” McCain said .
McCain said it was essential to pass legislation to deal with what he called a “ historic crisis . ”
“ If we do not , credit will dry up , with devastating consequences for our economy .
People will no longer be able to buy homes and their life savings will be at stake , ” he said .
McCain senior adviser Mark Salter said the campaign suspension would include pulling McCain ’s television ads .

Rainfall volume
The size of each territory shows the proportion of worldwide precipitation ( falling on land ) that falls there .
The largest volume falls on Brazil , but this is partly because of its large land area .
Coal power
The size of each territory shows the proportion of the worldwide electricity generated from coal that is generated there .
North American territories generate three times more electricity from coal than the total for territories in any other region .
However , the country with the highest coal - generated electricity per person is Australia , which is a large territory with a low population density .

Mineral Depletion
Territory size shows the proportion of all annual mineral depletion that occurs there .
Mineral depletion is defined as the loss of potential future income , at current prices , due to the quantities of minerals currently being extracted .
Territories that appear small on this map may lack minerals , or have already used those worth extracting .
Meat consumption
Territory size shows the proportion of worldwide meat consumption ( including animal products ) that occurs there .
Overall , the most meat is consumed in China , a quarter of the world total - but one - fifth of the world population lives in China .
Meat consumption per person is highest in Western Europe .
Malaria cases
Countries are sized according to the proportion of all the people living with malaria worldwide that live there .
Most territories are barely visible due to the low number of malaria cases within their borders .
People affected by disasters
Territory size shows that area's share of all people worldwide affected by disasters between 1975 and 2004 .
Being ' affected ' includes requiring emergency assistance for basic survival , and / or catching an infectious disease not usually found in that territory .
Species gone extinct
Each country 's size shows the proportion , of all species worldwide that are known to have become extinct between 1500 and 2004 , that became extinct there .
Of those species recorded as recently becoming extinct , more lived in the United States than anywhere else , followed by the United Republic of Tanzania , Uganda and Mauritius .
Science research
Territory size shows the proportion of all scientific papers published in 2001 written by authors living there .
The number of scientific papers published by researchers in the United States was more than three times as many as were published by the second highest - publishing population , Japan .
Gay Pride parades were described in the minister 's blog as " obscene " A Church of England priest has been ordered to remove comments about gay people from his blog , remarks described by his diocese as " highly offensive " .
The Rev Peter Mullen , who ministers in the City of London , said he had gay friends and the words were " satirical " .
He suggested in his internet blog that homosexuals should have their backsides tattooed with the slogan : " Sodomy can seriously damage your health " .
The gay rights group Outrage described the comments as " Neanderthal " .
A Diocese of London spokeswoman said the remarks did not reflect its views .
Mr Mullen said : " I certainly have nothing against homosexuals .
Many of my dear friends have been and are of that persuasion .
It 's the kind of remark you might expect from a drunk on a Saturday night , not someone in a supposedly responsible position
David Allison , Outrage " What I have got against them is the militant preaching of homosexuality . "
In the same blog , Mr Mullen called for all gay pride parades , which he branded " obscene " , to be outlawed .
He also criticised the blessing of two gay priests at a " wedding " performed earlier this year in a City of London church .
The Diocese of London spokeswoman said officials had met Mr Mullen and it had been agreed that the comments should be removed .
She said : " While clergy are entitled to their own personal views , we fully recognise that the content of this text is highly offensive and it is in no way reflective of the views of the Diocese of London . "
Outrage spokesman David Allison said : " It 's the kind of remark you might expect from a drunk on a Saturday night , not someone in a supposedly responsible position . "

What are these ?
Last year , when I attended the European Conference on Lasers and Electrooptics , one of the " big things " was " chaotic laser oscillators for security purposes . "
The basic idea is that chaotic systems are unpredictable yet still retain many controllable properties , and therefore they make a good fit for security applications .
I did n't think very highly of such security schemes then , but recent research into using chaotic lasers to generate random numbers looks much more promising .
Although they mostly operate behind the scenes , random number generators are the workhorses of both computer security and computational methods used in scientific simulations .
Even quantum key distribution relies on having a good random number generator .
Unfortunately , truly random number generators — usually these are based on noise associated with physical processes — are incredibly slow .
To get around this , pseudo - random number generators are often used .
These are algorithms that , given a seed number , generate a sequence of numbers that have all the statistical properties of random numbers — except that they are n't random .
Pseudo - random number generators are now pretty good but , if the starting value is known , the random sequence is entirely predictable .
Furthermore , pseudo - random number generators have been shown to be vulnerable before , and there is no reason to suppose that such vulnerabilities can't happen again .
Random numbers , faster
The obvious solution is a fast generator of truly random numbers .
This is exactly what researchers in Japan have demonstrated .
The system is based on a chaotic laser — the researchers took the output from a standard telecommunications laser and feed some of it back to itself after a short time delay .
This delayed feedback creates large , unpredictable amplitude oscillations .
The additional feedback first increases the laser amplitude by extracting light from the semiconductor more efficiently .
Afterwards , there are n't enough electron - hole pairs around to sustain the high amplitude output , so the laser crashes to a low output .
In the meantime , the high amplitude pulse is still traveling around the delay circuit , allowing the electron - hole pair numbers build up again .
If the timing is just right , the high amplitude pulse can hit just as the numbers peak again , which would create a regular train of pulses .
To get a random series of pulses , the electrical current , feedback delay , and feedback level are adjusted so that they never quite match .
The electron - hole pair numbers peak a little early , or a little late , providing a set of randomly spaced pulses .
These pulses are converted into a train of random ones and zeros .
To make extra sure that this is random , the researchers built two of these chaotic lasers and then used an exclusive - or to combine the outputs .
They then finely tuned the laser 's feedback until the average ratio of ones to zeros was balanced .
With this one adjustable parameter set to the right value , the researchers obtained strings of ones and zeros that pass all the standard tests for randomness .
The crucial difference : the lasers generate random bits at 1.7 Gb/s , which is at least an order of magnitude faster than any other true random number generator .
You might think that , since normal lasers include a bit of noise in their amplitude ( which is the basis of this technique ) , it would be possible to use this directly to derive a random sequence .
In principle , that is possible , but the amplitude noise is quite small , making it practically impossible to choose a one - zero threshold that results in a non-biased sequence of ones and zeros .
This points out the role of chaos in this system — it acts to amplify the normal amplitude noise to the point where it 's large enough to allow the researchers to choose a threshold that balances the one - zero ratio .
The moral of the story is that sometimes a crappy laser can do the job better than a good laser .

IF AT FIRST YOU DON ’T SUCCEED ….
The Politico ’s Mike Allen and Jonathan Martin report today on the next arrow in the McCain campaign ’s quiver .
As part of a plan to reinvigorate his flagging campaign , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) is considering additional economic measures aimed directly at the middle class that are likely to be rolled out this week , campaign officials said .
Among the measures being considered are tax cuts — perhaps temporary — for capital gains and dividends , the officials said .
There ’s quite a bit wrong with this .
First , as Hilzoy noted over night , Americans are n’t exactly worried right now about “ how they ’ll manage to pay the taxes on their massive capital gains . ”
Second , as Brad DeLong explained , the reporting itself is flawed : “ Capital gains and dividend tax cuts are simply not ‘ economic measures aimed directly at the middle class ’ : the middle class does n’t collect capital gains , or dividends , in any material amount . ”
And third , is it me or is the McCain campaign deliberately trying to reinforce the “ erratic ” meme the Obama campaign has been pushing ?
Since the financial crisis began in earnest , consider just how many responses McCain has offered the public : he was for and against the AIG bailout on successive days ; he wanted to see Chris Cox fired ; he wanted a commission to study what had gone wrong ; he pretended to “ suspend ” his campaign ; he said earmarks are the real problem ; he unveiled a “ Homeowner Resurgence Plan . ”
In each instance , McCain seemed very excited about his latest thought , touted it for about a day , faced resistance from those who pointed out that McCain did n’t appear to know what he was talking about ; and then forgot about his idea soon after .
A day or two later , he ’d start the cycle over again with some new idea .
Now he ’s poised to offer yet another proposal , based at least in part on tax cuts on capital gains that do n’t actually exist in the midst of a financial collapse .
McCain has simply gone from one ridiculous notion to another , flailing around , desperately looking for something coherent to say .
It ’s not working .
The Politico added , “ McCain ’s new package would amount to a do - over from the hasty introduction of McCain ’s mortgage buy - up program . ”
We ’re 23 days from Election Day , and McCain is looking for “ do - overs ” on economic policy in the middle of a financial crisis ?
Seriously ?
This feature of git is too cool not to blog about : git bisect , and more specifically , git bisect run .
“ git bisect ” is a tool that facilitates a binary search of changes to your git repository to help find where a bug was introduced .
You can walk through the process manually using “ git bisect { good , bad , skip} “ , or if you can write a script that automates checking for the bug , you can use “ git bisect run scriptname ” to have git do all the work for you .
The script should return 0 if the bug does not exist , and some other number ( except 125 ) if the bug does exist .
In my case , Cappuccino ’s “ steam ” build tool was failing , so I wrote a simple script that would test it by trying to run “ steam ” on Foundation :
#!/bin/sh
# install a known working copy of the build tools
pushd ../tmp/Tools
sudo sh install - tools
popd ../tmp/Tools -tools
# build whatever version of Cappuccino git bisect has checked out for us
rm - rf $ STEAM_BUILD
ant release # install the freshly built tools
pushd $ STEAM_BUILD / Cappuccino / Tools
sudo sh install - tools
popd # run steam on Foundation to see if the built tools work
rm - rf $ STEAM_BUILD
pushd Foundation
steam
RETURN=$ ?
popd # return the recorded return value
exit $ RETURN
I provided “ git bisect start ” with a known bad commit and a known good commit , then ran “ git bisect run ” :
git bisect start c1e882ace1dd29aea98d9247db304fe5d5077df7 d6c0f8802a2fd3a07e14418de7744ae04ae4499e git bisect run ../test.sh
Sure enough , a few minutes later “ git bisect ” reported exactly which commit caused the problem :
Sen . Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala ) said that Republicans were “ still a bit stunned ” that they lost so many Senate seats .
Senate GOP in big funk
A day after losing Ted Stevens ’ seat , along with their best hope for getting Joe Lieberman to cross over , Senate GOP leaders preached party unity as the key to surviving the Obama years .
If that does n’t work , there ’s always psychotherapy .

Down to 42 seats with two still at risk , Senate Republicans are in a deep funk .
Some are in denial .
Some want a return to conservative principles .
Some want to cut deals .
Some want more filibusters .
Others want to jump out a window — but they ’re afraid they ’d screw that up , too .
“ We probably would n’t die , ” a Republican Senate aide joked Wednesday .
“ We ’d just lie there , hurt and suffering , which is not too much different from where we are now . ”
Two years ago , the Republicans held a 55 - 45 majority .
They ’re down 13 seats since then , with a too - close - to - call race in Minnesota and a runoff in Georgia still to come .
“ The feeling I get is that we ’re not ready yet to discuss with ourselves what happened , ” said Sen .
Jeff Sessions of Alabama , one of the few Republicans to win an easy reelection this year .
“ I think people are kind of still a bit stunned and are not prepared to have thought it through sufficiently . ”
“ We think the whole problem is George Bush and not us , and we ’re part of the problem , ” added Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina .
Although Republicans are n’t exactly anxious to align themselves with the outgoing president , they ’re feeling so nostalgic for the power they once had that they ’ve scheduled their committee organizing meetings for mid-December — an excuse to be back in town for Bush ’s final White House holiday party .
John McCain — the Republican senator who had hoped to be hosting those parties for the next four years — returned to the Senate this week .
He said Tuesday that he had nothing to say to the press .
When reporters asked him for a comment on Wednesday , he said “ No , no , no ! ” and kept walking .
The Republicans ’ only glimmer of good news :
When Stevens — the longest - serving Republican in Senate history — conceded his Alaska race to Democrat Mark Begich on Wednesday , he spared them the unpleasant task of having to expel him from their caucus .
That there is no simple solution for what ails the party is clear from the number of solutions offered to fix it .
Ask a room of Senate Republicans what ’s next for their diminished and deflated minority , and you ’ll get a different answer from each of them .
During a closed - door Republican Conference meeting on Tuesday , DeMint offered proposals to impose term limits on the Republican leader and to restrict how long members can serve on the Appropriations Committee .
The resolutions were soundly defeated , but not without bitter exchanges among the Republicans present for the meeting .
Sen .
Mel Martinez of Florida said the meeting was “ terrible ” and “ caused consternation ” among his colleagues because of the dispute over DeMint ’s proposals .
GOP senators met behind closed doors again on Wednesday and did a quick review of their races , with the leadership and defeated incumbents blaming Republican losses on the economic downturn and the president ’s call for a $ 700 billion economic rescue plan .
But even this session brought a clash between GOP lawmakers , as Sens. David Vitter of Louisiana and Kit Bond of Missouri fought over whether Republicans should support a bailout of the auto industry , with Bond supporting it and Vitter opposed .
“ Sometimes people do n’t like change , but after two disastrous elections , we need it , ” DeMint said .
“ We need to be who we say we are .
The most important thing for the party is to mean something again . ”
Retiring Sen. John Warner of Virginia — who will be succeeded next year by a Democrat , former Gov. Mark Warner — tried to lighten the mood Wednesday with some gallows humor .
Warner told of how he had gone to a straw poll in Virginia with McCain .
Warner made a strong pitch for McCain at the event and figured he ’d seal the deal by offering to pay for lunch for the whole crowd .
When the voting was over , Texas Rep. Ron Paul had won .
“ It was a really funny moment , but still kind of sad because it was true , ” noted one senator .
So far , GOP leaders have remained upbeat .
They point out that after the 2004 elections , Republicans held the White House and picked up seats in the House and Senate .
The leadership points to this as proof it can be done , and done quickly .
“ You play the hand you ’re dealt , ” said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota , who is now vice chairman of the Republican Conference .
“ We ’re not happy to be where we are , but we are where we are .
Now you have to determine how you get back on top . ”
Sen . John Ensign of Nevada , the outgoing NRSC chairman , said victories in the Georgia runoff and Minnesota recount , which Sen. Norm Coleman leads by 215 votes over Democratic challenger Al Franken , could help ease the pain by keeping Democrats from reaching a 60 - vote , filibuster - resistant majority .
“ Obviously , we were very disappointed by [ the ] Election Night results .
Believe me , we put our heart and soul into this last two years , ” Ensign said .
Georgia and Minnesota “ are absolutely the two that we feel like we have to hold onto to basically take away a good feeling from this cycle . ”
But first , the Republicans will have to say goodbye to their own .
On Wednesday night , just off the Senate floor , Republicans planned to gather in tribute to their retiring and defeated colleagues .
It ’s a longer - than - usual list this year , and it includes Stevens , Warner , Pete V. Domenici , Elizabeth Dole , Wayne Allard , Gordon Smith , John Sununu , Larry Craig and Chuck Hagel .
“ This causes a lot of pain , ” said Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson .
“ There are a lot of good people there .
We ’re going to miss them all . ”
Several weeks ago , the Ticket reported on what the candidates drive .
Barack Obama , as you may recall , rolls around in a 2008 Ford Escape hybrid when he 's not being ferried by the Secret Service .
And John McCain likes to cruise in a 2004 Cadillac CTS , although he too is now driven everywhere by the Secret Service .
But , as Newsweek points out in its latest issue , that 's not McCain 's only ride .
In fact , the magazine reports that the Arizona senator and his wife , Cindy , a car enthusiast and racer , have 12 vehicles together .
The Ford Escape is the only car registered to Obama and his wife , Michelle .
To be fair , only the Cadillac is registered in John McCain 's name .
His wife 's name is on 11 vehicles .
Among them : a 2008 Jeep Wrangler ; a 2007 half - ton Ford pickup truck ; a vintage 1960 Willys Jeep ; a 2000 Lincoln ; and a 2001 GMC SUV .
Do n't tell Detroit , but the couple also have some foreign - brand cars , including a 2005 Volkswagen convertible and a 2001 Honda sedan .
Interestingly , McCain told Detroit television station WXYZ - TV , " I 've bought American literally all my life and I 'm proud . "
If his wife buys the cars , that could literally be true .
And , of course , Honda , Toyota and others make thousands of cars in the United States .
But then again , maybe McCain just forgot .
After all , if you can't recall how many houses you have , how are you supposed to remember what 's in their garages ?
UPDATE : This morning the Obama campaign released this commercial attacking McCain for his foreign - made cars :

DIGG THIS
Being a principled nonvoter on Election Day is a little like being a turd in the punchbowl .
At least that ’s how all the people running around yesterday blissfully participating in the American civic religion of statism viewed it : I ’m some sort of a downer , a crank , a loonie , a jerk .
Voting Is Evil
It ’s not that I view voting as pointless .
Even some active voters admit as much , but they still go through the motions because , “ You ca n’t just do nothing . ”
( I do n’t think not voting is equivalent to doing nothing , but we ’ll come back to that . )
No , I do n’t vote because I believe voting — and here I am talking particularly about national elections — is a positive evil , a fact that by now should be completely clear but for whatever reason does not seem to be .
Oh , it is possible to get many voters to recognize certain uncomfortable facts about the nature of national politics , such as the often indistinguishable nature of candidates from the major parties ( and that there are “ major parties ” ) .
Some voters seem to understand that large vested interests ( Goldman Sachs , for example ) play both sides of the fence with political donations , hoping for their state - enabled exploitation to continue uninterrupted , if not to expand .
Some voters even get that it ’s always the same small club of elites who just swap plum administrative jobs every couple of years , regardless of who wins any particular election .
Still others are aware of the stories of vote fraud surrounding the increasingly common Diebold electronic voting gizmos .
To top it all off , everyone at least knows something about the illegal and / or immoral activities of the U.S. government , from systematic kidnapping and torture and unprovoked wars that have slaughtered more than a million people abroad to the establishment of a police state here at home that spies on everyone , suppresses free speech , criminalizes dissent , restricts travel , and bullies and plunders us with abandon .
But even as the proverbial horse is presented directly with the trough , he still usually refuses to drink .
In other words , despite knowing all that he knows about the voting process and the nature of what he is supporting , the average voter will not take the next logical step and decline to participate in a game that is not only rigged but that is actively harmful to himself and his fellow human beings .
Why ?
Voting Is an Exercise in Self - Indulgence and Denial
It ’s an interesting question .
I ca n’t read people ’s minds nor understand their motives and I do n’t pretend to , but one clue is found in the common responses one receives when one insults or impugns the civic religion ( sometimes even simply by saying “ I do n’t vote ” ) :
“ Well , why do n’t you go live somewhere else then ? ”
“ I guess you ’d rather we had a dictatorship ! ”
“ It ’s because of people like you that this country is in the mess it is in . ”
“ How can you just not care ? ”
“ Think of all the soldiers who died for your right to vote ! ”
A careful reading of each of these responses reveals that , whatever its other merits , none has any logical connection to my decision not to vote .
This suggests that for many , voting is experienced as an emotional act more than anything else .
Their egos are involved at a fundamentally nonrational level .
If you mock the civic religion , you are therefore ( so he perceives ) mocking the voter as a person .
For whatever reason , he invests a lot of his own identity in his chosen party or candidate ( hence the importance attached to voting for a “ winner ” and the immediate dismissal of anyone who “ does n’t have a chance ” ) .
But more than that , the emotionally comfortable experience of voting rests on the willful denial of what the U.S. government is and does .
Now , it is true there have been and are some governments that are even more hostile to their subjects ’ lives and properties than ours is , at present .
But this does n’t change the fact that ours is bad and getting worse , nor that ours presumes to murderously lord it over the entire planet instead of confining itself to one particular region of tyranny .
Many voters will simply consider criticisms of the U.S. government as hyperbole , or as criticisms of the country itself .
This is because believing that one can say one is against war , torture , and plunder while voting for all three is much more psychologically reassuring than admitting the inescapable truth , namely , that one ’s voluntary assent to a system that promotes institutionalized violence as the way to organizing human affairs is simply shameful .
So I confess to being short with people who presumptuously ask “ Did you vote ? ” or who literally wear their voterdom ( “ I voted ! ” ) around like a badge of moral superiority .
I have trouble hiding my disdain when otherwise intelligent people flaunt their absurd belief that , despite all evidence to the contrary , they have some say in what a government that employs some four million people , 536 of whom are elected every 2 - 6 years , does .
Is Nonvoting a Form of Surrender ?
Some minority of voters are sympathetic to the argument for principled nonvoting , but nevertheless see it as a form of surrender .
To answer them , let ’s review the ( admittedly oversimplified ) case for not voting :
Premise 1 : The U.S. empire represents a threat to the peace , freedom , security , prosperity , and lives of Americans and of the peoples of the world .
( See , e.g. : Iraq War , Afghanistan war , Pakistan war , Democrat and Republican national conventions , Department of Homeland Security , IRS , EPA , FDA , the War on Drugs , etc. , etc . )
Premise 2 : The people who run the U.S. empire are mainly all the same and have rigged the political game so as to keep their real priorities and policies perpetually out of the hands of voters .
( See , e.g. : Wall Street bailout , telecom retroactive immunity to lawsuits , etc. )
Premise 3 : Voting not only will not change Premise 1 , regardless of who you vote for , but it furnishes the same evil government officials with the legitimacy they need to continue committing their crimes .
( See , e.g. , such pernicious concepts as “ the will of the people , ” “ the majority , ” “ popular mandate , ” “ vox populi , vox Dei , ” etc . )
Conclusion : Voting makes you an active accomplice to serious crimes and enables the commission of yet more crimes .
With the argument framed thus , my question is :
Is refusing to participate in the violence of the state a form of surrender — or an act of conscience ?
Even Nonvoters Ca n’t Sleep Entirely Soundly at Night
I must note nonvoting is only one step toward obeying the dictates of conscience .
I ’m not , for example , courageous enough to stop filing my taxes .
( At any rate , civil disobedience in the face of state violence is the subject of an entirely different discussion . )
Not voting , however , is as of now a perfectly legal and easy way to dissociate oneself from the crimes of the U.S. government .
Why would anyone choose otherwise ?
Something often said when looking back on how relatively peaceful and open societies collapsed into murderous and repressive dictatorships is , “ Why did n’t anyone speak up ? ”
That ’s what I ’m doing when I do n’t vote and when I strongly ( if not always patiently and politely ) discourage others from doing so .
Voting for evil , supposedly lesser or not , is evil .
Do n’t ever do it .

I am confused .
I understand that the language Joy is regarded as a functional language .
It also seems that is closer to Backus ' FP than , say , Haskell .
The Joy FAQ ( http://www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/phimvt/joy/faq.html) states that it is functional because expressions are functions operating on a stack , and juxtaposition is function composition .
That definition feels ( to me ) like cheating .
Could not one also define a language with assignments and call it " functional " , intepreting expressions as pure functions operating on an environment ?
I mean , every imperative language can be implemented with the State monad , and that does n't make it functional ( I think ) .
Perhaps my question makes no sense , and is just wordplay .
I 'd really like to know what you think .

Cooking dinner , washing dishes , doing laundry : these are just some of the everyday activities a family deals with in their home .
Becky Eckle has a family of six to clean up after : her husband Tom , her daughter Samantha , her son Kris , and two ghosts .
The Eckle family has been coping with paranormal activity at their home , on the corner of Urban and South Wells streets , since moving in nearly nine years ago .
Becky , a Tyler County native , moved back to the area to be closer to her mother .
“ I was born here , I was born in Sistersville , ” said Eckle .
“ I ’ve moved around a lot .
I lived in North Carolina for a while .
I lived in Parkersburg for a while . ”
The Eckles bought the house , traced back to the 1870s , from Walker Boyd in 2000 .
For the first three years in the home , the family got on just fine with no major commotions .
But after the Eckles began some new renovation work , the former inhabitants made their presence known .
“ We started remodeling the bedroom , ” said Becky .
“ We had already done the living room , put drywall up , and then we did the bathroom .
My daughter and I were n’t here or my son ; just my husband was here .
He was asleep on the couch and he had made a blowout patch where he had made a hole in the wrong spot to cover it up .
There were little chunks of drywall lying on the floor and Samantha had been playing with them .
She stacked them up and they were in the bedroom .
When he woke up the next morning , they were thrown at him ; they were on him and on the floor beside of him , and nobody else was here . ”
From that moment on , the spirits started causing trouble in the Eckle household .
Becky ’s husband was n’t the only one to notice the ghosts .
Her daughter Samantha also noticed the new entities .
“ Some friends were over , then my little girl ( asked ) us ‘ where ’s the little boy at that plays with bubby ? ’
I said what little boy ?
‘ You know , that little boy that plays with bubby . ’
Bo ?
‘ No , not Bo .
You know , that little boy .
He plays in bubby ’s room and sometimes he plays in your room .
He has red hair and a green shirt . ’
We all just kind of looked at her ; she was probably 3 - years - old when she told us that . ”
The family believes there are two different spirits : a young boy and an adult male .
It ’s been difficult for Becky to get solid information on the house and its former inhabitants .
“ I traced the house back when I traced the property back … but we do n’t know the exact year the house was built , ” said Becky .
“ If I ever get a chance , I ’d like to know .
We ’ve asked people , but there are n’t a whole lot of older people around anymore that still know .
We know a Hedelson lived here ; I got that from the courthouse . ”
The incidents in the Eckle household are your typical ghost incidents : random noises , creaky floors , moving objects , opening and closing doors , etc .
The major encounters only seem to occur when major renovations are going on .
“ One night we were all laying in bed ; Tom ’s dad was here helping him work , ” said Becky .
“ All of a sudden seven or eight of my pictures on the wall all came flying off the wall .
There ’s no way even my cat could have done that .
It just looked like somebody spread their arms and went right through the wall and knocked all my pictures off . ”
The ghosts not only affect physical objects , but also the very temperature of some of her rooms .
“ There ’s one room in the house that always stays cold , ” said Becky .
“ Nobody can sleep in there .
We have an electric heater we try to put in there and it will warm up some , but it ’s not like the rest of the house ; it ’s very cold . ”
While some might scoff at the notion of ghosts and spirits , but not the Eckles ; they have the pictures to prove it .
“ I have a picture of a ghost my daughter took in this house , ” said Becky .
“ It ’s on my cell phone .
She was playing around with my cell phone and as far as I know my cell phone does not take black and white pictures .
It ’s a black and white picture .
It was on the wall in the living room ; she took a picture of the wall and there it was . ”
There are many groups with the ability to measure paranormal activity in a home , such as The Atlantic Paranormal Society ( T.A.P.S. ) or the Mid Ohio Valley Ghosthunters .
Becky has n’t had the chance yet , but she would like to consult with someone .
“ We had talked about it and we were going to , ” said Becky .
“ Some of my friends , after Samantha took that picture , wanted us to call T.A.P.S. or someone , but I never got to do that yet . ”
For now , the Eckles are content to share the home with their phantom friends .
Other than an incident here and there , Becky said that ghost activity is now as routine as cleaning the house .
“ Sometimes it will still freak you out , ” said Becky .
“ I was cleaning out the lint catcher in the dryer and I thought , at first , it was my shadow I was seeing , but it was n’t my shadow because it was n’t moving the same direction I was , and that made me come out of the dryer pretty quick .
Other than that , it ’s pretty routine .
You just learn to deal with it . ”
“ They do n’t seem to be harmful , ” added Becky .
“ Every once in a while I ’ve been touched on the shoulder when I ’m in the shower .
Other than that they do n’t seem to be harmful , but everyone is like ‘ I ca n’t believe you live in that house , ’ and I ’m like ‘ well , they lived here first apparently . ’ ”
Treating URL Protocol Schemes as Cruft
One of the more visible changes in last week ’s iPhone OS 2.2 update is a new toolbar in Safari .
Here ’s the previous toolbar from Safari in iPhone OS 2.1 :
It now looks like this :
The new toolbar looks much more like an iPhone - sized version of the desktop Safari toolbar , with the rectangular location text field on the left and the oval search text field on the right .
But the new toolbar is functionally equivalent to the old one , with the same three tappable targets : location field , search , and reload .
I prefer the old 2.1 toolbar , but , at this point , I ’m hesitant to say that the reason amounts to anything more than 17 months of ( very frequent ) habit .
Here ’s what the differences amount to :
The location field is shorter , so you see less of the URL .
The reload button seems to be a smaller target , and , because it ’s so close to the search field , it seems too easy to mistakenly tap the search field when aiming for the reload button .
The search field is now a bigger target , and therefore easier to tap , but the old 2.1 search button never felt too small to me .
They ’ve made something bigger that was already big enough .
So two of the three items in the toolbar have been made worse at the expense of improving the other one needlessly .
But I have a theory why Apple did this anyway .
My guess is that testing showed that many iPhone users did n’t know that the magnifying glass in the toolbar was a button they could tap to start a web search .
The new layout makes it unambiguous what the search item in the toolbar does , and that may well make the small usability hit to the size of the location field and reload button worth it .
To make better use of the available space in the location field , Safari no longer shows the “ http : / / ” or “ https : // ” protocol scheme .
You do see the protocol scheme , however , when you tap the location field to edit the URL :
But it ’s hidden , sort of like file name extensions in the Mac OS X Finder , in the normal display view .
The best argument in favor of always displaying the protocol scheme is to make it visible when you ’re connected via HTTPS , but the lock icon in the location field serves the same purpose , and is almost certainly better recognized by typical users than the extra “ s ” in “ https : / / ” .
This is a pretty clever idea , and once seen in action , it seems so obvious that I ’m now surprised that the iPhone version of Safari has n’t been doing this all along .
And it makes me wonder whether the desktop version of Safari will follow this lead — space is n’t at such a premium there , but it ’s always struck me as somewhat ungraceful that we spend all day staring at dozens of URLs that all start with the same repetitive prefix .
This article , which first appeared in The Standard for April 1963 , is collected in Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays .
The libertarian movement has been chided by William F. Buckley , Jr. , for failing to use its " strategic intelligence " in facing the major problems of our time .
We have , indeed , been too often prone to " pursue our busy little seminars on whether or not to demunicipalize the garbage collectors " ( as Buckley has contemptuously written ) , while ignoring and failing to apply libertarian theory to the most vital problem of our time : war and peace .
There is a sense in which libertarians have been utopian rather than strategic in their thinking , with a tendency to divorce the ideal system which we envisage from the realities of the world in which we live .
In short , too many of us have divorced theory from practice , and have then been content to hold the pure libertarian society as an abstract ideal for some remotely future time , while in the concrete world of today we follow unthinkingly the orthodox " conservative " line .
To live liberty , to begin the hard but essential strategic struggle of changing the unsatisfactory world of today in the direction of our ideals , we must realize and demonstrate to the world that libertarian theory can be brought sharply to bear upon all of the world ’s crucial problems .
By coming to grips with these problems , we can demonstrate that libertarianism is not just a beautiful ideal somewhere on Cloud Nine , but a tough - minded body of truths that enables us to take our stand and to cope with the whole host of issues of our day .
Let us then , by all means , use our strategic intelligence .
Although , when he sees the result , Mr. Buckley might well wish that we had stayed in the realm of garbage collection .
Let us construct a libertarian theory of war and peace .
The fundamental axiom of libertarian theory is that no one may threaten or commit violence ( " aggress " ) against another man ’s person or property .
Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence ; that is , only defensively against the aggressive violence of another .
1
In short , no violence may be employed against a non-aggressor .
Here is the fundamental rule from which can be deduced the entire corpus of libertarian theory .
2
Let us set aside the more complex problem of the State for a while and consider simply relations between " private " individuals .
Jones finds that he or his property is being invaded , aggressed against , by Smith .
It is legitimate for Jones , as we have seen , to repel this invasion by defensive violence of his own .
But now we come to a more knotty question : is it within the right of Jones to commit violence against innocent third parties as a corollary to his legitimate defense against Smith ?
To the libertarian , the answer must be clearly , no .
Remember that the rule prohibiting violence against the persons or property of innocent men is absolute : it holds regardless of the subjective motives for the aggression .
It is wrong and criminal to violate the property or person of another , even if one is a Robin Hood , or starving , or is doing it to save one ’s relatives , or is defending oneself against a third man ’s attack .
We may understand and sympathize with the motives in many of these cases and extreme situations .
We may later mitigate the guilt if the criminal comes to trial for punishment , but we cannot evade the judgment that this aggression is still a criminal act , and one which the victim has every right to repel , by violence if necessary .
In short , A aggresses against B because C is threatening , or aggressing against , A . We may understand C’s " higher " culpability in this whole procedure ; but we must still label this aggression as a criminal act which B has the right to repel by violence .
To be more concrete , if Jones finds that his property is being stolen by Smith , he has the right to repel him and try to catch him ; but he has no right to repel him by bombing a building and murdering innocent people or to catch him by spraying machine gun fire into an innocent crowd .
If he does this , he is as much ( or more of ) a criminal aggressor as Smith is .
Egalitarianism as a Re ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 3.44 Buy New $ 8.95 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
The application to problems of war and peace is already becoming evident .
For while war in the narrower sense is a conflict between States , in the broader sense we may define it as the outbreak of open violence between people or groups of people .
If Smith and a group of his henchmen aggress against Jones and Jones and his bodyguards pursue the Smith gang to their lair , we may cheer Jones on in his endeavor ; and we , and others in society interested in repelling aggression , may contribute financially or personally to Jones ’s cause .
But Jones has no right , any more than does Smith , to aggress against anyone else in the course of his " just war " : to steal others ’ property in order to finance his pursuit , to conscript others into his posse by use of violence , or to kill others in the course of his struggle to capture the Smith forces .
If Jones should do any of these things , he becomes a criminal as fully as Smith , and he too becomes subject to whatever sanctions are meted out against criminality .
In fact , if Smith ’s crime was theft , and Jones should use conscription to catch him , or should kill others in the pursuit , Jones becomes more of a criminal than Smith , for such crimes against another person as enslavement and murder are surely far worse than theft .
( For while theft injures the extension of another ’s personality , enslavement injures , and murder obliterates , that personality itself . )
Suppose that Jones , in the course of his " just war " against the ravages of Smith , should kill a few innocent people , and suppose that he should declaim , in defense of this murder , that he was simply acting on the slogan , " Give me liberty or give me death . "
The absurdity of this " defense " should be evident at once , for the issue is not whether Jones was willing to risk death personally in his defensive struggle against Smith ; the issue is whether he was willing to kill other people in pursuit of his legitimate end .
For Jones was in truth acting on the completely indefensible slogan : " Give me liberty or give them death " surely a far less noble battle cry .

The libertarian ’s basic attitude toward war must then be : it is legitimate to use violence against criminals in defense of one ’s rights of person and property ; it is completely impermissible to violate the rights of other innocent people .
War , then , is only proper when the exercise of violence is rigorously limited to the individual criminals .
We may judge for ourselves how many wars or conflicts in history have met this criterion .
It has often been maintained , and especially by conservatives , that the development of the horrendous modern weapons of mass murder ( nuclear weapons , rockets , germ warfare , etc. ) is only a difference of degree rather than kind from the simpler weapons of an earlier era .
Of course , one answer to this is that when the degree is the number of human lives , the difference is a very big one .
4
But another answer that the libertarian is particularly equipped to give is that while the bow and arrow and even the rifle can be pinpointed , if the will be there , against actual criminals , modern nuclear weapons cannot .
Here is a crucial difference in kind .
Of course , the bow and arrow could be used for aggressive purposes , but it could also be pinpointed to use only against aggressors .
Nuclear weapons , even " conventional " aerial bombs , cannot be .
These weapons are ipso facto engines of indiscriminate mass destruction .
( The only exception would be the extremely rare case where a mass of people who were all criminals inhabited a vast geographical area . )
We must , therefore , conclude that the use of nuclear or similar weapons , or the threat thereof , is a sin and a crime against humanity for which there can be no justification .
This is why the old clich no longer holds that it is not the arms but the will to use them that is significant in judging matters of war and peace .
For it is precisely the characteristic of modern weapons that they cannot be used selectively , cannot be used in a libertarian manner .
Therefore , their very existence must be condemned , and nuclear disarmament becomes a good to be pursued for its own sake .
And if we will indeed use our strategic intelligence , we will see that such disarmament is not only a good , but the highest political good that we can pursue in the modern world .
For just as murder is a more heinous crime against another man than larceny , so mass murder — indeed murder so widespread as to threaten human civilization and human survival itself — is the worst crime that any man could possibly commit .
And that crime is now imminent .
And the forestalling of massive annihilation is far more important , in truth , than the demunicipalization of garbage disposal , as worthwhile as that may be .
Or are libertarians going to wax properly indignant about price control or the income tax , and yet shrug their shoulders at or even positively advocate the ultimate crime of mass murder ?

If nuclear warfare is totally illegitimate even for individuals defending themselves against criminal assault , how much more so is nuclear or even " conventional " warfare between States !
It is time now to bring the State into our discussion .
The State is a group of people who have managed to acquire a virtual monopoly of the use of violence throughout a given territorial area .
In particular , it has acquired a monopoly of aggressive violence , for States generally recognize the right of individuals to use violence ( though not against States , of course ) in self - defense .
5
The State then uses this monopoly to wield power over the inhabitants of the area and to enjoy the material fruits of that power .
The State , then , is the only organization in society that regularly and openly obtains its monetary revenues by the use of aggressive violence ; all other individuals and organizations ( except if delegated that right by the State ) can obtain wealth only by peaceful production and by voluntary exchange of their respective products .
This use of violence to obtain its revenue ( called " taxation " ) is the keystone of State power .
Upon this base the State erects a further structure of power over the individuals in its territory , regulating them , penalizing critics , subsidizing favorites , etc .
The State also takes care to arrogate to itself the compulsory monopoly of various critical services needed by society , thus keeping the people in dependence upon the State for key services , keeping control of the vital command posts in society and also fostering among the public the myth that only the State can supply these goods and services .
Thus the State is careful to monopolize police and judicial service , the ownership of roads and streets , the supply of money , and the postal service , and effectively to monopolize or control education , public utilities , transportation , and radio and television .
Now , since the State arrogates to itself the monopoly of violence over a territorial area , so long as its depredations and extortions go unresisted , there is said to be " peace " in the area , since the only violence is one - way , directed by the State downward against the people .
Open conflict within the area only breaks out in the case of " revolutions " in which people resist the use of State power against them .
Both the quiet case of the State unresisted and the case of open revolution may be termed " vertical violence " : violence of the State against its public or vice versa .
In the modern world , each land area is ruled over by a State organization , but there are a number of States scattered over the earth , each with a monopoly of violence over its own territory .
No super - State exists with a monopoly of violence over the entire world ; and so a state of " anarchy " exists between the several States .
( It has always been a source of wonder , incidentally , to this writer how the same conservatives who denounce as lunatic any proposal for eliminating a monopoly of violence over a given territory and thus leaving private individuals without an overlord , should be equally insistent upon leaving States without an overlord to settle disputes between them .
The former is always denounced as " crackpot anarchism " ; the latter is hailed as preserving independence and " national sovereignty " from " world government . " )
And so , except for revolutions , which occur only sporadically , the open violence and two - sided conflict in the world takes place between two or more States , that is , in what is called " international war " ( or " horizontal violence " ) .
Now there are crucial and vital differences between inter-State warfare on the one hand and revolutions against the State or conflicts between private individuals on the other .
One vital difference is the shift in geography .
In a revolution , the conflict takes place within the same geographical area : both the minions of the State and the revolutionaries inhabit the same territory .
Inter - State warfare , on the other hand , takes place between two groups , each having a monopoly over its own geographical area ; that is , it takes place between inhabitants of different territories .
From this difference flow several important consequences : ( 1 ) in inter -State war the scope for the use of modern weapons of destruction is far greater .
For if the " escalation " of weaponry in an intra-territorial conflict becomes too great , each side will blow itself up with the weapons directed against the other .
Neither a revolutionary group nor a State combating revolution , for example , can use nuclear weapons against the other .
But , on the other hand , when the warring parties inhabit different territorial areas , the scope for modern weaponry becomes enormous , and the entire arsenal of mass devastation can come into play .
A second consequence ( 2 ) is that while it is possible for revolutionaries to pinpoint their targets and confine them to their State enemies , and thus avoid aggressing against innocent people , pinpointing is far less possible in an inter-State war .
6
This is true even with older weapons ; and , of course , with modern weapons there can be no pinpointing whatever .
Furthermore , ( 3 ) since each State can mobilize all the people and resources in its territory , the other State comes to regard all the citizens of the opposing country as at least temporarily its enemies and to treat them accordingly by extending the war to them .
Thus , all of the consequences of inter-territorial war make it almost inevitable that inter-State war will involve aggression by each side against the innocent civilians — the private individuals — of the other .
This inevitability becomes absolute with modern weapons of mass destruction .
If one distinct attribute of inter-State war is inter-territoriality , another unique attribute stems from the fact that each State lives by taxation over its subjects .
Any war against another State , therefore , involves the increase and extension of taxation - aggression over its own people .
7
Conflicts between private individuals can be , and usually are , voluntarily waged and financed by the parties concerned .
Revolutions can be , and often are , financed and fought by voluntary contributions of the public .
But State wars can only be waged through aggression against the taxpayer .
Anatomy of the State Murray N. Rothbard , Mu ... Best Price : $ 8.12 Buy New $ 4.75 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
All State wars , therefore , involve increased aggression against the State ’s own taxpayers , and almost all State wars ( all , in modern warfare ) involve the maximum aggression ( murder ) against the innocent civilians ruled by the enemy State .
On the other hand , revolutions are generally financed voluntarily and may pinpoint their violence to the State rulers , and private conflicts may confine their violence to the actual criminals .
The libertarian must , therefore , conclude that , while some revolutions and some private conflicts may be legitimate , State wars are always to be condemned .
Many libertarians object as follows : " While we too deplore the use of taxation for warfare , and the State ’s monopoly of defense service , we have to recognize that these conditions exist , and while they do , we must support the State in just wars of defense . "
The reply to this would go as follows : " Yes , as you say , unfortunately States exist , each having a monopoly of violence over its territorial area . "
What then should be the attitude of the libertarian toward conflicts between these States ?
The libertarian should say , in effect , to the State : " All right , you exist , but as long as you exist at least confine your activities to the area which you monopolize . "
In short , the libertarian is interested in reducing as much as possible the area of State aggression against all private individuals .
The only way to do this , in international affairs , is for the people of each country to pressure their own State to confine its activities to the area which it monopolizes and not to aggress against other State - monopolists .
In short , the objective of the libertarian is to confine any existing State to as small a degree of invasion of person and property as possible .
And this means the total avoidance of war .
The people under each State should pressure " their " respective States not to attack one another , and , if a conflict should break out , to negotiate a peace or declare a cease - fire as quickly as physically possible .
Suppose further that we have that rarity — an unusually clear - cut case in which the State is actually trying to defend the property of one of its citizens .
A citizen of country A travels or invests in country B , and then State B aggresses against his person or confiscates his property .
Surely , our libertarian critic would argue , here is a clear - cut case where State A should threaten or commit war against State B in order to defend the property of " its " citizen .
Since , the argument runs , the State has taken upon itself the monopoly of defense of its citizens , it then has the obligation to go to war on behalf of any citizen , and libertarians have an obligation to support this war as a just one .
But the point again is that each State has a monopoly of violence and , therefore , of defense only over its territorial area .
It has no such monopoly ; in fact , it has no power at all , over any other geographical area .
Therefore , if an inhabitant of country A should move to or invest in country B , the libertarian must argue that he thereby takes his chances with the State - monopolist of country B , and it would be immoral and criminal for State A to tax people in country A and kill numerous innocents in country B in order to defend the property of the traveler or investor .
8
It should also be pointed out that there is no defense against nuclear weapons ( the only current " defense " is the threat of mutual annihilation ) and , therefore , that the State cannot fulfill any sort of defense function so long as these weapons exist .
The libertarian objective , then , should be , regardless of the specific causes of any conflict , to pressure States not to launch wars against other States and , should a war break out , to pressure them to sue for peace and negotiate a cease - fire and peace treaty as quickly as physically possible .
This objective , incidentally , is enshrined in the international law of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , that is , the ideal that no State could aggress against the territory of another — in short , the " peaceful coexistence " of States.9
Suppose , however , that despite libertarian opposition , war has begun and the warring States are not negotiating a peace .
What , then , should be the libertarian position ?
Clearly , to reduce the scope of assault on innocent civilians as much as possible .
Old - fashioned international law had two excellent devices for this : the " laws of war , " and the " laws of neutrality " or " neutrals ’ rights . "
The laws of neutrality are designed to keep any war that breaks out confined to the warring States themselves , without aggression against the States or particularly the peoples of the other nations .
Hence the importance of such ancient and now forgotten American principles as " freedom of the seas " or severe limitations upon the rights of warring States to blockade neutral trade with the enemy country .
In short , the libertarian tries to induce neutral States to remain neutral in any inter-State conflict and to induce the warring States to observe fully the rights of neutral citizens .
The " laws of war " were designed to limit as much as possible the invasion by warring States of the rights of the civilians of the respective warring countries .
As the British jurist F.J.P. Veale put it :
The fundamental principle of this code was that hostilities between civilized peoples must be limited to the armed forces actually engaged … .
It drew a distinction between combatants and noncombatants by laying down that the sole business of the combatants is to fight each other and , consequently , that noncombatants must be excluded from the scope of military operations .
10
In the modified form of prohibiting the bombardment of all cities not in the front line , this rule held in Western European wars in recent centuries until Britain launched the strategic bombing of civilians in World War II .
Now , of course , the entire concept is scarcely remembered , the very nature of nuclear war resting on the annihilation of civilians .
In condemning all wars , regardless of motive , the libertarian knows that there may well be varying degrees of guilt among States for any specific war .
But the overriding consideration for the libertarian is the condemnation of any State participation in war .
Hence his policy is that of exerting pressure on all States not to start a war , to stop one that has begun and to reduce the scope of any persisting war in injuring civilians of either side or no side .
A neglected corollary to the libertarian policy of peaceful coexistence of States is the rigorous abstention from any foreign aid ; that is , a policy of nonintervention between States (= " isolationism " = " neutralism " ) .
For any aid given by State A to State B ( 1 ) increases tax aggression against the people of country A and ( 2 ) aggravates the suppression by State B of its own people .
If there are any revolutionary groups in country B , then foreign aid intensifies this suppression all the more .
Even foreign aid to a revolutionary group in B — more defensible because directed to a voluntary group opposing a State rather than a State oppressing the people — must be condemned as ( at the very least ) aggravating tax aggression at home .
Let us see how libertarian theory applies to the problem of imperialism , which may be defined as the aggression by State A over the people of country B , and the subsequent maintenance of this foreign rule .
Revolution by the B people against the imperial rule of A is certainly legitimate , provided again that revolutionary fire be directed only against the rulers .
It has often been maintained — even by libertarians — that Western imperialism over undeveloped countries should be supported as more watchful of property rights than any successor native government would be .
The first reply is that judging what might follow the status quo is purely speculative , whereas existing imperialist rule is all too real and culpable .
Moreover , the libertarian here begins his focus at the wrong end — at the alleged benefit of imperialism to the native .
He should , on the contrary , concentrate first on the Western taxpayer , who is mulcted and burdened to pay for the wars of conquest , and then for the maintenance of the imperial bureaucracy .
On this ground alone , the libertarian must condemn imperialism .
11
Does opposition to all war mean that the libertarian can never countenance change — that he is consigning the world to a permanent freezing of unjust regimes ?
Certainly not .
Suppose , for example , that the hypothetical state of " Waldavia " has attacked " Ruritania " and annexed the western part of the country .
The Western Ruritanians now long to be reunited with their Ruritanian brethren .
How is this to be achieved ?
There is , of course , the route of peaceful negotiation between the two powers , but suppose that the Waldavian imperialists prove adamant .
Or , libertarian Waldavians can put pressure on their government to abandon its conquest in the name of justice .
But suppose that this , too , does not work .
What then ?
We must still maintain the illegitimacy of Ruritania ’s mounting a war against Waldavia .
The legitimate routes are ( 1 ) revolutionary uprisings by the oppressed Western Ruritanian people , and ( 2 ) aid by private Ruritanian groups ( or , for that matter , by friends of the Ruritanian cause in other countries ) to the Western rebels — either in the form of equipment or of volunteer personnel .
12
We have seen throughout our discussion the crucial importance , in any present - day libertarian peace program , of the elimination of modern methods of mass annihilation .
These weapons , against which there can be no defense , assure maximum aggression against civilians in any conflict with the clear prospect of the destruction of civilization and even of the human race itself .
Highest priority on any libertarian agenda , therefore , must be pressure on all States to agree to general and complete disarmament down to police levels , with particular stress on nuclear disarmament .
In short , if we are to use our strategic intelligence , we must conclude that the dismantling of the greatest menace that has ever confronted the life and liberty of the human race is indeed far more important than demunicipalizing the garbage service .
Man , Economy , and Stat ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 22.75 Buy New $ 25.00 ( as of 07:50 EST - Details )
We cannot leave our topic without saying at least a word about the domestic tyranny that is the inevitable accompaniment of war .
The great Randolph Bourne realized that " war is the health of the State .
" 13
It is in war that the State really comes into its own : swelling in power , in number , in pride , in absolute dominion over the economy and the society .
Society becomes a herd , seeking to kill its alleged enemies , rooting out and suppressing all dissent from the official war effort , happily betraying truth for the supposed public interest .
Society becomes an armed camp , with the values and the morale — as Albert Jay Nock once phrased it — of an " army on the march . "
The root myth that enables the State to wax fat off war is the canard that war is a defense by the State of its subjects .
The facts , of course , are precisely the reverse .
For if war is the health of the State , it is also its greatest danger .
A State can only " die " by defeat in war or by revolution .
In war , therefore , the State frantically mobilizes the people to fight for it against another State , under the pretext that it is fighting for them .
But all this should occasion no surprise ; we see it in other walks of life .
For which categories of crime does the State pursue and punish most intensely — those against private citizens or those against itself ?
The gravest crimes in the State ’s lexicon are almost invariably not invasions of person and property , but dangers to its own contentment : for example , treason , desertion of a soldier to the enemy , failure to register for the draft , conspiracy to overthrow the government .
Murder is pursued haphazardly unless the victim be a policeman , or Gott soll hten , an assassinated Chief of State ; failure to pay a private debt is , if anything , almost encouraged , but income tax evasion is punished with utmost severity ; counterfeiting the State ’s money is pursued far more relentlessly than forging private checks , etc .
All this evidence demonstrates that the State is far more interested in preserving its own power than in defending the rights of private citizens .
A final word about conscription : of all the ways in which war aggrandizes the State , this is perhaps the most flagrant and most despotic .
But the most striking fact about conscription is the absurdity of the arguments put forward on its behalf .
A man must be conscripted to defend his ( or someone else ’s ? ) liberty against an evil State beyond the borders .
Defend his liberty ?
How ?
By being coerced into an army whose very raison d’tre is the expunging of liberty , the trampling on all the liberties of the person , the calculated and brutal dehumanization of the soldier and his transformation into an efficient engine of murder at the whim of his " commanding officer " ?
14 Can any conceivable foreign State do anything worse to him than what " his " army is now doing for his alleged benefit ?
Who is there , O Lord , to defend him against his " defenders " ?
References
1 There are some libertarians who would go even further and say that no one should employ violence even in defending himself against violence .
However , even such Tolstoyans , or " absolute pacifists , " would concede the defender ’s right to employ defensive violence and would merely urge him not to exercise that right .
They , therefore , do not disagree with our proposition .
In the same way , a libertarian temperance advocate would not challenge a man ’s right to drink liquor , only his wisdom in exercising that right .
2 We shall not attempt to justify this axiom here .
Most libertarians and even conservatives are familiar with the rule and even defend it ; the problem is not so much in arriving at the rule as in fearlessly and consistently pursuing its numerous and often astounding implications .
3 Or , to bring up another famous antipacifist slogan , the question is not whether " we would be willing to use force to prevent the rape of our sister , " but whether , to prevent that rape , we are willing to kill innocent people and perhaps even the sister herself .
4 William Buckley and other conservatives have propounded the curious moral doctrine that it is no worse to kill millions than it is to kill one man .
The man who does either is , to be sure , a murderer ; but surely it makes a huge difference how many people he kills .
We may see this by phrasing the problem thus : after a man has already killed one person , does it make any difference whether he stops killing now or goes on a further rampage and kills many dozen more people ?
Obviously , it does .
5 Professor Robert L. Cunningham has defined the State as the institution with " a monopoly on initiating open physical coercion . "
Or , as Albert Jay Nock put it similarly if more caustically , " The State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime … .
It forbids private murder , but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale .
It punishes private theft , but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants . "
6 An outstanding example of pinpointing by revolutionaries was the invariable practice of the Irish Republican Army , in its later years , of making sure that only British troops and British government property were attacked and that no innocent Irish civilians were injured .
A guerrilla revolution not supported by the bulk of the people , of course , is far more likely to aggress against civilians .
7 If it be objected that a war could theoretically be financed solely by a State ’s lowering of nonwar expenditures , then the reply still holds that taxation remains greater than it could be without the war effect .
Moreover , the purport of this article is that libertarians should be opposed to government expenditures whatever the field , war or nonwar .
8 There is another consideration which applies rather to " domestic " defense within a State ’s territory : the less the State can successfully defend the inhabitants of its area against attack by criminals , the more these inhabitants may come to learn the inefficiency of state operations , and the more they will turn to non-State methods of defense .
Failure by the State to defend , therefore , has educative value for the public .
9 The international law mentioned in this paper is the old - fashioned libertarian law as had voluntarily emerged in previous centuries and has nothing to do with the modern statist accretion of " collective security . "
Collective security forces a maximum escalation of every local war into a worldwide war — the precise reversal of the libertarian objective of reducing the scope of any war as much as possible .
10 F.J.P. Veale , Advance to Barbarism ( Appleton , Wis. : C.C. Nelson , 1953 ) , p. 58 .
11 Two other points about Western imperialism : first , its rule is not nearly so liberal or benevolent as many libertarians like to believe .
The only property rights respected are those of the Europeans ; the natives find their best lands stolen from them by the imperialists and their labor coerced by violence into working the vast landed estates acquired by this theft .
Second , another myth holds that the " gunboat diplomacy " of the turn of the century was a heroic libertarian action in defense of the property rights of Western investors in backward countries .
Aside from our above strictures against going beyond any State ’s monopolized land area , it is overlooked that the bulk of gunboat moves were in defense , not of private investments , but of Western holders of government bonds .
The Western powers coerced the smaller governments into increasing tax aggression on their own people , in order to pay off foreign bondholders .
By no stretch of the imagination was this an action on behalf of private property — quite the contrary .
12 The Tolstoyan wing of the libertarian movement could urge the Western Ruritanians to engage in nonviolent revolution , for example , tax strikes , boycotts , mass refusal to obey government orders or a general strike — especially in arms factories .
Cf. the work of the revolutionary Tolstoyan , Bartelemy De Ligt , The Conquest of Violence : An Essay On War and Revolution ( New York : Dutton , 1938 ) .

14 To the old militarist taunt hurled against the pacifist : " Would you use force to prevent the rape of your sister ? " the proper retort is : " Would you rape your sister if ordered to do so by your commanding officer ? "

A Brooklyn man who claims he suffered the nightmare of all lost - luggage stories is demanding millions from American Airlines after it allegedly misplaced his deceased wife ’s body for four days .
According to the lawsuit , filed last week , the body of 57 - year - old Teresa Olaya was so badly decomposed when it finally arrived in Guayaquil , Ecuador , that her grieving husband , Miguel , had to forgo a traditional open - casket funeral .
“ During those days , a thousand things went through my mind , ” Olaya , 60 , told The Post .
“ Where is she ?
Is she dumped somewhere like an animal ?
And I had no answers for my daughter .
She would ask me , ‘ Where is my mami ? ’ ”
The awful saga began on March 28 when Olaya lost his wife of 26 years to pelvic cancer .
He made arrangements with a Brooklyn mortuary , DeRiso Funeral Home , to fly her body back to Ecuador .
DeRiso , which is also named as a defendant in the suit , did not respond to a request for comment .
Olaya , who came to the United States in 1994 , flew to Guayaquil with his 16 - year - old daughter , Laura , ahead of the body to begin making arrangements .
But on April 1 , when Teresa was slated to arrive on an American flight , officials at the airport had no answers for Olaya .
So he returned to the airport the following day , only to be given different – and sometimes contradictory – information .
One official told him the body was in Miami , another that it was in Guatemala City .
When Teresa ’s body finally arrived late at night on April 4 , Olaya saw that it had n’t been property refrigerated .
“ When I opened the casket , it was a terrible shock , ” said Olaya .
“ I still ca n’t get it out of my mind ”
“ They treated the body like a piece of baggage , ” said lawyer Christopher Robles , who said his client was seeking an unspecified seven - figure sum .
“ They did n’t keep it refrigerated . ”
A spokeswoman for the airline said the company could not comment on pending litigation .

We had the chance to interview former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman inside the Pepsi Center on Wednesday , during the Democratic National Convention .
Our concise conversation ranges from the Congressional Democrats ' failure to call for a full House vote on Contempt of Congress by Karl Rove , Siegelman 's 2002 election which he believes was " stolen electronically , " the corporate media 's inability to investigate or report on it , and the concern about whether or not Democrats will be in a forgive and forget mode after this session of Congress if Obama is successful in his quest for the White House .
Here 's our complete interview ( appx. 6 mins ) ...
Some pull - quotes from the interview ...
On his ' stolen ' 2002 election : " I went to bed the winner .
The media had been sent home .
The pollworkers had been sent home .
The party chairmen had been given their copies of the election results .
And then after midnight a light went on in the basement of the capitol , the basement of the courthouse , in the sheriff 's office , and 5,200 votes that were mine were shifted to my opponent . "
On Democrats : " Democrats are so magnanimous in victory , as they were after Watergate , they did nothing .
After the Iran - Contra scandal , they did nothing .
But what Democrats are going to want to do is get on with positive programs , to fix the damage that has been done by the Bush administration ...
But I view this as part of that positive change .
Finding out who hijacked the Department of Justice and who used it as a political weapon . "
On Rove : " If we do not vote the contempt citation , Karl Rove is simply going to get in his getaway car and thumb his nose at the Constitution , Congress , and the American people .
It creates almost two systems of justice : one for the powerful , those connected to the White House , and then another system for you and me and the rest of the people . "

Interview with Former AL Gov. Don Siegelman
by Brad Friedman of BradBlog.com Democratic National Convention
August 27 , 2008
BRAD FRIEDMAN : Governor Don Siegelman , happy to see you a free man , for now , at the Democratic National Convention .
GOV .
DON SIEGELMAN : Not as happy as I am for you to see me a free man .
BF : I bet .
Any luck with the Judiciary Committee , government committees , getting these investigations done on Karl Rove and their connection to your case ?
DS : Well , we 've had success because of the persistence of a few very strong Congressmen and Chairman Conyers .
But even though we have a contempt citation out of committee , it really means nothing unless the full House votes on this when they get back from recess .
So my purpose here at the Democratic National Convention is to convince the members of Congress that we have to have this on the agenda when they get back from this recess .
BF : And what kind of response are you getting from these folks ?
DS : Well , we 're getting a good response from the rank and file members of the House .
They want this contempt citation voted on .
If we do not vote the contempt citation , Karl Rove is simply going to get in his getaway car and thumb his nose at the Constitution , Congress , and the American people .
And it sends absolutely the wrong message .
It creates almost two systems of justice : one for the powerful , those connected to the White House , and then another system for you and me and the rest of the people .
BF : And if they do not vote in the full House this session , does that mean the contempt , it goes away ?
DS : It means , this is my interpretation : Democrats are so magnanimous in victory , as they were after Watergate , they did nothing .
After the Iran - Contra scandal , they did nothing .
But what Democrats are going to want to do is get on with positive programs , to fix the damage that has been done by the Bush administration .
And so ... but I view this as part of that positive change .
Finding out who hijacked the Department of Justice and who used it as a political weapon , and restoring justice and preserving our democracy crosses party lines .
This is about America .
It 's not about Republicans and Democrats , it 's about right and wrong .
BF : And do you , the sense that they 're going to go positive , if you will , if they win in November , after this administration ---
Is that a sense you get , or are they actually telling you , " Look , if this does n't happen now , it 's not going to happen afterwards ? "
DS : I 'm not being told that .
But I just know from ... history teaches us that Democrats have always looked to change .
They want to , they want to fix the problems and even though this is a very important problem , it 's viewed by some as a negative , something that 's dwelling in the past and not looking to the future .
That , I think , is looking at it the wrong way .
Because I think this is such an important issue .
Not just finding out who did it …
BF : Yeah .
DS : … but fixing it so that it does n't happen again .
BF : You 've spoken , I know , to a lot of folks in the corporate mainstream media about what happened in 2002 .
You went to bed the winner , that night , of the election .
You woke up .
They found numbers had , as I think you put it , been electronically manipulated in ... Baldwin County , was it ?
DS : Baldwin County .
I went to bed the winner .
The media had been sent home .
The pollworkers had been sent home .
The party chairmen had been given their copies of the election results .
And then after midnight a light went on in the basement of the capitol , the basement of the courthouse , in the sheriff 's office , and 5,200 votes that were mine were shifted to my opponent .
And when I asked for a recount , Karl Rove 's client , the Attorney General , said he was going to put anybody in jail who tried to recount those votes .
BF : You say a light went on ?
DS : Well …
BF : Literally , or … ?
DS : No , they actually had closed the courthouse .
And everybody had left except for just a few people in the basement in the sheriff 's office .
BF : So we know that in fact they were there in the middle of the night doing something .
Nobody knows what it was ?
DS : Absolutely .
BF : And you told that story , I think , to , I remember , Washington Post , Dan Abrams .
Has anybody picked up on that angle of your story in the corporate media ?
Because I have n't heard it .
DS : No , not really .
It is one of those things that , it happened ... you know , people do n't want to believe that elections are stolen in this country .
They do n't want to believe that we go to war under false premises .
And they do n't want to believe that their Department of Justice is used as a political tool .
But in fact , in this administration , one can argue that those things have indeed happened .
BF : Is it your suspicion that your election was stolen electronically , or is it your belief that it was ?
DS : Oh , it 's not just my belief .
People who 've looked at this election and have studied the figures --- they 've done regressive analysis of voting trends --- say it 's a statistical impossibility .
There was electronic voting manipulation in the 2002 governor 's race in Baldwin County .
BF : Do the records , the database records , from that election still exist somewhere ?
DS : No .
BF : They 've been destroyed ?
DS : Those have been destroyed .
BF : Governor , good to talk to you .
Good to see you out of jail .
Keep up the good work and thank you for making noise .
DS : Absolutely .
Thank you , Brad .
BF : Thank you , sir .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The capture of two cocaine - laden semi-submarines in the past week has highlighted the increasing use of the vessels , which now transport one - third of illicit drugs in the eastern Pacific , a major route between Colombia and the United States , U.S. authorities said Friday .
This 60 - foot semi- submersible vessel sank after U.S. authorities boarded it September 17 .
The first seizure occurred September 12 , when a Coast Guard team , under cover of darkness , boarded a 59 - foot semi-submersible 370 nautical miles southwest of Guatemala .
The startled Colombian smugglers reversed the vessel in an effort to throw the boarding party overboard , but the Coast Guard was able to seize the craft , its four - person crew and its 237 bales of cocaine .
Just five days later , on Wednesday morning , a 60 - foot semi-submersible was seized about 200 nautical miles south of Guatemala .
As the boarding team unloaded the last few bales , the Coast Guard said , the unstable vessel began to take on water through its exhaust vents and sank .
Watch what was found inside one of the subs »
Each boat carried about 7 tons of cocaine worth $ 196 million .
U.S. Navy , Coast Guard and Drug Enforcement Administration officials say South American drug cartels are turning to semi-submersible vessels , which have a low profile to avoid detection , because of the government 's success at thwarting other smuggling techniques , including the use of fishing trawlers and speed boats .
Between 2000 and 2007 , U.S. authorities said , there were 23 drug sub " events " that they know of .
But the number of sightings has mushroomed .
There have been 62 events in the first three quarters of fiscal 2008 , officials said .
" This is a serious threat that is growing , both in volume of cocaine shipped and in sophistication of the craft , " said Rear Adm .
Joseph R. Castillo , the Coast Guard 's director of response policy .
The Coast Guard has captured only a small number of the vessels known or believed to have crossed the area , it said .
In some cases , the crews have scuttled the semi-subs to avoid prosecution .
Coast Guard officials say the semi-subs typically are built in the jungles of Colombia , are 25 to 65 feet long , have crews of four or five people and are capable of speeds of up to 13 knots with a range of over 5,000 nautical miles .
The vessels ' low profile makes them extraordinarily hard to detect , either visually or by radar .
Intelligence played a role in the two most recent busts , officials said .
Locating semi-subs " is more difficult than finding a needle in a haystack , " said Michael Braun , chief of operations for the DEA .
" When you look at the vast amount of sea that they have to patrol to find these things , we 're talking about an area , I believe , that 's twice the size of the United States . "
U.S. Drug Czar John Walters said Friday that the success in capturing subs has contributed to a reduced supply of cocaine on U.S. streets , evidenced by high cocaine prices and declining quality .
" Today we are now over 20 months into significant and sustained shortages of cocaine on the streets of the United States , " Walters said .
" Last year alone , workplace drug testing [ that returned positive ] for cocaine dropped 19 percent .
This is closing the vise .
And in the process of closing the vise , [ smugglers ] have tried new techniques . "
Walters said smugglers are reluctant to sail on the semi-subs because they are dangerous .
" Some of them are little better than death traps , which is the degree to which they 've been pressed to try to continue this deadly trade , even though they can't keep up . "
The Coast Guard and the drug czar support legislation to impose stiff penalties for operating a semi-sub on the open seas .
" We want to criminalize the use of these in the high seas so that it 's not OK to just scuttle them , get rid of the drugs and be free from prosecution , " Walters said .

Comparisons to the stock market crash of 1929 were tossed around last week as the Dow Jones industrial average had its worst week in at least 75 years .
Despite a big rally on Monday after countries around the world vowed to inject new capital into banks , anxieties linger about the long - term effects , particularly in New York , where the city ’s economic fate is so closely intertwined with what happens on Wall Street .
In trying to make sense of recent events , a historian at the College of William and Mary has argued the crisis is not unlike the Panic of 1873 , when rampant real estate speculation culminated in a credit crunch , and banking failures that led to broad panic in the stock markets .
That crash lasted more than four years .
While the 1929 stock market collapse is widely perceived by economists to have played a role in the economic contraction , the stock market collapse in 1873 — much like the one now — came after a building boom created by easily obtainable mortgages and an ensuing banking crisis , said Prof.
Scott Reynolds Nelson , whose piece in The Chronicle of Higher Education has been widely translated into Korean , Spanish , Italian and Russian ( and noted in our sister blog , Economix ) .
“ Most people do n’t know a lot about it , but people who do know a lot about it are really creeped out , ” Professor Nelson said of the 1873 crisis , which resulted in a near total collapse of the financial system .
Since his article was published , Professor Nelson , who specializes in 19th - century history , has gotten many calls from Wall Street observers asking about how the 1873 crisis played out .
He has even received an offer to write a financial column for the Motley Fool , which he found amusing .
“ Can you imagine how bizarre it would be for a 19th - century historian to write about the lessons of the day ? ” he said .
A visit to Google Books and The Times ’s archives helps trace the arc of the 1873 crash .
Before the panic , railroad and real estate speculation had been rampant [ pdf ] — and values had multiplied to unheard of heights .
Credit was easy , and new financial instruments were created , including new types of railroad bonds whose values no one could be sure of .
American securities were traded worldwide and about two - thirds of those bonds were held overseas , according to Professor Nelson .
As one historian , James Ford Rhodes , who lived through the period , observed
Prosperity was written all over the face of things .
Manufacturers were busy workmen in demand .
Streets and shops were crowded and everywhere new buildings going up .
Prices of commodities were in high , demand pretty good .
Everybody seemed to be making money .
Yet , there were already financial problems in Europe .
The panic here started on a Thursday , Sept. 18 , when the prominent house that had essentially financed the Civil War , Jay Cooke & Company , had a cash crunch — in part because of the collapse of the ill - conceived Northern Pacific Railroad — and said it would suspend payments on the notes it had issued — akin to declaring bankruptcy .
The announcement hit Wall Street with the force of a thunderbolt from a clear sky .
As the Times reported at the time :
The brokers stood perfectly thunderstruck for a moment , and then there was a general run to notify the different houses of Wall Street of the failure .
The brokers surged out of the Exchange , stumbling pell mell over one another in general confusion and reached their offices in race horse time .
The members of the firms who were surprised by this announcement had no time to deliberate .
The bear clique was already selling the market down in the Exchange , and prices were declining frightfully .
Within a day , other financial houses began to fail , including Fisk and Hatch , believed to be “ one of the richest and soundest in New York . ”
The names of 18 other companies [ pdf ] unable to stand by their contracts were read off , leading to greater panic , a scene where “ jobbers squared off at each other and screamed and yelled violently , flinging their arms around and producing a scene which bedlam itself could not equal . ”
The government announced it would buy $ 10 million in bonds [ pdf ] to try to inject confidence into the financial system .
Investors started trading the next day , a Saturday , optimistic that the panic had subsided [ pdf ] .
But it had n’t and on that day , Sept. 20 , the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for the first time in its history .
On Sunday morning , President Ulysses S. Grant and the treasury secretary , William A. Richardson , came to New York , spending the day in consultation with Cornelius Vanderbilt , Henry Clews and other prominent business men to cobble together a solution .
Businessmen , bankers and merchants flocked to the Fifth Avenue Hotel , beseeching President Grant to increase the currency by every means in his power , declaring that unless the government came to the rescue nothing could save the country from bankruptcy and ruin .
Meanwhile , banking houses in cities outside New York also failed .
Meanwhile , the government , having bought about $ 13 million in bonds , had reached the end of its tether and stopped this mode of relief .
With the credit markets frozen , at one point the overnight lending rate shot to a quarter of a percentage point , Professor Nelson said , which annualized is about 148 percent .
The top national banks of New York formed a Clearing House Committee [ pdf ] , pooling their cash and collateral into a common fund and issuing loan certificates against it that would operate like cash .
This became the basis for the reconstruction of the credit markets .
Eventually , on Wall Street , the panic “ had run its course , like a great fire that burned itself out ” [ pdf ] .
But it took about 40 days [ pdf ] .
During the full course of the crisis , 73 members of the stock exchange and 5,000 mercantile companies [ pdf ] failed .
Even though the Wall Street panic was over , the commercial crisis across the country was just beginning because of the lingering credit crunch .
Even two months later in Richmond , Va. , just before Election Day , the effects of the economic crash were quite visible with shuttered tobacco companies , all - but - closed flour mills and a retail slowdown .
A number of railroads defaulted in the payment of the interest on their bonds ( and railroad construction dropped from 7,000 miles in 1873 to 1,700 in 1875 ) [ pdf ] .
Businesses with good credit curtailed their purchases , while those with bad credit had no buying power .
The closing of cotton and iron mills and other manufacturers threw hordes of laborers into unemployment , many of them former Civil War soldiers .
They became transients , and the words “ tramp ” and “ bum ” became commonplace American terms .
Relief rolls grew rapidly in major cities , with 25 percent unemployment in New York City alone .
The panic was not without political consequences .
The collapse of farm prices set the scene for an agrarian insurgency .
Disenchanted farmers who believed that the government ’s mismanaged currency policy was determined by Eastern bankers and industrialists eventually formed the short - lived Populist Party , which called for a graduated income tax , pensions and nationalizing transportation and communication .
This recession hit industrial workers particularly bad .
A bitter antagonism emerged between workers and the leaders of banking and manufacturing , which led to labor unrest that continued through the following decades , resulting in some of the most violent strikes in American history .
In January 1874 , police violently broke up a demonstration by thousands of unemployed workers in New York ’s Tompkins Square Park , which was the largest demonstration in the city ’s history .
The financial crisis led Congress to pass a bill in 1874 that would allow for more printing of currency to spur inflation and reduce the real value of debts .
In a surprise move that was viewed by many as the most important event of his administration to that point , President Grant vetoed the bill .
In early 1875 , Congress passed a bill , known as the Specie Resumption Act , which would back United States currency with gold .
By pegging the dollar against hard currency , the act helped curb inflation , tame speculation and produce a stable dollar .
It turned the Republican Party toward a stance of conservative fiscal policies .
The American and world economy did recover — slowly , but it took more than four years of depression .
A 1911 New York Times magazine article assessed the panic , observing in a perhaps overly lyrical way :
However , as the sun always shines after rain , so conditions began to improve in 1877 , and by 1878 there was a better feeling throughout the nation .
Confidence returned slowly , but it did return , and the tide of prosperity rose steadily until its inspiration had penetrated every city and hamlet in the country .
The fertile lands of the West and South brought forth bountiful harvests , and ocean commerce expanded under the stimulus of good crops .
The excess of American exports was only one of the features of this golden period in our affairs , which broke all records .
Stocks began their rise in spring of 1878 , and in 1879 , men of means awoke suddenly to the fact that railroads were of value as investments after all , and a marvelous buying of securities sprang up , which electrified the financial world and led to a boom in prices . ”
The article argued ( perhaps too simplistically ) that the panic ultimately helped to impose belt - tightening for consumers and businesses , a moderation that proved healthy for the post - panic economy : “ During the depression of the 1870s , much wealth had been accumulated and people had learned to be economical and more efficient . ”
An optimist could perhaps argue that the current financial crisis will also cause consumers and businesses to change their habits .
Indeed , some changes are already happening :
The last independent investment banks have agreed to live with more regulations as they become bank holding companies , and consumer debt dropped in August , the first time it has fallen in a decade .
Across the US , many firms are reluctant to hire new staff
The US unemployment rate climbed to 5.7 % in July official figures show , its highest in more than four years .
Firms cut workers for a seventh month in a row , but the losses were fewer than analysts had been expecting .
The economy lost 51,000 non-farm jobs the US Labor Department said , the same as the newly - revised figure for June , when unemployment was at 5.5 % .
Economists had been expecting about 75,000 jobs to go , but said July 's data still indicated the economy was weak .
It 's not a good number but it 's not as bad as expected
Marc Pado , Cantor Fitzgerald .
US companies have been reluctant to add staff amid higher oil and food prices , and slowing economic growth .
The only major sectors showing job creation were government , hospitality , education and health services .
About 22,000 jobs went in the construction sector while factories cut 35,000 jobs .
' Mild , long recession '
The Labor Department also heavily - revised figures for the previous two months .
It said that 47,000 jobs were cut in May instead of the 62,000 previously stated , and that 51,000 were cut in June rather than 62,000 .
" People really thought the non-farm payrolls number ( for July ) was going to be bad number , " said Marc Pado , a market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald .
" So not only was the latest number 20 - 25,000 better - than - expected but the prior two months were revised up .
So it 's not a good number but it 's not as bad as expected . "
However , while layoffs were limited , there was no sign of firms going on a " hiring binge " either , said Brian Gendreau of ING Investment , who feared a " mild , but longer recession " than the US saw in 2001 - 2002 .
" This figure might not be as weak as expected but it is still painful , " he said .
" I do n't think this will change anyone 's perceptions on slow economic growth . "

' The Painted Turtle ' Paul Newman Tribute ( Photos )
The Painted Turtle brought together family and friends who gathered to honor the legacy and celebrated the life of .
He was not only a wonderful actor but an extraordinary human being who lost his battle with lung cancer last month .
Paul Newman founded the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp The Painted Turtle , a residential summer camp that serves seriously ill children .
The program assists kids in gaining hope when their will to go on diminishes and provides them the ability to lead a rich , productive life .
If you were to step foot on the grounds , you would think that you were at a traditional camp site with swimming , boating , fishing , horseback riding and arts and crafts .
When you dig deeper you will see that there are no activities that can not be done by each and every child no matter what their illness .
The children are well cared for and the camp provides one adult for every two campers as well as nurses who are in the children 's cabin in order to assist them with their activities .
The staff is made up of a compilation of the best medical specialty professionals that California has to offer .
Last night 's event was held at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco where celebrities came to remember , honor and enhance Paul Newman 's legacy by lending their support to one of his important programs .
Check out our photo gallery below .

Both Kevin and I have noted the absurd Washington Post essay by Donald Luskin titled “ A NATION OF EXAGGERATORS : Quit Doling Out That Bad- Economy Line . ”
It was published on Sunday morning , 12 to 24 hours before news broke that the American economy is basically in shambles , making it one of the most poorly timed pieces of punditry ever .
But what Kevin and I both missed is that Luskin advises John McCain on the economy !
He admits it halfway through the piece , saying , “ Full disclosure : I ’m an adviser to John McCain ’s campaign . ”
Get a load of the wisdom Luskin is providing McCain .
This is from the piece :
Things today just are n’t that bad .
Sure , there are trouble spots in the economy , as the government takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and jitters about Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers , amply demonstrate .
And unemployment figures are up a bit , too .
None of this , however , is cause for depression — or exaggerated Depression comparisons .
Luskin follows this with a number of arguments ( bolstered by statistics , of course ) that would cause anyone with a rudimentary grasp of the American economy to spit out their coffee .
Like this one :
A housing “ slump , ” a housing “ crisis ” ?
A “ severe ” price decline ?
According to the latest report from the National Association of Realtors , the median price of an existing home is up 8.5 percent from the low of last February .
And according to the U.S. Census Bureau , the median price of a new home is up 1.3 percent from the low of last December .
Home prices may not be at all - time highs — and there are pockets of continuing decline in some urban areas — but overall they ’ve clearly stopped going down and have started to recover .
So why keep proclaiming a “ crisis ” after it ’s over ?
Sure , yeah , the housing crisis ( sorry , “ crisis ” ) is over .
Over !
All those investment banks that are tanking because of their investments in mortgage - backed securities … well , shoot , I guess Donald Luskin will have a hard time explaining them .
But frankly , Luskin is more interested in telling you to shut your worrying pie-hole .
He writes :
McCain campaign adviser and former U.S. senator Phil Gramm was right in July when he said that our current state “ is a mental recession . ”
Maybe he was out of line when he added that the United States has become “ a nation of whiners . ”
But when it comes to the economy , we have surely become a nation of exaggerators .
Got that ?
Donald Luskin does n’t want to hear one word about gas prices , you underinsured , economically - insecure middle class putz !
The economy is wonderful and unicorns are prancing with anthropomorphized rainbows among showers of glitter in the clouds .
I never go to Dunkin ' Donuts .
I think the coffee tastes like sweet potatoes .
But Jenn Abelson 's story today about the chain 's expansion into China makes me want to go .
In Shanghai , that is , where Dunkin ' just opened .
It 's because of this photo .
Ryan Pyle / WPN for The Boston Globe
Those are mochi ring doughnuts .
Abelson writes : " Dunkin ' staff experimented with foods with a local twist , like mochi rings , chewy treats made of glutinous rice that are fried in oil , and marinated lamb sandwiches .
They worked for months to perfect the right color , sweetness , and texture of the green tea latte , a concoction with the thickness and color of pea soup . "
That sounds great !
Much better than egg and cheese biscuits and Coolatas .

Those articles you sent me were very illuminating ... about the crookedness of so many lawyers and judges .
How could these people stonewall when this is a Constitutional matter ?
You have n't seen anything yet !!
There is an ongoing war against the Constitution : NOW YOU KNOW !!
The construction of the Qualification Clause for President is like the single thread that unravels a entire garment :
Correctly constructed , as it should be , it also proves that State Citizens may not vote or serve on juries , whether grand juries or trial juries , whether Federal Juries or State juries .
That alone entirely VOIDs any and all election (s ) in which State Citizens are barred from voting .
Those who can vote and serve on juries , cannot serve in the House , Senate or White House .
Those who can serve in the House , Senate or White House can not vote or serve on juries .
Yes , despite the Guarantee Clause guaranteeing a Republican Form of Government , the population of federal citizens inhabiting the 50 States is an
absolute legislative democracy .
Now you know exactly what they mean by " democracy " !!

( WINNING BRIEF !!)
1 . The issues as to whether there are different meanings for the term " United States " , and whether there are three different " United States " operating within the same geographical area , and one " United States " operating outside the Constitution over its own territory ( in which it has citizens belonging to said " United States " ) , were settled in 1901 by the Supreme Court in the cases of De Lima v. Bidwell , 182 U.S. 1 and Downes v. Bidwell , 182 U.S. 244 .
In Downes supra , Justice Harlan dissented as follows :
The idea prevails with some -- indeed , it found expression in arguments at the bar -- that we have in this country substantially or practically two national governments ; one , to be maintained under the Constitution , with all its restrictions ; the other to be maintained by Congress outside and independently of that instrument , by exercising such powers as other nations of the earth are accustomed to exercise .
[ Downes supra , page 380 , emphasis added ]
He went on to say , on page 382 :
It will be an evil day for American liberty if the theory of a government outside of the supreme law of the land finds lodgment in our constitutional jurisprudence .
No higher duty rests upon this court than to exert its full authority to prevent all violation of the principles of the Constitution .
[ Downes supra , page 382 , emphasis added ]
2 . This theory of a government operating outside the Constitution over its own territory , with [ federal ] citizens of the " United States " belonging thereto under Article 4 , Section 3 , Clause 2 ( 4:3:2 ) of the Constitution , was further confirmed in 1922 by the Supreme Court in Balzac v. Porto Rico , 258 U.S. 298 ( EXHIBIT # 4 ) , wherein that Court affirmed , at page 305 , that the Constitution does not apply outside the limits of the 50 States of the Union , quoting Downes supra and De Lima supra ; that , under 4:3:2 , the " United States " was given exclusive power over the territories and the citizens of the " United States " residing therein .

HOWEVER , Congress had expressly extended the ENTIRE U.S. CONSTITUTION
into D.C. and into all Federal Territories , in 1871 and 1873 , respectively --

We found a third such " Extension Statute " here :
http://www.supremelaw.org/cc/ simons/reply.htm
RELATED RESEARCH NOW REVEALS A THIRD EXTENSION STATUTE
The chain of evidence leading to statutes codified in Title 48 now compels Appellant to present a key holding of the Third Circuit , in a case again comparing constitutional courts , on the one hand , and territorial courts also known as legislative tribunals , on the other :
... [ V]esting a territorial court with jurisdiction similar to that vested in the District Courts of the United States does not make it a " District Court of the United States . "
[ Parrot v. Government of Virgin Islands ]
[ 230 F.3d 615 , 623 , hns .
11-12 ( 3rd Cir. 2000 ) ]
[ bold emphasis added ]
In this context , see also the following finding by a Federal district judge presiding upon a territorial court in U.S. v. King , in 1954 before the Territory of Alaska was admitted to the Union in 1959 :
... [ T ]he term " district court of the United States " standing alone includes only the constitutional courts .
[ United States v. King , 119 F.Supp. 398 ( DC / Alaska 1954 ) ]
[ bold emphasis added ]
The Parrot case cites high Court authorities in Mookini v. U.S. , 303 U.S. 201 ( 1938 ) and also in Barnard v. Thorstenn , 489 U.S. 546 , 551-552 ( 1989 ) .
The decision in Barnard held that the Supreme Court lacked supervisory power over the District Court of the Virgin Islands because that Court was not an Article III Federal district court .
Moreover , the Barnard case also reveals the existence of a third " Extension Statute " as follows :
By extending the Privileges and Immunities Clause to the Virgin Islands , Congress has made the same decision with respect to that Territory .
The residency requirements of [ Local ] Rule 56 ( b ) violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV , § 2 , of the Constitution , as extended to the Virgin Islands by 48 U.S.C. § 1561 .
[ Barnard v. Thorstenn , 489 U.S. 546 , 559 ( 1989 ) ]
[ bold emphasis added ]
Appellant now lodges a formal objection to 48 U.S.C. 1561 supra , because Congress has previously extended all guarantees of the U.S. Constitution into all Federal Territories –- even future Federal Territories –- by Act of 1873 as previously cited and discussed in Appellant 's other pleadings now pending before this Court of Appeals .
Paraphrasing the Parrot decision supra , vesting a territorial tribunal like the USDC with jurisdiction similar to that vested in the District Courts of the United States cannot make the USDC an Article III " District Court of the United States " !
See Balzac v. Porto Rico .
This must be true notwithstanding the Statute at Large which effectively " broadcasted " the USDC into all States of the Union on June 25 , 1948 , but without expressly abolishing the Article III DCUS which had existed inside those several States for at least 159 years prior to that date .
See 28 U.S.C. 132 , 62 Stat. 895 , § 132(a ) .
When Congress extended the entire U.S. Constitution into D.C. in 1871 , and then into all Federal Territories in 1873 , even future Federal Territories , and then again into the Virgin Islands ( with some qualifications : cf. 48 U.S.C. 1561 ) , a clear pattern was established .
That pattern is quite the opposite of any Congressional intent to change the DCUS substantially by eliminating its historic jurisdiction and / or by vesting all DCUS with jurisdiction similar to that vested in territorial tribunals , where Congress enjoys exclusive legislative jurisdiction ( read " the federal zone " ) .
The latter intent is also quite the opposite of the clear legislative intent as stated in the Miscellaneous Provisions , i.e. " as continuations of existing law " , e.g. the law of court jurisdiction .
See 62 Stat. 985 , Sec. 2 ( b ) .
The historical record therefore proves that Congress never expressed any intent to abolish the DCUS , nor is there any evidence in that record that Congress intended to make the USDC a " District Court of the United States " .
Appellant is forced to speculate that FDR returned from the Yalta Conference with a secret deal which he shared with Truman , namely : to end WWII , foreign banks agreed to finance the United States , provided that its government agreed to lien on the assets of all American People , in order to repay those massive loans .
When FDR died , Truman inherited that " deal " and thus was launched the Bill which later broadcasted the USDC into every State of the Union .

Those articles you sent me were very illuminating ... about the crookedness of so many lawyers and judges .
How could these people stonewall when this is a Constitutional matter ?

As if further evidence was needed of the phenomenon that is " Joe the Plumber " ( however brief it may be ) , there comes this e-mail advisory :
Real Toledo Area Plumbers to Hold Press Conference to Express Their Grave Concerns with Senator McCain ’s Economic Policies
The message goes on to advise that in Northwood , Ohio , today " members of Local 50 Plumbers , Steamfitters and Service Mechanics " will not only take questions but " share their concerns with several of Sen.
McCain 's proposals , including his plan to tax employer - based healthcare insurance , his tax proposal which favors the wealthy over working Ohioans and other issues that will impact working families . "
The gathering takes place shortly before a scheduled McCain appearance in Westerville , Ohio .
Joe the Plumber -- aka Samuel " Joe " Wurzelbacher -- lives in Holland , Ohio , and was invited to McCain 's rally .
No word on whether the fellow the the Republican presidential candidate thrust into the spotlight as an iconic working stiff ( but who , as it turns out , is not an officially licensed plumber ) will make it .
( UPDATE : The Huffington Post reports that in Colorado , Democrats have unleashed electronic messages that feature a plumber identified as Joe Martinez .
In the robo calls , Martinez touts Barack Obama 's tax plan . )

Many shops in the Japanese capital are conveniently situated in the city ’s dizzying array of department stores ; places where climate control and carefully coiffured cuties are commonplace — compulsory even .
Yet down certain side streets and a bit of the beaten track , outlets with more character , if not exactly customers , can be found .
Like this shop specialising in brooms for example .
A store that , perhaps due to a niche that ’s not exactly necessary nowadays , unfortunately has n’t had the pleasure of a patron since 1972 — Saturday , September 2nd , to be precise .
And even then the customer in question was after a hand brush that unfortunately they did n’t have .
WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS ?
What is this ineffable , subjective stuff — this thing , substance , process , energy , soul , whatever — that you experience as the sounds and sights of life , as pain or as pleasure , as anger or as the nagging feeling at the back of your head that maybe you ’re not meant for this job after all .
The question of the nature of consciousness is at the heart of the ancient mind - body problem .
How does subjective consciousness relate to the objective universe , to matter and energy ?
Consciousness is the only way we experience the world .
Without it , you would be like a sleepwalker in a deep , dreamless sleep , acting in the world , speaking , having babies , but without feeling anything .
You would feel nothing , nada , nichts , rien .
Indeed , in the most famous deduction of Western thought , philosopher and mathematician Ren Descartes concluded that because he was conscious he existed .
That was his only unassailable proof that he was n’t just a chimera .
Maybe he did n’t have the body he thought he had , maybe he had fake memories ( premonitions of The Matrix ) , but because he was conscious he must exist .
Yet the questions go on .
Are only people conscious ?
What about a fetus ?
What about a neurological patient in a persistent vegetative state , such as Terri Schiavo ( who died in 2005 ) , who ca n’t do much more than open and close her eyes ?
Although many are willing to accord sentience , consciousness , to our beloved cats and dogs , what about apes , monkeys , whales , mice , bees and all the other critters on the planet ?
Can a fly be conscious ?
What about artificial consciousness ?
Is your cool iPhone sentient ?
Can machines ever become conscious , as is widely assumed in so many science - fiction novels and movies ?
Until recently , these questions were purely within the domain of speculative philosophy and fantasy .
But over the past decades , science has been making huge strides in exploring the brain .
An immense number of psychological , medical , neurobiological and physical stories about consciousness can now be told .
Each Consciousness
Redux essay will illuminate one facet of one of the most central , enduring and puzzling aspects of the world , subjective feelings .
I am a scientist who seeks rational explanations of ineffable consciousness and of how and why it arises in the brain .
But I also realize that our universe is a strange place ; there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in philosophy .
So I try to be humble when it comes to one of the most mystifying aspects of this universe — that I wake up each day and find myself conscious , capable of seeing , touching , loving , feeling and remembering .
I am not a zombie !
Many different traditions besides the modern scientific one have provided answers , and we should not reject them out of hand but listen to them .
Unconscious Influences
As I write these lines , I am flying back from the annual meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness that took place , this year , in Taipei , Taiwan .
It ’s a gathering of hard - nosed philosophers , neurologists , psychologists and neuroscientists concerned with consciousness .
One of its high points is an annual award , named in honor of the father of American psychology .
The 2008 William James Prize for Contributions to the Study of Consciousness went to Naotsugu Tsuchiya , a young neurobiologist from the California Institute of Technology .
What had he done that caught the attention of the prize committee ?
In 2005 Tsuchiya invented a technique , continuous flash suppression , which renders a picture invisible , hiding it from your conscious sight .
Yet some part of your brain has access to the image and influences your behavior in untold ways .
The way it works is simple .
Say Tsuchiya wants to camouflage a picture of an angry male face .
With the help of a split computer screen , Tsuchiya projects a faint image of this snarling guy into your left eye .
Your right eye sees a rapidly changing set of colored rectangles , one on top of another .
If you keep both eyes open , all you see are the ever changing series of colored patches but no angry face .
The constantly flickering colors attract your attention in a way that the static portrait does not .
As soon as you close your right eye , the face becomes visible .
But otherwise you have no inkling that the face is there , even though your left eye has been staring at it for many minutes .
You simply do not see it .
So what is the big deal ?
Subconsciously Active
Functional brain imaging shows that this angry face still activates a part of your brain that is concerned with fear , the amygdala .
That is , at least some sector of your brain knows about the face — as it ought to because an angry male face in front of you might spell big trouble .
This brain activity remains unconscious but may influence your behavior or generate a subtle feeling of unease .
Using this technique , psychologist Sheng He , with his student Yi Jiang and their colleagues at the University of Minnesota , made an intriguing discovery .
They projected to one eye a photograph of a naked person on one side of the gaze and a scrambled version of the same image on the other side .
They then hid both using continuous flash suppression .
The paid volunteers who participated in the experiment never saw anything but flashes of color .
The psychologists asked the volunteers to guess whether the naked person was in the left or the right part of the image .
But they could n’t .
Their guesses were no better than chance .
He and Jiang demonstrated that the observers attended to the naked picture but not to its scrambled counterpart .
Even more interesting , straight males attended to pictures of naked women but were slightly repelled by pictures of naked men .
Straight women were attracted to pictures of naked men without showing a consistent repulsion for pictures of naked women .
Gay men behaved much like straight women ; they unconsciously paid attention to the pictures of the naked men but not to those of women .
What is disconcerting about this experiment is that this all took place outside the pale of consciousness .
Because the observers never actually saw the naked images , they had no idea they were attracted or repelled by them .
This experiment is scary because it seems as if people ’s sexual orientation could be inferred ( statistically ) from their unconscious attentional biases .
An example of the unconscious mind at work .
Freud would have loved it .
What this experiment teaches us is that the mind has many nooks and crannies ; some — probably the minority — are consciously accessible , whereas most are hidden from introspection , lost in the vast catacombs of the brain .
Yet they can powerfully influence your behavior , making you do things without knowing why .
Continuous flash suppression — and other techniques that magicians and psychologists have invented to distract you so you do not see things while looking at them — in combination with functional brain imaging is a delicate tool to map the landscape of the visual unconscious .

Well , its not as juicy as " Sex , Lies and Videotape " but two women running for a North Carolina seat have employed their gender , accusations of lying and lots of videotape during their election campaigns .
At the heat of their cat fight ?
Christianity .
The two women are locked in one of the closest races the Senate has seen .
According to an Dole 's 30 - second advertisement shows clips of some members of an atheist advocacy group — the Godless Americans Political Action Committee — talking about some of their goals , such as taking " under God " out of the Pledge of Allegiance and removing " In God We Trust " from U.S. currency .
It goes on to question why Hagan went to a fundraiser at the home of a man who serves as an adviser to the group .
A move that has brought negative comments from fellow Republican political figures , one who calls it " risky " and " getting on thin ice . "
Hagan 's campaign goes on to say " Godless Americans and Kay Hagan .
She hid from cameras .
Took Godless money .
What did Hagan promise in return ? "
The ad ends with a woman in the background of Hagan saying " There is no God ! " Kay Hagan , a Presbyterian church member , elder and Sunday school teacher , has filed a defamation and libel lawsuit against Dole , claiming the advertisement is causing injury to her name and reputation .
Hagan also released " Elizabeth Dole 's attacks on my Christian faith are offensive , " Hagan says in the ad .
" She even faked my voice in her TV ad to make you think I do n't believe in God .
Well , I believe in God .
I taught Sunday School .
My faith guides my life , and Sen .
Dole knows it . "
Dole 's campaign made the statement that it has no intent to remove the ad , calling all claims factual and the lawsuit , a " silly political gimmick . "
Some of North Carolina 's media are comparing the ad to a racially inflammatory ad from the 90s campaign involving Harvey Gantt , the black challenger to Despite Dole 's popularity and " sure thing " status , Hagan 's strength in the campaign has surprised many .
That strength is said to come from the Obama excitement sweeping the nation .
Is Dole 's effort to smear Hagan 's faith , twisting her dedication to the LORD by showing an advertisement that would lead people to believe she was n't a follower , a true claim of defamation and libel ?
Or is this just another case of bad campaign tactics employed to attempt to lift one 's own standings by hurting others ?
The legal case will be interesting to follow but the election , well , it will reveal the truth .
Republican U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Dole , North Carolina 's representative for the past six years , is apparently taking the final days of her campaign up a notch .
Known for her strong faith and speaking often of prayer , a recent ad released by the Senator questions the faith of her opponent , Democrat Kay Hagen

Hagan also released a retaliatory ad of her own , alluding to Dole herself not being a very good Christian by violating the Ninth Commandment .
In Hagan 's own words : Dole 's campaign made the statement that it has no intent to remove the ad , calling all claims factual and the lawsuit , a " silly political gimmick . "
Some of North Carolina 's media are comparing the ad to a racially inflammatory ad from the 90s campaign involving Harvey Gantt , the black challenger to former Senator Jesse Helms .
The last - minute ad campaign revealed a pair of white hands destroying a " rejection notice " from an assumed job position that was offered to a less - qualified minority candidate .
The reportedly racist and bigoted Senator from North Carolina died earlier this year .

Maximillion Cooper knows the far - flung .
The British founder of the Gumball 3000 , an annual celebrity - laden rally celebrating its 10th year , has blazed a trail across the globe from the United States to Europe to Thailand in his Lamborghini .
With the Gumball brand extending to fashion and film , Cooper now has eight companies that pulled in combined revenue of over $ 55 million last year .
The 36 - year - old mogul 's success and notoriety , for better or worse , has launched him onto the world 's stage , in front of some of the least likely people in the least likely places .
Which brings me to the 2008 Gumball 3000 that just wrapped up in August -- when Cooper led over 50 rally participants ( paying nearly $ 120,000 each ) on a weeklong , 3,000 - mile adrenaline - pumping adventure from San Francisco to Beijing , with a detour through Kim Jong Il 's personal Eden .
Pyongyang , North Korea , a Communist state once tossed together with Iraq and Iran to make up President Bush 's Axis of evil , has been closed off from the rest of the world for decades and has gone completely untouched by popular culture .
On the heels of his most ambitious business trip yet , Inc.com caught up with Cooper about how he got Kim Jong
Il to allow the world 's richest misfits to paint a gray city red .
How did you get the idea to take Gumball to North Korea ?
About three years ago while I was in China I happened to meet the North Korean ambassador to the United Kingdom .
He later invited us to go to Pyongyang on holiday and we were blown away by the place .
It 's stuck in this 1950s time warp .
During a dinner a few months later , the North Korean ambassador asked if we'd be interested in taking the Gumball race to North Korea .
What did it mean to you to have North Korea show interest in Gumball ?
For two and half years I went back and forth with North Korea to see if it was possible to incorporate a route for the actual rally .
On one trip to Pyongyang , I had this very powerful meeting with the whole of the North Korean cabinet and they presented us with this document that invited the Gumball rally to come to North Korea .
The letter also invited us to exit North Korea via the demilitarized zone into South Korea , a border no one has crossed since 1953 .
It was really a powerful gesture and the most powerful invitation I 've ever received .
I left that meeting jumping hoops from the air , thinking I 'd united Korea . [ laughs ]
Did you face any challenges planning the route ?
It was an interesting two years of planning .
I looked into bringing a rally stop into North Korea but that became less and less feasible .
Taking all these super expensive cars to North Korea seemed like a bad idea .
I certainly would n't be able to get insurance for any of these cars .
The country is very small , of course , and we would have had to fly the cars in .
Crossing the demilitarized zone is such a big feat , which I 'd love to be the first to do , but I 'd only really do it if I 'd got complete support from everyone involved .
It 's such a big step that governments have to be ready for it in many ways .
So [ after our U.S. leg of the rally ] we shipped the cars from Las Vegas to China , and while the cars were being shipped , we were able to spend 16 hours in North Korea .
Was it worth the two years of planning ?
I 'm pleased that we did this .
I 'm actually really glad that we did n't try and fly the cars there and have a rally .
The real experience was dealing with governments .
For the three years since I got this document from Kim Jong
Il , you 'd think the governments of the world would help us , but no one really did anything .
It was just me and my own taking on the idea of unifying Korea . [ laughs ]
I did n't have that as my mission in life but I found myself in a really unique opportunity .
You 'd expect the governments involved with bringing peace to the region would have taken the baton from me , but they have n't .
Why did the North Koreans reach out to Gumball ?
What was it about your brand and company that allowed you access to North Korea ?
North Korean people have no idea about the Gumball brand .
They 've never heard of the Beatles or the Rolling Stones or McDonalds or Coca - Cola .
It 's such a closed country .
The North Korean diplomats ' bases abroad had heard of us , though .
They 've watched the DVDs and seen us on TV .
Their position [ before this ] , which I talked very openly about with them , was that they [ North Korea ] have no social relationships with anybody outside their country .
Any talks with any country or any outside party are purely political .
What I tried to do through this was just open up their doors a little bit .
What was your itinerary like in North Korea ?
We did go to the Mass Games , an annual event in North Korea that featured 100,000 people performing in one of the largest stadiums in the world .
It was an amazing site .
We had a small tour of the city on the bus and we were taken back to our hotel , where we had this very formal dinner with the ministry of culture .
After dinner , we explored the city a little bit .
We were free to do what we wanted , really .
We went out skateboarding in the middle of the night .
Of course , no one in North Korea had ever seen a skateboard .
Bam Margera and Adam Dunn were filming parts of the new Jackass movie there .
We had 35 nationalities in attendance , obviously none of which had been there before , all of which are very influential and famous people .
( This year 's rally participants included the likes of PayPal cofounder Ken Howery , Russian billionaire Dmitry Zelenov , Saudi real estate magnate Amro Kayal , Kuwaiti prince Faisal Al - Sabah , models Nicole Dahm and Tyson Beckford . )
So I think that was a huge step .
It 's probably through sports or popular culture that the doors are going to continue to open .
A South Korean newspaper referred to it as " Skateboard diplomacy . "
Did you get any sense of the basic economy in North Korea ?
It 's no different than all the bits of news that you hear and read .
It 's a full - on closed country .
It 's a completely Communist regime ; there are no shops , there is a market in Pyongyang where locals do trade .
The only shops for Westerners are probably in the hotels .
I hear you ended up in a karaoke Bar ?
Yes , some of us ended up at a karaoke bar .
It was actually no different than a karaoke bar in Japan or South Korea really .
Amazingly , it did have a few Western songs , including a few Sex Pistols songs .
I have no idea how those ended up on a North Korean jukebox .
Was there any sign that North Korea is any closer to becoming an open economy ?
You may not know the name Rebecca Willis yet , but you will soon .
The woman , from Marshall , North Carolina , has just gotten a whopping $ 275,000 for agreeing never to dance in the city ’s community center again .
Rebecca Willis sued the city six years after she was banned from the community center ’s weekly Friday night dances .
Town leaders had said she was “ gyrating and simulating sexual intercourse with her partner while dancing , ” also wearing a short skirt that may have given onlookers an extra show .
Willis denies that her dancing was obscene , calling it “ exuberant and flamboyant ” instead .
Now , as a result of a settlement , the city is paying her the six - figure amount to keep her bumping and grinding out of their center — and to keep the case out of their courts .
Past attempts to get the lawsuit of Rebecca Willis v. Marshall dismissed had failed , with a judge saying it was entirely possible the city had “ singled her out ” with its ban .
Willis had claimed it was a violation of her freedom of expression and equal protection and had the American Civil Liberties Union on her side .
I , for one , am intrigued .
Anyone want to start up a cash pool to get her to perform this , uh , “ exuberant ” dance for us ?
For purely research - related reasons , of course .

Barack Obama is gaining support in the rural , conservative town of McArthur , Ohio , reflecting nationwide trends in which the Illinois senator has been consolidating support among independents and in some traditional Republican strongholds .
With just three weeks until the election , political analysts say absent an October surprise it will be difficult for Republican John McCain to turn things around .
That 's a challenge his campaign , which has been written off before , says it is delighted to take up .
But the test before McCain is stark , even here in Vinton County in the rumpled Appalachian hills of southeast Ohio where George W. Bush won by 10 points in 2004 .
It 's an area with strong beliefs about such issues as gay marriage and abortion , but one that also faces severe economic challenges .
When social issues dominate the agenda , Republicans tend to do well here .
When the economy dominates , the Democrats can mount serious challenges .
That 's what Obama is doing here .
In the past four days , both McCain and Obama have campaigned here .
Obama has even chosen to prepare for Wednesday night 's debate here in Ohio .
The economy and the financial crisis top most voters ' agendas here , as they do nationwide .
The Buckeye State has long been a national bellwether , crucial to winning the White House .
No Republican candidate has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio's 20 electoral votes .
And no Democrat has done so either , at least in recent history .
" It 's a bellwether state for a reason : because it really does look like America , " says Michael Burton , a professor of political science at Ohio University in Athens .
" There 's a northeast that looks like the Northeast , there is a western side that looks like the Midwest and a southern tier that has a very Southern feel to it . "
That 's evident here on Main Street in McArthur .
It 's the county seat .
It has one stoplight .
The old brick court house sits across from the Main Street Diner and the Hotel McArthur .
The median income in the county is $ 25,000 .
That 's one reason Patty Elkins , who owns the diner , says she can't raise her prices .
A grilled cheese sandwich costs $ 1.50 .
It 's also the reason , she believes , Democrat Obama has traction here .
" This is a very poor part of the country and Ohio – it's the poorest , " says Ms. Elkins , whose family has owned the diner since 1984 .
" People here are ready for change , they just can't afford higher oil prices , higher food prices – they just can't afford it - so they 're leaning toward someone that 's saying : ' I 'm going to take care of the economy , I 'm going to take care of the healthcare system and try to straighten this out . ' "
Laura Harms and her daughter Jennifer were having lunch in a booth nearby .
Ms. Harms comes from a " staunch , very staunch Republican " family .
" You go in and you check the little box so you vote only straight Republican , " she says .
But Harms has always had an independent streak .
She says she likes to vote for the best person .
In 2004 , George W. Bush got her vote .
But this year , as far as she 's concerned , the best man is Obama , and both she and her daughter are voting for him .
" Right now I 'm so ticked by the way Republicans are doing things , " she says .
" [ And ] when McCain was asked how many houses he owned and he said , ' I do n't know , ' I was like , ' Whoa !
Forget you buddy , you can't even begin to identify with me and my daughters . "
Just around the corner from the diner is the Republican headquarters for Vinton County .
It 's a small storefront festooned in red , white , and blue with yard signs for statewide Republicans stacked out front .
Cecil Reid , who was minding the shop , says they ran out of McCain / Palin yard signs a couple of days ago .
He says the county is changing , but he believes McCain will still do well here , primarily because he believes Obama could never identify with lots of people here .
" I'm a Christian and I definitely believe Obama 's got Muslim in him , I do n't go for that , " says Mr. Reid , a retired county employee who now works part time at a grocery store .
" Plus McCain has the experience and I believe he can bring us out of this economy . "
Reid believes the strength of the fundamentalist Christian movement here could ultimately help McCain .
Indeed , one reason George W. Bush had a 10 - point margin here in 2004 is because of a gay marriage amendment on the ballot .
" The turnout in places like Vinton County and southeast Ohio spiked in large part because of very smart political organizing around the gay marriage amendment , " says Professor Burton .
" That significantly helped Republicans like Bush . "
Another social issue for some people here is race .
Aaron Brooks , who was heading to an appointment at the county courthouse , says he 's a Democrat but he 's supporting McCain over Obama .
" He 's black , " says Mr. Brooks .
" It 's not that I do n't think he 'll do a good job ; it 's just that I do n't think he 'll do a good job for us white people .
That 's just the way I feel . "
Pollsters have also picked up lingering questions among some voters about Obama 's race .
But they believe this campaign will come down to economic issues .
They also believe Obama 's candidacy could in the end have a healing effect .
" These are the last vestiges of racial bigotry in this country , " says pollster John Zogby , author of " The Way We'll Be " about the direction of the country .
" But as the election goes , there 's no question the financial crisis of the last few weeks has really undercut McCain / Palin . "
Recent polls here have Obama ahead by as much as five percent .
But 6 percent are still undecided .
Tressa Sexton is one of them .
She 's a registered Republican , she says " only because of my husband . "
But she says she 's really a Democrat .
She 's still not sure who she 's going to vote for , in part , because she does n't trust politicians in general .
" They can say what they want to say , but if you look at the economy over the last few years it 's all been for the big people , " she says .
Meanwhile , the Marist Poll reported Monday that the presidential race across Ohio " is no longer a statistical dead heat . "
Among registered voters , Obama now outpaces McCain 48 percent to 40 percent .
Among likely voters including those who are undecided yet leaning toward a candidate , Obama has 49 percent compared with 45 percent for McCain .
LITERATURE REVIEW ON FEMALE SEX OFFENDERS
Although there is an increasing literature on male sex offenders , there is a noticeable dearth of information concerning female sex offenders .
Most of the work in the area has come from three of the largest prison programs for female sex offenders in Missouri , Minnesota , and Kentucky .
OVERALL NEGLECT OF FEMALE SEXUAL OFFENCES
For a variety of societal reasons , female sexual abuse is likely to remain unnoticed .
Some researchers have found that the incidence of sexual contact with boys by women is much more prevalent than is contended in the clinical literature ( Condy , Templer Brown & Veaco , 1987 ) .
Despite society 's increasing concern about sexual assault , there may be several reasons for the under - reporting of female sexual abuse of both child and adult victims .
Traditionally , society has held preconceptions of women as non-violent nurturers .
Women in general , and mothers more specifically , have more freedom than men to touch children ( Marvasti , 1986 ) .
Therefore , a man may be more easily perceived as abusive when touching a child than when a woman touches a child in a similar manner ( Plummer , 1981 ) .
Further , sexual offences perpetrated by women are often incestuous in nature and children may be reluctant to report sexual contact with a parent on whom they are dependent ( Groth , 1979 ) .
Health care workers are often unable to detect mother - child incest as mothers often accompany their children to the doctor 's office .
This may serve as a barrier to detecting sexual abuse of the child ( Elliott & Peterson , 1993 ) .
The medical profession is only reluctantly becoming sensitive to the fact that females can , in fact , be perpetrators of sexual abuse ( Wilkins , 1990 ; Krug , 1989 ) .
Female sexual abuse of adolescent and adult men may also go unnoticed from a legal perspective .
In general , men are viewed as physically incapable of being sexually abused by women , and the myth that females are exclusively victims of sexual abuse has only recently been challenged .
Sarrel & Masters ( 1982 ) provide evidence contradicting the belief that it is impossible for men to respond sexually when subjected to sexual molestation by females .
They present eleven cases of male molestation by females , indicating that the male sex response can occur in a variety of emotional states including anger and terror .
Brown , Hull and Panesis ( 1984 ) report thirteen cases of females arrested for the rape of both female and male victims in Massachusetts between the years 1974 and 1978 as well as an additional seven cases from 1980 to 1981 .
Petrovich and Templer ( 1984 ) report that part of their sample of male inmates in a medium security penitentiary were molested by men or women when they were between the ages of 16 and 54 years of age .
Another reason why female sexual assaults of men may be neglected is that males , in general , are reluctant to report sexual abuse ( Elliot & Briere , 1994 ) .
This is mainly due to the denial and shame associated with male victimisation .
Therefore , the sexual assault of a man by a woman is likely to be unreported because of actual or perceived social consequences ( Williams , 1995 ) .
PREVALENCE OF SEX OFFENDING BY WOMEN
Due to the possible underestimation of female sex offending , the accurate assessment of the problem is difficult .
Sex offences are generally thought to be committed by men against women or children and to date , most investigators believe that males make up the majority of sex offenders .
Many researchers consider Finkelhor and Russell 's ( 1984 ) estimates of the prevalence of female sex offending to be the most accurate to date .
Their tentative evaluation is that females may account for up to 13 % of the abuse of females and 24 % of the abuse of males , either acting alone or with a partner .
Graham ( unpublished ) validates Finkelhor and Russell 's ( 1984 ) estimates by indicating that 24.62 % of male sex offenders in his study had a history of sexual abuse by a female .
Finkelhor and Russell ( 1984 ) also estimated that approximately 6 % of sexual abuse against females and 14 % of sexual abuse against males is thought to be perpetrated by females acting alone .
Although it is rare , it is apparent that women are capable of and do commit sexual offences against both children and adults .
In 1991 , Dr. Fred Mathews made the point that female sex offenders are a significant population worthy of attention .
He states : " [ assuming that approximately 10 % of child molesters are female ] ... if one , in seven Canadian men and one in four women were sexually abused as a child , as a study has indicated , that works out to be about five million people .
Ten percent of that figure would mean 500,000 Canadians have been abused by girls or women ; 1 percent would mean about 50,000 .
I do n't know about you , but that does n't seem like a minor number " ( Globe & Mail , October 30 , 1991 , pp. A1 - A2 ) .
As it is obvious that female sex offenders are largely a neglected but important population , research must place more focus on their development and criminal behaviour , in order to recommend appropriate intervention strategies both prior to and after incarceration .
FEMALE CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PERPETRATORS OF SEXUAL OFFENSES
Little research has been carried out in the area of female child and adolescent perpetrators of sex offences .
This research may provide some insight into the development of the adult female sex offender ( Fehrenbach & Monastersky , 1988 ) .
Although some researchers have found that female sex offending tends to occur in adulthood and not in childhood or adolescence ( Wolfe , 1985 ; McCarty , 1986 ) , other researchers have described female child and adolescent perpetrators of sexual abuse ( Mathews , 1987 b , Mathews , 1987 c , Mathews 1987d ; Fehrenbach and Monastersky , 1988 ; Johnson , 1989 ; Higgs , Canavan , & Meyer , 1992 ) .
Johnson ( 1989 ) described the behaviour of thirteen female child sex offenders between the ages of four and thirteen years of age .
There was a correlation of 100 % between perpetration of sexual assaults and prior sexual victimization .
In contrast , Johnson ( 1988 ) found that 49 % of male child perpetrators of sex offences had a history of sexual victimization .
Similar findings for child female sex offenders were reported by Knopp and Lackey ( 1987 ) in a survey of 44 treatment providers of female sexual abusers in the United States .
The survey revealed that , of 41 respondents who treated female sex offenders , fifteen treated those under the age of eleven .
Once again , all the female sex offenders studied had been sexually victimized .
Adolescent female perpetrators of sex offending have also been examined .
Knopp and Lackey ( 1987 ) examined 44 treatment providers of female sex offenders and found 35 treated female sex offenders between the ages of eleven and seventeen years .
Both Mathews ( 1987b , 1987 c , 1987d ) in the Phase adolescent female sex offenders ' group in Minnesota and Higgs , et al. ( 1992 ) present individual case studies .
In addition to these researchers , Fehrenbach and Monastersky ( 1988 ) report a history of early sexual victimization of the female sex offenders studied .
Fehrenbach and Monastersky ( 1988 ) provide an interesting contrast to the notion that female sex offenders often co-offend with males .
In examining a sample of adolescent female sex offenders , they indicate that these women , unlike adult female sex offenders , tend to commit offences without any coercion from male co-offenders .
As with other studies on female sex offenders , Fehrenbach and Monastersky ( 1988 ) caution about generalizing from their sample to other populations .
Clearly , research is needed in this area in order to better understand the processes which influence the development of sexual deviance in females .
The current literature strongly suggests that past sexual victimization plays a significant role in the development of female sex offenders .
INCARCERATED FEMALE SEX OFFENDERS
Although at least one researcher claims that female sex offenders are generally psychotic ( O'Connor , 1987 ) , a larger literature refutes this claim ( Wolfe , 1985 ; Marvasti , 1986 ; Grier , Clark & Stoner , 1993 ) .
Female sex offenders tend to be young , ranging in age from approximately 17 - 24 years ( Brown et al. , 1984 ) with low socio-economic status and poor education ( Mathews , Matthews & Speltz , 1989 ) .
They also generally deny or minimize their behaviour ( Wolfe , 1985 ) and have substance abuse problems ( Mathews et al. , 1989 ) .
This is generally consistent with research on male sex offenders .
OFFENSES
Females are capable of several forms of sexual abuse on a variety of victims .
Travin , Cullen and Protter ( 1990 ) classify female sex offences as either involving or lacking physical contact .
Generally , offences tend to involve physical contact ( Knopp & Lackey , 1987 ) .
Although very few researchers have studied females committing offences such as exhibitionism or fetishism , a few studies have described such cases ( Grob , 1985 ; Hollender , Brown & Roback , 1977 ; Zavitzianos , 1971 ) .
Female sex offenders are also unlikely to use violence against their victims ( Marvasti , 1986 ; Johnson & Shrier , 1987 ) .
Laury ( 1992 ) discusses a rare form of offence involving the sexual abuse of male patients by females employed in health care .
They state that although this form of abuse is rare , health professionals cannot ignore its existence .
TYPOLOGIES
Due to the paucity of research , there are no well - formulated theories of female sexual offending .
A major setback in research on female sex offenders is small sample size .
Researchers have attempted to develop typologies of female sex offenders based on observable characteristics of these offenders and their offences .
In general , studies have reported individual cases .
For example , Faller ( 1987 ) classified female sex offenders as : single parent , polyincestuous , psychotic , adolescent , and non-custodial abuse .
McCarty ( 1986 ) categorized female sex offenders as co-offenders , accomplices , or independent offenders .
Furthermore , Sarrel and Masters ( 1982 ) suggested classifying female sexual offenders as : forced assault , baby - sitter abuse , incestuous abuse , and dominant woman abuse .
Although , Faller ( 1987 ) , McCarty ( 1986 ) and Sarrel and Masters ( 1982 ) have classified female sex offenders by offence characteristics , Mathews et al. ( 1989 ) have developed a female sex offender typology , : teacher / lover , male - coerced , and predisposed , based on the offenders ' motivation to commit sexual offences .
Atkinson ( 1995 ) agrees that this typology is the most useful of those described .
Teacher / Lover
The teacher / lover offender type is an adult woman who acts as the initiator of the sexual abuse of an adolescent ; usually a male .
She has a difficult time accepting her behaviour as criminal as she has no hostility toward her victim .
This type of sex offender acts in a position of power through her age and role in the adolescent 's life .
The teacher / lover is seeking a loving sexual expression in her interactions with the victim .
She feels that her sexual favours are an act of kindness towards the victim and she believes the victim 's experiences with her are positive expressions of love .
The teacher / lover is usually a victim of severe emotional and verbal abuse as a child .
Her family environment is likely to have been dysfunctional , with her father distant and verbally and physically abusive towards her .
She is typically a victim of extrafamilial sexual abuse as an adolescent .
The teacher / lover has often had a history of sexually abusive relationships with her lovers .
The teacher / lover tends to be defensive and denies the reality of her actions .
She also minimizes the negative impact of her actions on the victim .
She may be acting out her anger .
This type of offender is also likely to have a drug or alcohol addiction .
Male - Coerced / Male - Accompanied
A male - coerced offender is influenced by a male to participate in sexual abuse .
Usually the victim of this abuse is the offender 's daughter .
These women are likely to endorse traditional roles in a relationship , taking the position of homemaker and mother / wife and their mate as the " breadwinner . "
Male - coerced sex offenders fear their husbands and feel powerless in interpersonal relationships .
They are commonly subjected to the threat of physical punishment by their partner .
These offenders are likely to join in sexual abuse which their partner has previously committed on his own .
Characteristics of these offenders include : low to average level of intellectual functioning , passivity , underassertiveness , anger and antisocial tendencies , low self - esteem and difficulty believing that others can care about them .
Along with overdependency in relationships , these women also tend to have alcohol and / or drug problems .
In an earlier classification of female sex offenders , Mathews ( 1987 ) distinguished between male - coerced and male - accompanied offenders .
Male - coerced offenders are reluctant to participate in abuse but fear punishment , whereas male - accompanied offenders usually participate more actively in sexual abuse .
Predisposed Predisposed sex offenders independently initiate sexual abuse .
They themselves , have been victims of severe sexual abuse in childhood .
Furthermore , they have typically been abused by family , strangers and acquaintances throughout their lives .
Predisposed offenders come from families where sexual abuse has been common throughout generations .
Their victims tend to be family members , often their own children .
In addition to being sexually abused , victims of these offenders are also often physically abused and neglected by the offender .
Although they may escape their childhood sexual abuse in adolescence , it is rare for these offenders to be involved in a healthy sexual relationship .
Instead , they have a tendency to become involved with abusive male partners .
These women may also have sadistic fantasies that can be triggered by anger .
This anger may result from concern about their ability to control acting on their urges .
Predisposed offenders tend to commit offences which are violent in nature and involve young victims ( under six years of age ) .
These offenders are also chronically suicidal and self - injurious .
Predisposed sex offenders have " low self - esteem , passivity , extreme anger , and acting out behaviour , accompanied by what would be identified as psychopathology ( i.e. , extreme distrust , anguish , nervousness , distorted thinking , feelings of persecution , and dependence on drugs , alcohol , food or dependent relationships with men ) " ( p. 39 , Mathews et al. , 1989 ) .
VICTIMS
Females are more commonly victims of female sex offenders than males ( Mathews et al. , 1989 , Faller 1987 , Brown et al. , 1984 ) .
Furthermore , victims tend to be children known to the offender ( Wakefield & Underwager , 1991 ; Knopp & Lackey , 1987 ; Brown et al. , 1984 ; Elliot , 1993 ) .
Many of the victims tend to be the offender 's own children ( Lukianowicz , 1972 ; Faller , 1987 ; Allen , 1990 ) .
In general , the literature regarding mother - child incest has been presented as individual case studies ( Wahl , 1960 ; Shengold , 1980 ; Margolis 1984 ; McCarty , 1986 ; Marvasti , 1986 ; Banning , 1989 ; Lawson , 1991 ) .
Although Chasnoff , Burns , Schnoll , Burns , Chisum & Kyle - Spore ( 1986 ) report cases of maternal - neonatal incest , it is believed that victims of female sex offenders are rarely infants .
Chasnoff et al.'s ( 1986 ) study reported three sexual abuse cases by women participating in an addiction program for women and their infants .
Editor 's update : Gallup Polls just completed in China , Armenia , and Bolivia have now been added to this report , and overall findings have been adjusted to reflect the results .
The global survey now represents nearly three - quarters of the world 's population , with China 's high percentage of " do n't know " responses slightly reducing the margin by which world citizens prefer Barack Obama to John McCain .
Gallup Polls conducted in 73 countries from May to October 2008 reveal widespread international support for Democratic Sen. Barack Obama over Republican Sen. John McCain in the U.S. presidential election .
Among these nations , representing nearly three - quarters of the world 's population , 24 % of citizens say they would personally rather see Obama elected president of the United States , compared with just 7 % who say the same about McCain .
At the same time , 69 % of world citizens surveyed did not have an opinion .
World citizens are more divided over whether the outcome of the U.S. election makes a difference to their country , with 26 % saying it does and 22 % saying it does not .
Moreover , 52 % of those surveyed did not have an opinion .
The following map displays the findings by country , and the analyses on the right side of this page examine findings by region and within selected individual nations .
Overall , citizens in Europe are the most likely to state a preference for the next president of the United States and to think the election makes a difference to their country .
Citizens in Asia are the least likely to state a preference for the next president of the United States and to think the election makes a difference to their country .
In individual countries , only Georgia and the Philippines prefer McCain to Obama by a statistically significant margin .

Happy Monday !
Today , we make you feel really bad about only getting your spouse roses and / or candy for Valentine 's Day ...
Nebuchadnezzar got his wife one of the original Seven Wonders of the World .
Hope you enjoy another excerpt from the HOTW !
Nebuchadnezzar had a problem with his beautiful young queen Amyitis , and unfortunately , this meant he had a political problem too .
Amyitis was a princess from Medea ( in modern - day Iran ) and the Babylonian king had married her to cement an alliance with the Medes .
But Amyitis complained that the Mesopotamian desert was depressing ; she missed the greenery and mountain streams of her homeland .
So Nebuchadnezzar brought the mountains to her .
Most of what we know about the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is based on a sketchy descriptions in ancient sources , including its distinctive name , which sounds a bit weird to modern ears ( from a distance , the gardens probably appeared to be suspended or " hanging " in midair ) .
The gardens were built to an impressive height , resembling a mountain ; in fact , that was the whole point .
The Greek historian and geographer Strabo described the structure in the following way : " It consists of vaulted terraces raised one above another , and resting upon cube - shaped pillars .
These are hollow and filled with earth to allow trees of the largest size to be planted .
The pillars , the vaults , and the terraces are constructed of baked brick and asphalt . "
Another Greek writer , Diodorus Siculus , added that " it was planted with all sorts of trees , which both for greatness and beauty might delight the spectators . "
So how big were the gardens ?
Diodorus Siculus claimed they were four hundred feet on a side and eighty feet tall , making them one of the tallest structures in the ancient world .
Small streams and waterfalls snaked everywhere , watering the greenery and providing the pleasant sound of running water .
According to Strabo , getting the water to the top was a rather labor - intensive process : " The ascent to the highest story is by stairs , and at their side are water engines , by means of which persons , appointed expressly for the purpose , are continually employed in raising water from the Euphrates into the garden . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve threw a massive life - line to consumers on Tuesday with two new programs aimed at making it easier for them to obtain loans for homes , cars and on credit cards .
Under the new mortgage program , the Fed will buy up to $ 100 billion of debt issued by government - sponsored mortgage enterprises Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks .
It will also buy up to $ 500 billion of mortgage securities backed by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and Ginnie Mae .
The central bank also launched a $ 200 billion facility to support consumer finance , including student , auto , and credit card loans and loans backed by the federal Small Business Administration .
This will lend to investors who hold securities backed by this debt .
The launch of the two programs lifted investor spirits and drove up the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average more than 100 points , or about 1.3 percent , within minutes of its open .
“ One of the big problems we have is that there has been a lack of demand for debt .
You have seen the market for securitized debt such as credit cards or student loans dry up completely , ” said Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg , Florida .
“ Here is the Fed taking a bunch of debt out of the market , ” he said .
“ It should help unblock the credit markets . ”
The new mortgage - support facility was intended to strike at the collapsed housing market , the core of the United States ’ economic woes .
“ This action is being taken to reduce the cost and increase the availability of credit for the purchase of houses , which in turn should support housing markets and foster improved financial conditions more generally , ” the Fed said .
Investor appetite for both the debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the mortgage - backed securities they guarantee has dried up since the government seized the companies in September , and the Fed hopes to fill that void .
TAPPING TARP
“ They are getting to the heart of the problem , it ’s clean , it ’s quick , it ’s direct , ” said Todd Abraham , co-head of government and mortgage bonds at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
“ It ’s a good way to bring down mortgage rates . ”
Under the consumer - finance facility , the Treasury will help cover any losses the Fed might face by providing $ 20 billion of credit protection from its $ 700 billion financial bailout fund , which Congress approved last month .
A Treasury spokeswoman said the $ 20 billion will come from the remaining unallocated $ 40 billion in the first tranche of the $ 700 billion financial rescue fund .
That leaves Treasury with $ 20 billion , and once that is used it must ask Congress for access to the remaining $ 350 billion in the fund .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
The Treasury noted that issuance of asset - backed securities in consumer lending categories such as credit cards , auto loans and student loans had essentially ground to a halt in October .
Last year , issuance was roughly $ 240 billion .
“ Continued disruption in the ABS market could further deteriorate credit availability for consumers and increase the prospects for further deterioration in the economy generally , ” the Treasury said in a statement .
The Fed ’s twin announcements marked the latest in a series of emergency measures by U.S. authorities to try to keep the economy from falling into a deep and prolonged recession .
Late Sunday , the government stepped in to prop up the second largest U.S. bank Citigroup .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Most economists say the emergency steps represent a necessary , if ad hoc , response to the greatest financial shock the United States has experienced since the Great Depression .
Some , however , are worried the mounting costs of the measures , which have the potential to reach several trillion dollars , could eventually fuel a troubling inflation .
“ It may mean ( a ) longer - run issue with inflation and inflation concerns , ” said John Silvia , chief economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte , North Carolina .
“ It may be too much of a good thing is a bad thing .
We may be overpaying for bad assets . ”
Policy - makers , however , have signaled a willingness to do whatever it takes to try to tamp down the risk of a severe recession .
Remember that scene in Minority Report , where newspapers could change their covers electronically to keep you informed of the latest news ?
Well a couple of months ago Esquire mens ’ magazine told the world they had tested a similar technology on a prototype edition to celebrate 75 years of bronzed ladies and gadgets .
It hit the shelves in September and secured it ’s place as the first first magazine to incorporate an animated cover .
100,000 copies with an e-ink electronic paper cove .
I know what you ’re thinking … this has the potential to animate the lovely girls that make Esquire covers so memorable , or flash snippets of feature articles to encourage you to buy it .
I feel I may have over sold it at this point ; it more resembles a cut out , greyscale LCD screen embedded in the cover that flashes “ The 21st Century Begins Now ” .
In fact it ’s fairly rudimentary technology , even by Esquire ’s admission , and is unlikely to cause a stir in the techorati or media industry .
Really , it looks pretty pants if I ’m honest .
What it does mean however , is that printing houses and publishers are starting to become more open to new forms of communication in the printing industry .
David Granger , Esquire ’s editor in chief , says :
“ Magazines have basically looked the same for 150 years , ” Mr. Granger said .
“ I have been frustrated with the lack of forward movement in the magazine industry . ”
“ This is really the 1.0 version , ” said Kevin O’Malley , Esquire ’s publisher .
“ Imagine when the consumer walks by a newsstand and sees that it is alive . ”
and we think it ’s a great approach .
150 years is a long time to rest on your laurels and ideas like this are great for re-energising stagnant thinking and forcing research through commercial competition .
Esquire ’s limited 100,000 edition cover required a decent budget , both developing a battery small enough to be inserted in the magazine cover , and refrigerating them to preserve power until the magazines got to the shelves , after which it runs out of juice after 90 days .
“ Part of the iconic DNA of the magazine is our covers , ” said Mr. O’Malley , Esquire ’s publisher .
“ I fully expect that in 25 to 30 years , this cover will be in a museum . ”
To take the pressure off Esquire ’s wallet , Ford Motor stepped in as sponsor in return for the inside of the digital cover as an advertisment .
And so here we are , right at the pioneering use of this technology , and already we ’re getting Bladerunner adverts moving around on the page .
If wo n’t be long before Google starts advertising on them .
Recycled Plastic Building Material Could Replace Concrete , Steel and Timber
October 23rd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
A UK - based company called i-plas has invented a building material — also called i-plas — made from recycled plastic that could replace concrete , steel , and timber .
I - plas can make use of any type of plastic waste except for PVC and thermoset .
According to i-plas ( the company ) , producing 1 ton of i-plas ( the product ) from landfill waste saves 1.66 tons of CO2 emissions .
In contrast , producing 1 ton of concrete generates nearly a ton of CO2 .
I - plas can be used for bridges , walls , fences , footpaths , and more .
It does n’t splinter or chip and requires no varnishing or coating since it is moisture - resistant .
The fungible material can be made either hard or soft depending on the waste materials used in its production .
You can expect to see more of i- plas in the near future — the company is planning seven new production facilities and hopes to supply the 2012 Olympics .

' Bigfoot ' discovery was just a frozen rubber gorilla suit
A frozen ' carcass ' which two hunters said was a Bigfoot is nothing more than a full - body rubber gorilla suit , researchers have revealed .
Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer sparked an internet frenzy last week after they claimed to have discovered a corpse of the mythical man-ape while out hiking in remote woods .
What Whitton and Dyer failed to mention is that they are also owners of a company that offers Bigfoot merchadise .
They pair sold the frozen ' corpse ' to researchers for an undisclosed sum .
Rick Dyer ( R ) and Matt Whitton , at last week 's press conference where they claimed to have found Bigfoot 's body
At a news conference last Friday , they had claimed genetic tests carried out on the ' remains ' - which were frozen in ice and placed in a freezer - were inconclusive .
The pair said the male creature was more than seven feet tall , weighed more than 35 stone , had red hair and black - grey eyes .
But Steve Kulls , executive director of the website Squatchdetective.com , said the rubber suit was discovered after the researchers thawed the ' corpse ' .
Kulls is part of the team who handed over an undisclosed sum for the remains .
He said researchers had used heat to speed up the thawing of the shaggy remains .
Bigfoot found ?
The grainy photo appears to show the body of an ape - like creature in a freezer but it is hard to make out what it is
Within an hour , they realised at least part of the head was hollow and , over the next hour , a break appeared near the feet .
He added : ' As the team and I began examining this area ... I observed the foot which looked unnatural , reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot . '
Even expert Bigfoot obsessive Tom Biscardi - who has been hunting the creature since 1971 - was fooled .
' It 's a huge situation for me after 35 years , because I 've wanted to bring one back , ' Mr Biscardi said at the time .
Bigfoot hunter Tom Biscardi holds up a picture he claims is the creature 's mouth at the press conference last week .
Biscardi was convinced that the find was real
' They showed me the body .
They took me to the area where they found it - it took a day and a half to get there . '
The Bigfoot , also known as a Sasquatch , is said to roam the forests of north - west America and some suggest that it may be related to the Asian Yeti , or Abominable Snowman .
The Bigfoot first came to prominence in popular culture in 1967 when filmmakers Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin released a video which contained what they claimed was a genuine video of the mythical creature .
Since then many have sought to debunk the myth saying the film clip simply shows a man in ape suit .
Phone calls to Whitton and Dyer went unreturned last night .
But the voicemail recording for their Bigfoot Tip Line - which proclaims they search for leprechauns and the Loch Ness monster - has been updated and announcing they 're also in search of ' big cats and dinosaurs ' .
The use of no- or low - calorie artificial sweeteners in foods and beverages has more than doubled over the last 20 years , but so has the obesity rate .
What gives ?
A study published in the current issue of Behavioral Neuroscience suggests that artificial sweeteners may lead to weight gain after all , at least in rats , reports the Los Angeles Times .

Changes since x64 RC1 :
The secrets of the crushing of Yugoslavia are emerging , telling us more about how the modern world is policed .
The former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia in The Hague , Carla Del Ponte , this year published her memoir The Hunt : Me and War Criminals .
Largely ignored in Britain , the book reveals unpalatable truths about the west 's intervention in Kosovo , which has echoes in the Caucasus .
The tribunal was set up and bankrolled principally by the United States .
Del Ponte 's role was to investigate the crimes committed as Yugoslavia was dismembered in the 1990s .
She insisted that this include Nato's 78 - day bombing of Serbia and Kosovo in 1999 , which killed hundreds of people in hospitals , schools , churches , parks and tele vision studios , and destroyed economic infrastructure .
" If I am not willing to [ prosecute Nato personnel ] , " said Del Ponte , " I must give up my mission . "
It was a sham .
Under pressure from Washington and London , an investigation into Nato war crimes was scrapped .
Readers will recall that the justification for the Nato bombing was that the Serbs were committing " genocide " in the secessionist province of Kosovo against ethnic Albanians .
David Scheffer , US ambassador - at - large for war crimes , announced that as many as " 225,000 ethnic Albanian men aged between 14 and 59 " may have been murdered .
Tony Blair invoked the Holocaust and " the spirit of the Second World War " .
The west 's heroic allies were the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) , whose murderous record was set aside .
The British foreign secretary , Robin Cook , told them to call him any time on his mobile phone .
With the Nato bombing over , international teams descended upon Kosovo to exhume the " holocaust " .
The FBI failed to find a single mass grave and went home .
The Spanish forensic team did the same , its leader angrily denouncing " a semantic pirouette by the war propaganda machines " .
A year later , Del Ponte 's tribunal announced the final count of the dead in Kosovo : 2,788 .
This included combatants on both sides and Serbs and Roma murdered by the KLA .
There was no genocide in Kosovo .
The " holocaust " was a lie .
The Nato attack had been fraudulent .
That was not all , says Del Ponte in her book : the KLA kidnapped hundreds of Serbs and transported them to Albania , where their kidneys and other body parts were removed ; these were then sold for transplant in other countries .
She also says there was sufficient evidence to prosecute the Kosovar Albanians for war crimes , but the investigation " was nipped in the bud " so that the tribunal 's focus would be on " crimes committed by Serbia " .
She says the Hague judges were terrified of the Kosovar Albanians - the very people in whose name Nato had attacked Serbia .
Indeed , even as Blair the war leader was on a triumphant tour of " liberated " Kosovo , the KLA was ethnically cleansing more than 200,000 Serbs and Roma from the province .
Last February the " international community " , led by the US , recognised Kosovo , which has no formal economy and is run , in effect , by criminal gangs that traffic in drugs , contraband and women .
But it has one valuable asset : the US military base Camp Bondsteel , described by the Council of Europe 's human rights commissioner as " a smaller version of Guantanamo " .
Del Ponte , a Swiss diplomat , has been told by her own government to stop promoting her book .
Yugoslavia was a uniquely independent and multi-ethnic , if imperfect , federation that stood as a political and economic bridge in the Cold War .
This was not acceptable to the expanding European Community , especially newly united Germany , which had begun a drive east to dominate its " natural market " in the Yugoslav pro vinces of Croatia and Slovenia .
By the time the Europeans met at Maastricht in 1991 , a secret deal had been struck ; Germany recognised Croatia , and Yugoslavia was doomed .
In Washington , the US ensured that the struggling Yugoslav economy was denied World Bank loans and the defunct Nato was reinvented as an enforcer .
At a 1999 Kosovo " peace " conference in France , the Serbs were told to accept occupation by Nato forces and a market economy , or be bombed into submission .
It was the perfect precursor to the bloodbaths in Afghanistan and Iraq .
State Highlights
Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska , who was convicted eight days before the election on seven felony counts , lost his bid for a seventh term as final ballots were counted on Nov. 18 .
Mr. Stevens , a Republican , was trailing his Democratic challenger , Mayor Mark Begich of Anchorage , by 3,724 votes out of more than 315,000 cast after state election officials counted about 25,000 absentee and other outstanding ballots .
Only an estimated 2,500 ballots remained to be counted the following week , according to Gail Fenumiai , the state elections director .
" I am humbled and honored to serve Alaska in the United States Senate , " Mr. Begich said .
" It 's been an incredible journey getting to this point , and I appreciate the support and commitment of the thousands of Alaskans who have brought us to this day . "
Mr. Stevens did not immediately concede the race .
He could request a recount , but he would have to pay for it if the current vote margins hold .
The ballots remaining to be counted include overseas voters , special absentee ballots given to people who planned to be traveling out of state on Election Day or who live in remote parts of the state .
The election will not be certified until early December .
In an initial count after Election Day , Mr. Stevens had led Mr. Begich , the mayor of Anchorage , by 3,257 votes .
Republicans said at the time that traditional voting patterns among absentee voters favored Mr. Stevens holding on to win , but Mr. Begich noted that he had made a concerted effort to win absentee voters .
More than 90,000 ballots have been counted since Election Day .
Mr. Stevens 's longtime colleague and sole Alaskan member of the House , Representative Don Young , won his 19th term .
Mr. Young , a Republican first elected in 1973 , has also been under federal investigation .
He had led Ethan Berkowitz , a Democrat and former state lawmaker , by about 51 to 45 percent as absentee , early and questioned ballots continued to be counted .
In the state Senate , Democrats picked up enough seats to get a 10 - 10 split with the Republicans , who still control the House in Juneau .
Mr. Stevens , a 40 - year incumbent and the longest - serving Republican in Senate history , was convicted Oct. 27 on seven felony counts of failing to disclose more than $ 250,000 in gifts and home renovations .
Two days later , Mr. Stevens returned to Alaska for a six - day campaign sprint in which he insisted to voters that he had been wrongfully prosecuted and would have his conviction overturned .
Many national Republicans called on Mr. Stevens to resign , including Senator John McCain , the Republican nominee for president , and his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska .
Some Senate leaders threatened to expel Mr. Stevens if he stayed in office and lost his appeal of his conviction .
Yet the state Republican Party encouraged voters to keep Mr. Stevens in office , and the senator 's campaign paid for a blitz of final advertisements , including a two - minute commercial on the eve of the election .
Mr. Stevens said more than once in the last week before the election that he had not been convicted , a reference to the fact that a conviction is not formal until sentencing , which has not yet taken place .
He told voters at one small rally that his situation was similar to that of the lacrosse players at Duke University who were wrongly accused of sexual assault in 2006 .
" Those fellows went through an ordeal like mine until they discovered that it was actually a scheme of the prosecution , " he said .
" The abuse of power was overwhelming . "
Mr. Stevens suggested that if he were to lose his appeal , he would resign rather than face a possible expulsion from the Senate .
" He said he would do what 's right for Alaska , " a spokesman for the Senator , Aaron Saunders , said on election night .
At the same time , Mr. Saunders questioned whether senators could muster the two - thirds vote necessary for expulsion .
Mr. Stevens , whose 85th birthday was Nov. 18 , is a revered figure in Alaska , known for bringing billions of dollars in federal spending to the state .
He took office just nine years after Alaska entered the union .
Mr. Begich , the son of a former Alaska congressman , Nick Begich , a Democrat who was killed in a plane crash in 1972 , ran a careful campaign in which he rarely criticized Mr. Stevens .
Instead , he let consistently bad news about the accusations surrounding Mr. Stevens do its own damage .
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee also spent heavily on an advertisement accusing Mr. Stevens of corruption .
Mr. Begich would be the first Democrat to represent Alaska in Congress in three decades .
He says he will steer a different course from other Democrats in Washington on many issues including favoring drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
Like Mr. Stevens , Mr. Young is known for bringing home millions of dollars in federal money .
Mr. Young had stopped short of declaring victory on election night , but he was clearly optimistic based on the results tallied shortly before midnight .
" I do n't listen to the polls , never have , " Mr. Young said while supporters chanted around him at the Egan Center .
" The people believe in me . "
Mr. Stevens 's loss breaks up Alaska 's three - member , all - Republican delegation .
Senator Lisa Murkowski is the state 's junior senator .

By our count , 35 banks have now signed up for the government ’s capital injection plan – that ’s an investment of $ 163.4 billion in federal funds .
But we may soon have many more to count .
Treasury Department officials tell the Wall Street Journal that thousands of banks could apply .
There seem to be two main motivations for banks to join the fun .
First , the government ’s deal — a mere 5 % interest at a time when credit is tight and with few strings attached — is just too sweet to pass up .
Second , and this seems like a more powerful motivator , banks are afraid that if they do n’t sign up , they ’ll be seen as weak .
Ever since the Treasury Department launched its plan to invest directly in the nation ’s banks , officials have refused to say exactly how they ’d be picking which banks could participate , only saying that the program was for " healthy " banks .
Judging from the market reaction and the roster of participants so far , it seems that characterization was accurate .
As a result , banks that do n’t jump on board risk being tarred as unhealthy .
The New York Times reports on the secret internal criteria being used by regulators to gauge a bank ’s health .
The banks get a rating from 1 to 5 .
Those getting a 1 or 2 — the healthiest banks — " are essentially guaranteed to qualify for the investments . "
For those in the middle tier , it ’s a judgment call .
The bottom rung is n’t given a chance .
Nevertheless , a few banks have already announced that they will not be applying .
The San Antonio - based bank Cullen / Frost , for example , announced last week that it has " sufficient capital to grow our business and take advantage of acquisition opportunities . "
Others have taken an opposite tack .
The head of Washington Federal , for instance , tells the Journal that the bank is participating because " we wanted it well - known in the market that we 're on the list of survivors . "
GOP lawmaker compares ACORN to the KKK David Edwards and Nick Juliano

The organized assault from the Republican party on an organization dedicated to registering low - income and minority voters continued in full force Friday , with a prominent Republican lawmaker comparing the community organizers at Acorn with the Ku Klux Klan .
The Association of Community Organziations for Reform Now has faced repeated accusations of attempted voter fraud and investigations by state and federal officials of its activities in several key states .
Feeney , a three term Florida Republican facing a difficult reelection races , launched wildly unsubstantiated accusations that Acorn has caused dead people to cast votes and somehow allowed the same voter to cast " 20 to 30 " ballots in a single election .
" This is destructive to democracy , " he told Fox News Friday .
" I believe Acorn has violated more Americans ' civil rights to have their vote counted than any group since the KKK .
It 's an outrage . "
The " fair & balanced " network , which has spent an inordinate amount of time over the last week parroting GOP talking points bashing Acorn and tying the group to Democratic candidate Barack Obama , did n't have an Acorn representative or anyone else to balance Feeney 's tirade .
Nor did they mention allegations against Feeney himself that he tried to subvert democracy by hacking electronic voting machines .
The Republicans seem far more willing to attack Acorn and trump up allegations of voter registration fraud than Democrats were to call for inquiries into electronic voting or other alleged irregularities four years ago .
President Bush 's Justice Department has made a priority of investigating alleged voter fraud , although it 's inquiries tend to lead nowhere .
The American Prospect 's Adam Serwer lays out the flaws in the GOP 's claims , as were reported Thursday night on CNN .
CNN is unable or unwilling to make the critical distinction between registration fraud and voter fraud .
As I 've said before , the former is really easy to do , even by accident , and the latter is extremely difficult and rarely occurs .
The sheer volume of ACORN registration forms found in Indiana suggests the forms were deliberately filled out wrong , but they do not in any sense prove that there is a widespread liberal conspiracy to steal the election .
More likely , ACORN workers were stealing time and trying to get paid without actually doing their jobs .
Given how easily the forms were discovered , it would have to be the most inept scheme in the history of the United States .
In contrast to Republicans ' repeated crying about election fraud , comparatively little attention is being paid to thousands of voters being purged from registration rolls across the country .
One assumes folks like Feeney would like to keep it that way .

The New York Attorney General 's office is negotiating with top Wall Street firms that received federal bailout money to forego executive bonuses this year , sources close to the attorney general told CNBC .
The efforts by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo also may expand to include capping non-executive bonus compensation .
In addition , Cuomo has not ruled out trying to recoup previous years ' bonuses for top executives , sources said .
The discussions involve firms that have received money under the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout fund , known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
Besides Wall Street financial institutions , Cuomo has also asked insurance giant American International Group to disclose more on its executive compensation .
AIG has received billions in government money under the TARP .
Over the past few months I have been spending a fair amount of time testing out Facebook ’s advertising platform .
While I ’ve been advertising since early on , when Facebook ’s program was called “ Flyers ” , I never had a chance to put substantial resources into testing it out .
Since then , I ’ve launched a number of campaigns each with varying success .
I ’ve also spent the last few months speaking with people about their experience with Facebook advertising .
What Results Are People Having ?
The result has been mixed but there is one thing that has been consistent throughout : nobody can ever spend all their money that they want to on Facebook advertising .
The reason for this ?
Well the most obvious is that not enough people click on the advertisements on Facebook .
A look at my own ads would reveal click through rates ( CTRs ) of 0.03 percent to 0.11 percent .
Other people that I have spoken with have also produced similar results .
Some click through rates have exceeded 0.11 percent but those are not the norm .
Ultimately it depends on the ad that you are running .
The best model is to run multiple campaigns within the Facebook ad network , each targeting similar groups .
Are the Numbers Comparatively Low ?
While I ’m sure there are ways to increase the overall click through rate , the numbers are still dreadfully low .
These low rates demand an extremely high number of impressions .
It seems almost counterintuitive though to suggest that Facebook does n’t have enough inventory .
Time and time again we hear about the excessive amount of inventory driving down CPMs for publishers .
On a CPM basis , it would be accurate to state that there is too much inventory .
In a world where search marketing provides advertisers access to consumer intentions , impressions simply do n’t suffice .
If you wanted to pay for advertising on a CPM basis on Facebook , you could most definitely go through your entire advertising budget .
It does n’t make much sense though to pay on a CPM basis when you can pay per click .
Not everything is bad news for Facebook though .
After doing a little research , we found that Facebook ’s click through raters were not necessarily that bad when compared to traditional banner advertising .
Many advertisements on top blogs around the web provide click through rates of around 0.10 percent to 1.0 percent , most of which trend toward the low end .
Those numbers were based on data of large campaigns run around the web that we received from advertising campaigns run from within agencies .
Not Enough Inventory Among Quality Users
Facebook has a large group of “ quality ” users .
When saying this I mean that there is a large group of users that fall within valuable demographic categories for advertisers .
Every single person that I have spoken with about Facebook advertising has said the exact same thing : Facebook limits their budget and they are never able to spend everything they ’ve allocated to Facebook advertising .
The main reason behind this ( from the sample group of advertisers I ’ve spoken with ) , is that there are not enough impressions by the demographic groups being targeted with advertisements .
As Facebook grows in popularity , the number of impressions will change significantly but for now there is still a lack of quality impressions .
I would assume that this is why Mark Zuckerberg continues to speak about focusing on growth .
If there are numerous advertisers that do n’t hit their daily budget on the ad network , Facebook clearly has a problem with inventory .
Compare this to Google where advertisers consistently hit their daily budget limits .
Facebook needs to build their inventory as much as possible if they are going to build a successful advertising network .
First pictures of burned - out rooms inside Mumbai terror siege hotel
The first pictures of burned - out rooms at a luxury Mumbai hotel where terrorists were holed up for three days were released today after the siege ended .
The shocking images emerged after crack troops killed the remaining three insurgents at the five - star Taj Mahal after a fierce one - hour gun battle .
At least 195 people were killed in a series of ten coordinated attacks which began on Wednesday - but the death toll is likely to rise much further .
Burned out : Wreckage inside the Taj Mahal hotel after the Mumbai siege ended
Elite National Security Guard commandos said they discovered 30 bodies in a single room after storming the Taj Mahal hotel at 7.30 am .
Authorities said that nine of the ten terrorists who arrived in India 's financial capital by boat .
One was captured during the intense standoff .
The revelation comes after claims that up to seven of the 10 Islamic militants could have been British .
Explosions continued rock the 565 - room hotel hours after it was relieved as troops detonated bombs left by the terrorists .
Search :
The grim task of looking for bodies in the 565 rooms began today
Firefighters were also sent in to put out raging flames on the outside of the 105 - year - old building .
Announcing the siege was over , J.K. Dutt , director general of National Security Guard said : ' There were three terrorists , we have killed them . '
Soldiers have also begun the grim task up searching for bodies in the Taj Mahal .
No Britons are thought to be among the 100 guests in the hotel when the siege began , but the Foreign Office today said they could n't rule it out .
But one Briton and 14 other foreigners were among those killed elsewhere in the city .
Destruction : The Taj Mahal 's lobby has debris strewn across its marble floor
Last night some reports claimed that as many as seven of the group of terrorists had British connections , with several supposedly having links to Bradford , West Yorkshire .
German MEP Erika Mann , who was part of a delegation from Brussels caught up in the attacks , said she had been told there was a ' European dimension ' and that ' English citizens ' were among the insurgents .
There were also reports that the terrorists checked British news websites on their mobile phones during the attacks .
Gordon Brown urged caution , saying Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had made no mention of any British link when they spoke yesterday .
Cover : Soldiers in sniper positions as a gun battle rages inside the Taj Mahal Hotel
But he added : ‘ There is so much information still to be discovered .
Obviously , where you have terrorists operating in one country they may be getting support from another country or coming from another country . ’
The meticulous planning of the Mumbai attacks has been compared with the 2005 London bombings which left 52 people dead .
These were carried out by Britons of Pakistani origin , two of whom had trained in camps in Pakistan ’s lawless tribal area .
Investigators are also looking into possible links between the Mumbai terrorists and Rashid Rauf , from Birmingham .
Relief :

Rauf is said to have been a key figure in a plot to blow up planes leaving Heathrow .
He is reported to have died last week in an American missile strike .
The other major development of the day was that masked commandos ended the siege at the luxury Oberoi Hotel , freeing dozens of hostages .
One soldier described stepping over dozens of bodies in darkened corridors slick with blood .
He said : ‘ The gunmen showed no remorse to anybody – whoever came in front of them they fired at . ’
He added that the Oberoi was filled with terrified guests , making the task even harder .
Freed : A baby is carried to safety
He said the troops played a game of cat and mouse through the hotel ’s rooms , with the terrorists moving skilfully from place to place , often switching off lights and plunging rooms into darkness .
British hostage Mark Abell , 51 , a lawyer , described the scene of carnage when he was led through the Oberoi ’s lobby to safety .
‘ There was blood and guts everywhere , ’ he said .
‘ It was very upsetting . ’
Fellow hostage Peter Worth told how some of the gunmen had smiled at one another while they sprayed hotel guests with bullets .
‘ It was as if they were laughing and enjoying the fear as they tried to kill us , ’ said the 32 - year - old engineer , from Bristol .
Burning : Flames pour from the Taj Mahal hotel as troops move to rout the gunmen
Nearby , as darkness fell , shooting continued at the five - star Taj Hotel where up to six gunmen were said to be holed up .
Throughout the day , commandos had fought a running battle with the besieged gunmen .
They had abseiled from helicopters on to the roof the hotel at daybreak .
A series of explosions rocked the building and Indian commandos blew giant holes in the walls of the landmark building using grenades .
CNN reported the government had cut off their live transmissions from the scene in Mumbai .
Authorities have asked not to show live broadcasts of the battle because they believe the gunmen were monitoring the news .
Most channels largely obliged .
At Nariman House , which houses a Jewish centre , a rabbi and his wife were among six civilians killed .
Some of the victims had been bound .
Their deaths left their two - year - old son – who was smuggled out on Thursday – orphaned .
A little - known group called the Deccan Mujahideen has claimed responsibility for the well - planned operation .

The terrorists carried floor plans of the hotels as well as machine guns , grenades , AK - 47s and plastic explosives .
They each had supplies of dried fruit and water and some carried satellite telephones and mobiles .
The militants were split into two groups – one responsible for the attacks in north Mumbai ; the other for those in the south at the Jewish centre and the hotels .
Many senior Indian officials including the foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee have blamed ' Pakistani elements ' for the attacks , and one captured gunman had already been identified as Pakistani .
The gunmen came to Mumbai in a hijacked boat .
Authorities stopped a cargo ship off the west coast of Gujarat that had sailed from Saudi Arabia and handed it over to police for investigation .
Chris Mims Found Dead
, former lineman for the San Diego Chargers , was found dead in his Los Angeles apartment just before 9:30 am this morning .
38 - year - old Mims played for the University of Tennessee and was drafted in 1992 .
He played eight seasons in the NFL , seven for the San Diego Chargers , and one with the Washington Redskins .
He retired in 2000 .
Police discovered Mims ' body while on a welfare check .
He had been suffering from weight and medical problems .
Although the cause of death is unknown , foul play is not expected .
Potentially providing an important lift to a faltering global economy , China unveiled plans Sunday to pump about $ 586 billion into infrastructure projects and other stimulus measures to bolster domestic demand and shore up its weakening economy .
The massive two - year stimulus package , which one analyst described as China ’s version of America ’s New Deal , represents one of the most aggressive actions to date by a country to counter the effects of the global financial crisis .
It comes as China ’s president , Hu Jintao , prepares to join President Bush and other world leaders Saturday for a global economic summit in Washington .
President - elect Barack Obama has called on U.S. lawmakers to take swift action to pass a stimulus package as well .
During the summit , leaders of major economies are expected to discuss a coordinated fiscal stimulus , much like lock - step actions by nations in recent weeks to inject capital into banks and to lower interest rates .

China ’s move could set a bar for other countries to follow , said Carl B. Weinberg , chief economist at High Frequency Economics .
China ’s plan would include tax cuts , a loosening of credit and government spending through 2010 on a wide range of programs , including construction of low - income housing , transportation systems and the development of rural infrastructure , the official New China News Agency said .
Analysts welcomed the larger - than - expected stimulus package , which amounts to a hefty one - sixth of China ’s annual economic output .
They said the spending would help businesses , boost demand for commodities and raise consumption .
China ’s announcement appeared to give an immediate lift to investors ’ confidence , as stock markets today rose in Asia and Australia .
Chinese stocks jumped the most in seven weeks , gaining as much as 5.9 % in morning trading .

“ The Chinese stimulus package is a bold and very positive step for the Chinese and global economies , ” said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com in West Chester , Pa .
With the U.S. , Japan and much of Europe staring at recession , China ’s role looms ever larger because it has been a major driver of global economic growth in recent years .
China ’s rapid expansion has spurred trade and commodity purchases and prices .
Many multinational companies are looking to China ’s large market to help them ride out the turbulence of the worst global downturn in decades .
But China ’s economic growth has slowed sharply this year , to an annual pace of 9 % in the third quarter compared with nearly 12 % for all of last year .
Tens of thousands of Chinese factories have closed this year , and more are at risk as export orders from the United States and elsewhere shrink .
China ’s real estate market has also been sagging , damping investments and consumer spending .
Before Sunday ’s announcement , some analysts had predicted that China ’s economic growth would fall to as low as 6 % next year -- a disturbing prospect for Chinese officials because of the threat of rising joblessness and the risk of social instability .
Analysts said the stimulus package would probably lift growth next year to 8 % or higher .

“ This broad - based fiscal stimulus program will emerge as the government ’s front line of defense against an excessive economic slowdown , ” said Jing Ulrich , managing director of China equities at JPMorgan Chase in Hong Kong .
Likening the package to President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s New Deal during the Great Depression , Ulrich said higher social - welfare spending and rural reforms would stimulate private consumption .
In the U.S. , Democratic leaders of Congress are looking to approve a stimulus package of about $ 60 billion to $ 100 billion .
But as in other countries , officials also are concerned about increased public spending at a time when fiscal budgets are under strain .
That ’s not a concern for China , with its $ 2 trillion in foreign reserves and a reported fiscal surplus of $ 175 billion in the first half of this year .
The package is much larger than Beijing ’s fiscal injection during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 .

“ China can afford massive fiscal stimulus , ” Weinberg said .
He added that the biggest windfall for China from this package was political as it showed the nation ’s capacity to contribute to global economic stability .
China “ will demand a more equal footing after this [ summit ] meeting , ” Weinberg said , noting that China has thus far been a minor player in the power structure of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
Beijing ’s stimulus package is the largest of a series of steps taken recently to spur the nation ’s growth .
Previous measures have included interest - rate cuts , tax rebates for exporters and reduction of reserve requirements for banks so more money could be made available for lending .
China also previously has pledged substantial funds for various infrastructure and rural - development projects .
It was n’t clear whether previously committed money was included in the new stimulus amount .
The announcement Sunday indicated that China would spend about $ 58.6 billion in the current quarter , with additional funds to be used over the next two years to finance programs in 10 major areas , including water , electricity , technological innovation and rebuilding from disasters such as the May 12 earthquake .

Ulrich said Beijing had huge infrastructure projects planned from now to 2020 .
“ Despite the weakening economy and slowing tax revenue in recent months , ” she said , “ the government has every political incentive to boost spending in priority programs . ”

It ’s hard to get cell reception in an out - of - the - way place like Sedona , Ariz . , but it helps if you sit on the Senate committee that oversees the telecommunications industry .
The Washington Post has learned that AT&T and Verizon , both of which have lobbying ties to the McCain campaign , provided cell towers for the McCains ’ ranch at no charge to the couple .
Washington Post :
Verizon delivered a portable tower know as a “ cell site on wheels ” — free of charge — to Cindy McCain ’s property in June in response to an online request from Cindy McCain ’s staff early last year .
Such devices are usually reserved for restoring service when cell coverage is knocked out during emergencies , such as hurricanes .
In July , AT&T followed suit , wheeling in a portable tower for free to match Verizon ’s offer .
“ This is an unusual situation , ” said AT&T spokeswoman Claudia B. Jones .
“ You ca n’t have a presidential nominee in an area where there is not cell coverage . ”
Over the course of the past year , Cindy McCain had offered land for a permanent cell tower and Verizon embarked on an expensive process to meet her needs , hiring contractors and seeking county land - use permits even though few people other than the McCains would benefit from the tower .
Ethics lawyers said Cindy McCain ’s dealings with the wireless companies stand out because Sen.
John McCain is a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee , which oversees the Federal Communications Commission and the telecommunications industry .
He has been a leading advocate for industry - backed legislation , fighting regulations and taxes on telecommunications services .

There is a tendency , particularly in Washington and occasionally in Western Europe , to think of the rise of Japan , China and India as being in some way a matter of power shifting from the Western powers to the East .
My belief , and the essence of the argument that I have made in my new book , Rivals , is that this is wrong .
We should recognise this process as being one that is bringing about a rivalry , a competition , not between West and East , but between East and East .
In economic terms , these nations are becoming more integrated : trade between them is increasing as a share of their total trade , up to nearly 50 per cent now , which is lower than the EU 's 65 per cent , but just above the intra-regional trade inside the North American free trade area .
The Asian countries are more integrated because they are conscious commercial competitors and therefore , I think , stimulating the reforms in all three countries .
Inherent in the relationships between these three powers is a mixture of economic competition , growing commercial relationships and integration , but also political rivalry .
One of the people I spoke to was someone who then became Japan 's Foreign Minister , and I asked him what I should think about tensions between China and Japan .
These were strong at the time I was speaking to him , with violence at football matches , big protests about visits to the Tokyo War Shrine , and things of that nature .
He said ; " Ah , I do n't know why you Westerners are so surprised by all this tension between China and Japan .
After all , China and Japan have hated each other for a thousand years – why should it be any different now ? "
I mention this because that man is now Japan 's Prime Minister , Taro Aso .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republicans ’ hopes for only modest losses in November ’s congressional election appeared to be fading as fears of an economic collapse and panic on Wall Street fuel U.S. voters ’ wrath , political analysts and lawmakers said on Monday .
The House ’s failure to pass a $ 700 billion bailout for financial institutions , at least partly because of significant Republican opposition , could contribute to the volatility of an already chaotic election season .
But more time will be needed to gauge the impact .
“ Democrats have actually gained momentum because of the economic crisis in the past few weeks , ” Larry Sabato , a political science professor at the University of Virginia , told Reuters shortly before the House of Representatives vote .
While the trend is not irreversible , “ on the whole , a bad economy hurts the president ’s party and the president ’s party is the Republican Party , ” he said .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has already seen his lead in opinion polls widen over Republican rival John McCain , with the economy topping voters ’ worries .
Sabato pointed to several congressional races where incumbent Republicans had been doing well , only to see their poll numbers drop in recent weeks as voters focused more and more on the economy .
He cited a Courier - Journal Bluegrass poll in which Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell now appeared locked in a “ dead tie ” against a challenger seeking his Kentucky seat , after earlier showing strong poll numbers .
In Oregon , centrist Republican Sen. Gordon Smith , who is trying for a third six - year term , has also fallen into a dead heat with his opponent after looking as if he was making progress .
With Congress having to deal with the difficult Wall Street crisis so close to the November 4 election , Sabato likened the situation to 1980 , when Democratic President Jimmy Carter ’s re-election was doomed by the disastrous collapse of his efforts to rescue U.S. hostages being held in Iran .
“ That ’s what comes to mind , ” Sabato said .
The political landscape had been brightening for Republicans in mid- to late - summer , when they successfully pushed for legislation allowing more domestic offshore oil exploration in the midst of record gasoline prices .
‘ DRILL BABY DRILL ’
Republicans , and even some Democrats , saw the “ drill - baby - drill ” approach resonating with voters and congressional Republicans were further buoyed by McCain ’s surprise pick of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate .
Now , with Palin coming under intense scrutiny and stumbling in a high profile interview with CBS News , many Republicans are starting to worry about her qualifications for the vice presidency , congressional aides said .
Gasoline prices , still steep in consumers ’ minds , have come off their high mark .
Simultaneously , more weighty worries have taken over with the rash of failures of large U.S. banks and Wall Street firms , threatening voters ’ life savings .
“ We were on our way up until Thursday night , ” said Rep. Tom Cole , an Oklahoma conservative who leads efforts to elect more House Republicans .
Then came the “ political shock . ”
He was referring to a briefing on Thursday September 18 at the Capitol when Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned of dire economic consequences unless Congress approved the $ 700 billion bailout to shore up the financial system .
Cole ’s counterpart , Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , would not predict how many seats his party would pick up on November 4 , saying only that there will be gains .
“ There ’s no doubt that you ’ve seen a significant change .
The voters are very focused on the economy , ” he said .
With U.S. unemployment rising , home foreclosures at record levels and the budget deficit skyrocketing , Van Hollen said “ voters understand and are suffering the consequences of eight years of Bush economic policies . ”
Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , may have summed it up shortly before the bailout vote failed .
“ The problem is we ’re one month away from an election , ” he said .
“ We ’re all worried about losing our jobs . ”
Michele Bachmann made her intentions , on Hardball , unmistakably clear .
We now know who ’s going to oversee ( hopefully not , maybe she wo n’t be re-elected and she ’ll just return to whatever cloistered existence she was leading before engaging in the mayhem and destruction , and other diabolical activities that she currently pursues in Congress and on cable news programs ) , the Reich wing witch hunts that are going to be taking place all over this country .
We can now expect the hunting down , and concomitant merciless prosecution of thought crime , precrime , and perhaps the worst of the triumvirate , guilt by association ( particularly for those who fraternize with members of the Weather Underground , the Black Liberation Army , the Symbionese Liberation Army , several prominent Beat writers , and other like - minded individuals and organizations ) .
Since when have Republicans been interested in preserving , and encouraging investigative journalism ( do n’t they ultimately want there to be only Fox News and the Wall Street Journal , and AM hate radio , I ’ll also throw in the Washington Times , not that anyone reads it ? ) ?
I guess when it comes to investigating such things as the ‘ left - wing ’ connections of liberal members of Congress , the Rethugs are wholeheartedly for a vigorous Fourth Estate .
Leave it to a surrogate for the McCain - Palin campaign ( who here , here , and here one can observe the xenophobia , islamophobia , and downright stupidity of the campaign ’s supporters ) , who seem to be attempting to gin up an assassination attempt on Barack Obama , to bring back one of the darkest practices in American history ( McCarthyism ) .
Bachmann probably has little sense of who McCarthy was , I doubt she has much sense of U.S. history in general ( she appears to have no knowledge of what the Founding Fathers or the Constitution were / are all about ) , or who are identified as some of the greatest wrongdoers in it .
Please Michele Bachmann go away , and leave politics to people who have some understanding of free speech , that the government should n't pursue so - called thought criminals ( and precrime ) , what liberal means ( it does n’t mean left - wing extremist ) , what it means to love this country and defend its founding principles , and what it means to foster democracy , and democratic values ; not take them away for the myopic interests of a small minded , jingoistic , militaristic , greedy , racist , and uncompassionate political party that has the interests of the extreme wealthy and few others as its principal motivations .
Michele Bachmann , would you like to have someone going through all the associations you ’ve ever had in your lifetime ?
Based on what I ’ve seen of your thoughts and actions I ’d say there have been quite a few nefarious and mal - intentioned individuals in it .
Those who live in glass houses , should n't throw stones .
Former CIA man died after volume on hospital heart monitor was turned down
Died from a heart attack : Alan Bel
A former CIA man died after the volume of an alarm on his hospital heart monitor was turned down , an inquest has heard .
American Alan Bel , 60 , suffered a heart attack – but medics failed to notice because they were not alerted because they could not hear the alarm .
Consultant cardiologist Dr Bernard Clarke told the inquest that ‘ on the balance of probabilities ’ staff could have saved the 60 - year - old if the machine had been working .
And Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows said a ‘ serious failure ’ of the heart monitor had contributed to the death of Mr Bel who retired from the CIA spy agency 30 years ago .
A Manchester Royal Infirmary ( MRI ) investigation was not able to establish who turned the alarm ’s volume control off and when .
Mr Meadows has used new powers to write to the hospital and Spacelabs Medical , the company which make the machine , calling for a more thorough investigation of the case .
He has also asked for a review of all monitoring machines at the MRI and for machine maintenance to be properly recorded .
The MRI and company now have 56 days to respond .
Following Mr Bel ’s death , hospital bosses have employed four extra nurses to monitor and observe patients - at a cost of £ 120,000 a year .
Grandfather to nine Mr Bel , who had lived in Salford for 30 years , was originally from Texas , where he worked for the CIA and had a history of heart problems .
He had a pacemaker fitted in 2000 , but when the battery was changed in June last year he caught an infection and had to go back into the MRI to have the device removed .
Because his heart was no longer being regulated by the pacemaker he was hooked up to the sophisticated heart monitor .
Staff did not realise its alarm volume had been turned down and Mr Bel died of a heart attack on November 9 last year - half an hour after he was seen alive by nurses .
Investigations revealed the volume on the alarm - which would have alerted staff to a problem - had been turned down .
Mr Bel ’s daughter Carolyn Birtwistle has begun legal action against the hospital to try to make sure this does n’t happen to anyone else .
The nurse from Swinton , Manchester , said : ‘ My dad was a lovely , caring and giving man and his whole family have been devastated by his death just months before he was to become a great - grandfather .
‘ Family was everything to him and we want him back - we can’t have that so we feel we are owed the truth about his death .
‘ We want to know exactly what happened so that we have the comfort of knowing it will never happen again to another family , we do n’t want anyone to go through what we have done .
‘ There are so many questions surrounding my dad ’s death and we feel the hospital have blocked us in our attempt to get answers so we are very pleased the coroner is taking this case so seriously - we fear other lives could already have been lost in the same way . ’
Mr Nigel Meadows recorded a narrative verdict at an inquest on October 13 .
Mr Bel , worked in the CIA until he married before moving to the UK and setting up his own security business .
He was well known across Salford and Manchester for his work at several local churches .
He and his wife Diane had five children .
It also emerged during the inquest that an extra safety mechanism on the monitoring machine had been switched off possibly at some time around when the equipment was installed on the ward 16 months before .
The family ’s solicitor , Emma Holt , said : ‘ This is a tragic case where a life has been lost through carelessness .
I can confirm that we are pursuing action against the trust concerned . ’
In his letter to the MRI ’s medical director John Pearson and the managing director of Hertforshire - based Spacelabs , Mr Meadows wrote : ‘ In view of the fact that he had no electrical activity in his heart , the cardiac arrest must have occurred at least five minutes before he was found .
‘ Immediate action is necessary in the event of a cardiac arrest and any delay is prejudicial to a successful resuscitation occurring . ’
He added : ‘ The equipment was subject to a periodic maintenance review but this did not detect the operation difficulties with the equipment .
‘ It seems apparent that a member of nursing staff could have manually turned the volume down . ’
Speaking about the interim use of extra nurses to check up on monitors he said : ‘ It seems to the court this can not be a sensible use of public money . ’
A spokeswoman for the MRI said : ‘ We are unable to release further details into the public domain before we have responded directly to the coroner .
‘ The family are aware that we have been asked to look at this further by the coroner and if they have any questions or concerns in the meantime we would be happy to discuss these with them . ’
A spokesman for Hertfordshire - based Spacelabs said : ‘ It is difficult for the company to comment in detail at present , as we have just received the coroners report .
‘ We are preparing some clarifications and a response regarding his comments .
We do not maintain this particular equipment . ’
Shut Up ... No , YOU Shut Up ! Nonpartisan Advice for the Upcoming Presidential Debates : An I Love Television ™ Special Report
Jeremy Eaton
Barack Obama is up poop creek without a paddle .
Sorry to rain on your parade , voters , but Obama has a super - duper important debate coming up this week against John McCain — and he 's woefully unprepared !
Why ?
Because in case you have n't noticed , THE DEBATE RULES HAVE TOTALLY CHANGED .
See , in the 2004 debates , John Kerry easily won , handing George Bush 's honky ass to him on a silver platter .
However , on Election Day , it was Bush 's turn to serve up a nice big platter of ass , right before he strolled nonchalantly back into the White House .
So what happened ?
As mentioned earlier , THE RULES HAVE CHANGED .
Kerry may have won the " intellectual " debate — but since when does half of America give two craps about that ?
They 're going to vote for the person who gets off the best " zingers " and is n't too intellectually threatening ( i.e. , the candidate who wears the " Who Farted ? " T - shirt ) .
So what 's the modern political candidate supposed to do ?
WELL , LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME .
Barack Obama and John McCain will be debating on Friday , September 26 ( and vice - presidential hopefuls Joe Biden and Sarah Palin duke it out on Thursday , October 2 ) , and if they 're smart , they 'll read and heed the following surefire tips for winning modern debates .
Not only will these tactics help this year 's candidates win the slightly retarded hearts and minds of America , it will also quite possibly propel them into the White House .
SO , CANDIDATES —IGNORE MY ADVICE AT YOUR PERIL !
THE RULES
First things first :
The Obama / McCain debate will be 90 minutes in length and use the " podium format . "
This obviously works in Obama 's favor since McCain is old , feeble , and used to spending a lot of time on his back ( a possible holdover from the days he spent lazing around Vietcong sweatboxes ) .
There will be a single moderator — Jim Lehrer , best known as the host of the NewsHour on PBS and as " Doyle , " Pauly Shore 's best bud in the 1996 movie Bio -Dome .
The topic for the first presidential debate will be " Domestic and Economic Policy . "
( " Oh shit " is right , John McCain — but just keep blaming the homosexuals on Wall Street and you 'll be fine . )
The vice - presidential debate is also 90 minutes long and will be moderated by Washington Week 's Gwen Ifill — which is totally bad news for Joe Biden .
There 's nothing worse than being trapped by two chicks at once ... unless you 're in the backseat of a car .
Am I right , dudes ??
Up high !
THE HANDSHAKE
The opening handshake is incredibly important , because this is where the candidate must indicate dominance .
Without pausing , race to the middle of the stage , grab your opponent 's hand , and , with your other hand , firmly grasp his elbow .
Smile broadly , squeeze the shit out of his arm , and whisper in his ear , " You my bitch , right ?
Say you my bitch .
That 's right , bitch ...
I 'm gonna make you cry like a little bitch , bitch . "
Then let go , smile and wave at your audience , and take your place behind the podium .
That 's if you 're Sarah Palin .
However , if you 're Barack Obama you should definitely go for the high five .
Why ?
Because of his war injuries , John McCain CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS !
And when he does n't return the high five , Barack can be like , " Fine ... leave me hanging , jerk ! "
Another great handshake to use in the debates is the " psych . "
Reach out your hand , and when he goes for the shake , suddenly yank your hand away yelling , " PSYCH ! "
Extra debate points if you follow it by running your fingers through your hair .
( Not you , John McCain ... you can't raise your arms . )
STYLE TRUMPS SUBSTANCE
Issues , schmissues !
The smart debater knows that personal flair wins debates .
It 's far more important to come off as likable and memorable than whether or not your arguments have any factual basis .
For example , a clever candidate may want to eschew business attire entirely for a " Teen Wolf " costume .
People fucking LOVE Teen Wolf !
Run out onto the stage howling , and maybe throw in a basketball dunk for good measure .
( Not you , John McCain ... you can't raise your arms . )
But it 's not just about the way one dresses .
Having a cool catchphrase can also work wonders !
For example , Obama can score big personality points ( while shoring up his " urban base " ) by countering McCain 's arguments with phrases such as " Honky , please ! " or " Cracker , please ! " or perhaps even " May - o - nnaise , please ! "
But McCain is just as capable of capturing the " urban " vote — we all know that " urban " is code for " black , " right ?
Right !— if he heeds the following two words of advice : battle rap .
Obama will crap his elitist underpants when his shoes and mother are insulted by McCain 's wicked rhymes .
( Oh , and John ?
Do n't forget to beat - box ! )
NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION
In debates , what you do n't say is just as important as the bullshit you do say .
In 1980 , whenever President Jimmy Carter finished a point , Ronald Reagan would pull out that Alzheimery and condescending " heh - heh - heh " laugh that translated to " Oh , Jimmy , you fucking naive hillbilly . "
Al Gore would audibly sigh , and George Bush would spasmodically twitch ( not sure if that was a tactic or not ) .
So John McCain , I have two words of advice for you : Fart ... Machine .
It 's a box that makes fart sounds .
Nothing drives an elitist more crazy and fills voting hillbillies with glee like a juicy fart sound whenever people like Barack Obama are talking about " well - funded capitalization . "
Here are a few more ways to nonverbally communicate that your opponent is an idiot :
AIR WANKING .
Eye - rolling is old - timey .
Today 's hot young debaters pretend they are air - masturbating ( or wanking ) to show their displeasure with an opponent 's argument .
And if you really want to drive your point home , do the " oral - sex wank " where you wank toward your mouth while jabbing your tongue into your cheek .
Joe Biden should try this one behind Sarah Palin 's back .
CARTOON SNORING .
Nothing breaks a competitor 's concentration like the sound of someone loudly snoring in the background .
Try the " snore - whistle , " the " snore - SNORT ! " and the always - popular " snore- weeeeee - we- we- we-we ! "
USE OF METAPHORICAL PROPS .
Obama leaves a walker next to McCain 's podium .
( Just in case . )
McCain hands Obama a waffle iron .
( Just in case . )
Palin gives Biden a muzzle .
( Just in case . )
And Biden presents Palin with a box of tampons and a Midol .
( Just in case ... of a nuclear standoff . )
PANTSING .
Nothing 's funnier during a dry speech about governmental fiscal responsibility than suddenly pulling down your opponent 's pants .
UNLESS !
You do it to John McCain and then yank his shirt over the back of his head .
He wo n't be able to do anything about it ...
BECAUSE HE CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS !
KA-ZING !
What do you remember from the Reagan / Carter debates ?
" There you go again ! "
How about the Bush / Kerry debates ?
" Fuzzy math ! "
Or the Bentsen / Quayle matchup ?
" Senator , you are no Jack Kennedy . "
That 's right ... the ZINGER !
It does n't matter if you 're Abraham freakin ' Lincoln — if you do n't have a potential burn waiting in your arsenal , you might as well kiss your debate success good - bye .
Here are some examples of some sweet - ass zingalings in action .
SARAH PALIN : As the mother of a child with Down syndrome ...
JOE BIDEN : I thought everybody in Alaska had Down syndrome .
SNAP !!
Or ...
BIDEN : Our country simply can't stand another eight years of Bush politics ...
PALIN : Mmm ... Joey ?
My eyes are up here [ pointing at her head ] — not down here [ pointing at her tits ] .
YA BURNT !
Or ...
BARACK OBAMA : Change can happen !
The government must rise above the petty bureaucracy that puts ...
JOHN McCAIN : Ass - sphincter - say - what ?
BARACK OBAMA : ... What ?
McCAIN : Ha -ha - haaaaaa !
FACE !!
Or ...
McCAIN : As a senator , I 've stood up to big business , and I 'll fight hard for ...
OBAMA : [ Waving hand in front of nose ]
Peeeee - YEW !
What smells ?
Did someone 's colostomy bag break ?
OWWWW !
[ Spinning around in a circle , licking his finger , touching his bum , and saying ...]
Ssssssssssssssss !
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
Again , the American public does n't give a handful of meerkat poop about the validity of a candidate 's argument .
It wants to see one candidate dominating the other , drawing attention to his weaknesses .
For example , we 've all heard about McCain 's temper problem .
Take it from someone who spent most of his public - school career bugging the shit out of people :
Here are three great ways to get under people 's skin .
SQUEAKY VOICE .
Repeat everything your opponent says immediately after he says it using a whining , squeaky voice .
( This drove my seventh - grade lab partner , Scott Hill , crazy ! )
SIMULTANEOUS TALKING .
This is kind of like a verbal mirror exercise .
You watch your opponent 's mouth carefully and say exactly what he says while he 's saying it .
Include the " Stop thats , " the " Shut ups ! " and the " I 'm going to bust your fucking face ins . "
SPEAK EXTREMELY LOUD !!
As if your opponent is too old and feeble to hear you .
Another way to confuse old people is to suddenly yell , " MATLOCK'S ON ! "
They 'll teeter off the stage , and you 'll win the debate by default .
One of the great political tactics that 's successful nearly every time is the " outrageous half - lie . "
Here 's how it works :
Without looking at your opponent , say something like , " Unlike some candidates I could mention , I have never given a 13 - year - old chlamydia . "
He 'll be digging himself out of that hole for weeks !
Another way to confuse and really aggravate your opponent is to question his patriotism via a " knock - knock " joke .
Example ...
JOE BIDEN : Knock , knock !
SARAH PALIN : Who 's there ?
BIDEN : 9/11 .
PALIN : 9/11 who ?
BIDEN : You said you 'd never forget !
BURN ! FACE !
FACIAL !
Kaaaaa-ZING -A-LING-A-LIIIING !
( Maybe I should 've put this in the " zinger " section ? )
CLOSING STATEMENTS
At the end of the debate , each candidate is given time to make a " closing statement . "
I could give each candidate specific advice about what to say , but let 's face facts .
There 's only ONE WAY for this year 's candidates to do the impossible — which is win the debate AND win the election .
Here 's how in eight easy steps :
1. Listen quietly and respectfully as your opponent lists his qualifications for the job .
2 . When he is finished , pick up the box sitting at your feet and carry it to the center of the stage .
3 . Open the box .
4 . Pull out the severed , still - dripping head of Osama bin Laden .
5 . Close the box .
6 . Walk directly to the White House , because you 've already got the job .
7 . Raise your arms in victory .
8 . Not you , John McCain ... you can't raise your arms .

Iran 's ' Nuclear Detonators ' Are A CIA Fake
The New York Times ' Judith Miller Elaine Sciolino has another ' nuclear Iran ' scare story which immediately got picked up by other media :
International nuclear inspectors are investigating whether a Russian scientist helped Iran conduct complex experiments on how to detonate a nuclear weapon , according to European and American officials .
As part of the investigation , inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency are seeking information from the scientist , who they believe acted on his own as an adviser on experiments described in a lengthy document obtained by the agency , the officials said .
...
Although officials would not say how they had obtained the new document , it was first publicly mentioned in an agency report in May as one of 18 documents presented to Iran in connection with suspected nuclear weapons studies .
At the time it was described as a “ five - page document in English ” about experiments with a complex initiation system to detonate a large amount of high explosives and to monitor the detonation with probes .
There was no indication that the document was a translation of a much longer , more comprehensive document in Farsi .
The original , Farsi document is described by officials familiar with it as a detailed narrative of experiments aimed at creating a perfectly timed implosion of nuclear material .
Wait a second : Iran , nuclear detonators and a Russian engineer ?
Where was that about ?
Oh yeah : " Operation Merlin "
The New York Times piece mentions nothing about the story which James Risen described in his book State of War partly published in The Guardian .
But this seems quite related :
To be precise , [ the Russian scientist ] was carrying technical designs for a TBA 480 high - voltage block , otherwise known as a " firing set " , for a Russian - designed nuclear weapon .
He held in his hands the knowledge needed to create a perfect implosion that could trigger a nuclear chain reaction inside a small spherical core .
...
The Russian , who had defected to the US years earlier , still could n't believe the orders he had received from CIA headquarters .
The CIA had given him the nuclear blueprints and then sent him to Vienna to sell them - or simply give them - to the Iranian representatives to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Gordon Prather did not believe Risen 's tale that this was an attempt to lead Iran on a false technical path .
He argues that the whole story was simply an attempt by the CIA to plant evidence against Iran .
Also here .
The U.S. sent a Russian scientist as an agent to Vienna with manipulated blueprints of special detonators to hand them to a delegate from Iran .
Eight years later the IAEA gets handed material by the U.S. about special detonator experiments allegedly made in Iran
Now Iran gets accused by U.S. and European ' officials ' ( note : NOT IAEA officials ) of having worked or planed to work with such detonators based on a ' secret ' long brief in Farsi of which the IAEA first only got handed a five page English copy .
I do smell a rat here - a big one .
This is Iraq and ' Niger papers ' all over .

The tents open at around 10 am .
and fill up steadily through the day , often becoming completely full by 5 pm ...
One of the favourite postcard scenes from the Oktoberfest is of a ... waitress dressed in traditional costume and carrying an amazing number of foaming one - litre mugs of beer — often around ten — and still managing to smile .
One of the most interesting things about the Oktoberfest , from an economist ’s point of view , is the form of the contractual relationship she has with the owner / operator of the tent in which she works .
She is employed just for the duration of the Oktoberfest , and has probably the most high - powered incentive contract you will find anywhere .
She has no fixed wage , but receives 9 per cent of the revenue on the beer she ... brings to the table , as well as tips of course .
Thus she has the incentive to maximise sales revenue as well as give good service .
This is not a trivial thing .
She works more than a 12 - hour day , and the fetching and carrying is very hard work , particularly when the tent becomes full and turns into an enormous disco ...
This usually happens from around 6 each evening .
It is easy to see that a fixed wage unrelated to revenue would have very poor incentive properties .
...
The revenue - sharing form of contract means that the presumably risk - averse waitress receives no insurance , in the form of a fixed payment , from the tent owner , who is far richer and therefore likely to be less risk - averse , if not risk - neutral .
This leads one to ask whether there may not be an alternative way of providing incentives .
A noticeable feature of one of the large beer tents is the variation in waitress effort and rewards there must be across locations .
Tables differ in their distance from the serving points and therefore in the work involved .
Some areas fill up earlier than others , for example those closest to the bandstands , and therefore generate more revenue .
In particular , there are areas of the tent reserved in ‘ boxes ’ , which are booked by companies and groups , and these generate more tips than other areas , as well as higher value sales .
So one could imagine a tent operator running an incentive system in the form of a tournament , in which high effort ... would be rewarded by allocating waitresses to the best groups of tables .
In fact however this does not take place .
Waitresses as a rule serve the same set of four tables in the same tent year after year , and moves between areas are infrequent .
The reason for this appears to be the importance of teamwork , as well as long - term customer relationships .
Usually , a team of four waitresses work their set of four adjacent groups of four tables collectively , keeping the same team over a number of years .
They share the fetching and carrying , which smoothes the burden of work and allows more regular individual rest periods , and they allocate arriving customers across tables , which effectively pools revenues .
...
Moreover , customers form attachments to particular groups of waitresses and return year after year .
A tournament system would disrupt these kinds of relationships , while of course they provide self - made insurance and incentive mechanisms .
The price of an Oktoberfest Mass , the litre mug of beer which is the standard unit of consumption , is regulated , and is set each year by a committee consisting of representatives of the tent operators and of the City Council .
Its announcement is always followed by a storm of protest — the increases are usually above the rate of inflation .
For waitresses , the crucial numbers are those after the decimal point .
Apparently , customers almost always round up to the nearest Euro , so a price of € 7.80 is bad news , € 8.20 good .
For a waitress serving around 1000 Mass per Oktoberfest , this would make a difference of about €600 in tips .
On the other hand , since waitresses typically work over a long run of years , it all averages out in the end .
There is no data enabling us to test whether the rate at which waitresses quit is sensitive to the price of a Mass .
Love it or hate it , the Oktoberfest is a fascinating economic enterprise .
It certainly gives economists plenty to talk about over our beer .
Both sides claimed victory in Thursday ’s much - anticipated vice presidential debate , but on Friday the contours of the presidential contest remained much as they have been for weeks : Barack Obama holding a narrow advantage even as fewer voters are left to convince .
State polls showed Obama ’s support edging upward as previously undecided voters cast their lot .
The result is that the Republican campaign has a much smaller pool from which to win support .
Recent polls by CNN - Time magazine in Nevada and Colorado , for example , showed the percentage of undecided voters at 2 % , a third of what it had been weeks earlier .
In both states , Obama held a four - point edge .
In the states where the next president will probably be decided , backers of Republican nominee John McCain described themselves as still confident but concerned about the Democratic ticket ’s current control of the race .

“ McCain is letting Obama dictate the discussion , ” said Gregory Amend , the owner of an Ohio - based manufacturing firm and a McCain donor .
“ He needs to dictate the discussion . ”
In Missouri , which has voted with the winning presidential candidate every time but once since 1904 , the race has narrowed to a dead heat .
“ Ten days ago , you thought ‘ Maybe this year it wo n’t be a dogfight in Missouri , ’ ” said St. Louis attorney and Republican activist Ed Martin .
“ We are in for a dogfight . ”
Martin said Republicans “ breathed a sigh of relief ” that Sarah Palin survived the vice presidential debate , but he would not go so far as to suggest that meant a resurgence for McCain .
“ It ’s too early to say they ’ve got their groove back , ” he said .

In Florida , the McCain campaign was diverting more money than once planned into advertising in the state ’s pricey media markets to offset polls showing upward movement by Obama .
“ The hope was you could lock Florida and put it away a month and a half ago , ” said Brian Ballard , a leading McCain fundraiser in the state .
The vice presidential debate ended with no major gaffes on either side -- and with instant polls of voters giving the edge to Democrat Joe Biden , the Delaware senator -- but the conclusion of another potential campaign - shifting event was good and bad news for McCain .
The performance by the Alaska governor did serve to allay concerns about her , even among conservatives , after rocky interviews in recent weeks .
Yet there are now only two planned events with the power to dramatically alter the race -- the second presidential debate Tuesday in Nashville and the final one the following week in New York .
Advertisement
Outside events could certainly intrude , but of late they have harmed the Arizona senator ; his campaign has faltered as the nation ’s economic woes have increased .
A compendium of new polls by Pollster.com , which has collected survey results throughout the campaign , found that 11 of 12 new statewide surveys showed movement in Obama ’s direction , compared with polls taken weeks earlier .
Nationally , too , Obama continued to lead .
If McCain ’s campaign has been waylaid by the rising importance of the economy , it also has taken its focus at times off the battleground states key to electing the next president .
Early this week , McCain was in Iowa , a state widely expected to go to the Democrats .
On Friday , vice presidential nominee Palin woke up in St. Louis , in the middle of dead - heat Missouri -- but left there without a public event to head to GOP stronghold Texas , where she starred at a fundraiser .
She will spend almost two days this weekend in California , where Obama is ahead by double digits .
Why ?
“ The fundraisers in California -- well , more than one , ” answered Tucker Eskew , a senior campaign aide .
“ And California has got other races down ballot .
It ’s very important . ”
Obama campaign communications director Robert Gibbs called McCain ’s visit to Iowa “ baffling . ”
“ Texas and California are not on our maps as swing places , ” he added .

As the candidates stumped for votes Friday , the impact of new economic realities on the campaign was evident .
Obama interrupted a visit to a Pennsylvania flower shop , where he bought flowers for his wife on their anniversary , to laud passage of the House economic rescue bill and to direct attention to Friday ’s report that more than 150,000 jobs were lost last month .
The number represented the steepest drop in years .
He struck at McCain ’s position on deregulation , a line of discussion that probably would have generated yawns from voters if not for the collapse of Wall Street titans in recent weeks .
Now , however , it is an argument could serve to undercut McCain ’s persona as a “ maverick . ”
“ He ’s now going around saying , ‘ I ’m going to crack down on Wall Street -- I ’m going to really get tough on these folks , ’ ” Obama said .
“ But the truth is for 26 years , he ’s been saying , ‘ I ’m all for deregulation . ’
For 26 years , he has said the market is king . ”
Advertisement
Unlike Obama , who has used the faltering economy as an argument against a third successive Republican term in the White House , McCain used the economic developments to argue that he was better positioned to bring reforms to Washington .
In Colorado , another contested state , he mentioned the jobs report and spoke about the need to bolster the economy but seemed unaware that the bailout bill had just passed .
“ There was a jobs report that came out today that ’s terrible news for America , ” he said in Pueblo .
“ I have to give you straight talk , my friends ; I ca n’t give you rosy scenarios .
We ’re in a tough fight to get our economy back .
“ But I can also tell you that energy , it will be a creator of millions of jobs here in Colorado and around America , and we have to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil . ”
Advertisement
After flying to Arizona , he commended the House for passing the economic measure but did not mention the loss of jobs .
Though poll results can be upended by new events , campaigns react with worry to voter movements at this stage .
The more polls show Obama ahead , the theory goes , the more voters expect him to win and the more comfortable they get with that prospect .
In many states , too , voters are able to cast early ballots .
“ Running for president is an all - or - nothing proposition , ” said Republican Carl Bearden , a former Missouri legislator who counseled McCain to be “ more demonstrative . ”
“ Everything that needs to be said is there .
It is not crafting it .
It ’s delivering it , ” Bearden said , adding that “ Obama does a great job of delivering his message . ”

November 3 , 2008 --
The response to my recent article “ The Myth of the Tragedy of the Commons ” ( also posted at Links at http://links.org.au/node/595) has been very encouraging .
It prompted a small flood of emails to my inbox , was reposted on many websites and blogs around the world , and has been discussed in a variety of online forums .
The majority of the comments were positive , but many readers challenged my critique of Garrett Hardin ’s very influential 1968 essay , “ The Tragedy of the Commons ” .
A gratifying number wrote serious and thoughtful criticisms .
While they differed in specifics , these responses consistently made one or more of these three points :
How can you say that the tragedy of the commons is a myth ?
Look at the ecological destruction around us .
Is n’t that tragic ?
It does n’t matter if Hardin ’s account of the historical commons was wrong .
He was n’t writing history : he just used the commons as a model , or a metaphor .
Hardin was n’t rejecting all commons , just “ unmanaged commons ” .
A “ managed commons ” would not be subject to the tragedy .
This article responds to those points .
Except under the first heading , I ’ve tried to avoid repeating arguments I made in the first article , so if you have n’t already done so , I encourage you read it here first .
How can you say that ?
Some respondents described ecological horrors and catastrophes — vanished fisheries , poisoned rivers , greenhouse gases , and more — and then said , in various ways , “ The destruction of the world we all share is a terrible tragedy .
How can you call it a myth ? ”
This question reflects an understandable problem with terminology .
When Hardin wrote “ The Tragedy of the Commons ” , he was n’t using the word “ tragedy ” in its normal everyday sense of a sad or unfortunate event .
I tried to explain this in my article :
“ Hardin used the word ‘ tragedy ’ as Aristotle did , to refer to a dramatic outcome that is the inevitable but unplanned result of a character ’s actions .
He called the destruction of the commons through overuse a tragedy not because it is sad , but because it is the inevitable result of shared use of the pasture ” .
So the point is not whether ecological destruction is real .
Of course it is .
The point is , did Hardin ’s essay correctly explain why that destruction is taking place ?
Is there something about human nature that is inimical to shared resources ?
Hardin said yes , and I say that ’s a myth .
But it was only a model !
During the 1970s and 1980s , Hardin ’s description of the historical commons was so thoroughly debunked by historians and anthropologists that he resorted to denying that he ever meant to be historically accurate .
In 1991 , he claimed that his account was actually a “ hypothetical model ” and “ whether any particular case is a materialization of that model is a historical question — and of only secondary importance ” .
( Hardin 1991 )
Similarly , an academic who called Hardin “ one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century ” wrote that his description of the traditional commons was a “ thought experiment ” , so criticism of his historical errors is irrelevant ( Elliot 2003 ) .
But Hardin offered no such qualification in his 1968 essay , or in the many books and articles he wrote on related subjects in the next 20 years .
Quite the opposite , in fact .
In a 1977 essay , for example , Hardin referred explicitly to “ the way the common pasture lands of England were converted to private property ” , by parliamentary Enclosure Acts in the 1700s and 1800s .
These Acts , he wrote , “ put an end to the tragedy of the commons in this aspect of agriculture ” .
That ’s a very explicit statement about historical facts — there ’s nothing “ hypothetical ” about it ( Hardin 1977 : p. 46 ) .
So Hardin ’s later claim that historical facts do n’t matter was an attempt to rewrite his own history .
He only claimed the story was “ just a model ” after it had been thoroughly disproved .
But it was only a metaphor !
In his 1968 essay and many subsequent articles , Hardin lumped together very different social situations and problems , labelled them all “ commons ” and claimed that the “ tragedy of the commons ” explained them all .
He argued that the destruction of the historical commons explained the collapse of fisheries , overcrowding in US national parks , air and water pollution , “ distracting and unpleasant advertising signs ” , overpopulation and even “ mindless music ” in shopping malls .
While his account is often labelled a metaphor , Hardin did n’t say that those situations were similar to commons .
He said they were commons , and he repeatedly referred to their problems not as similar to but as aspects of the tragedy of the commons .
If all of those things were commons , then the fact that he was wrong about the historical “ tragedy ” completely undermines his core argument .
In reality , however , none of the examples he mentions are “ commons ” in any meaningful sense .
Shopping malls and billboard locations are private property , with access controlled by the owners .
National parks are managed or mismanaged by government bureaucrats .
Unmanaged shared resources like air and water are being polluted by giant corporations , not by “ rational herdsmen ” .
And Hardin ’s claim that population growth results from a “ commons in breeding ” is just plain bizarre .
There ’s no evidence that Hardin meant the “ tragedy ” to be seen as “ only a metaphor ” — but if he did , it was a very poor metaphor indeed .
He really meant the `unmanaged commons '
Several people suggested that Hardin was really criticising “ unmanaged commons ” , and thus presumably favoured a “ managed commons ” .
The problem with that idea is that Hardin clearly thought that “ managed commons ” was a contradiction in terms .
In his original 1968 essay Hardin wrote that a commons “ if justifiable at all , is only justifiable under conditions of low - population density ” .
As population grew , “ the commons has had to be abandoned in one aspect after another ” .
The “ tragedy of the commons ” could only be avoided by abandoning the commons : either by converting it to private property , or by imposing external controls that effectively eliminate the sharing of resources .
He repeated that argument many times in later articles and books .
In 1985 , for example :
“ A commons is a resource to which a population has free and unmanaged access : it contrasts with private property ( access only to the owner ) and with socialized property ( access to which is controlled by managers appointed by some political unit ) ” .
( Hardin 1985 : p. 90 . )
In short , Hardin defined the commons as unmanaged — so the claim that he was arguing for “ managed commons ” does n’t make sense .
When he argued for management , he was arguing for enclosing the commons .
He was more explicit in an article written to mark the 30th anniversary of his original essay : “ A ‘ managed commons ’ describes either socialism or the privatism of free enterprise . ” ( Hardin , 1998 . )
Since he equated socialism with bureaucratic state control , it is clear that for him the “ managed commons ” was not a commons at all .
Several readers said they understood that Hardin later changed his mind , that he said the tragedy only occurred in “ unmanaged commons ” .
One pointed to this sentence , in a speech Hardin gave in 1980 :
“ As a result of discussions carried out during the past decade I now suggest a better wording of the central idea : Under conditions of overpopulation , freedom in an unmanaged commons brings ruin to all ” .
( Hardin 1980 . )
Note , however , that Hardin only says that this is “ better wording ” .
There is nothing in this restatement of his “ central idea ” that does n’t appear in the original essay .
Far from recanting , he was trying to be more explicit .
In any event , as we ’ve seen , five years later Hardin still defined the commons as unmanaged , so it ’s evident that he only added the word “ unmanaged ” in 1980 to clarify his argument , not to change it .
( Nor did the addition of “ under conditions of overpopulation ” add anything to what he wrote in 1968 .
Since Hardin believed that overpopulation was the biggest problem in the Third World countries where most commons - based communities exist today , that qualification just reinforced his general anti-commons argument . )
What does `unmanaged ' mean ?
While Hardin ’s later articles did not revise his original argument fundamentally , they did expand it in a way that provides an important insight into the way he thought about commons - based communities .
In the 1980 speech quoted above , he accepted that an unmanaged commons can work if ( a ) “ the informal power of shame ” is used to keep people in line and ( b ) “ the community does not exceed about 150 people ” .
As evidence for these apparently arbitrary requirements , he cited the example of Hutterite religious communes .
Between 40,000 and 50,000 people live in such communities in western Canada and the US : they hold all property in common , and communities normally divide in two when the population reaches 150 or so .
The issue of size is a red herring : many shared resource communities are much larger than the limit the Hutterites have chosen .
But what ’s truly remarkable here is that Hardin classified Hutterite colonies as unmanaged , with the “ informal power of shame ” as its only means of staving off the tragedy of the commons .
Compare that to this account of Hutterite governance in Canada :
“ Each colony elects an executive council from the managers of various enterprises , and together with the colony minister , the executive deals with important matters that will be brought before the assembly ( all baptised male members — in effect , men 20 years of age and older ) .
Although women have an official subordinate status , their informal influence on colony life is significant .
They hold managerial positions in the kitchen , kindergarten , the purchase of dry goods , and vegetable production ” .
( Ryan 1999 : p. 1125 )
Obviously , the word “ unmanaged ” simply does n’t apply to Hutterite communities .
The fact that Hardin thought it did shows how limited his conceptions were .
Anything that was n’t either privately owned or controlled by the state was , by definition , “ unmanaged ” .
As Derek Wall points out , such blindness to non-capitalist social structures is widespread in mainstream social science :
“ The commons is important because it provides a way of regulating activity without the state or the market … .
Throughout history , the commons has been the dominant form of regulation providing an alternative almost universally ignored by economists who are reluctant to admit that substitutes to the market and the state even exist ” .
( Wall 2005 : p. 184 . )
Hutterite colonies do n’t just share resources — they democratically organise and govern their communities to manage those resources .
That was also true of the historical commons in Europe , and it ’s true of Indigenous societies in many parts of the world today .
As historian Peter Linebaugh writes :
“ To speak of the commons as if it were a natural resource is misleading at best and dangerous at worst — the commons is an activity and , if anything , it expresses relationships in society that are inseparable from relations to nature ” .
( Linebaugh 2008 : p. 279 ) .
Hardin , like the economists
Wall describes , looked at the world with capitalist blinders on .
As a result , he could n’t recognise a community - managed non-tragic commons when it was right before his eyes .

Indian soldiers remained at the Taj Mahal on Sunday
Pakistan has expressed concern about rising tensions with India following allegations that gunmen who attacked Mumbai this week had Pakistani links .
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari offered full co-operation with India and his government denied any involvement in the deadly attacks .
Wednesday 's gun and bomb assault on India 's commercial capital left at least 195 people dead and 295 injured .
Troops killed the last of the gunmen at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel on Saturday .
As few as 10 militants may have been involved in the assault which saw attacks in multiple locations including two hotels , a major railway station , a hospital and a Jewish centre .
While the vast majority of victims were Indians , at least 22 foreigners are known to have died , including victims from Israel , Germany , Japan , Canada , Australia , Italy , Singapore , Thailand and France .
One Briton , Andreas Liveras , was also killed .
Some of the gunmen came ashore by rubber dinghy on the night the killing began , others are reported to have been in the city for months gathering information on their targets .
The BBC's Chris Morris reports from the city that many people in Mumbai want their own government to look into the failure of intelligence which allowed the events of this traumatic week to unfold with such bloodshed .
' 9/11 for India '
Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the strain in relations with India was serious but he hoped the crisis could be defused .
Speaking after an emergency cabinet meeting in the capital Islamabad , he told reporters :
" Let us not fool ourselves , it is a serious situation when the people in India feel this is 9/11 for India .
" I think as a responsible elected government , we can not be oblivious of the seriousness of the situation . "
He pledged that intelligence officials would fully co-operate with the Indian investigation but added that the country 's intelligence chief would not travel to India as earlier reported , something he called a " miscommunication " .
A senior security official said Pakistan had now received preliminary evidence from India , the BBC's Barbara Plett reports from Islamabad .
But he warned that if India started to mobilise troops , Pakistan would respond in kind , even if that meant pulling soldiers away from fighting Islamist militants on the Afghan border .
He said the next 48 hours would be crucial in determining to what level tensions would escalate .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh said earlier he believed that a group based outside India was behind the killings and senior Indian politicians have said the only surviving gunman to be captured is from Pakistan .
A claim of responsibility for this week 's attacks was made by a previously unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen - a reference to a mainly Muslim region of India .
According to a statement leaked to Indian newspapers , the one alleged militant captured alive , named as Azam Amir Qasab , said the Mumbai militants had received training from an Islamist group once backed by Pakistani intelligence , Lashkar - e - Toiba .
Pakistan banned the group in 2002 at US insistence .
National Archives unsure how many White House emails will be saved Nick Juliano
Published : Monday November 24 , 2008

The plans to retain and store records from George W. Bush 's eight years in office is lacking in specifics and raises the serious possibility that millions of missing White House e-mails will be lost permanently , an independent government watchdog warned Monday .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , which is suing to force the Bush administration to account for the missing e-mails , obtained a copy of the National Archives and Records Administration 's contingency plans for processing White House records .
The eight - page plan ( .pdf ) contains few specific dates and warns of possible e-mail archiving complications relating to the ongoing lawsuit .
" The American people are at risk of losing the Bush administrations electronic records ,  warned Anne Weismann , CREW 's top lawyer .
 It is appalling that less than two months before the administration ends , the agency entrusted with preserving our nation 's historical records still has very little information about what records it will be receiving .
True to form , the White House is keeping both NARA and the public in the dark up to the very end . "
The Archives ' contingency plan notes that the outgoing administration will be leaving behind " 50 - 100 times the volume of electronic materials and formats not previously dealt with . "
The strain , presumably caused by advances in technology and the increasing reliance on e-mail since Bush took office in 2001 , is forcing the Archives to implement a new IT system .
The Presidential Records
Act requires the Archive to catalog and retain White House records , which are officially owned by the public .
The Archives outlines its plan to create a searchable database of White House memos and other text - based records , White House photo archives , the president 's daily calendar of activities , the Secret Service list of White House visitors and the White House 's e-mail records .
The Archives says it is " confident that it has the ability to ingest the Bush emails , [ but ] the timing of this ingestion is dependent on the completion of any ongoing restoration project for the MS Exchange emails undertaken by the EOP . "
Soon after Bush entered office , the White House dismantled the Automated Records Management System ( ARMS ) , which President Clinton had implemented to archive e-mails .
The system 's replacement , MS Exchange , was unreliable and led to between 5 and 10 million e-mails being deleted from White House servers .
CREW and another group are suing to force the White House to detail how many e-mails are missing and whether they can be recovered from computer back - up tapes .
It is the outcome of that lawsuit that the Archives says it is waiting on .
However , the Archives says it " has a high level of confidence " that it will be able to save most of the e-mails , estimating there are " hundreds of millions of messages " to be incorporated into its new system .
The plan , CREW argues , reveals an agency that is still in the planning stages and begging to be trusted .
At this point we ’re well past 4,500 votes in our baby name poll .
We had a huge surge in votes recently as stories appeared in the international press and blogs all over the world .
This is becoming a pretty wild ride , and will make a great story for our little Morrison to tell years from now .
Thanks to everyone who has participated so far .
So … what happens when you ask the World Wide Web to name your child ?
I ’ll share the literal results below .
Beyond the raw data , though , what happens when you try to crowdsource you ’re kid ’s moniker ?
It ’s a bit of a risk – we ’ve opened ourselves up to the possibility of criticism , abuse , and pranksterism during a very emotional time in our lives .
This little project still ongoing , and the baby is n’t due yet for another month , but at this point I can give you a little advice about using the web to involve family , friends , and even perfect strangers in your life ’s – or your work ’s – decisions :
Set the tone –
We ’re serious about using everyone ’s votes and suggestions in our decision , but we realize this is a pretty goofy way to choose a name .
So that ’s how we presented it – fun , a bit geeky , but actually quite useful .
If you ’re wondering about the secret of Google ’s success , you have my guess right there .

Expect abuse and embrace pranksterism – Our voting form has been spammed and we ’ve been called some rather nasty names .
Those are both unfortunate , but you know what ?
The vast majority of the people voting and commenting have been helpful , earnest , and encouraging .
And funny suggestions , when they are actually funny , should be celebrated , not repressed or cast aside .
Pompous decorum and solemnity are straight out – you ’re not doing anyone any favors by letting them participate , you ’re inviting them to join in the fun .

Make it interesting – I ’m not sure we would have had the same reaction if we wanted the world to vote on what we should have for dinner tomorrow , but people really love coming up with baby names .
They love making videos of Stephen Colbert .
They love picking a new theme song for hockey night .
And if you really do need advice on dinner tomorrow , involve a group of friends or local foodies , pick people who will be interested in adding their advice .
Another way to look at it is the framework presented in the Wisdom of Crowds :
Diversity of opinion –
We have really lucked out on this one , since we have votes from all around the world ( and feel free to give your home town / home country a shout out in the comments below ) .

Independence –
There ’s discussion on this site and others , and people can always check the leaderboards , but for the most part people have been giving us names with very personal , independent reasoning behind them .

Aggregation –
You can see some of the ways we ’re looking at the data already and in the coming days I ’ll add even more .
Let me repeat one point , just because it ’s so astonishing – we ’ve really put ourselves , and our unborn child ’s appellation , out there .
Any abusive behavior has been vastly outweighed by good wishes and helpful contributions .
So thanks again , unwashed masses of the interwebs .

26/11/2008 Life after bankruptcy
The age of privatisation is over .
Politics not the market is responsible for promoting the common good .
Philosopher Jürgen Habermas talks to Thomas Assheuer about the necessity of an international world order .
Die Zeit : Herr Habermas , the international financial system has collapsed and a global economic crisis is looming .
What do you find most worrying about this ?
Jürgen Habermas :
What worries me most is the scandalous social injustice that the most vulnerable social groups will have to bear the brunt of the socialised costs for the market failure .
The mass of those who , in any case , are not among the winners of globalisation now have to pick up the tab for the impacts of a predictable dysfunction of the financial system on the real economy .
Unlike the shareholders , they will not pay in money values but in the hard currency of their daily existence .
Viewed in global terms , this avenging fate is also afflicting the economically weakest countries .
That 's the political scandal .
Yet pointing the finger at scapegoats strikes me as hypocritical .
The speculators , too , were acting consistently within the established legal framework according to the socially recognised logic of profit maximisation .
Politics turns itself into a laughing stock when it resorts to moralising instead of relying upon the enforceable law of the democratic legislator .
Politics , and not capitalism , is responsible for promoting the common good .
You recently lectured at Yale University .
Which images of this crisis impressed you most ?
A seemingly endless loop of melancholic Hopperian images of long rows of abandoned houses in Florida and elsewhere with " Foreclosure " signs on their front lawns flickered across the television screens .
Then you saw buses arriving with curious prospective buyers from Europe and wealthy Latin Americans , followed by the real estate agent showing them the closets in the bedroom smashed in a fit of rage and despair .
After my return I was struck by the sharp contrast between the agitated mood in the United States and the calm feeling of " business as usual " here in Germany .
In the US the very real economic anxieties coincided with the hot end - spurt of one of the most momentous election campaigns in recent memory .
The crisis also instilled a more acute awareness of their personal interests in broad sectors of the electorate .
It forced people to make decisions that were , if not necessarily more reasonable , then at least more rational , at any rate by comparison with the last presidential election which was ideologically polarised by " 9/11 . "
America will owe its first black president – if I may hazard a prediction immediately before the election – and hence a major historical watershed in the history of its political culture , to this fortunate coincidence .
Beyond this , however , the crisis could also be the harbinger of a changed political climate in Europe .
What do you have in mind ?
Such tidal shifts change the parameters of public discussion and in the process , the spectrum of political alternatives seen as possible .
The Korean War marked the end of the New Deal , Reagan and Thatcher and the waning of the Cold War the end of the era of social welfare programs .
Today , with the end of the Bush era and the bursting of the last neoliberal rhetorical balloons , the Clinton and New Labour programs have run their course too .
What is coming next ?
My hope is that that the neoliberal agenda will no longer be accepted at face value but will be suspended .
The whole program of subordinating the lifeworld to the imperatives of the market must be subjected to scrutiny .
According to the neoliberal slogan the state is just one player in the economic field and should play as small a role as possible .
Is this way of thinking now discredited ?
That depends on what course the crisis takes , on the perceptual capacities of the political parties and on the issues that find their way onto the public agenda .
In Germany , at any rate , things are still strangely calm .
The agenda that recklessly prioritises shareholder interests and is indifferent to increasing social inequality , to the emergence of an underclass , to child poverty , a low wage sector , etc. , has been discredited .
With its mania for privatisation , this agenda hollows out the core functions of the state , it sells off the remnants of a deliberating public sphere to profit - maximising financial investors , and subordinates culture and education to the interests and moods of sponsors who are dependent on market cycles .
Are the consequences of the privatisation mania becoming apparent in the financial crisis ?
In the United States the crisis is exacerbating the already apparent material , moral , social , and cultural damage caused by a policy of deregulation pushed to an extreme by the Bush administration .
The privatisation of social security and health care , of public transport , the energy supply , the penal system , military security services , large sectors of school and university education , and the surrender of the cultural infrastructure of cities and communities to the commitment and generosity of private sponsors are part of a social design whose risks and consequences are difficult to reconcile with the egalitarian principles of a social and democratic constitutional state .
State agencies are incapable of conducting business in accordance with economic imperatives .
Yes , but certain vulnerable areas of life should not be exposed to the risks of stock market speculation , which conflicts , for example , with basing provision for the elderly on shares .
In democracies there are also some public goods , for example undistorted political communication , which cannot be tailored to the profit expectations of financial investors ; the citizens ' need for information cannot be satisfied by the culture of easily digestible sound bites that flourishes in a media landscape dominated by commercial television .
Are we experiencing a " legitimation crisis " of capitalism , to quote the title of a controversial book of yours ?
Since 1989 - 90 it has become impossible to break out of the universe of capitalism ; the only option is to civilize and tame the capitalist dynamic from within .
Even during the post - war period , the Soviet Union was not a viable alternative for the majority of the Left in Western Europe .
This was why in 1973 I wrote on legitimation problems " in " capitalism .
These problems have again forced their way onto the agenda , with more or less urgency depending on the national context .
A symptom of this are the demands for caps on managers ' salaries and the abolition of " golden parachutes , " i.e. the outrageous compensation payments and bonuses .
But are n't such policies merely window dressing ?
There are elections coming up next year .
Yes , this is of course symbolic politics designed to divert attention away from the failures of the politicians and their economic consultants .
They have been aware of the need for regulation on the financial markets for a long time .
I just reread Helmut Schmidt 's crystal - clear article " Regulate the New Mega - Speculators " from February 2007 in Die Zeit .
Everyone knew what was going on .
In America and Great Britain , however , the political elites viewed the wild speculation as useful as long as things were going well .
And Europe succumbed to the Washington Consensus .
In this regard there was also a broad coalition of the willing for which Mr. Rumsfeld did n't need to advertise .
The Washington Consensus was the notorious economic plan proposed the IMF and the World Bank in 1990 that was supposed to provide the template for economic reform , first in Latin America and then throughout half of the world .
Its central promise was " Trickle Down " : led the rich become richer and affluence will trickle down to the poor .
Empirical evidence of the falsehood of this prognosis has been accumulating for many years .
The effects of the increase in affluence are so asymmetrical , at both the national and the global level , that the zones of poverty have grown before our very eyes .
Let 's confront the past a bit :
How did it come to this ?
Did the end of the communist threat strip capitalism of its inhibitions ?
The form of capitalism reined in by nation - states and Keynesian economic policies – which , after all , conferred historically unprecedented levels of prosperity on the OECD countries – came to an end somewhat earlier , already with the abandonment of the system of fixed exchange rates and the oil crisis .
The economic theory of the Chicago School already acquired practical influence under Reagan and Thatcher .
This merely continued under Clinton and New Labour – and during the period as British chancellor of the exchequer of our most recent hero Gordon Brown .
However , the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a fatal triumphalism in the West .
The feeling of being among the winners of world history is seductive .
In this case it contributed to inflating a theory of economic policy into a worldview permeating all areas of life .
Neoliberalism is a form of life .
All citizens are supposed to become entrepreneurs of their own labour power and to become customers ...
... and competitors .
The stronger who win out in the free - for - all of the competitive society can claim this success as their personal merit .
It is deeply comical how managers – though not just them – fall prey to the absurd elitist rhetoric of our talk shows , let themselves be celebrated in all seriousness as role models and mentally place themselves above the rest of society .
It 's as if they could no longer appreciate the difference between functional elites and the ascriptive elites of estates in early modern societies .
What is so admirable about the character and mentality of people in leading positions who do their job in a halfway competent manner ?
Another alarm signal was the Bush Doctrine announced in Fall 2002 , which laid the groundwork for the invasion of Iraq .
The social Darwinist potential of market fundamentalism has since become apparent in foreign policy as well as in social policy .
But Bush was n't alone .
He was flanked by an impressive horde of influential intellectuals .
Many of whom have learned nothing in the meantime .
In the case of leading neoconservative thinkers like Robert Kagan , the thinking in terms of predatory categories a la Carl Schmitt has become only more apparent after the Iraq disaster .
His recent commentary on the current regression of international politics into a nuclear armed and increasingly unrestrained power struggle is : " The world has returned to normal . "
But to repeat :
What went wrong at the political level after 1989 ?
Did capital become too powerful vis -a - vis politics ?
It became clear to me during the 1990s that politics must build up its capacities for joint action at the supranational level if it is to catch up with the markets .
There even seemed to be initial steps in this direction during the early part of the decade .
George Bush the elder spoke in a programmatic way of a New World Order and seemed to want to make use of the long blocked – and ridiculed !
– United Nations !
There was initially a sharp increase in the number of humanitarian interventions enacted by the Security Council .
The politically intended economic globalisation should have been followed by a system of global political coordination and a further legal codification of international relations .
However , the initial ambivalent efforts lost momentum already under Clinton .
The current crisis is making us aware of this deficiency again .
Since the beginning of the modern era , the market and politics have had to be repeatedly balanced off against one another in order to preserve the network of relations of solidarity among the members of political communities .
A tension between capitalism and democracy always remains , because the market and politics rest on conflicting principles .
The flood of decentralsed individual choices unleashed within more complex networks also calls for regulations after the latest phase of globalisation ; this is contingent on a corresponding extension of political procedures through which interests are generalised .
What does that mean ?
You continue to support Kant 's cosmopolitanism and advocate Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker 's idea of a global domestic politics .
That sounds downright illusory – how should we think of it ?
After all , you need only consider the current state of the United Nations .
I must admit that a reform of the core institutions of United Nations from the ground up would not go far enough .
To be sure , the Security Council , the Secretariat , the Tribunals , and the powers and procedures of these institutions in general must as a matter of urgency be made fit for a global implementation of human rights and the effective prohibition on violence – in itself an immense task .
However , even if the United Nations Charter could be developed into a kind of constitution for the international community , this framework would still lack a forum in which the militarised struggle of the major powers would be transformed into institutionalised negotiations concerning the problems of the global economy in need of regulation , including problem of climate and environmental policy , of the distribution of contested energy resources , scarce supplies of drinking water , etc .
At this transnational level problems of distribution arise that cannot be dealt with in the same way as violations of human rights or infringements of international security – in the final instance as prosecutable offences – but have to be worked out through political negotiations .
But an institution responsible for this already exists , the G8 .
That 's an exclusive club in which some of these issues are discussed in a noncommittal way .
As it happens , there is a revealing discrepancy between the overhyped expectations associated with these events and the meager results of the media spectacles that remain without consequences .
The illusory weight of expectation shows that the populations are very well aware – perhaps even more acutely aware than their own governments – of the unresolved problems of a future global domestic politics .
That sounds suspiciously like the dreams of a ghost - seer .
Just a few days ago most people would have regarded what is happening today as unrealistic .
The European and Asian governments are outdoing each other with regulatory proposals to address the deficient institutionalisation of the financial markets .
Even the SPD in the CDU are presenting proposals on accounting rules and capital adequacy ratios , on the personal liability of managers , on improved transparency and oversight of the stock market , etc .
Of course , a tax on stock market transactions , which would already go some way towards a global tax policy , is rarely mentioned .
In any case , the new " architecture of the financial system " announced with much fanfare will not be easy to implement against US resistance .
As to whether it would even go far enough given the complexity of these markets and the worldwide interdependence of the most important functional systems …
International treaties , which is what the parties currently have in mind , can be revoked at any time .
They cannot provide the basis for a watertight regime .
Even if new powers were transferred to the International Monetary Fund , that would not amount to a global domestic politics .
I do n't want to make predictions .
Given the scale of the problems , the most we can do is to think about constructive proposals .
The nation - states must understand themselves increasingly as members of the international community – even in their own interest .
That is the most difficult task that needs to be tackled over the next couple of decades .
When we speak of " politics " with this stage in mind , we often think of the actions of governments which have inherited the self - understanding of collective actors who make sovereign decisions .
However today the continuity of this self - understanding of the state as a Leviathan , which developed since the seventeenth century in tandem with the European system of states , has already been broken .
The substance and composition of what we used to call " politics " in the international arena is constantly shifting .
But how does that fit with the social Darwinism in international relations which , as you claim , has again become prominent on the global political stage since 9/11 ?
Perhaps we should take a step back and look at a somewhat larger context .
Since the late eighteenth century , law has gradually permeated the politically constituted power of government and stripped it of the substantive character of mere " force " in the domestic sphere .
In its external relations , however , the state has preserved enough of this substance , in spite of the growth of intertwined international organisations and the increasingly binding power of international law .
The concept of the " political " shaped by the nation - state is nevertheless in a state of flux .
Within the European Union , for example , the member states continue to enjoy their monopoly on legitimate force while nevertheless implementing the laws enacted at the supranational level more or less without demur .
This transformation of law and politics is also bound up with a capitalist dynamic which can be described as a periodic interplay between a functionally driven opening followed in each instance by a socially integrative closure at a higher level .
Does this mean that the market splits society apart and the welfare state closes it up again ?
The welfare state is a late and , as we are now learning , fragile accomplishment .
Expanding markets and communications networks have always had an explosive force with simultaneously individualising and liberating consequences for individual citizens ; but each of these breaches has been followed by a reorganisation of the old relations of solidarity within a more comprehensive institutional framework .
This process began during the early modern period as the ruling estates of the High Middle Ages were progressively parliamentarised , as in England , or mediatised by absolute monarchs , as in France , within the new territorial states .
The process continued in the wake of the constitutional revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the welfare state legislative programs of the twentieth century .
This legal taming of the Leviathan and class antagonism within civil society was no small matter .
For the same functional reasons , however , this successful constitutionalisation of state and society points today – following a further phase of economic globalisation – towards the constitutionalisation of international law and of the strife - torn world society .
What role does Europe play in your scenario ?
Not the one it has in fact played in the crisis .
It is not clear to me why the recent crisis management of the European Union is being praised so highly .
Gordon Brown was able to bring the American finance minister Paulsen to reinterpret the laboriously negotiated bailout with his memorable decision because he brought the most important players in the Eurozone on board through the mediation of the French president and against the initial resistance of Angela Merkel and her minister of finance Peer Steinbrück .
You need only examine this negotiation process and its outcome more closely .
For it was the three most powerful among the nation - states united in the EU who agreed as sovereign actors to coordinate their different measures which happened to point in the same direction .
In spite of the presence of Messrs Juncker and Barroso , the way this classical international agreement came about had almost nothing to do with a joint political will - formation of the European Union .
The New York Times duly registered , not without a hint of malice , the Europeans ' inability to agree upon a joint economic policy .
How do you account for that ?
The present course of the crisis is making the flaw in the construction of the European Union manifest : every country is responding with its own economic measures .
Because the competences in the Union , simplifying somewhat , are divided in such a way that Brussels and the European Court of Justice implement the economic freedoms whereas the resulting external costs are palmed off on the member states , there is at present no joint will - formation at the level of economic policy .
The most prominent member states are even divided over the principles governing how much state and how much market is desirable in the first place .
Moreover each country is conducting its own foreign policy , Germany first and foremost .
The Berlin Republic , for all its quiet diplomacy , is forgetting the lessons that the old Federal Republic drew from history .
The government is exploiting the extended room for manoeuvre in foreign policy it has gained since 1989 - 90 and is falling back into the familiar pattern of national power politics between states , though the latter have long since shrunk to the format of minor princedoms .
But what could these princedoms do ?
What would be the next step ?
Are you asking me for my wish list ?
Since under the present conditions I regard graduated integration or different speeds of unification as the only possible scenario for overcoming the present stagnation , Sarkozy 's proposal for an economic government of the Eurozone can serve as a starting point .
This does not mean that we would have to accept the statist background assumptions and protectionist intentions of its sponsor .
Procedures and political results are two different things .
The " closer cooperation " in the field of economic policy would have to be followed by " closer cooperation " in foreign policy .
And neither could be conducted any longer through backroom deals behind the backs of the populations .
You wo n't find support for that even in the SPD .
The SPD leadership is abandoning this idea to the Christian Democrat Jürgen Rüttgers , the " labour leader " in the Rhine and Ruhr region .
All across Europe the social democratic parties have their backs to the wall because they are being forced to play zero - sum games with shrinking stakes .
Why do n't they embrace the opportunity to break out of their national cages and gain a new room for manoeuvre at the European level ?
In this way they could even set themselves apart from the regressive competition from the left .
Whatever " left " and " right " still mean today , only together could the Eurozone countries acquire sufficient weight in world politics to be able to exert a reasonable influence on the agenda of the global economy .
The alternative is to act as Uncle Sam 's poodle and throw themselves at the mercy of a global situation that is as dangerous as it is chaotic .
Speaking of Uncle Sam – you must be deeply disappointed with the United States .
For you the US was supposed to be the draft horse of the new world order .
Do we have any alternative except to bet on this draft horse ?
The United States will emerge weaker from the current dual crisis .
However , it remains for the present the liberal superpower and it finds itself in a situation which encourages it to overhaul its neoconservative self - image as the paternalistic global benefactor .
The worldwide export of its own form of life sprang from the false , centralised universalism of the Old Empires .
By contrast , modernity rests upon the decentralised universalism of equal respect for everyone .
It is in the interest of the United States not only to abandon its counterproductive stance towards the United Nations but to place itself at the head of the reform movement .
Viewed historically , the confluence of four factors – superpower status , the oldest democracy in the world , the assumption of office of a , let 's hope , liberal and visionary president , and a political culture that provides an impressive sounding board for normative impulses – represents an improbable constellation .
Today America is deeply distraught by the failure of the unilateral adventure , the self - destruction of neoliberalism and the abuse of its exceptionalist consciousness .
Why should n't this nation , as it has so often in the past , pull itself together and try to bind the competing major powers of today – the global powers of tomorrow – before it is too late into an international order that no longer needs a superpower ?
Why should n't an American president – buoyed by a watershed election – who finds that his scope for action in the domestic arena is severely constrained want to embrace this reasonable opportunity – this opportunity for reason – at least in foreign policy ?
The so - called realists would dismiss your proposal with a jaded smile ...
I realise that many things speak against it .
The new American president would have to overcome the resistance of the elites within his own party who are subservient to Wall Street ; he would doubtlessly also have to be dissuaded from succumbing to the reflexes of a new protectionism .
In addition , the United States would need the friendly support of a loyal yet self - confident ally in order to make such a radical change of direction .
A
West that is " bipolar " in a creative sense will become possible , of course , only when the EU learns to speak with one voice in foreign policy and , indeed , to use its internationally accumulated capital of trust to act in a farsighted manner itself .
The " Yes , but ... " is obvious .
Yet in times of crisis there is perhaps more need of a somewhat broader perspective than the advice of the mainstream and the petty manoeuvring of politics as usual .

After a century of declines , the U.S. infant mortality rate barely budged between 2000 and 2005 , causing the United States to slip further behind other developed countries despite spending more on healthcare , according to a report released Wednesday .
The rate was 6.86 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2005 , virtually unchanged from 6.89 in 2000 .
In 1900 , the rate was 100 deaths per 1,000 live births .
The United States dropped to 29th in the world in infant mortality in 2004 , the latest year for which data are available from all countries , tying with Poland and Slovakia .
The year before , it was 27th .
In 1960 , it was 12th .
The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed the leveling off in mortality to a 9 % increase in premature births over the same period and to stalled progress in saving the earliest preterm infants .
Premature birth and low birth weight are by far the biggest causes of infant death .

Advances such as prenatal steroids that hasten lung development and other treatments that help premature infants breathe have allowed the vast majority of those infants to survive .
But the search for new breakthroughs is only one part of the solution , said Joann Petrini , director of the March of Dimes ’ perinatal data center .
“ Several decades ago we saw really dramatic declines because we had these silver bullets , ” she said .
“ But the other piece is to see how can we prevent some of these babies from being born preterm in the first place . ”
Infant mortality rates vary by race and ethnicity , from a high of 13.63 per 1,000 births for African American women to a low of 4.42 for Cuban Americans , according to the CDC report .
Differences in socioeconomic status and access to medical care did not entirely explain the gap , the report said .

A rise in twins and triplets , driven by the use of infertility treatments , contributed somewhat to the rise in premature and low - birth - weight births , Petrini said .
But even accounting for those trends , premature births are increasing , possibly tied to rising rates of obesity , diabetes and hypertension .
What those conditions have in common is that they are preventable , and that , said Petrini and other health advocates , is where the United States falls behind other developed countries .
“ We as a nation place less emphasis on primary care and prevention than a lot of these other industrialized democracies do that have lower rates than we do , ” said Dr. Ann O’Malley of the Center for Studying Health System Change , a Washington - based research group .
Twenty - two countries have infant mortality rates below 5 per 1,000 births , and Sweden , Norway , Finland , Japan , Hong Kong and Singapore are below 3.2 .

Health advocates acknowledge that many of those countries have more homogeneous populations than the United States .
But they also have fewer gaps in healthcare coverage and health systems that emphasize primary care .
“ We ’re great in this country at taking care of really sick people with high - tech interventions , ” O’Malley said .
“ But we ’re not very good at plugging people into preventive care . ”

EVEN WHILE CAPITALISM continues its inexorable push to corral every square inch of the globe into its logic of money and markets , new practices are emerging that redefine politics and open up spaces of unpredictability .
Instead of traditional political forms like unions or parties , people are coming together in practical projects , from urban gardening in vacant lots to the suddenly ubiquitous do - it - yourself bike shops .
More and more people , recognizing the degradation inherent in business relations , are creating networks of activity that refuse the measurement of money .
They depend instead on sharing skills and technological know - how within new communities , such as the biofuels co-ops that have proliferated in many cities .
Networks have grown , thanks to the spread of the Internet and other telecommunications techologies , and new kinds of “ families ” based on shared values , alternative living arrangements , and non-economic relationships are growing within the old society .
Collectively , I call these projects “ Nowtopia . ”
Rarely do the individual participants conceive of them in political terms ; day - to - day issues about how we live , what we do , how we define and meet our needs tend to be understood as outside politics .
But all Nowtopian activities are profoundly political .
The Nowtopian movement embodies a growing minority seeking emancipation from the treadmill of consumerism and overwork .
Acting locally in the face of unfolding global catastrophes , friends and neighbors are redesigning many of the crucial technological foundations of modern life , like food and transportation .
These redesigns are worked out through garage and backyard research - and - development programs among friends using the detritus of modern life .
Our contemporary commons takes the shape of discarded bicycles and leftover deep - fryer oil , of vacant lots and open bandwidth .
“ Really , really free markets , ” anti-commodities , and free services are imaginative products of an anti-economy provisionally under construction by freely cooperative and inventive people .
They are n’t waiting for an institutional change from on high but are building the new world in the shell of the old .
These practices require sharing and mutual aid and constitute the beginnings of new kinds of communities .
Because these people are engaged in creative appropriation of technologies to purposes of their own design and choice , these activities embody the ( partial ) transcendence of the wage - labor prison by workers who have better things to do than their jobs .
They are tinkerers working in the waste streams and open spaces of late capitalism , conjuring new practices while redefining life ’s purpose .
Efforts to create islands of utopia have always flourished on the margins of capitalist society , but never to the extent that a radically different way of living has been able to supplant market society ’s daily life .
Nowtopians , and anyone determined to free themselves from the constraints of economically defined life , face the same historic limits that have beset all previous efforts to escape .
Can the emerging patterns resist the co-optation and reintegration that have absorbed past self - emancipatory movements ?
The new apparatus of global production helps speed up the extension of market society , but it inevitably also speeds the spread of social opposition , the sharing of experiments and alternatives .
Our moment in history is at least as exhilarating as it is daunting .
As the news came out of Mumbai last night , the mainstream media was struggling for details .
Not for the first time , those on the ground were able to provide a series of reports , rumours , videos and pictures , which slowly fell together into a pretty harrowing jigsaw .
Perhaps most startling are the pictures of photographer Vinukumar Ranganathan receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors to his Flickr pages to show over 100 dramatic photos of the grim scenes .
Online encyclopedia sites including Wikipedia and Mahalo , as well as the citizen media aggregators NowPublic and GroundReport are being constantly updated with new information .
With the sheer scale and number of attacks making it difficult to find a coherent picture , many resorted to Twitter , and snippets of information about the attacks pinged from from mobile phones every second as people described the horrors around them , while a Google map sprang up with details of the attack site .
But one significant development in this citizen reporting was that , as noted by Lloyd , the Indian government asked that the live Twitter updates cease to prevent the perpetrators gaining operational information .
A strange sort of tribute to the strength of an emerging media and it seems like a landmark , somehow , in its development .
I 've been meaning to document this for ages ...
My laptop is set up with an encrypted root filesystem using LVM and dmcrypt .
It also has a small Debian stable system for recovery purposes ( I do n't have a CD drive , so if everything goes horribly wrong , I can't just boot from a live CD ) .
Here 's how to set up something similar :
Step 1 .
Set up the recovery system
Start the Debian lenny ( beta ) installer as usual .
( I originally used etch , but these instructions are for lenny - either should work . )
When you get to " Partition disks " , choose " Manual " .
Here 's the partitioning scheme to use :
main partition for LVM , taking up the whole disk minus 1GB or so .
select " Do not use " , for now
1GB recovery partition at the end of the disk ( this will also be the main system 's / boot , since / boot needs to be unencrypted anyway ) .
Use the defaults : ext3 mounted at /.
Finish partitioning and write changes to disk , and wait for the base system to install .
Say yes to installing Grub to the MBR for now ( it might be possible to do the install more cleanly by installing Grub to the recovery partition 's boot sector instead - I have n't tested that ) .
Reboot into the freshly installed recovery system and satisfy yourself that it works .
Step 2 .
Set up the main system
Now boot the Debian installer again .
This time it 's for your installed system .
At the " Partition disks " stage , choose " Manual " again .
Select the main partition and choose " Use as : physical volume for encryption " .
Next select " Configure encrypted volumes " .
Your main partition will now be randomized - this is slow - and some time later you 'll be asked for a passphrase .
You 'll have to type this in at each boot .
Select the contents of the " disk " Encrypted volume ( hda1_crypt ) and choose Use as : physical volume for LVM .
Now " Configure the Logical Volume Manager " and create a Volume Group .
I always use the laptop 's hostname as the VG name ( this reduces confusion if you ever plug the disk into another machine for disaster recovery ) .
Create a Logical Volume called swap , the size you want your swap space to be .
If you plan to use suspend - to - disk , this needs to be at least as large as your RAM .
Create a Logical Volume called root , for the root filesystem .
If you want separate " partitions " for things like / home , now is a good time to create them too ; if you want to use my schroot howto , leave some unallocated space in the VG for that .
Set your swap LV to be used as a swap area , and your root LV to be used as ext3 mounted at / .
If you wanted extra LVs , set them up too .
Also set your recovery partition to be used as ext3 , mounted on / boot , and not reformatted .
It should now look something like this ( smcvcrypt is the name of a KVM virtual machine in which I 've been testing these instructions , normally you 'd have the laptop 's hostname there ) .
Proceed with the installation .
Install Grub to the MBR - this will temporarily make the recovery system unbootable , but shrug never mind .
Finish the installation and reboot into your new main system .
Step 3 .
Make them dual - boot
Within the main system your recovery system is also visible , at / boot .
Bind - mount / dev onto / boot / dev , chroot into / boot , and run " update - grub /dev/hda2 " , where hda2 is the partition where the recovery partition is .
Leave the chroot .
Edit / boot / grub / menu.lst and put this right at the end :
title
Go to recovery system root ( hd0,1 ) chainloader +1
( Replace ( hd0,1 ) with what Grub thinks the recovery partition is - the second number is the partition number starting from 0 , so / dev /hd a5 would be ( hd0,4 ) and so on . )
Also edit / boot / boot / grub / menu.lst and put this right at the end :
title Back to main system root ( hd0 ) chainloader +1
Also , still in / boot / boot / grub / menu.lst , go to the top of the file and change the colour scheme to something else ( I used a red background ) to indicate that this boot menu is for the recovery system .
Reboot and try it out .
You should now have an extra boot menu option , " Recovery system " .
Selecting it will switch to the recovery system 's boot menu , which has an option to switch back , and so on .
Each boot menu also has some entries for kernels , any of which will boot with the appropriate root filesystem ( encrypted root for the main system , unencrypted for the recovery system ) .
Success !
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Google
Inc received the royal seal of approval on Thursday when it added a picture of the Queen to the logo on its British homepage to mark her visit to its London offices on Thursday .
The image , known as a Google Doodle , shows the Queen in profile and a golden crown above the letter E of Google .
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will tour the Internet search giant ’s British headquarters , a short walk from Buckingham Palace in central London .
The royal party will meet Google executives and hear about the company ’s search engine , advertising and mobile phone technology .
They will also learn how Google Earth , an online map , is being used to help save the Amazon rainforest .
The Queen will then be invited to upload a video to the royal family ’s official channel on YouTube , the video - sharing site owned by Google .

Human mathematical competence emerges from two representational systems .
Competence in some domains of mathematics , such as calculus , relies on symbolic representations that are unique to humans who have undergone explicit teaching 1, 2 .
More basic numerical intuitions are supported by an evolutionarily ancient approximate number system that is shared by adults 3,4,5,6 , infants7 and non-human animals 8,9,10,11,12,13 — these groups can all represent the approximate number of items in visual or auditory arrays without verbally counting , and use this capacity to guide everyday behaviour such as foraging .
Despite the widespread nature of the approximate number system both across species and across development , it is not known whether some individuals have a more precise non-verbal ‘ number sense ’ than others .
Furthermore , the extent to which this system interfaces with the formal , symbolic maths abilities that humans acquire by explicit instruction remains unknown .
Here we show that there are large individual differences in the non-verbal approximation abilities of 14 - year - old children , and that these individual differences in the present correlate with children ’s past scores on standardized maths achievement tests , extending all the way back to kindergarten .
Moreover , this correlation remains significant when controlling for individual differences in other cognitive and performance factors .
Our results show that individual differences in achievement in school mathematics are related to individual differences in the acuity of an evolutionarily ancient , unlearned approximate number sense .
Further research will determine whether early differences in number sense acuity affect later maths learning , whether maths education enhances number sense acuity , and the extent to which tertiary factors can affect both .
Astronomy Picture of the Day
The sky is filled with breathtaking pictures , many of which are available on the World Wide Web .
Each day we feature a different picture of some part of our fascinating universe , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
Explanation :
Almost £ 90bn was added to the value of leading shares on Monday as investors breathed a huge sigh of relief that Citigroup had been rescued by the US government .
The FTSE 100 enjoyed its biggest ever daily percentage gain and its second best points gain in its 24 - year history , surging 372 points , or 9.8 per cent , to 4,153 .
That eclipsed the 8.4 per cent rise on the day in September when the Financial Services Authority banned short selling of financials .
The FTSE 250 climbed 298 points , or 5.4 per cent , to 5,789.5 .
Traders said the plan to pump $ 20bn into Citi and , crucially , guarantee up to $ 306bn in problematic assets had helped inject some much needed confidence into the market .
The chancellor ’s pre-Budget report did nothing to affect the positive mood in the City .
The record - breaking gain helped the FTSE 100 recoup a large chunk of last week ’s 11 per cent fall , which was the third biggest on record .
However , trading volumes were below average , suggesting that Monday ’s gains owed more to short covering and computerised trading strategies that follow trends or momentum .
“ The reality is that we are in a bottoming process in the equity market , and this , as well as the broader economic deleveraging , will drive volatility , ” said Michael O’Sullivan of Credit Suisse private banking .
The mining sector spearheaded the bounce .
As risk appetite returned , Kazahkmys climbed 27.8 per cent to 229¾p , while Eurasian Natural Resources added 27.4 per cent to 257p .
BHP Billiton gained 22.9 per cent to 980p and Anglo American put on 22.8 per cent to £ 13.90 .
Insurance stocks , which were hit hard in last week ’s market rout , were also in demand .
Prudential rose 20.4 per cent to 295 p , while Aviva added 9 per cent to 321p .
A push from Nomura provided further support .
“ We rate both Prudential and Aviva ‘ buy ’ as we believe the market is too pessimistic about the probability of the companies needing to raise capital , ” analyst Matt Lilley said .
Banks also had a good day because of the Citi bail out .
Barclays climbed 10 per cent to 146½p as shareholders approved its controversial £ 7bn fund raising , while Royal Bank of Scotland added 7.2 per cent to 50.8 p helped by positive comments from Fox - Pitt Kelton .
“ We believe the UK banking sector can get through the recessions without further re-capitalisations , ” said analyst Leigh Goodwin .
Lloyds TSB rose 18.4 per cent to 147.6 p , while HBOS moved 17.3 per cent higher to 86 p .
However , emerging markets bank Standard Chartered missed out .
It was one of the two blue chips that closed lower – the other was the non-voting shares of fund management group Schroders , down 0.1 per cent at 540p .
Standard Chartered fell 4.5 per cent to 725 p after it announced plans to raise £ 1.8 bn in a deeply discounted rights issue .
The move surprised the market because last week , Standard was reassuring investors about the strength of its capital base .
Retailers were in demand after the chancellor confirmed plans to cut value - added tax from 17.5 per cent to 15 per cent .
Marks and Spencer gained 6.9 per cent to 218 ¼p even though rumours circulated that the company might have another one - day sale .
According to the rumour mill , December 4 and 11 have been pencilled in .
Kesa Electricals , up 12.9 per cent to 72¼p , and DSG International , 5.8 per cent better at 13¾p , also enjoyed gains .
Traders said there was the possibility of a short squeeze in DSG .
This is because 60 per cent of the stock available to borrow is now out on loan .
Among the mid-caps , Homeserve , which sells insurance policies for home appliances and emergency repair services , dropped 29 per cent to 867 p after the company warned that profits could be hit if the slowdown continued .
UK Coal , the biggest coal mining company in the country , rose 11.2 per cent to 59½p after the chairman , chief executive and finance director , all declared the purchase of 68,500 shares .
There was also director sharebuying at IG Group , the financial spread betting company .
Chairman Jonathan Davie said he had picked up 90,000 shares at 183 p .
Shares rose 11.1 per cent to 203p .
Julia Cavenaugh is a Republican from Texas who voted twice for President Bush , so it is no easy stretch for the second - grade teacher to cast her ballot for Barack Obama .
Fed up with Republicans over the economy , she likes Obama ’s tax and healthcare plans .
After the economic crisis erupted last month , she found another reason to reject her party ’s presidential nominee : temperament .
Watching John McCain debate Obama , she found his body language hostile , and said he seemed upset by his rival ’s answers on the economy .
“ Obama is more tactful , ” she said .
That ’s part of why Cavenaugh increasingly sees Obama as the answer to her nagging question : “ Who ’s going to represent our country better ? ”

Swing voters have tilted Obama ’s way as the economy has overwhelmed all other issues as the top priority for Americans .
In interviews with Cavenaugh and a dozen others who participated in a recent Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll , demeanor emerged as a dominant theme in their explanations for why they trusted Obama more than McCain to guide the nation out of its financial crisis .
Jay Sicht , a 37 - year - old independent voter who sells auto parts in Columbia , Mo. , described Obama as “ level - headed , calm , cool and collected under pressure ” -- qualities that he wants in a president facing the prospect of a global depression .
Sicht has noticed that car owners have been delaying repairs to save money , so business has slowed down a bit .
He works on commission , so it will hurt if customers scrimp even more .
He has qualms about Obama .
The Illinois senator seems arrogant and abrasive , Sicht said , but his “ gut feeling ” is still to trust him .
Advertisement
McCain , on the other hand , comes off as a “ hothead , ” Sicht said .
During the Republican primaries , Sicht was particularly unnerved by McCain responding to a question about whether it was time to send “ an airmail message to Tehran ” by referring to the Beach Boys song “ Barbara Ann ” as “ Bomb Iran ” and singing , “ Bomb , bomb , bomb . . . " Sicht found nothing funny about it .
“ I do n’t feel he ’s very stable mentally , ” said Sicht , who voted for Bush in 2000 and a minor - party candidate in 2004 .
Obama and McCain have tried to stoke negative impressions of each other ’s personality .
McCain has portrayed Obama as an elitist out of touch with mainstream America .
He also has tried to raise suspicions about Obama ’s ties with 1960s radical William Ayers and others , asking , “ Who is the real Barack Obama ? ”
For his part , in recent weeks Obama has taken to calling McCain “ erratic , ” suggesting a steadier hand would be better - suited to leading an economic recovery .

As Sicht ’s remarks suggest , doubts about McCain ’s personal disposition could erode the edge he has long held over Obama on foreign affairs as well .
To Vandria Rainer , an independent who lives in San Luis Obispo , it looked like McCain was trying to score “ fighting points ” against Obama when he suspended his campaign and threatened to skip the first presidential debate until Congress passed a bailout bill .
“ There seems to be a bit of fight in McCain that seems unpresidential , ” said Rainer , 62 , a teacher who voted for Bush in 2000 and his Democratic challenger , John F. Kerry , in 2004 .
Willie Standifer of Virginia Beach , Va. , put it another way : “ You ca n’t just jump in without gathering the facts . ”

A 50 - year - old Democrat and former postal employee who has been out of work for several months , Standifer said McCain seemed like “ a decent man , ” but one who is less in tune with average Americans than Obama .
With the election just two weeks away , the vast majority of voters have made up their minds , but public opinion could shift back in McCain ’s direction .
Beyond temperament , the interviews with swing voters suggest , McCain ’s party affiliation also remains a major impediment to gaining support from voters who are normally open to backing a Republican .
“ What has happened with the economy has pushed me over the edge to say , ‘ No , I do n’t want any more Republicans , ’ ” said Barbara Webber , a retired Illinois pharmacist and political independent who voted for Bush .

Webber , 66 , lives in Palos Hills , a Chicago suburb .
She fears that recent hits to her 401 ( k ) will soon force her to resume working .
She and her siblings have been unable to sell the house they inherited last year from their mother , because “ people are buying foreclosures instead , ” she said .
Gaylord Yost , 75 , a retired forester who lives in a Milwaukee suburb , River Hills , is also disgusted with Republicans .
He faults McCain for supporting Bush ’s economic policies , and assails the party for what he calls an “ anything - goes ” approach to business that has backfired .
“ I ’m not open to a Republican at all , because of what they ’ve done , ” said Yost , an independent .
“ As long as their party starts with an R , that ’s it . ”
For others , the nature of McCain ’s campaign has proved a turnoff .

Russ Houser , 51 , a carpenter who lives in Cedaredge , Colo. , said McCain used to be his “ favorite Republican . ”
But Houser said that McCain had “ gone overboard ” in focusing on Ayers , and that the distortions in his attack ads raised doubts about his honesty .
What cemented his unfavorable view of McCain , though , was “ the showmanship ” of his response to the economic crisis -- “ running back to Washington and suspending his campaign , ” said Houser , an independent .
Obama , by contrast , has “ kept his cool , ” Houser said .
By paying attention to mannerisms , posture and vocal inflections , he added , “ I think everybody gets an impression on whether they believe someone or not . ”

And when it comes to Obama , Houser said , “ I believe him . ”

Google is to shut its 3D virtual world Google Lively less than 6 months after launching it .
Lively launched with a bang back in July with talk that it could become a Second Life killer .
However limited support , poor uptake not helped by only being available to Windows users , and a general disinterest in the product has seen some speculating about its future for a while .
According to a post on the Google Blog , Google refers to Lively as a kind of experimentation , but says that “ not every bet is going to pay off . ”
That ’s why , despite all the virtual high fives and creative rooms everyone has enjoyed in the last four and a half months , we ’ve decided to shut Lively down at the end of the year .
It has been a tough decision , but we want to ensure that we prioritize our resources and focus more on our core search , ads and apps business .
Lively.com will be discontinued at the end of December , and everyone who has worked on the project will then move on to other teams .
We ’d encourage all Lively users to capture your hard work by taking videos and screenshots of your rooms .
A new record for shortest lived Google product ?
For those of you who ca n’t remember the service , which would be 99.99 % of everyone reading this given how few people use Lively , here ’s a demo video of what it looks like

Many people when they wake up in the morning after they had a couple of drinks ( or more ) they experience the well - known hangover ( Dizziness , headache , fatigue , severe thirst , even shivering , sweating or nausea ) .
The best way to get rid of a hangover is to stay in bed and try to sleep until the suffering is over .
There are cases though that you have to go to work and must find ways to recover from a hangover quickly and effectively .
This article provides you with 11 ways on how to get rid of a hangover quickly .
Some facts about hangover
According to numerous surveys , the hangover is due to the metabolism of alcohol in our organism and depends on the age and ability of the body ’s enzymes to cope with it .
About 65 % of the people that consume alcohol do experience the hangover symptoms the next day .
One of the major differences between drinks is the content of methanol and complex organic molecules .
The concentration of these substances is generally high in dark liqueurs , and thus deemed to cause more unpleasant drunkenness .
Important role to play in this phenomenon are substances used to fraud drinks , for example the cheap vodka .
According to a survey published in the British Medical Journal , the drinks leading to the « worst drunkenness » are brandy , red wine , rum , whiskey , white wine , gin and vodka .
Some Basic rules to avoid the hangover
Before going out for a drink , a basic rule is not to start with an empty stomach .
Food is very important , as it can delay the absorption of alcohol in our body .
If you cannot find something to eat , a glass of milk is good enough for a substitute .
In any case do not rely on dried fruit or nuts that will bring you to accompany your drink , because nuts will certainly trouble your stomach .
Also , before leaving home , make sure that you are properly hydrated .
Drink a lot of fluids ( no alcohol ) because each glass of water or juice you consume before alcohol will prove to be double the next « difficult » morning .
Besides that alcohol is a diuretic and therefore you should replace the fluids in your body .
11 Ways on How to Get Rid of Hangover Quickly
1. Avoid it !
Because the best cure is prevention , you should remember the three basic rules to avoid the hangover .
First , never drink on an empty stomach .
Second , never mix different drinks .
Third , prefer special , more expensive spirits to cheap alcohol .
Unfortunately , although we are all aware of these tips we tend to forget them the critical moments .
If you are reading these post , most probably is too late …
Otherwise you would n’t have to read them !
2. Sleep , Sleep , Sleep
There are no secret recipes or homemade remedies in order to get rid of a hangover .
The best solution is : sleep .
Namely , wake up to realize how bad you feel , get out of the bed , drink two large glasses of water , and return back to sleep .
Repeat this process as many times as needed during the day .
If necessary , inform your boss that you are on a sick leave for the day , which is not very far from the truth .
3 . Drink a lot of water
If you are wondering about the above phrase « two large glasses of water » , this was done intentionally because we want to emphasize that the main cause of the devastating symptoms of the next day is basically the dehydration caused by the volume of alcohol in the body .
To prevent dehydration , drink plenty of water between drinks - ideal is two glasses of water for every glass of alcohol .
To cure and get rid of the hangover drink plenty of water during the day , before feeling really thirsty .
The feeling of thirst is in essence , the alarm of our body to notify us that it is dehydrated .
It is suggested to drink two large glasses of water before we go to bed , after a night that we have consumed a lot of alcohol .
4. Aspirin , Fresh fruits and Vegetables
For better results you can accompany your glasses of water with an aspirin that can help you prevent and cure the headache caused from hangover .
Also you can take a multivitamin or even better some fresh fruits and vegetables in the morning or before sleep .
This will replace the vitamins and minerals that the body has lost and will accelerate the recovery .
Particularly beneficial is the tomato juice or orange , which is rich in vitamin B .
5 . Take advantage of the benefits of exercise
Do not underestimate the benefits of exercise .
As difficult as it seems to you to get up from the couch or go to the gym after work where the only thing you want is to go home to sleep , a gentle exercise will stimulate and help you feel better faster .
This is because by exercising and through sweating , toxins that have accumulated in the body are eliminated .
Try to walk to the office , if not too far away , or try to walk for 5 or 10 minutes .
You can also do some light cycling or some mild exercises at the gym in the afternoon , always taking care to avoid exaggerations and to drink plenty of water .
6 . Watch your diet
You most probably heard sometimes that a full stomach would help the body to quickly eliminate the accumulated alcohol ; this statement is both true and false .
It is False if you eat dairy products and also food full of fat .
In such a case the results will probably be the opposite , as the mixing of these foods will not help your body to get rid of alcohol toxins .
On the contrary , this statement is True if you prefer balanced small meals at regular intervals , rich in fibber and carbohydrates .
The tomato is extremely popular among the ‘ victims ’ of a hangover .
A spaghetti sauce with fresh tomato - butter - free may help you to get rid of the hangover faster .
Also prefer foods rich in carbohydrates that provide energy , like white bread with honey .
7. Prefer Tea instead of coffee
Most people believe that a cup of coffee can improve the situation and help you get rid of a hangover quickly .
In reality this is another medical myth .
Coffee will not help you get rid of a hangover ; it is more likely to help in deteriorating the situation .
The caffeine stimulates the body , contributing to a temporary increase in the required amount of energy .
Theoretically , the same effect is caused by energy drinks , such as Lucozade or Red Bull , which most probably will disturb even more your already disturbed stomach with their carbonate ingredients .
The best solution to get rid of a hangover is tea with lemon or without , which brings about the same results with coffee but without worsening dehydration of the body .
Again , attention to exaggerations : one to two cups of tea is enough , more would deteriorate the situation as tea has diuretic properties - which is not good for a dehydrated body .
8 . If you are feeling nausea …
If your stomach causes you nausea then to get rid of it you can use an apple or a banana ( even better together ) stirred in a blender with some ice .
This full of vitamins drink may prove to be your « rescue » .
9 . Get rid of a hangover with alcohol !
This method is not proven by any means but some people who have tried it suggest it , and they say it works .
Basically what is suggested is to drink an alcohol drink ( only ONE ) when you wake up in the morning .
This is because Alcohol raises blood pressure and it will help you feel better .
If you are going to attempt this method , avoid carbonated drinks such as champagne and prefer something milder .
Extremely popular for breakfast the next day is Bloody Mary cocktail - vodka , tomato juice , pepper , salt and a little Tabasco .
10 . Fresh Air
Although you may feel very tired and probably with a headache , a walk in nature and fresh air will make you feel better .
This is because the oxygen will stimulate your brain functions that due to the drink will have fallen in « hibernation » .
11 . Take a hot bath
Apart body functions , excessive consumption of alcohol harms our skin as well .
A dip in the bathtub , after it is filled with hot water and plenty of shower gel , is far better to remove toxins .

The French say they need the largest condoms in Europe while Greeks get by on smaller ones , according to a Europe - wide study by a German consultancy that provides advice on condoms .
The study by the Singen - based Institute of Condom Consultancy was done by asking 10,500 men in 25 countries to measure their penis and enter the number into a database .
The results show Frenchmen on average claim to need 15.48 cm - long condoms , about 3 cm longer than Greeks , whose condom - size requirement was the most modest .
The institute 's director Jan Vinzenz Krause says the data was collected over a period of eight months .
He did not want to comment on how honest he thought the Frenchmen had been in reporting the data .
The survey was aimed at educating youngsters about the importance of effective contraception .
The institute also offers online condom - size advice and hosts Pimp Your Condom , an annual fair organised in cooperation with the national Aids Trust , with the aim of educating teens about sexually transmitted diseases .
Mr Krause was in the spotlight in the past when he produced a prototype of the ' spray - on condom , ' an aerosol can which contains latex that creates a perfectly fitting condom .
The idea was not developed further .

Leaves , Twigs , and Bark : Cheap Biofuel Alternatives ?
August 12th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
It seems like new reports are practically coming out daily about the next great gasoline alternative — furfural , algae , and switchgrass , just to name a few .
Now 3 more contenders have entered the ring : leaves , twigs , and bark .
Australia ’s Commonwealth Science and Research Organization ( CSIRO ) reports that lignocellulose , a component of plants and wood , could potentially be used as a cheap fuel — as inexpensive as $ 40 - 60 a barrel .
Even better , lignocellulose biofuels are compatible with current facilities .
All they need for conversion is an extra unit in front of any existing sugar biofuel facility .
And there are plenty of benefits of using lignocellulose instead of other types of biofuels .
Since plants , leaves and twigs are n’t food crops and require little input during their growth , they do n’t compete heavily for resources needed for foodstuffs .
To learn even more about second - generation biofuels such as lignocellulose , check out the CSIRO podcast .

Pirates have anchored a hijacked Saudi oil tanker off the Somali coast , as the spate of hijackings gathered pace with two more ships seized on Tuesday .
Vela International , operators of the Sirius Star , told the BBC no demands had yet been received from the pirates .
The company said earlier all 25 crew on board the supertanker were safe .
The biggest tanker ever hijacked , Sirius Star is carrying a cargo of 2 m barrels - a quarter of Saudi Arabia 's daily output - worth more than $ 100 m .
Two more ships were also taken in the Gulf of Aden , the narrow waterway to the north of the Somali coast .
The hijackings of the cargo ship and a fishing vessel bring the total number of vessels attacked by the pirates this year to 95 .
The 25 - crew cargo vessel transporting wheat to Iran was attacked early on Tuesday in the Gulf of Aden , while contact was lost with the crew of 12 on the fishing boat on Tuesday morning .
' Outrageous act ' Vela International said it was waiting for " further contact " from pirates aboard the Sirius Star , which was seized on Saturday 450 nautical miles ( 830 km ) off the Kenyan coast .
SOMALIA PIRACY 92 attacks this year - most in the Gulf of Aden 36 successful hijackings 14 ships currently held , including the MV Faina carrying tanks 268 crew held hostage Source : International Maritime Bureau , 2008
Q&A : Somalia piracy Rules frustrate anti-piracy efforts Technology sets sights on piracy Negotiations for the crew 's release could be costly and protracted , says BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner .
The pirates are a sophisticated group with contacts in Dubai and neighbouring countries , says the BBC Somali Service 's Yusuf Garaad .
Much of their ransom money from previous hijackings has been used to buy new boats and weapons as well as develop a network across the Horn of Africa , he adds .
There have been at least 90 attacks by Somali pirates this year and more than 200 crew are still being held for ransom along the Somali coast .
A South Korean - built vessel , that is about the length of a US aircraft carrier , the Sirius Star was heading for the US via the southern tip of Africa when it was hijacked in what Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al - Faisal condemned as " an outrageous act " .
The US Navy said the seizure was an " unprecedented " attack and confirmed that the tanker had anchored off the Somali coast near the town of Harardhere .
Response team Vela International said the crew consisted of two British , two Polish , one Croatian , one Saudi and 19 Philippine nationals .
The captain is a Pole , Poland 's foreign ministry confirmed .

Our security correspondent says that the hijacking was highly unusual because of the size of the ship involved and marks a major escalation in piracy .
The seizure points to the inability of a multi-national naval task force sent to the region earlier this year to stop Somali piracy , he adds .
The pirates are believed to have taken the tanker by surprise when they arrived on three fast small boats .
Shipping analysts have speculated that they may be using so - called " mother ships " from which to launch their attacks from far out to sea .
Commander Jane Campbell , of the US Navy 's 5th Fleet , told the BBC it had warned shipping companies that the US naval presence could " not be everywhere " .
" For that reason we have strongly encouraged proactive self - protection measures for the companies , " she added .

War - torn Somalia has not had an effective government since 1991 and the anarchy on land has spread to the high seas in recent years .
Hijackings off the coast of East Africa and the Gulf of Aden - an area of more than 1 m sq miles - make up one - third of all global piracy incidents this year , according the IMB .
They are usually resolved peacefully through negotiations for ransom .
Shipping companies are now weighing up the risks of using the short - cut route to Europe via the Suez canal .

“ YOU cannot overestimate , ” thundered psychiatrist Jeffrey Schwartz , “ how threatened the scientific establishment is by the fact that it now looks like the materialist paradigm is genuinely breaking down .
You ’re gonna hear a lot in the next calendar year about … how Darwin ’s explanation of how human intelligence arose is the only scientific way of doing it …
I ’m asking us as a world community to go out there and tell the scientific establishment , enough is enough !
Materialism needs to start fading away and non-materialist causation needs to be understood as part of natural reality . ”
His enthusiasm was met with much applause from …
After years of lax rules and wasteful practices that led to an economic disaster , fishery managers have decided to adopt a new approach to some of the West Coast ’s largest fisheries : give fishermen exclusive rights to a portion of the overall catch .
The Pacific Fishery Management Council voted unanimously Friday to make a historic shift in strategy that encourages cooperation , rather than competition , among fishermen who drag nets to catch cod , whiting , rockfish , flounder and sole .
The new approach , often called “ individual fishing quotas , ” will give commercial fishermen from Morro Bay on California ’s Central Coast to Puget Sound in Washington state the right to bring in their portion of the catch when the seas are safe and they can command higher prices .
It will also eliminate rules that forced fishermen to shovel tons of dead fish overboard because they did n’t have permits to sell particular species inadvertently caught in their nets .

Advocates of this approach , which has been used successfully in Alaska and elsewhere , believe that this can help turn around West Coast fisheries .
In January 2000 , the federal government formally declared these fisheries an economic disaster , the culmination of decades of overfishing .
Since then , managers have attempted to restrict catches and buy out fishing boats -- actions that brought only marginal recovery of fish stocks .
“ We expect in five to 10 years this will be one of the best - managed fisheries in the country , ” said Johanna Thomas , Pacific Ocean policy director of the Environmental Defense Fund .
The quota system will not be implemented until 2011 and must first be approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service , the government agency that regulates fisheries .
The federal government typically defers decisions about regulating commercial catches to regional fishery management councils , which are quasi - governmental organizations dominated by fishing interests .
The shift to individual fish quotas comes after recent scientific studies showing that the system has a way of encouraging fishermen to be better stewards of the resource .
It tends to end the dangerous race to catch fish before another boat does and has helped stocks rebound .

Still , such a program cannot work without government setting restrictions on overall catches , scientists say , nor can it attack another fundamental problem : too many boats chasing too few fish .
In most catch - share programs , the industry tends to consolidate into fewer vessels , as some fishermen sell their quotas to competitors and cash out of the business .
That anticipated contraction has led to objections by one fishing group that contended that it would turn fishermen into the equivalent of “ sharecroppers ” working for a plantation .
The new management plan also will allow the Nature Conservancy , which has bought a number of these fishing permits in Morro Bay and Half Moon Bay , to switch to a different type of fishing gear that is less destructive than dragging nets across the rocky seafloor .
Few commercial boats trawl the bottom for fish in Southern California waters because the stocks are so depleted .
It also adopts a different approach to cut down on the wasteful problem of “ bycatch , ” the accidental netting of species that are so overfished they are off limits to commercial fishermen .
The problem is that more than 80 species of bottom - dwelling rockfish , cod and other groundfish tend to mix together and can end up in the same net .
Advertisement
“ Right now , fishermen are forced to discard the overfished species , ” said Jim Seger , an economist with the Pacific fishery council .
Under the new program , federal observers would tally all fish and count the overfished species against quotas and limits .
“ Since they will be counted as dead , the fishermen could bring them in and sell them . ”

Omar Osama Bin Laden aterrizó ayer en el aeropuerto madrileño de Barajas junto a su mujer , la británica Zaina al Sabah , y con pasaporte de Arabia Saudí , según han informado fuentes consultadas por EL PAÍS .
Se bajó en la terminal 4 de un avión procedente de El Cairo ( Egipto ) que se dirigía a Casablanca ( Marruecos ) y hacía escala en Madrid y pidió asilo político a España .
El ministro de Interior , Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba , ha señalado hoy que su petición de asilo se resolverá en 72 horas , según informa la agencia Efe .
" Lo que se ha hecho ha sido aplicar la ley .
( Bin Laden ) está retenido en ( la sala de tránsito e inadmitidos de ) Barajas y se está examinando por parte de la comisión que tiene capacidad legal de decidir si está incurso o no en un supuesto de asilo , si corresponde o no darle asilo en nuestro país " , ha añadido .
Según la legislación internacional en materia de asilo y refugio , basada en la Convención de Ginebra , el hijo de Osama Bin Laden tendrá que demostrar " que su integridad física o su vida corren peligro " fuera de España para conseguir que la Administración le reconozca el asilo , según ha explicado hoy el Representante Especial en España del Alto Comisionado de la ONU para los Refugiados ( ACNUR ) , Agni Castro - Pita , que estudia el caso .
Bin Laden , de 28 años , se declara como el " hijo pacifista " del líder de la red terrorista Al Qaeda , Osama Bin Laden ( que tiene otros 18 vástagos ) , y repudia las actividades de su padre , con quien convivió durante 20 años en Sudán y Afganistán .
La Embajada británica en Egipto le denegó el asilo en abril para evitar " una considerable inquietud púiblica " .
Según Rubalcaba , " ha viajado por distintos países de Europa y tiene la residencia en El Cairo , en casa de unos amigos " .
Omar Bin Osama Bin Muhammad Bin Awad Bin Laden nació en Arabia Saudí , hijo del ahora terrorista más buscado y la siria Najwa Ghanem .
Estuvo durante 10 años con su padre en el exilio en Sudán y , posteriormente , vivió en Afganistán , donde hasta el año 2000 fue incluso entrenado en un campo de terroristas .
Cuando sucediron los ataques del 11 - S , el hijo de Bin Laden se encontraba en Arabia Saudí .
Se casó con Jane Felix - Browne , quien ya tiene tres hijos y cinco nietos , en Egipto en septiembre de 2006 .
Ambos se conocieron en dicho país cuando la mujer acudió a El Cairo para someterse a un tratamiento de esclerosis múltiple .
Fractals and math .
In the beginning , God created Math in his / her image .
And God said ,  Be fruitful and multiply and multiply and multiply 
Fractals are created using very simple mathematical equations .
The fractal I am most interested in is called the Mandelbrot Set and its equation is : z = z * z + c which is about as simple as you get .
These equations are usually referred to as dynamic equations where the output of the equation is fed back into the equation .
This is more commonly known as a feedback loop .
Nature works very much like this in that it is one big giant feedback loop .
For example the leaves from the trees fall to the ground and get fed back into the earth for the next generation of trees and plants .
All things in nature work this way , so its no surprise that mathematical equations using feedback can generate images that look so much like things in nature .
Self - similarity .
Despite its apparent solidity the Universe is a fractal .
A fractal is a self - similar pattern or series of patterns with infinite detail .
Self - similarity refers to the fact that the patterns repeat themselves within the system but they never repeat exactly .
For example , there are many , many galaxies in our Universe but no two are exactly the same .
Some look similar to each other ( self - similarity ) but you could search the whole Universe and definitely not find two with exactly the same details .
Our bodies are also self - similar with patterns repeating themselves on different levels .
The Chinese and Indian cultures have known this for years , mapping the whole body onto different parts of the body like feet , ears and eyes .
Acupuncture and reflexology ( to name a few ) are based on this theory .
The key is in the details .
The key to the fractal is in the details .
You can search the universe of a fractal ( each fractal is a universe unto itself since it is infinite ) and find the same pattern over and over again but when you look closely at the details you can see that they are quite different .
There are over 6 billion people on our planet and again , you will not find two people that are exactly the same .
Even identical twins and clones are not exactly the same when you look more closely at the details .
It is important to realize this because modern medicine treats everyone as if they are exactly the same instead of realizing that each individual is unique and must be treated differently .
The practitioner must take the time to know the patient in all the details before deciding on a treatment for an ailment .
This is the biggest mistake of modern medicine .
Fractal dimension .
Another important fact about fractals is that they exist between dimensions .
We are use to describing the universe in 2 , 3 and even 4 dimensions ( including time ) but what appears to be solid matter in the universe ( galaxies , stars , planets , trees and animals etc ) actually form and exist in the space referred to as the fractal dimension .
Fractal just means fraction  so a fractal dimension is really just a fractional dimension and would look something like  2.34784  or  3.48723  instead of exactly 2 - D or 3 - D. Each person has a unique fractal dimension and will respond to different fractal images in different ways .
Fractal healing .
Fractals can be seen in trees , rivers , clouds and all other natural objects .
Your own person ( body and mind ) is a fractal with patterns that repeat on every level of your being .
Fractal patterns can be used to restore yourself to the healthy beautiful creature that you really are .
A healthy body has all its fractal patterns intact on every level , mind , body and soul .
An unhealthy body is a body that has had its fractal pattern disrupted in some way causing things to change unexpectedly .
You can easily tell a diseased tree from a healthy one because it begins to lose its fractal pattern .
Because of the self - similar nature of fractals , it is possible to work on many levels simultaneously .
It has been proven that looking at pictures of nature can increase the healing process dramatically .
This is because nature is a fractal .
Looking at pictures of fractals has the same effect in generating healing energy and installing the healthy fractal pattern back into the body and soul .
The trick is to find the fractal that suits you best .
Meditating on a fractal image can be both relaxing and stimulating .
The images can trigger the natural fractal properties of our minds and bodies .
It is important to choose a fractal that is pleasing to you since this is more likely to be compatible with your fractal dimension .
Colour therapy and charkas .
Fractal therapy combined with colour therapy gives a strong and solid foundation for restoring your body and mind to its original and natural form .
Using colour therapy , you can increase the potency of the fractal image by triggering the specific charkas for whatever part of the body or mind you are trying to work on .
Reddit , like all social media websites , is serendipitous .
Few know what type of photograph , video or news bit is going to explode , and what 's going to fizzle .
And often times , content creators are n't the ones who ...
When Eickholt analyzed Flickr 's link referral page to make sense of his newfound prominence , Reddit.com topped the list .
What is Reddit , you ask ?
" This website talks about current events and stuff like that , I guess , " said Eickholt .
" I have no idea .
I 've never really been to those websites before . "
It was n't until after he received my e-mail , requesting an interview a few days after the photo 's popularity had run its course , that the 28 - year - old amateur photographer from Alberta , Canada , checked his Flickr account to find his new audience .
Eickholt says more than a hundred people added him to their lists of favorite Flickr users , meaning they 'll be notified every time he posts a new photo .
Before this week , he had two .
A photo of mountain goats scaling a cliff , featured on Roger Eickholt 's Flickr page , was all the rage on Monday .
It was plastered on social media sites and around the blogosphere , driving more than 200,000 people to view it .
... submit their own links -- they do n't discover that their photos had struck gold until later .
" It just seems so random , " Eickholt said .
" You never know what 's going to take off like that . "
Eickholt does n't even consider this among his best pictures .
" It 's interesting , I suppose , " he said .
" But it 's not photographically that great , you know .
It 's not technically great . "
Still , it attracted the attention of U.K. photographic press agency Rex Features .
Although he wo n't be receiving a paycheck , Eickholt is excited about the opportunity to see his photo and name published in magazines and newspapers .
Social media websites have a way of catching photographers off guard .
On Digg , the social media créme de la créme , about 16 % of all front - page items in the last 30 days were images .
That 's nearly a photo every hour .
Andreas Junus and Irawandhani Kamarga , art directors for a creative agency based in Indonesia , hit it big on Digg last week .
For their picture , called Real Life Photoshop , they recreated the interface of the professional image - editing software in their studio .
The project was done as a favor for their friend 's software company , which planned to use it to promote Photoshop CS4 .
They placed the photo on Kamarga 's Flickr page to show their work to friends .
But Digg and Reddit users took notice .
It 's now the seventh most - popular image of the last seven days on Digg , and it was featured on countless blogs , including Gizmodo and Wired .
" We never intended it to go viral really , " they wrote in an e-mail .
" It was for print and poster . "
Richard Peters ' Spring Lamb photo ( above left ) also hit Digg this week and racked up a whopping 120,000 hits to the Flickr page in the first two days after it was featured .
The self - taught photographer , who now shoots occasionally for a 24 - hour news channel in the U.K. , says the year - old image is by far his most popular .
It appeared in a U.K. newspaper 's " viral e-mail of the week " section and won the BBC's Countryfile 2007 competition .
Peters , 30 , was delighted with the photo 's recent resurgence .
" I kind of forgot all about it , " he said in an e-mail .
" It was fun to keep track of all the comments being made , and some of them really made me laugh , especially the ones that were negative for the sake of being negative . "
Lakshal " Lucky " Perera abhors Digg for that very reason .
The 27 - year - old from Wollongong , Australia , had his image , C is for Cookie , make the Digg home page earlier this week -- also without his prior knowledge .
For the picture , he shot himself , wearing a swimming cap , in his bathtub , and used Photoshop to duplicate hundreds of homemade cookies and render his body blue and hairy .
While he appreciates the attention paid to his disturbing recreation of a Sesame Street character , the staunch Reddit supporter cringed when browsing the Digg discourse .
" Digg is like YouTube , " Perera said in an e-mail .
" There 's some great content on there , but the experience is ruined for me by the inane and stupid commentary that so many users get involved in . "
Here is a sampling of a couple of the most - liked comments on that post : " OM NOM NOM NOM , " wrote one user .
" COOKIE MONSTER !!! " added another .
What 's not intellectual about that ?
But the fact of the matter is that websites such as Digg are providing a gateway for photographers to be seen by hundreds of thousands of people .
Where else can you find that kind of audience for a snapshot of a mountain goat ?

HYDERABAD , India , Nov. 8 ( UPI ) --
About 6,000 Muslim clerics from around India approved a fatwa against terrorism Saturday at a conference in Hyderabad .
Maulana Qari Mohammad Usman Mansoorpuri , president of the Jamaiat - Ulama - i- Hind , called terrorism the most serious problem facing Islam , The Hindu reported .
He blamed Islamic radicals for their actions and the news media for failing to distinguish between the radicals and the majority of Muslims .

" We have no love for offenders whichever religion they might belong to , " he said .
" Our concern is that innocents should not be targeted and the career of educated youth not ruined .
The government should ensure transparency in investigation . "
India has the world 's second - largest Muslim population after Indonesia , although Hindus outnumber Muslims .
The meeting was also expected to address issues like national integration .
" Islam rejects all kinds of unjust violence , breach of peace , bloodshed , murder and plunder and does not allow it in any form .
Cooperation should be done for the cause of good but not for committing sin or oppression , " the fatwa written at the Darul Uloom Deoband , India 's foremost Islamic seminary .
McCain has been absent 8 times this year for critical vote
[ Update : On Tuesday afternoon , the Senate passed H.R. 6049 by a tally of 93 - 2 . Senator John McCain , along with Senators Obama and Biden , did not record a vote on the tax credits . ]
The U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote as early as Tuesday , on the Baucus / Grassley Amendment to H.R. 6049 , legislation that would extend tax breaks for renewable energy production and energy - efficiency measures .
Negotiators hammered out the extensive tax package to continue investment credits for solar , wind , and geothermal energy .
It also creates a new tax credit for purchasers of plug - in hybrid vehicles .
>> More on Senate struggles with renewable energy at RG&B
The Senate version of the measure , would spend $ 17 billion on energy tax incentives over 10 years and pay for those incentives by limiting some oil and gas company deductions , altering tax treatment of certain foreign oil - related income and raising the per - barrel tax by four cents over three years .
The Senate bill contains an extension of the Production Tax Credit ( PTC ) for wind energy for an additional year .
Also up for consideration is an extension of the Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) , which has been the most significant federal incentive for small - scale rooftop solar .
If the Senate passes the bill , it will quickly move to the House of Representatives where it will be voted on later this week .
This could be that last opportunity this year for Congress to extend the tax credits .
Last December , McCain was the only senator who did not vote on a procedural motion that would have paved the way for an increase in taxes on oil and gas companies to pay for expanded incentives for alternative energy .
The motion failed by one vote .
McCain absence was especially astonishing considering he was already in Washington .
But McCain is not the only one to say one thing and do another when it comes to supporting renewable energy .
Members in both houses of Congress have made a habit of saying they are committed to renewable energy and turning around and voting against .
A recent piece by the folks at the Center for Public Integrity found that the pattern of that behavior was , in fact , quite striking .

Given my disposition , it 's strange I was never bothered by the whimsically optimistic tone of Advance Wars .
Maybe it 's the sociopath in me , but I did n't find it the least bit incongruous to whistle while plotting the extermination of my enemies .
I was deeply disturbed though by the turns of this latest installment : A meteor shower blots out the sun , choking off nearly all human life and leaving the few remaining survivors cloaked in shades of pastel .
But seriously , the Advance Wars franchise has consistently managed to create a serious gaming experience that does n't take itself too seriously .
Or perhaps saying that Advance Wars takes its audience seriously would be more accurate : every animation and cutscene is skippable ; menus and interface streamlined ; quicksaves are left to your discretion ; difficulty actually increases as you progress , optional hardcore levels are available , and mission grading is transparent .
So who cares if they have a terrible fashion sense and unhealthy fixation on adolescent boys ?
really guys , this is getting awkward .
If you accept this premise - that Intelligent Systems takes gamers seriously , not that they 're a bunch of creepy pederasts - then you 'll be intrigued but not surprised to see that Days of Ruin has improved upon Dual Strike 's single player campaign by giving you less toys rather than more .
Tag team is gone .
Two - screen levels are gone .
Those obnoxious kamikaze bomb units are gone .
CO upgrades are gone .
CO selection is gone !
CO powers remain , but their importance is greatly diminished .
The unlock store is gone , and extra maps have been integrated with the mission select map - a subtle change which actually went a long way in getting me to play them .
On the other side of the ledger , we get bike units that can move farther to capture cities but are otherwise rather pussy , and a flare unit for use in fog of war , which is even more vestigial than the bike .
We also get a pretty sweet anti-tank gun , temporary air and seaports that can repair but not build , and some different planes and boats and shit .
The only new gameplay tweak is that CO 's have a field of influence over other units , but of course this also means that where CO 's used to be able to jabber silly platitudes from the sidelines they now have to get in a tank and fight .
Their CO power bar only fills when they are personally involved in a skirmish , and if they get blown up the power bar resets .
Again , more constraints than Dual Strike , and better results .
Despite their obvious effort to add substance , Days of Ruin 's emo plot is just as abysmal as all the others .
But someone playing these games for the story would have to be at a 6th grade reading level ... or a 6th grader ...
mmmmmmmmm , 6th graders ...
If anyone ever actually read more than one page of this blog it would be readily apparent how undiscriminating I am when it comes to turn - based strategy games .
They 've been an obsession of mine since Warsong and Shining Force , and not even a summer of getting my ass kicked in chess by a bunch of unhygienic 12 - year olds at gifted kid camp could shake it .
As a responsible 8 - 6 man , they 're now the only thing separating me from those commuters that read those large folded inky things .
So it is from a place of authority that I say no tactics game has ever been as satisfying as any part of the Advance Wars series .
And that satisfaction comes not from sexy bells and whistles , but compehensive gameplay economy , which in turn could only come from a development team possessing great humility .
This is n't rocket science ; it 's a simple lesson , simply replicated .
So why are games designed like this so few and far between ?
Judge Paul Sacco says his unorthodox punishment of forcing noise ordinance violators to sit in a room and listen to music they do n't like has cut down on repeat offenders in the small prairie town of Fort Lupton , 25 miles north of Denver .
Brutal .
And to answer Wolf Blitzer ’s and Jack Cafferty ’s question as to whether we ’re going to see any interviews with Sarah Palin , no we wo n’t .
The McCain camp said today that until the media gives her a pass , they wo n’t let anyone interview her .
Nice .
So we all get to roll the dice and just guess whether she ’s qualified .
Extorting the media is n’t exactly “ maverick . ”
It ’s Bush :
[ McCain campaign chair Rick ]
Davis demurred when asked when Palin will sit for interviews with major news organizations , pointing out that now would not be the right time given the “ combative ” attitude the media has seemingly adopted toward Palin
Not to mention , was n’t it the McCain campaign recently whining about how many articles there are about Barack Obama , and how the media refuses to cover McCain ?
Now that the media wants to cover the McCain campaign , McCain and Palin are AWOL .
Actually , what ’s really going on here is that the McCain campaign is afraid to let Palin say anything after all the revelations about her this weekend .
Anyway , here ’s the Cafferty video :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h58sEq38oiw]
A Santa Claus was removed from his grotto after a woman complained that he asked if she wanted to sit on his lap , despite warnings about his behaviour by his helper elf .
Andrew Mondia , 32 , who says he was sacked from the central London Selfridges store after only three days on Monday , said : " I had no intention of offending her , I just wanted to include her in the moment .
Christmas is for adults too .
" I was just being my innocent usual self .
I was shocked when they told me .
I could n't believe I 've been sacked for being too friendly . "
Selfridges said all potential Santas were told during their training that no one should sit on their lap .
Mondia had also been warned by his helper elf several times that he should not ask clients to sit on his knee .
A spokesman said : " Unfortunately , this particular Santa did n't behave in line with his training . "
Mondia insists that during his one - day training , which was " a bit rushed " , he was told that if children wanted to sit on Santa 's knees they must be placed there by their parents , but at no point was he told that the action was forbidden .
Mondia , who at other points in his career has also posed as a box of Nesquik and a BlackBerry pearl mobile phone , had been due to work six days a week , at £ 9.75 an hour over the festive period , and would have earned about £ 2,500 .
He said .
" I 'm looking for other jobs but it 's going to ruin my Christmas . "
For decades , Claremont kindergartners have celebrated Thanksgiving by dressing up as pilgrims and Native Americans and sharing a feast .
But on Tuesday , when the youngsters meet for their turkey and songs , they wo n’t be wearing their hand - made bonnets , headdresses and fringed vests .
Parents in this quiet university town are sharply divided over what these construction - paper symbols represent :
A simple child ’s depiction of the traditional ( if not wholly accurate ) tale of two factions setting aside their differences to give thanks over a shared meal ?
Or a cartoonish stereotype that would never be allowed of other racial , ethnic or religious groups ?
“ It ’s demeaning , ” Michelle Raheja , the mother of a kindergartner at Condit Elementary School , wrote to her daughter ’s teacher .
“ I ’m sure you can appreciate the inappropriateness of asking children to dress up like slaves ( and kind slave masters ) , or Jews ( and friendly Nazis ) , or members of any other racial minority group who has struggled in our nation ’s history . ”
Raheja , whose mother is a Seneca , wrote the letter upon hearing of a four - decade district tradition , where kindergartners at Condit and Mountain View elementary schools take annual turns dressing up and visiting the other school for a Thanksgiving feast .
This year , the Mountain View children would have dressed as Native Americans and walked to Condit , whose students would have dressed as Pilgrims .
Advertisement
Raheja , an English professor at UC Riverside who specializes in Native American literature , said she met with teachers and administrators in hopes that the district could hold a public forum to discuss alternatives that celebrate thankfulness without “ dehumanizing ” her daughter ’s ancestry .
“ There is nothing to be served by dressing up as a racist stereotype , ” she said .
Last week , rumors began to circulate on both campuses that the district was planning to cancel the event , and infuriated parents argued over the matter at a heated school board meeting Thursday .
District Supt .
David Cash announced at the end of the meeting that the two schools had tentatively decided to hold the event without the costumes , and sent a memo to parents Friday confirming the decision .
Cash and the principals of Condit and Mountain View did not respond to interview requests .
Advertisement
But many parents , who are convinced the decision was made before the board meeting , accused administrators of bowing to political correctness .
Kathleen Lucas , a Condit parent who is of Choctaw heritage , said her son -- now a first - grader -- still wears the vest and feathered headband he made last year to celebrate the holiday .
“ My son was so proud , ” she said .
“ In his eyes , he thinks that ’s what it looks like to be Indian . ”
Among the costume supporters , there is a vein of suspicion that casts Raheja and others opposed to the costumes as agenda - driven elitists .
Of the handful of others who spoke with Raheja against the costumes at the board meeting , one teaches at the University of Redlands , one is an instructor at Riverside Community College , and one is a former Pitzer College professor .
Advertisement
Raheja is “ using those children as a political platform for herself and her ideas , ” Constance Garabedian said as her 5 - year - old Mountain View kindergartner happily practiced a song about Native Americans in the background .
“ I ’m not a professor and I ’m not a historian , but I can put the dots together . ”
The debate is far from over .
Some parents plan to send their children to school in costume Tuesday -- doubting that administrators will force them to take them off .
The following day , some plan to keep their children home , costing the district attendance funds to punish them for modifying the event .
“ She ’s not going to tell us what we can and cannot wear , ” said Dena Murphy , whose 5 - year - old son attends Mountain View .
“ We ’re tired of [ district officials ] cowing down to people .
It ’s not right . ”
But others hoped that tempers would calm over the long holiday weekend , and the community could come together to have a fruitful discussion about Thanksgiving and its meaning .

“ Its always a good thing to think about , critically , how we teach kids , even from very young ages , the message we want them to learn , and the respect for the diversity of the American experiences , ” said Jennifer Tilton , an assistant professor of race and ethnic studies at the University of Redlands and a Claremont parent who opposes the costumes .

James Kellaris , a marketing professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Business Administration , has done research on earworms and brain itch , and he 's found that as many as 99 percent of us have fallen prey to them at one time or another [ source : BBC News ] .
Kellaris says women , musicians and people who are neurotic , tired or stressed are most prone to earworm attacks .
With musicians , it makes sense because they 're listening to music continuously , but Kellaris is n't sure why women are more susceptible to earworms [ source : Prokhorov ] .
Researchers also are n't sure why some songs are more likely to get stuck in our heads than others , but everyone has their own tunes that drive them crazy .
Often the songs have a simple , upbeat melody ; catchy , repetitive lyrics ; and a surprise such as an extra beat or unusual rhythm -- the same factors that made the songs or jingles popular in the first place ( like the Chili's , " I want my baby back baby back baby back ribs " jingle , which made Kellaris ' list of the most insidiously " stuck " songs ) .

Most people ( 74 percent ) get caught up on songs with lyrics , but commercial jingles ( 15 percent ) and instrumental songs ( 11 percent ) can also be hard to shake [ source : DeNoon ] .
What makes us groan is cause for celebration to record companies and advertisers , who are thrilled when people can't get their songs and jingles out of their heads .
Contrary to popular belief , we do n't just repeat the songs we hate .
In one study done by researchers at Bucknell University , more than half of students who had songs stuck in their heads rated them as pleasant , and 30 % were neutral .
Only 15 % of the songs were considered unpleasant .
How to Get Songs Out of Your Head
Unfortunately , there 's no tried and true way to get songs out of your head once they 're stuck in there .
They can stick in your brain for anywhere from a few minutes to several days -- long enough to drive even the sanest person batty .
Most earworms eventually " crawl out " on their own , but if a song is nagging you to the brink of insanity , here are a few tips to try :
1 . Sing another song , or play another melody on an instrument .
2. Switch to an activity that keeps you busy , such as working out .
3. Listen to the song all the way through ( this works for some people ) .
4 . Turn on the radio or a CD to get your brain tuned in to another song .
5 . Share the song with a friend ( but do n't be surprised if the person become an ex-friend when he or she walks away humming the tune ) .
6 . Picture the earworm as a real creature crawling out of your head , and imagine stomping on it .
[ source : University of Cincinnati ]
Do n't worry if you keep getting songs stuck in your head -- it does n't mean there 's anything wrong with you .
However , if you actually hear music that is n't there ( instead of just thinking about it ) , see a psychologist or other mental health professional .
It could be a sign of endomusia -- an obsessive condition in which people hear music that is n't really playing .

Background
Bulk Rename Utility is an easy to use file rename program ( a.k.a. file renamer ) .
Renaming multiple files and / or multiple folders has never been easier !
It has a small memory footprint so it can be left running all the time without consuming all your memory .
It started as a freeware Visual Basic tool , but as its popularity has grown it has been completely rewritten in C++ to be robust and lightweight - and very , very fast !
It can easily handle folders / discs containing well over 100,000 entries ... and it can batch rename 1,000s of files in seconds .
The software gets downloaded very frequently .
It has a large base of regular users and an active User 's Forum .
Most of the features have originated from users ' suggestions .
As such , it is continually being enhanced and improved .
As well as being " recommended " by a number of web sites , Bulk Rename Utility has also appeared on many magazine cover - discs , from Brazil to Sweden .
Bulk Rename Utility is compatible with all versions of Windows , e.g. Windows 10 , 8 , 7 , Vista , XP , Windows Server 2019 , 2016 , 2012 , 2008 , 2003 , 2000 .
If you have a suggestion for a new feature , get in touch and it could appear in a future release of the software !
Brace yourself for plenty more days of record highs and lows .
Today was not one of the good days .
At $ 1.48 per euro , the dollar was down 2.6 percent , its steepest decline against the euro since Jan. , 2 , 2001 .
The dollar index was also down 2.6 percent .
It ’s hard to believe it was down to $ 1.38 barely more than 10 days ago .
While looking for improvements to injecting HTML fragments into a document ( which I mentioned , in passing , when I looked at using Document Fragments )
I decided to spend some more time with Internet Explorer ’s insertAdjacentHTML method .
This method has been in Internet Explorer since version 4.0 – as well as is in the current release of Opera – and allows you to inject fragments of well - formed HTML into a variety of locations in a document .
The locations work as such ( I list the equivalent terminology ) :
.insertAdjacentHTML( " beforeBegin " , ... ) before .insertAdjacentHTML( " afterBegin " , ... ) prepend .insertAdjacentHTML( " beforeEnd " , ... ) append .insertAdjacentHTML( " afterEnd " , ... ) after
The method is only available on DOM elements ( which makes sense ) and is easy to use :
var ul = document.getElementById( " list " ) ; ul.insertAdjacentHTML( " beforeEnd " , " < li > A new li on the list . </li > " ) ; ul.insertAdjacentHTML( " beforeEnd " , " < li> Another li !</li > " ) ;
At first glance the method appeared to work well and seemed to be relatively fast .
Two questions remained , though :
How fast is it in comparison to using the Document Fragment technique I outlined before and does it work for all the strange use - cases that exist ?
I created a test case to compare the three types of injection :
The type we ’ve been using in jQuery prior to the upcoming 1.3 release , the new Document Fragment technique we ’ll be using in jQuery 1.3 , and a case using insertAdjacentHTML ( where applicable ) .
While both the Document Fragment and insertAdjacentHTML cases were significantly faster than the old techniques used in jQuery the Document Fragment technique ended up being marginally faster in IE 6 ( 50 ms vs. 80 ms for insertAdjacentHTML ) .
There ’s a huge problem with insertAdjacentHTML :
It does n’t work on all HTML elements in IE 6 ( specifically it does n’t work on table , tbody , thead , or tr elements ) .
Having gaps in the functionality is very undesirable ( attempting to use insertAdjacentHTML on those elements causes an exception to pop up in IE 6 ) .
It does n’t work on XML documents .
Of course neither does innerHTML ( at least not until browsers start to implement HTML 5 more completely ) .
We ’re stuck doing the traditional techniques used in libraries like jQuery .
So why spend all this time talking about a method that is relatively half - baked in the main browser that implements it ?
Because it ’s going to be part of the HTML 5 specification .
This means that we ’re going to see a larger number of browsers start to implement this method ( and hopefully it ’ll encourage existing vendors to implement it more completely and efficiently ) .
Having browsers implement this method will dramatically reduce the amount of code needed to write a respectable JavaScript library .
I ’m looking forward to the day in which this method is more - widely available ( along with querySelectorAll ) so that we can really buckle down and do some serious code simplification .
Come on folks , say it in unison with us : " Finally ! "
At long last , a company with a little clout has stood up and questioned the necessity of those ridiculous hard plastic containers that hold minuscule flash cards and the like ( along with plastic twist - ties ) , and better still , it 's already doing something about it .
Beginning today , consumers who are tired of borrowing the fire department 's Jaws of Life to rescue their new USB drive can opt for products in Amazon 's " Frustration - Free Packaging , " which utilizes streamlined packaging that often includes recyclable cardboard .
19 products from the likes of Fisher - Price , Mattel , Microsoft and Transcend are currently available in the new containers , and the firm 's CEO has a vision of offering its " entire catalog of products in Frustration - Free Packaging " within a few years .
Hey , everyone else in the gadget world -- care to hop on a meaningful bandwagon for once ?

The Road to the New MacBook 2008 Event
Filed to : The Road to the New MacBook 2008 Event
New MacBooks , MacBook Pros , and probably an updated MacBook Air are coming up next week , at the Apple MacBook 2008 event .
The MacBook and MacBook Pro are long due for a case redesign but , beyond that , little is known for sure .
Here we have collected all the pieces of information we have about them .
All the facts , the logical rumors , and the crazy ones , which we will keep updating through the coming days until the MacBook Event liveblog kicks off .

The facts
• There 's an Apple event on October 14 and we will be there to liveblog the pants out of it .
Advertisement
• Long overdue , a new MacBook line will be unveiled , with newly - designed MacBooks and MacBook Pros .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
• Remember that Apple told resellers not to stock MacBooks or iPods ( this was just before the Let 's Rock announcement ) .
Advertisement
The logical and probable rumors
• The MacBook Air , being a recent design , will probably get a features bump , but not a redesign .
This could to be supported by price cuts during the summer .
Advertisement
• The new MacBooks may abandon Intel 's chipset - not the central processor , but the supporting circuitry - in favor of an Nvidia chipset .
Nvidia delayed the launch of their new laptop chipset to October 15 , which apparently provides faster built - in graphics and superior HD capabilities , after it was delayed from its original September 30 intro date .

• Despite the pretty mock ups , the MacBook and the MacBook Pro will probably look like the MacBook Air , but on a different scale .
In previous generations , there was always a new model that introduced a new look , then the rest followed up .

• Several images of the base top , the base bottom and the display frame of the MacBook Pro have surfaced .
It is still not clear if these images are real or not , even while they do look real indeed .

• Some people alleged that these images show a shell carved out of a single piece of aluminum , using a new and revolutionary manufacturing process code - named " Brick " .
Advertisement
• However , there are several reasons to believe this may not be the case , starting with an Apple patent detailing a new welding process .
However , both manufacturing techniques may have been combined for this product .
New MacBook Pro Rumor Control Earlier this week we reported on a rumor about a new " secret " manufacturing technology by Apple .…

• The MacBook in the teaser invitation may be the 13 - inch model .
Assuming the Apple logo is the same size as before , that is .
They have changed its size before .

• Following Apple 's commitment for greener computers , all displays in the upcoming MacBook line may be LED - based .

Crazy rumors and wishful thinking
• The usual blurry MacBook spyshots have appeared , some of which , like this one , have been proven to be fake .
Advertisement
• The glass iPhone trackpads are most probably just that , fake .
Advertisement
• Some crazy people really wish to see a touch notebook .
Advertisement
• There 's even more crazy people that think that a semi- transparent MacBook Pro may appear , based on an Apple patent .
Advertisement
• Some really really crazy people have been dreaming about tablet Macs since 2007 and before .
Maybe the whole brick thing really refers to the fabled " son of Newton " that every fanboy has been dreaming about since forever , the subnotebook - tablet .
After all , a pure tablet with no keyboard is really the only device that could be actually carved from a single piece of aluminum .
AARP Vote08 Video Release
In 2008 ARRP launched this website for the purpose of energizing its members to get out and vote in the presidential 2008 elections .
Once the election was over this site 's domain eventually expired .
When I discovered it was available I decided to buy it with the goal of recreating the content from its 2008 archived pages .
I added some additional information about ARRP from other sources .
You might wonder why I would recreate an old site 's content that is not necessarily relevant today , but I believe from an historical perspective this ARRP message should still be " findable " on the web .
It continues to resonate even today .
And the more ways that are available for people to discover ARRP the better .
You can reach their actual website by going to : https://join.aarp.org.
The cheeky video that was part of the 2008 election was hilarious , perhaps even provocative to some folks .
I remember the first time I saw it .
I was working as part of a custom application development team .
Our progressive software company had a client in the healthcare market place who required our services .
Because of their industry they were subjected to special regulations and a higher - than - usual expectation of security and privacy for their clients .
We were brought in to address their security concerns by developing customized software .
While we were taking a break , one of the company 's executive liaisons popped her head into the IT office and invited us to come take a look at a new video ARRP had just released on the internet .
While I was watching it , all I could think of was how my very conservative New England father would react if / when he saw this .
My mother has a great sense of humor , but my father is all about what is proper etiquette .
We all thought it was hilarious and would certainly make a memorable statement to that demographic .
Hopefully if you come across this website , it will bring a smile IF you recollect this ARRP campaign .
On Tuesday AARP launched an entertaining get - out - the vote campaign with an Internet video , which allows recipients to see their own names featured in campaign video , as well as on t- shirts and other paraphernalia as someone who can “ shake up Washington . ”
AARP believes it has found as way to energize potential voters .
Their message basically says by the way you vote YOU can break the gridlock in Washington .
Let ’s hope this will be a successful get - out - the vote campaign .
UPDATE : After the 2008 elections there was optimism that something would change in the halls of Congress .
Unfortunately , seven years later , the GOP is fractured from within and Washington is even more dysfunctional than it was in 2008 .
PRESS RELEASE
October 20 , 2008
Contact : Drew Nannis , AARP , 202-434-2560 anannis(at)aarp.org
Washington , DC – On October 21 , 2008 , AARP premiers a new component of their Get Out the Vote campaign .
In this cutting edge , online video it will be revealed whom the organization ’s pick is on November 4 , election day .
Millions of personalized , online videos will be sent by ARRP to its E-activists who will be the first to view the video .
The 60 - second video features a “ man on the street ” who turns around to face his fellow Americans in order to find out who will break the government ’s gridlock found in Congress .
The “ man on the street ” does not get the expected response .
Upon watching the video , each viewer will be asked to “ take action ” by making a pledge to vote on or before Election Day .
AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond said : “ We are coming down to the final few weeks of the campaign and we are seeing the number of undecided voters continuing to shrink .
We believe it is critically important that AARP do everything it can to make sure people stay excited about voting through Election Day .
What better way than to have some fun by emphasizing the importance of having leaders who are able to rise above the current partisan atmosphere and deliver on their promises ?
We have political coverage invading voters ’ lives 24 / 7 .
It is critical that voters do n’t become fatigued and overwhelmed by the bombardment of ads and events .
We want the American people to stay motivated and vote on November 4th .
Our fun video is just another way to help do that happens .
The video is just the latest effort made by ARRP .
In the weeks leading up to this video launch , AARP has released a collection of online and offline ( TV spots , radio , and flyers ) efforts to educate its supporters about the election .
ARRP has also distributed resources about early voting , a nationwide voter guide , and even opportunities to go to AARP ’s online community to discuss the presidential debates .

I was in Houston last week , and I found myself doing some remote tech support over the phone .
Everyone in the Houston office patiently waited for me to finish , but gave me the strangest look when I told my assistant back in Michigan , " You 're going to have to reboot Gonzo and Fozzie , because they need to mount Miss Piggy . "
Needless to say , out of context that conversation sounds a bit awkward .
Knowing my servers are all named after Muppet characters , however , makes it pretty clear that Miss Piggy is my file server , and Gonzo and Fozzie need to mount the /home directory .
The truth of the matter is , all my servers are named after Muppet characters , because I have a single Windows 2003 Terminal Server that I wanted to name Animal , since it would be my least stable machine .

Advertisement Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed in central Nigeria after Christians and Muslims clashed over the result of a local election .
A Muslim charity in the town of Jos says it collected more than 300 bodies , and fatalities are also expected among Christians .
There is no official confirmation yet , and figures are notoriously unreliable in Nigeria , says the BBC's Alex Last .
Police have imposed a 24 - hour curfew and the army is patrolling the streets .
They have been given orders to shoot on sight in an effort to quell hostilities that mark the worst clashes in the restive West African nation since 2004 .
For the second straight day on Saturday , angry mobs went through the town burning homes , churches and mosques .
The Nigerian Red Cross says at least 10,000 people have fled their homes .
Contested election
The mostly Christian - backed governing party , the People 's Democratic Party , was declared to have won the state elections in Plateau state , of which Jos is the capital city .
Security forces could be seen in the town
The result was contested by the opposition All Nigeria People 's Party , which has support from Muslims .
Violence started on Thursday night as groups of angry youths burnt tyres on the roads over reports of election rigging .
Bodies from the Muslim Hausa community were brought into the central mosque compound .
The local imam , Sheikh Khalid Abubakar , said more than 300 dead bodies were brought there on Saturday alone .
Those killed in the Christian community would probably be taken to the city morgue , raising the possibility that the total death toll could be much higher .
Police spokesman Bala Kassim said there were " many dead , " but could n't cite a firm number .
Despite the overnight curfew , groups in some areas took to the streets again as soon as police patrols had passed by .
Troubled past
In 2001 , more than 1,000 people died in religious clashes in the city , situated in Nigeria 's fertile " middle belt " that separates the Muslim north from the predominantly Christian south .
And in 2004 , a state of emergency was declared in Plateau state after more than 200 Muslims were killed in the town of Yelwa in attacks by Christian militia .
Correspondents say communal violence in Nigeria is complex , but it often boils down to competition for resources such as land between those that see themselves as indigenous versus the more recent settlers .
In Plateau , Christians are regarded as being indigenous and Hausa - speaking Muslims the settlers .

US state department officials said the pair were in " good shape " Two American journalists arrested for entering Syria illegally have been released into US custody , the US state department said .
Holli Chmela , 27 , and Taylor Luck , 23 , are now at the US embassy in Damascus and were said to be in " good shape " .
The pair were detained after trying to cross the border from Lebanon aided by smugglers , Syrian officials said .
They were reported missing by after they failed to return to Jordan last weekend from a holiday in Lebanon .
Their disappearance had prompted an appeal by the US embassy in Beirut The US embassy in Beirut said the pair , who have both reportedly worked for the Jordan Times in Amman , travelled to Lebanon on holiday on 29 September from Jordan , and had told a friend on 1 October that they were planning to travel to Tripoli that day .
They were then going to cross by land into Syria before returning - again by land - to Jordan on 4 October .
The alarm was raised by their families when they failed to return to Jordan at the weekend as expected .
Their disappearance prompted the US embassy in Beirut to appeal for information on their whereabouts .

It 's been a hard road for Microsoft 's Windows Vista , but even though negative perceptions have followed the operating system since its release , recent data and positive user feedback show a glimmer of hope for Microsoft that Vista 's ship is turning around .
Microsoft 's recent Security Intelligence Report shows that Windows Vista was more resistant to exploits than Windows XP in the first half of 2008 .
In addition , veteran Microsoft blogger Ed Bott recently ran some numbers and concluded that Vista has a security edge over Windows XP .
Another security report , from last month , by Jeff Jones , Security Strategy Director in the Microsoft Security Technology Unit , cites that Windows Vista was affected by 50 percent fewer vulnerabilities than other desktop operating systems in the first half of 2008 and had 19 percent fewer vulnerabilities than Windows XP SP2 in the same time period .
Security reports from Microsoft touting its own operating system have been met with endless debate over the metrics used to crown Vista the most secure operating system .
Nevertheless , some IT professionals contacted for this article who have upgraded or are upgrading to Vista point to the OS 's security as a major plus as compared to Windows XP .
( For the IT viewpoint from the other side , see our recent article " Why I'm Skipping Vista " ) .
Vista Offers Better Search , Better Security
" The two features of Vista that are significantly better than Windows XP are security and search , " says Scott Noles , Director of Technology and Education at Kinex Medical Center , a post- operation rehabilitation facility in Waukesha , Wis .
Kinex , an early adopter of Windows Vista , currently has it installed on 90 desktops , 22 laptops and is in the process of installing Vista on 170 tablet PCs .
Noles says the security features built into Vista 's Windows Security Center , including the notorious UAC ( User Account Control ) , have proved effective in protecting his users ' desktops .
" With Vista we can keep unwanted software and configurations out of our environment without needing third - party tools and with less effort than in previous versions of Windows . "
A big part of Noles ' job at Kinex Medical Center is making it easier to track and find patient data , and the search capabilities in Vista are more user - friendly and faster than those in XP , he says .
" Vista 's ability to find files , applications and pieces of data whether it is in e-mail , network shares or on the local computers has allowed our employees to be more efficient . "
Farther south , Jim Osteen , Assistant Director of IT for the City of Miami , is in the process of upgrading to Windows Vista .
Currently , Osteen has Vista installed on 100 workstations , with a goal of 900 workstation installations by September , 2009 .
Osteen agrees that Vista 's search and security features exceed XP's , adding that he believes Microsoft 's response times to new security threats in Vista are the best in the industry .
The City of Miami's switch to Vista coincides with its move from a mainframe environment to a Windows Server environment and also a move to a centralized storage infrastructure , he says .
Vista 's data backup features can do automatic incremental data replication much better than XP , Osteen says .
" The replication model of XP was causing bottlenecks , " he added .
Osteen expects to save $ 80,000 in power savings through the use of Vista 's GPOs ( group policy objects ) , which enable quick transitions between a computer 's active and sleeping states .
" Windows Vista has improved sleep mode ; with XP , we were always turning computers on , wasting energy and money , " he says .
Vista Not Perfect , But We Can't Wait Two Years
Noles and Osteen are not immune to the negative perceptions about Windows Vista .
But both attribute most of the negativity to lack of education and testing by users .
With any operating system , Noles says , there are good items and bad items , and the key for businesses is to do complete testing to see if an OS is a good match .
" When we participated in the Vista beta program we tested the operating system in all areas of our business , " Noles says .
" We were not listening to the press , but testing to make up our own minds whether we wanted to move forward with it .
From testing we determined that Vista would be effective in our environment . "
Not that Vista has been perfect for either Noles or Osteen .
Both have had driver compatibility problems and are disappointed in how long it has taken third - party vendors to release software and hardware that works effectively with Vista .
But Osteen notes that he has seen reliability and compatibility improvements since the release of Vista Service Pack 1 last February .
Did either of them consider skipping Vista and waiting for its successor , Windows 7 ?
A company can always wait for the next generation , Noles says , but in the end it will still have to change .
" Windows Vista is a complete architecture change , so migrating to it earlier will allow us to go to Windows 7 more effectively , " he says .
" We will have some of the growing pains out of the way . "
Osteen adds : " Windows 7 seems like a service pack for Vista with a different interface .
Plus , we 're on a tight timeframe .
We can't wait two years for Windows 7 . "

A Bubble in Cygnus
Image Credit & Copyright : Keith Quattrocchi , Mel Helm
Explanation : Adrift in the rich star fields of the constellation Cygnus , this lovely , symmetric bubble nebula was only recently recognized and may not yet appear in astronomical catalogs .
In fact , amateur astronomer Dave Jurasevich identified it as a nebula on July 6 in his images of the complex Cygnus region that included the Crescent Nebula ( NGC 6888 ) .
He subsequently notified the International Astronomical Union .
Only eleven days later the same object was independently identified by Mel Helm at Sierra Remote Observatories , imaged by Keith Quattrocchi and Helm , and also submitted to the IAU as a potentially unknown nebula .
Their final composite image is seen here , including narrow - band image data that highlights the nebula 's delicate outlines .
What is the newly recognized bubble nebula ?
Like the Crescent Nebula itself , this cosmic bubble could be blown by winds from a massive Wolf - Rayet star , or it could be a spherically - shaped planetary nebula , a final phase in the life of a sun- like star .
The World According to Monsanto is an in - depth look at the domination of the agricultural industry from one of the world ’s most insidious and powerful companies .
A bold , brilliant film and a definite must - see for anyone who is interested in learning more about the multi-billion dollar , omni-powerful , and highly dangerous Monsanto .
French filmmaker Marie - Monique Robin spent some 20 years hearing about Monsanto before she set out to understand just what Monsanto was all about .
Robin posits that perhaps the company ’s past can shed some light on what the company is all about today .
Monsanto started out as one of the world ’s largest chemical companies and is responsible for the creation of Agent Orange ( used during the Vietnam War ) , Aspartame , Bovine Growth Hormone , Polystyrene , PCBs and GE crops ( genetically - engineered ) .
No other filmmaker has ever created such a compelling and damning case against Monsanto .
The only other individual to come close to exposing the ugly reality of Monsanto ’s contribution to the planet is the best - selling author Jeffrey Smith with his of Seeds of Deception book .
Monsanto ’s leading product is Roundup — the world ’s best selling herbicide for the last 30 years .
Monsanto is also the world ’s leader in biotechnology , with over 90 % of the genetically modified organisms grown on the planet belonging to them .
Most are modified to resist the application of Roundup technology
Roundup Ready Soy Beans account for 90 %
of all the soybeans grown in America .
When Roundup was introduced in 1974 , the success of the product was , in part , due to its claims of being biodegradable , and that the product ‘ leaves the soil clean ’ and is good for the environment .
Monsanto was twice found guilty of false advertising .
Monsanto has now removed the word biodegradable from its labels .
Monsanto ’s PCBs also have a lethal legacy .
Robin interviews individuals in Pennsylvania who suffered serious health affects from Monsanto ’s PCB production plant .
In 2001 , 20,000 residents filed two lawsuits against Monsanto seeking compensation for the negative effects of the PCBs .
Monsanto settled by paying $ 700 million dollars to build a special hospital , compensate the victims , and clean up the contaminated site .
David Carpenter , the foremost expert on PCBs explains how the entire world is now contaminated with PCBs .
“ They have gone into the water and into the air . ”
70 % of the food in American stores contain
bio -engineered elements .
Monsanto ’s GMOs , perhaps the products that are causing the most concern with activists around the globe , were only introduced in 1996 when their Roundup Ready Soybeans were approved for use in the USA .
Today , less than 12 years later , Roundup Ready Soybeans account for 90 % of all the soybeans grown in American .
70 % of the food in American stores contain bio-engineered elements .
There is no labelling of genetically modified foods in the USA .
Monsanto also created the controversial Bovine Growth Hormone ( rBHG ) , which is a transgenetic hormone injected into cows to increase milk yield .
Monsanto was involved in a major bribery scandal in Canada over their attempts to bribe Health Canada workers into suppressing rBHG data .
Eventually , Canada did not approve the drug for use in Canada .
The European Parliament has disapproved its use .
Marie - Monique Robin has left no stone unturned in the Monsanto story .
She interviews every authority on the subject ( both pro and anti-Monsanto ) , traces American policy - making that allowed Monsanto to prosper and shows how many individuals who have worked to approve the technology at a government level have long ties with the company .
A riveting look at the world ’s most frightening company .
May 7 , 2007  --
An all - female law firm is turning heads in Chicago with a new billboard and a blunt message :
" Life 's Short .
Get a Divorce . ''
The billboard , sponsored by Fetman , Garland & Associates , Ltd. , a firm that specializes in divorce cases , features the six - pack abs of a headless male torso and tanned female cleavage heaving forth from a black lace bra .
The ad is the brainchild of Corri Fetman , who told ABC News ' Law & Justice Unit , " Law firm advertising is boring … Everything 's always the same .
It 's lawyers in libraries with a suit on and the law books behind them .
They do n't say anything .
What , I should hire you because you have a law degree ?
C'mon .
So we wanted to try something different . "
Reaction from those who work in and around Chicago 's divorce courts has been less than enthusiastic .
" It 's grotesque , '' said John Ducanto , past president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers .
" It 's totally undignified and offensive . "
" It trivializes divorce and I think it 's absolutely disgusting , " Rick Tivers , a clinical social worker at the Center for Divorce Recovery in Chicago , told ABC News .
" Divorce is traumatic enough without this kind of [ advertising ] .
We try and help people go through the divorce process with as much integrity as possible .
A lot of my work is helping people grieve the loss of a divorce , and their own sense of betrayal .
This makes divorce seem like it's not a big deal , and it 's a huge deal for many people . ''
Ducanto called on the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Committee of Supreme Court of Illinois to sanction Fetman .
" I do n't think they 'll just let this pass , '' said Ducanto , who seemed genuinely hurt by the ad .
" I have been in practice for 52 years , and I 've worked my ass off to change the image of this particular area of the legal practice , and to see some punk try and pervert the whole image in the interest of lucre .
…
Sure , she 's got a lot of attention , but it 's like a guy who spits on a table — you got the attention , sure , but what kind of attention is it ? "
But the ARDC 's deputy administrator James Grogan told ABC News that traditionally Illinois has been reluctant to sanction lawyers for anything short of false or misleading advertising .
Recently , Grogan said , the commission took action against a lawyer who was advertising on local ethnic radio .
" The radio spot had the sounds of jungle noises and then a voiceover in Polish saying , ' I am the lion of the courtroom ! ' ''
Complaints began to flood in when potential clients realized the truth behind the lion 's roar .
" The guy had never tried a case in court before , '' Grogan said .
One of the genuine lions of the American divorce courts -- New York 's Raoul Felder -- said the ad was a new low for the profession .
" This has to be the Academy Award of bad taste , '' Felder told ABC News .
Fetman is " not your run - of - the - mill Perry Mason lawyer , '' he opined .
" Hell , that 's not even ' L.A. Law . '
It 's bizarre , '' he said .
" I do n't think anybody walks away from that ad thinking more of the legal profession that they did before they saw it . ''
Karen Enright , president - elect of the Women 's Bar of Illinois , shared similar feelings .
" It 's actually a disappointment to the profession and to the institution of marriage , which is something our community holds as sacred , '' she said .
" Our profession , and lawyers in general , have been under attack for advertisements similar to this and I think , '' she said , pausing .
" I think that it 's not in good taste . ''
But Fetman defends the billboard , almost gleefully .
Recycling popular catch phrases seems to come naturally to her .
" Lawyers do n't cause divorces .
People cause divorces , '' she said .
" If you think somebody 's going to look at a billboard and go out and get a divorce as a result , you 're insulting the intelligence of people .
If that 's the case , our next billboard is going to read , ' Gimme Your Money . ' "
The placement of the billboard -- first reported by the Chicago Sun -Times -- is interesting .
It peers down into an area of Rush Street known as the " Viagra Triangle " for its three , trendy singles bars in an affluent section of Chicago known as the " Gold Coast . ''
" Everybody 's got a pretty good sense of humor in this neighborhood , '' said Greg Horan , director of operations for Gibson 's Steakhouse , one of the three restaurant / bars in the triangle .
The billboard is perched on a parking garage behind the restaurant .
" We do n't endorse it or anything , but sure , people will look up and get a chuckle out of it . ''
As far as Fetman is concerned , it 's a lighthearted splash of color in an otherwise dreary area of legal advertisement .
" It promotes happiness , '' she said .
" It promotes happiness and personal integrity . "
And happiness may be something that Fetman , a divorcee , is seeking herself .
" By the way , the male body on the billboard ?
That 's my personal trainer , Chuck Sanow , " Fetman told ABC News , her girlish voice rising just so .
" He 's a Chicago firefighter and he owns a gym . "
November 2008
One of the differences between big companies and startups is that big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves against mistakes .
A startup walks like a toddler , bashing into things and falling over all the time .
A big company is more deliberate .
The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of learning , based on disasters that have happened to it or others like it .
After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt and fails to deliver , for example , a company might require all suppliers to prove they 're solvent before submitting bids .
As companies grow they invariably get more such checks , either in response to disasters they 've suffered , or ( probably more often ) by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs for protecting against new types of disasters .
It 's natural for organizations to learn from mistakes .
The problem is , people who propose new checks almost never consider that the check itself has a cost .
Every check has a cost .
For example , consider the case of making suppliers verify their solvency .
Surely that 's mere prudence ?
But in fact it could have substantial costs .
There 's obviously the direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check proofs of the supplier 's solvency .
But the real costs are the ones you never hear about : the company that would be the best supplier , but does n't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified .
Or the company that would be the best supplier , but falls just short of the threshold for solvency — which will of course have been set on the high side , since there is no apparent cost of increasing it .
Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check , they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost .
No matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it , this meta - check would at least remind everyone there had to be a cost , and send them looking for it .
If companies started doing that , they 'd find some surprises .
Joel Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to corporate customers .
He said that in most companies software costing up to about $ 1000 could be bought by individual managers without any additional approvals .
Above that threshold , software purchases generally had to be approved by a committee .
But babysitting this process was so expensive for software vendors that it did n't make sense to charge less than $ 50,000 .
Which means if you 're making something you might otherwise have charged $ 5000 for , you have to sell it for $ 50,000 instead .
The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the company does n't waste money .
And yet the result is that the company pays 10 times as much .
Checks on purchases will always be expensive , because the harder it is to sell something to you , the more it has to cost .
And not merely linearly , either .
If you 're hard enough to sell to , the people who are best at making things do n't want to bother .
The only people who will sell to you are companies that specialize in selling to you .
Then you 've sunk to a whole new level of inefficiency .
Market mechanisms no longer protect you , because the good suppliers are no longer in the market .
Such things happen constantly to the biggest organizations of all , governments .
But checks instituted by governments can cause much worse problems than merely overpaying .
Checks instituted by governments can cripple a country 's whole economy .
Up till about 1400 , China was richer and more technologically advanced than Europe .
One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese government restricted long trading voyages .
So it was left to the Europeans to explore and eventually to dominate the rest of the world , including China .
In more recent times , Sarbanes - Oxley has practically destroyed the US IPO market .
That was n't the intention of the legislators who wrote it .
They just wanted to add a few more checks on public companies .
But they forgot to consider the cost .
They forgot that companies about to go public are usually rather stretched , and that the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from being public at all .
Once you start to think about the cost of checks , you can start to ask other interesting questions .
Is the cost increasing or decreasing ?
Is it higher in some areas than others ?
Where does it increase discontinuously ?
If large organizations started to ask questions like that , they 'd learn some frightening things .
I think the cost of checks may actually be increasing .
The reason is that software plays an increasingly important role in companies , and the people who write software are particularly harmed by checks .
Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best ones actually prefer to work hard .
This does n't seem to be the case in most types of work .
When I worked in fast food , we did n't prefer the busy times .
And when I used to mow lawns , I definitely did n't prefer it when the grass was long after a week of rain .
Programmers , though , like it better when they write more code .
Or more precisely , when they release more code .
Programmers like to make a difference .
Good ones , anyway .
For good programmers , one of the best things about working for a startup is that there are few checks on releases .
In true startups , there are no external checks at all .
If you have an idea for a new feature in the morning , you can write it and push it to the production servers before lunch .
And when you can do that , you have more ideas .
At big companies , software has to go through various approvals before it can be launched .
And the cost of doing this can be enormous — in fact , discontinuous .
I was talking recently to a group of three programmers whose startup had been acquired a few years before by a big company .
When they 'd been independent , they could release changes instantly .
Now , they said , the absolute fastest they could get code released on the production servers was two weeks .
This did n't merely make them less productive .
It made them hate working for the acquirer .
Here 's a sign of how much programmers like to be able to work hard : these guys would have paid to be able to release code immediately , the way they used to .
I asked them if they 'd trade 10 % of the acquisition price for the ability to release code immediately , and all three instantly said yes .
Then I asked what was the maximum percentage of the acquisition price they 'd trade for it .
They said they did n't want to think about it , because they did n't want to know how high they 'd go , but I got the impression it might be as much as half .
They'd have sacrificed hundreds of thousands of dollars , perhaps millions , just to be able to deliver more software to users .
And you know what ?
It would have been perfectly safe to let them .
In fact , the acquirer would have been better off ; not only would n't these guys have broken anything , they'd have gotten a lot more done .
So the acquirer is in fact getting worse performance at greater cost .
Just like the committee approving software purchases .
And just as the greatest danger of being hard to sell to is not that you overpay but that the best suppliers wo n't even sell to you , the greatest danger of applying too many checks to your programmers is not that you 'll make them unproductive , but that good programmers wo n't even want to work for you .
Steve Jobs 's famous maxim " artists ship " works both ways .
Artists are n't merely capable of shipping .
They insist on it .
So if you do n't let people ship , you wo n't have any artists .
Mildred and Albert Swanson have been arrested in Finley , Alabama due to complete idiocy and bad judgement .
The District Attorney agreed that although there is no law that states someone can be arrested for bad judgement these two need to be behind bars at the least to save their son from years of therapy .
In what has to be the stupidest idea for a Halloween costume the Swanson 's thought it would be funny to dress there son up as a terrorist :
People throughout the community are shocked and for the child 's sake the parents will be prosecuted .
As part of their punishment all of the candy in their home will be given away on October 31st .
Do to disbelief no more will be written about this incident .

The press see this meeting as a significant moment Commentators in the Chinese and Hong Kong press view the visit to Taipei of China 's top official Chen Yunlin as a significant step forward for cross -strait relations and China 's image in the world .
Taipei and Hong Kong papers wonder how the Chinese representative will address the Taiwanese leader .
An earlier report had suggested he would not use the title of " president " .
Two Hong Kong papers urge him to be " magnanimous " in his choice of language .
Some pro-independence sections of the Taiwanese press condemn the visit , seeing it as a betrayal of their cause .
However other Taiwanese commentators urge pragmatism , with one paper saying independence is not likely to happen soon .
CHINA'S CHINA DAILY
Chen 's trip to Taiwan on behalf of the mainland for talks on cross-straits affairs is of guiding significance and represents another milestone in the history of the development of cross-straits relations .
CHINA'S XIN JING BAO Cross - strait relations have had a substantive breakthrough ...
The improvement of cross - strait relations is a good dispeller of the so - called " China threat " , and also a vivid display of China 's national image as a responsible power .
TAIWAN'S TAIPEI TIMES
The key question is whether Chen respects the feelings of Taiwanese and whether he will address Ma [ Ying - jeou ] as " president " .
TAIWAN'S CHINA TIMES Return as far as possible to the real axis of the Chiang - Chen talks and do not let a number of side issues blur the overall focus .
For example , the issue of Ma and Chen 's mutual " titles " .
HONG KONG'S APPLE DAILY
If Ma Ying - jeou¿ is not addressed by Chen Yunlin with the equivalent title of " President Ma " , this may disappoint mainstream public opinion in Taiwan ...
Beijing should have the magnanimity to genuinely respect popular sentiments in Taiwan .
HONG KONG'S MING PAO
What Chen Yunlin should do first is to recognise and accept the historical reality that the two sides of the strait have been divided for nearly 60 years .
His words and actions must also be extremely cautious and show the spirit of equality and mutual benefit in all respects .
He must make the people of Taiwan feel " respected " .
TAIWAN'S LIBERTY TIMES Under the Ma government 's arrangements , the Chiang - Chen meeting seems to have become a Kuomintang - CCP meeting in disguise , or even worse , a surrender ceremony to welcome the envoy of a suzerain state to Taiwan to sign a surrender treaty .
TAIWAN'S APPLE DAILY Realism is Taiwan 's only effective viewpoint , and we must face up to the reality of China 's existence and influence ...
Taiwan independence will be impossible to achieve for some time , and this cruel reality should be faced bravely .
HONG KONG'S SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST Unification is not going to come any time soon ; attaining this necessary goal is guaranteed to take considerable time .
No matter how lengthy the process is , though , every effort has to be made on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to make it as smooth as possible .

YOU do not need to travel far to find evidence of Russia 's demographic problems .
Just 250 km west of Moscow , in the Smolensk region , it is glaringly obvious .
Turn off the main road in the village of Semlevo and you will see rusting gates and derelict buildings .
Continue for a short distance on what just about resembles a road and you will see a new cowshed .
A third of the people working here are from Tajikistan .
Marina , a 38 - year old Russian milkmaid , is married to one of them .
Talib , she says , may be strict , but he does not drink or beat her up .
She prefers him to her first , Russian , husband who drank himself to death at the age of 47 , leaving her with three children .
Her 19 - year old son is unemployed and drinks heavily .
Talib came to Russia so that he can feed his other family in Tajikistan , and Marina does not mind Talib having another wife .
But local residents resent the Tajik and Uzbek migrants because “ they are prepared to work for a pittance and take our jobs . ”
Yet finding sober local working men in the village is difficult , says Sergei Pertsev , the farm manager .
“ Here , everyone has fallen ill with alcohol . ”
To make sure the farm functions properly Mr Pertsev keeps people in reserve , to fill in for those who go on a binge .
It used to be mainly men who drank , but now women do too .
Semlevo's collective farm was built in 1962 .
Since then the village 's population has dropped to a third of its former level .
Thirty years ago the village school had 500 pupils .
This year only one girl entered the first grade .
Some people have left the village , others have died of drink .
Those who remain drink heavily .
Still , by local standards , Semlevo , with its 900 residents , is a thriving metropolis .
Some nearby villages have just two or three people left .
Novosti
Rare and precious
Tatyana Nefedova , a geographer and specialist on Russian agriculture , calls these deserted areas “ Russia 's black hole ” .
In the European part of the country alone they account for one - third of the land mass .
Urbanisation has drawn people from villages into larger cities and to the vast industrial building sites in the east and north of the country .
Active life is concentrated in a radius of 35 - 40 km from the centre of these large cities .
Russia has only 168 cities with a population over 100,000 and their number is dropping .
The average distance between large cities is 185 km .
According to Ms Nefedova , this means that a stretch of 100 km between them is a social and economic desert .
In villages closer to large cities , especially Moscow and St Petersburg , or in the south of the country , things are better .
But for Mr Pertsev , the idea that Russia is “ rising from its knees ” seems like a bad joke .
Two years ago he lost his son , who was in the army .
The young man was killed by a drunk driver who crashed into a column of soldiers in the dark .
“ The only people who live well in this country are those who make decisions , sit on an [ oil ] pipe or those who guard it , ” says Mr Pertsev .
The sorry state of villages like Semlevo is the result of “ negative social selection ” , says Ms Nefedova : the most active and able people have migrated to large towns .
Few people have stayed behind , and most of those are unable to work .
In Semlevo there is only one farmer who keeps his own sheep and chickens .
Most houses there have no running water , plumbing or gas heating .
Still , Semlevo's old collective farm is considered lucky : it was recently bought by a businesswoman from Moscow .
Most other collective farms in this district are dead .
Russia 's demography befits a country at war .
The population of 142m is shrinking by 700,000 people a year .
By 2050 it could be down to 100m .
The death rate is double the average for developed countries .
The life expectancy of Russian males , at just 60 years , is one of the lowest in the world .
Only half of Russian boys now aged 16 can expect to live to 60 , much the same as at the end of the 19th century .
No babies to kiss
“ If this trend continues , the survival of the nation will be under threat , ” Mr Putin said in his first state - of - the - nation address in 2000 .
Six years later he offered an increase in child support and a bonus for second babies .
Since then the birth rate has started to climb , the number of deaths has declined and life expectancy has edged up a little ( see chart 5 ) .
Mr Putin rejoiced : “ We have overcome the trend of rising deaths and falling births …
In the next three to four years we can stabilise the population figures . ”
But demographers say there are few grounds for optimism , and Russia 's goal of increasing the population to 145 m is unattainable .
Anatoly Vishnevsky , Russia 's leading demographer , says an increase in the number of births in a single year does not reverse a trend .
People may respond to financial incentives by changing their timing rather than having more babies overall .
An extra $ 100 a month is helpful to people with low incomes and rural or Muslim families , who have more children anyway , but is unlikely to persuade middle - class families to produce more babies .
The main reason for the recent rise is that there was an uptick in the birth rate in the 1980s and the people born during that period are now having children themselves .
But the next generation to reach child - bearing age is much smaller .
“ What we are going to see over the next few years is a rapid decline in the number of births , ” says Mr Vishnevsky .
At the same time the death rate is likely to go up , not because people will die any earlier but because the generation which is getting to the end of its life now is larger than the one born during the war .
Russia 's demographic crisis is one of the main constraints on the country 's economy .
Although Russia 's population has been ageing , over the past decade the country has enjoyed a “ demographic dividend ” because the age structure was in its favour .
This dividend has now been exhausted and the population of working age will decline by about 1 m a year , increasing the social burden on those that remain .
Over the next seven years Russia 's labour force will shrink by 8 m , and by 2025 it may be 18 m - 19 m down on the present figure of 90m .
What makes a shrinking population dangerous for a country that has always defined itself by its external borders is the loss of energy it entails , Mr Vishnevsky argues .
The Soviet Union did not just try to exploit the resources of its vast and inhospitable land , it tried to populate it .
Now large swathes of land in Siberia and the far east are emptying out as people move to central Russia .
The population density in the country 's far east is 1.1 people per square kilometre .
On the other side of the border with China it is nearly 140 times that figure .
The decline in Russia 's population is often linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union .
In fact , the pattern was set back in the mid-1960s when the number of births fell below replacement level and life expectancy started to shrink .
In 1964 , after several years of post - Stalin thaw , life expectancy for men was 65.1 years , only slightly lower than in the West .
But by 1980 the gap with the West had widened to more than eight years and is now 15 years .
Russia 's health problems , says Mr Vishnevsky , were partly a legacy of the cold war .
By the middle of the 20th century the developed world had learnt to control infections that killed large numbers of people .
The next targets were illnesses caused by lifestyle , such as heart attacks , pollution and respiratory diseases .
But whereas the West invested heavily in health - care systems and better lifestyles , Russia was putting its financial and human capital into the arms race and industrialisation .
If life expectancy in Russia had improved at the same pace as in the West , the country would have had an extra 14.2 m people between 1966 and 2000 , adding 10 % to the population .
The Soviet Union 's spending on health care was less than a quarter of the American figure .
The Communist Party elite was well looked after , but ordinary people were less fortunate .
Crucially , the paternalistic Soviet system , which survives in today 's Russia , was geared towards fighting epidemics and infections rather than to empowering people to look after their own health .
Even now Russian doctors treat patients and their relatives like imbeciles .
Officially the state guarantees free care for all , but half the patients offer gifts and money to doctors and the other half often have to forgo necessary treatment .
Boosting the country 's health - care spending was one of the “ national projects ” Mr Medvedev was in charge of before becoming president .
Last year its funding doubled to 143 billion roubles ( $ 5.8 billion ) .
That is still below Western standards , but the main problem is that it is not well spent .
For example , the government more than doubled general practitioners ' pay .
But as Sergei Shishkin of the Independent Institute for Social Policy argues , the pay increase was not linked to performance and created a sense of injustice among specialists .
The curse of the bottle
Russian history , particularly in the 20th century , has encouraged the view that life is cheap .
But there is also a strong self - destructive streak in the national character .
Drinking yourself to death is one of the most widely used methods of suicide .
Alexander Nemtsov , a senior researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry , points to a clear correlation between the death rate and the consumption of alcohol in Russia .
A short anti-alcohol campaign conducted by Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s extended life expectancy by three years .
Mr Nemtsov estimates that nearly 30 % of all male deaths and 17 % of female deaths are directly or indirectly caused by excess alcohol consumption and that over 400,000 people a year die needlessly from drink - related causes , ranging from heart disease to accidents , suicides and murders .
The average Russian gets through 15.2 litres of pure alcohol a year , twice as much as is thought to be compatible with good health .
The problem lies not just with how much but also with what is drunk : moonshine and “ dual - purpose ” liquids , such as perfume and windscreen wash , make up a significant proportion of alcohol consumption , according to Russia 's chief physician , Gennady Onishchenko .
Tens of thousands a year die of alcohol poisoning , against a few hundred in America .
In large cities the fear of losing a job , and growing car ownership , is keeping people soberer .
The most obvious reason why Russians drink so much is the low price and easy availability of alcohol .
Consumption increased dramatically in the 1960s when the state hugely boosted production .
People started drinking not just on special occasions but during the week and at work too .
Vodka is one of a very few Russian products that seem relatively immune to inflation .
Between 1990 and 2005 , for example , the food - price index increased almost four times faster than the alcohol - price index .
A cheap bottle of vodka in Russia costs the same as two cans of beer or two litres of milk .
The easiest way to curb consumption would be to make hard spirits much more expensive and less accessible , as many Nordic countries have done .
But as with many other things in Russia , corruption gets in the way : two - thirds of hard liquor is produced illegally and sold untaxed .
Occasionally the government raises the alarm about alcohol poisoning , but it does little to curb drinking .
Instead it has declared war on Georgian wine and mineral water , which it claims is not fit for consumption .
But life expectancy in Georgia remains 12 years higher than in Russia .
Unlike drinking , AIDS is a relatively new problem for Russia .
The first case of HIV was recorded in 1987 , but it took a long time for the country to take notice .
By 1997 the number of cases had grown to 7,000 .
Now the official figure is over 430,000 , the largest in Europe .
The real number could be double that , according to the World Health Organisation .
Most victims are under the age of 30 .
Some two - thirds are drug - takers , but the epidemic is now spreading to the general public .
The government seems to have woken up to the danger and has increased spending .
But Vadim Pokrovsky , head of the federal AIDS centre , says Russia still lacks adequate prevention measures .
About 28,000 people have already died of AIDS - related illnesses , but the real number could be masked by a co-infection of HIV and tuberculosis which kills people after two or three months .
The incidence of TB is the highest in Europe .
Last year 24,000 people died of the disease , almost 40 times as many as in America , not least because most TB hospitals are crumbling and some lack sewerage or running water .
The only solution to Russia 's demographic problems appears to be immigration , as in the village of Semlevo , but the Russian public is hostile to it .
Wanted but not welcomed
Most low - skilled migrant workers in Russia come from Central Asia .
In the east of the country they are mainly Chinese .
The precise figures are impossible to pin down because the vast majority of immigrants over the past decade have been illegal .
Until recently they were treated much like serfs .
They could not apply for work permits but had to rely on their employers , who would often impound their passports and refuse to pay them for their work .
Thousands of corrupt police officers grew fat on the proceeds .
Eyevine
A cheap way to oblivion
In the past couple of years the rules have become more accommodating and migrant workers can now apply for their own work permits and sign contracts with their employers .
But for tax reasons only a quarter of immigrants do so .
The new law has increased the number of legal migrants to more than 2 m , but the real figure is thought to be five times that .
Many migrants are scared to venture outside on their own for fear of running into police or skinheads .
Employers much prefer illegal immigrants to local workers because they are cheaper and will put up with worse conditions .
But a xenophobic public habitually vents its anger on the immigrants , even though they are estimated to generate 8 % of Russia 's GDP .
Support for extremist organisations such as the Movement Against Illegal Immigration has risen sharply in the past few years .
More than half the population supports the slogan “ Russia for the Russians ” and almost 40 % feel “ irritation , discomfort or fear ” towards migrants from Central Asia and Azerbaijan .
Hate crimes are on the rise .
SOVA , a body that monitors racism , last year counted 667 racist attacks , including 86 racially motivated murders .
At a recent pep talk with the editors of Russia 's leading media , Mr Putin urged them to guard against xenophobia .
Russia 's new day of unity is traditionally marked by ultra-nationalist marches , and the youth wing of Mr Putin 's own United Russia party campaigns against immigrants .
Dmitry Rogozin , a nationalist politician who built his campaign for parliament in 2003 on anti-immigrant rhetoric , is now Russia 's ambassador to NATO .
On his office wall hangs a portrait of Stalin .
Newswise — Feeling sleepy ?
That 's because parts of your brain are actually asleep , according to a new theoretical paper by sleep scientists at Washington State University .
Contrary to conventional wisdom , the researchers say , there 's no control center in your brain that dictates when it 's time for you to drift off to dreamland .
Instead , sleep creeps up on you as independent groups of brain cells become fatigued and switch into a sleep state even while you are still ( mostly ) awake .
Eventually , a threshold number of groups switch and you doze off .
Lead author James Krueger said the view of sleep as an " emergent property " explains familiar experiences that the top - down model does n't , such as sleepwalking , in which a person is able to navigate around objects while being unconscious , and sleep inertia , the sluggishness we feel upon waking up in the morning .
" If you explain it in terms of bits and pieces of the brain , instead of a top - down phenomenon , all of a sudden you can make sense of these things , " said Krueger .
" The old paradigm does n't even address these things . "
Krueger teamed with fellow neurobiologists David Rector , Hans Van Dongen , Gregory Belenky , Jaak Panksepp and electrical engineer Sandip Roy on the work .
Their paper , " Sleep as a fundamental property of neuronal assemblies , " will appear in the December issue of Nature Reviews / Neuroscience .
It is available online at http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nrn2521.html.
If sleep were being directed by a control center , the whole brain would respond at the same time , said Krueger .
Instead , it behaves like a self - directing orchestra in which most sections are more - or - less in sync , but a few race ahead or lag behind at any given time .
During sleepwalking , he said , the neuronal groups needed for balance are in a wake state while those needed for consciousness are in a sleep state .
Conversely , in sleep inertia , enough neuronal groups are in a wake state for you to be awake in a general sense , but some groups are still in a sleep state — enough to hamper your ability to perform tasks .
" Everybody has sleep inertia every morning , " said Krueger .
" It takes 30 minutes to an hour to recuperate from being asleep " and get all your neuronal groups up and running .
The authors drew on evidence from several lines of research to develop their hypothesis .
For example , a group of brain cells that work together to perform a certain function become less responsive and switch into a sleep - like state after the cells have been active for a long time .
The likelihood that a given group of cells will enter the sleep state is proportional to how long it has been " awake " and how active it has been — in other words , how hard it has been working .
Also , while you are awake , the cerebrospinal fluid bathing your brain accumulates proteins called Sleep Regulatory Substances , or SRSs .
When the level of SRSs gets high enough , you go to sleep .
Putting a drop of an SRS onto a neuronal group causes that group to enter the sleep state , showing that sleep can occur in a group of a few hundred cells without affecting the rest of the brain .
Sleep researchers have long wondered how neuronal activity , which is measured in milliseconds , interacts with SRSs , which persist for hours or days .
How do they coordinate to produce a coherent sleep response ?
The authors cited numerous studies showing that when neurons transmit electrical signals to each other , they also release ATP , a small chemical best known as an energy source for cells .
The ATP causes cells called glia to produce SRSs , which in turn enter nearby neurons and activate a cascade of other chemicals that affect how the neurons respond to neurotransmitters .
" It 's a long - term change in sensitivity , " in the range of hours , said Krueger .
" You 've got to think in terms of hundreds of these operating simultaneously in a network .
If you 're changing the sensitivity of the [ neuron ] , and you have the same input coming into the cell , what happens ?
You 've got a different output in the network for the same input .
And that , by definition , is a state shift .
So now we 've got a complete mechanism " connecting neuronal activity , the production of Sleep Regulatory Substances and the occurrence of sleep .
As a final piece of the puzzle , co-author Sandip Roy developed a mathematical model accounting for the experimental finding that when one neuronal group goes into a sleep - like state , neighboring groups become more likely to do so .
The same happens when a sleeping group returns to wakefulness ; its communications with its neighbors prompt them to " wake up " as well .
The model showed that as communication among groups spreads , it can lead to the global synchronization that causes the whole animal to go to sleep .
Krueger said such behavior is typical of all sorts of coordinated networks of functional units that operate mostly independently .
" Whether it 's an engineered system or whether it 's fireflies glowing on a summer 's evening , they tend to synchronize , " he said .
Krueger added that the classic brain " sleep centers " still have a role in the new paradigm .
They coordinate the sleep - like and waking - like states of neuronal groups to help the organism adapt to its surroundings ( such as whether it 's light or dark out ) and achieve peak performance .
The paper 's authors research many major aspects of sleep biology .
Krueger studies the biochemistry of sleep ; Rector explores the connections between neuronal activity and sleep / wake cycles ; Van Dongen and Belenky study the relations between sleep and human performance ; Panksepp studies the mechanisms of instinctual emotional and motivational behaviors ; and Roy models network formation and coordination of action among independent units .

Tempted to buy an Apple iPhone for yourself or a loved one this Christmas ?
Impressed by its video playback , games , and touch screen technology ?
How about its speed ?
Well , the latter may not be as impressive as Apple has led consumers to believe .
According to reports , Apple has been forced to pull an advertisement airing in Britain that boasted the device 's extremely fast capabilities .
The ad in question showed an iPhone 3G transferring data " really fast " ; however , Britain 's Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) has deemed that spot misleading and has in turn banned the ad from airing in Britain in the future .
The ASA has demanded that it " must not appear again in its current form . "
In a statement , Apple defended the " really fast " claim by remarking that it was made in a very general manner , and that the new iPhone is in fact faster than the original EDGE - based iPhone .
In fact , the Cupertino - based firm remarked that the claims were " relative rather than absolute in nature . "
The company also pointed to the usual small print ; a disclaimer along with the ad admits that " network performance will vary by location . "
( Source : arstechnica.com )
The ASA was n't buying the excuses , however .
Citing some seventeen consumer complaints over the ad , it went ahead with banning the advertisement until a more realistic portrayal of the device 's capabilities can be made .
Despite the disclaimer and Apple 's plea that speed claims were made speaking relatively , the ASA determined that too many consumers " might not be fully aware of the technical differences between the different types of technology . "
( Source : guardian.co.uk )
Indeed , it seems
Apple marketing has too readily assumed that the average iPhone buyer spends hours studying local transfer speeds and making close comparisons between the iPhone 3G and its predecessor .
This is n't the first time Apple has been bruised by harsh ASA criticisms .
Earlier in 2008 , the company faced an official backlash after claiming that " all the parts of the Internet are on the iPhone . "
In fact , the iPhone did n't support either Flash or Java , meaning that in fact many parts of the Internet were not on the iPhone .
No word yet on how Apple plans to fix the ad , but with terrifying competition in the form of the BlackBerry Storm on the horizon maybe the California company should be more careful choosing its words .

Maybe I spoke too quickly when I said that Tyra Banks is a true ally of the LGBT commmunity .
Now the Tyra Banks show is looking to host a program on " Ex - Gays "
" I WANT TO BE AN EX - GAY
Are you a gay man or lesbian who wants to be straight ?
Do your friends or family disagree with your gay lifestyle and wish you were straight ?
If you ever wish you could erase your same - sex attractions and not be gay ? " ( Tyra )
The Tyra Banks show has been inclusive in featuring gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender people in her shows in a positive light .
Unless Tyra
Banks seeks to prove on her show how " conversion therapy " and " ex- gays " are nothing more than a myth and people who are in denial or outright lying , this show is a bad move .
Click here to send actual good show ideas to Tyra .
Click here to leave a comment telling Tyra Banks either not to make a show on " ex - gays " or to make one which exposes the myth that is the " ex - gay " movement .
If the show just shows so called " ex- gays " and religious fanatics it will further confuse people in the closet and legitimize a movement that is based in fear and hate and not grounded in science , psychology or reality .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Thursday offered a lengthy defense of Treasury 's actions to date to combat the financial market crisis and laid out the challenges that his successor will face .
In a speech delivered at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library , Paulson took a step back and reviewed his actions to date and did not find many missteps .
" As I assess our current situation , I believe we have taken the necessary steps to prevent a financial collapse , " Paulson said .
Paulson is under increasing pressure as public dissatisfaction with the $ 700 billion rescue package continues to mount and Congress is seeking ways to tap the pool of funds for purposes that the Treasury Secretary opposes .
Congress is clearly interested in tapping the funds to help the auto industry and to stem foreclosures .
Paulson warned that the crisis was not over , and said that unpredictable events were sure to occur .
" We must remain vigilant , ready to respond , " Paulson said .
Paulson said the task ahead is to " reinvigorate market capitalism " and called for partisan sniping to end .
" Democrats and Republicans must cooperate and manage an unprecedented situation , and find solutions that restore and maintain our national economic well - being , " Paulson said .
Globally , all nations must work together because they are " in the same boat , " Paulson said .
" We must work together to first plug the leak , bail , and row together to reach the shore .
Then we must work as a team to overhaul and refit the boat so we can handle the rough seas that will undoubtedly test us in the future , " Paulson said .
Paulson did not provide mamy specifics of his immediate plans .
He has been criticized for making a U - turn from his plans to use the pool of funds to purchase toxic mortgage assets .
Paulson said this was not the final word on the subject .
" Although we are not proceeding with direct asset purchase programs , we plan to use our resources aggressively to support the normalization of credit markets and the expansion of credit to support economic recovery , " he said .
" We are actively engaged in developing programs to be implemented when ready , " he said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A Northrop Grumman Corp U.S. military satellite used to track enemy missiles stopped working in mid-September , underscoring the urgent need to keep a program for replacement satellites on track , a defense official and several analysts said on Monday .
The U.S. Air Force had no comment , but Space News reported on Monday that the Pentagon ’s chief weapons buyer John Young has signed a memorandum asking Congress to provide $ 117 million in funding in fiscal 2009 for a new satellite to hedge against a potential gap in satellite coverage around 2014 .
“ There is no gap today in U.S. missile warning , but the apparent loss of a satellite means there is an increased danger of a gap down the road because the redundancy of the existing constellation has been diminished , ” said Loren Thompson at the Virginia - based Lexington Institute .
Thompson said he had learned of the problem with the Defense Support Program ( DSP ) satellite from several sources , and it underscored the urgency of getting the new Space Based Infrared Satellite ( SBIRS ) system being developed by Lockheed Martin Corp into orbit .
“ There ’s a sense of renewed purpose .
We need to be sure that the SBIRS launches proceed as scheduled , ” agreed one defense official , who asked not to be named , adding that the loss of the satellite posed challenges for the DSP constellation .
Theresa Hitchens , who heads the Washington - based Center for Defense Information , said several amateur astronomers had reported that DSP 23 , the last of the U.S. missile - warning satellites built by Northrop , and launched in November 2007 , had stopped transmitting in mid-September .
The defense official said it was unclear what caused the failure , but said the explanations could range from defective parts to natural phenomenon , and possibly , although unlikely , an intentional attack .
There was also a chance that the problem stemmed from the satellite being hit by debris in space .
The U.S. government has launched 23 DSP missile - warning satellites into space since 1970 , and experts estimate that six to 10 are still working , about double the number needed to watch the entire Earth at once .
The satellites have generally lasted longer than initially expected , which makes it even more troubling that the newest of the DSP satellites would have developed trouble a year after its launch , said the official and the analysts .
SBIRS PROBLEMS
“ The DSP constellation is starting to degrade now , that ’s not a surprise .
But it would n’t even be a concern if SBIRS were n’t so screwed up , ” said Jonathan McDowell , astronomer with the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
The SBIRS program has seen its share of problems , including delays due to technology challenges , and Lockheed is rewriting software for the satellites after software problems prevented communication with a smaller satellite once it went into orbit in late 2006 .
The U.S. government shot down that satellite last February , saying its toxic fuel tank posed a potential threat .
The first SBIRS sensor is already in space on board a classified satellite in highly elliptical orbit , but the first dedicated satellites are not due to be launched until 2010 .
The SBIRS program was launched in 1996 with an eye to launching the first satellites in 2004 at a cost of $ 4.2 billion .
The program has been restructured several times and its price tag is now seen at well over $ 11 billion .
The defense official said the success of the first SBIRS payload in space was good news for the next satellites being developed for geosynchronous orbit .
But it was prudent to secure additional funding to ensure that the U.S. military was able to maintain its ability to spot enemy missiles , the official added .
Hitchens said some amateur astronomers , who use optical and radio telescopes to track objects in space , suggested the DSP satellite may have been adrift in geosynchronous orbit , which could pose a danger to other satellites operating in that orbit , she said .
The defense official downplayed that possibility , and said the failed satellite also posed no imminent threat to human life , as was the case with the NRO satellite .
We know lots " “ maybe way too much " “ about John McCain and Barack Obama .
And we know a little bit about their wives , too .
Set aside the politics , though , and Cindy McCain and Michelle Obama are very interesting women in their own rights .
So today and tomorrow we 're going to focus on the two of them , minus their presidential - hopeful husbands .
1 . Her brother , Craig Robinson , is head men's basketball coach at Oregon State University .
He was actually a fourth - round draft pick for the 76ers in 1983 , but never played .
2 . She is childhood friends with Jesse Jackson 's daughter Santita , who sang at their 1992 wedding .
3. She and her brother ( who is only 16 months older than her ) both skipped second grade , which appears to be pretty common in the Robinson family : both of their parents skipped a grade as well .
4. Competition with her brother motivated her in her education .
When she visited him at Princeton , she thought , " I 'm smarter than he is , "  and decided right there that she wanted to apply at the school .
She did , even though some of her teachers advised against it , and got in .
5 . Her dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when he was in his 20s .
6 . She used to be a trademark / copyright lawyer for Sidley Austin in Chicago ( which is where she met Barack , who was interning there ) .
7 . She quit Sidley Austin to work in various public service jobs for Chicago Mayor Richard Daley .
8 . She once brought her then - four - month - old daughter to a job interview .
With another daughter , she was n't sure if she wanted the job or not , and brought Sasha to sort of sabotage the interview .
She did such a fine job interviewing , she was offered the position anyway .
9 . She likes off - the - rack clothes for campaigning , including the Gap , J. Crew , White House / Black Market and H&M .
However , she also likes clothes by couture designer Maria Pinto .
10 .
As a kid , her favorite toys were Barbie and Easy - Bake Oven .
Stay tuned for Cindy McCain tomorrow !
And thanks to Kathleen Pierce for the research .
Warrensville Heights Mayor Marcia Fudge , a friend and sorority sister of the late U.S. Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones , is putting her name forward as a potential replacement on the November ballot .
Fudge , a Democrat , will not run for the special election to finish out the last two months of Tubbs Jones ' 11th Congressional District term , which ends in December , she said .
Tubbs Jones died of a burst brain aneurysm on Aug. 20 .
Fudge , who declined to be interviewed during the past week because she said she needed the time to put her friend to rest , said she did not make the decision lightly .
" It 's very difficult to lose someone who is as close to me as Stephanie was , " she said .
" Ultimately I decided that it was probably the best thing to do because I want to ensure that her legacy continues . "
Fudge , who met Tubbs Jones in 1982 through the Cleveland chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority , said she feels that she is capable of carrying out that legacy because her values and ideals are closely aligned with her friend's .
" I can finish some of the things she did n't have the opportunity to finish , " she said , pointing in particular to Tubbs Jones ' work on predatory lending and disparities in health care among minorities .
Fudge , 55 , had worked for Tubbs Jones in several capacities over the years , in the county prosecutor 's office , and as her chief of staff in Congress in 1999 .
She has been mayor of Warrensville Heights since 2000 .
She said her concern for Warrensville Heights caused her some hesitation in deciding to run for the seat .
" I live here , and I 'm going to live here , so the direction of the city is going to be important to me , whether I 'm the mayor or not , " Fudge said .
She feels her legislative and finance background , as well as her familiarity with the city has uniquely qualified her to follow in Tubbs Jones ' footsteps .
" Being a mayor , I know the issues that are specific to inner-ring cities -- I know the issues because I deal with them every day , " Fudge said .
" I do n't know that there 's anyone else with that kind of experience .
The next step , Fudge said , is to gain the support of the Democratic Party 's executive committee in the 11th district , which will choose a name to put on the ballot in November .
Ohio law allows Cuyahoga County 's Democratic Party to replace Tubbs Jones on the ballot .
The party must make a choice by Sept. 26 , when the county Elections Board starts printing ballots .
The replacement for Tubbs Jones will face Republican Thomas Pekarek .
Merb 1.0 Released So Here ’s 44 Links and Resources To Get You Going
By Peter Cooper
Merb - a much heralded , highly flexible Ruby - based Web application framework - has reached version 1.0 after two years of development .
Congratulations to Merb 's creator , Ezra Zygmuntowicz , and to the large group of associated developers ( such as Yehuda Katz and Matt Aimonetti ) who 've kept adding features and pushed Merb forward to be a significant alternative to Rails .
Ruby Inside has been some surveys for the past couple of months , and they still show that only 25 % of Ruby Inside 's visitors have ever developed a Merb application .
With the stability that the 1.0 release offers ( older versions of Merb had a reputation - fair or not - for a constantly shifting API ) , it 's now a great time to give Merb a try .
It 's also a great time to get into writing tutorials and documentation !

First definitive proof for overall decrease in Arctic ice volume
A recent study based on satellite radar altimetry indicates drastic thinning of Arctic ice during the winter of 2007 .
It was found that the ice thickness had been fairly constant for the five previous winters .
The researchers were able to highlight widespread ice thinning in areas covered by both old and young ice .
This thinning constitutes the most severe since records started being taken in the early 1990s .
The study by scientists of University College London has been published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
The work provides the first definitive proof for overall decrease in Arctic ice volume , claim the authors .
The researchers have found that last winter 's ice thickness represented a decrease of an average of 26 centimeters below the 2002 - 2008 winter average .
The greatest decline of 49 centimeters was in the western Arctic , which could explain the region 's becoming relatively ice - free this summer , allowing it to be open to shipping for the first time in 30 years .
The record low of ice thickness during summer happened when the weather was not abnormally warm .
About five years ago , the average projection for the sea ice disappearing was about 2080 .
But the ice minimums , and this evidence of melting , suggests that we should favor the models that suggest the sea ice will disappear by 2030 - 2040 , but there is still a lot of uncertainty .
— Dr Seymour Laxon , University College London
Katharine Giles , the lead author , points out that the study used satellite data sets , which had a number of advantages over other methods .
Previous studies have used measurements from drilling , or submarine and airborne surveys .
These studies could be severely limited by time and space .
The present study utilized continuous , all - weather , day - and - night radar altimeter data from the European Space Agency 's Envisat satellite .
The study measured ice thickness from October to March , 2007 , over more than half of the Arctic .
There has been considerable uncertainty over the causes of ice loss in the Arctic .
It has been debated that ice could have been piled up against the coast , thus reducing the sea ice extent .
Measurements of the ice thickness , as in the present study , give definite proof for ice melting .
" So this means melting ; it does n't mean that the ice has just been pushed up against the coastline , " remark Seymour Laxon , co-author of the paper .
The conclusions of the study can help predict what could happen with the ice cover in future .
Deflection of sunlight by the Arctic ice cap could be reduced , leading to larger areas of water , which can absorb heat .
Warmer temperatures will in turn promote more ice melting .
" About five years ago , the average projection for the sea ice disappearing was about 2080 " , said Dr Laxon .
" But the ice minimums , and this evidence of melting , suggests that we should favor the models that suggest the sea ice will disappear by 2030 - 2040 , but there is still a lot of uncertainty . "

Geared towards raising awareness of endangered ocean habitats , a new online tool allows viewers an in - depth peek at underwater reefs around the world .
Google Earth has taken us up and out into the universe , and now they are taking us down and under the surface of the sea .
The new Google Earth ‘ layer ’ will allow people to experience a ‘ virtual dive ’ under the water at sensitive ocean areas all around the world .[ social_buttons ]
With a click of the mouse , viewers will be able to access video streams , photo galleries , conservation strategies and local stories specific to that spot .
Conservationists working in partnership with Google Inc. unveiled the new technology at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ’s ( IUCN ) world congress in Barcelona .
It seems as though right now the underwater Google plugin is only available for Windows , but I imagine a Mac version wo n’t be far behind .
Google Earth project manager Steve Miller said : “ We sat down and said ‘ let ’s open this up , let people around the world who might be passionate about their ( marine protected area ) , who might be passionate about the water in their backyard , let them contribute to this . ’ ”
According to Google Earth , a main goal of the project is to bring hard science to the general public ’s attention in an interesting and entertaining way .
By providing images and information about these critical areas , Google is hoping to raise global awareness about the current threats facing our world ’s oceans .
Currently there are about 4,500 ocean areas around the world that have been designated as protected areas .
This designation means that bans or restrictions on fishing and other commercial and recreational activities have protected local marine life .
Not all 4,500 areas are accessible through Google Earth .
The IUCN also launched an online web portal this year called Protect Planet Ocean , where viewers can find information on the critical importance of protected marine environments .
At the same IUCN conference , National Geographic revealed their WildCam Belize Reef project , a live underwater video feed of a coral reef off the coast of Belize .
WildCam Belize is the latest addition to National Geographic ’s WildCam project that offers streaming live footage of animals and habitats around the world .

Imagination Technologies Group , licensor of graphics processor cores , is rumoured to be working with Sony on the latest iteration of the PlayStation Portable .
The company recently issued a press release stating that it was working with " a major international consumer electronics company " , which is now rumoured to be Sony , according to EETimes .
Citing unnamed sources , the announcement is for an upgrade to the " PSP2 " says the report , but Imagination would only state it is for a " high - volume consumer device " .
Although the report mentions PSP2 , it is n't clear whether the technology would be for an entirely new iteration of the handheld hardware , or a remodel of the orginal , such as the PSP 3000 .
Imagination Technologies ' licensing partners include Sega Sammy , Intel and Samsung .
Sony Europe has told GamesIndustry .
biz that it will not " comment on rumour and speculation " .
A staff member resigned and apologized Tuesday for writing a speech read by Stephen Harper in 2003 as leader of the Opposition that plagiarized from an address days earlier by then Australian prime minister John Howard .
Australian Prime Minister John Howard , left , is seen on a television screen addressing the Australian Parliament in March 2003 , alongside an image of Conservative Leader Stephen Harper , right , speaking two days later .
( ( CBC ) )
" Pressed for time , I was overzealous in copying segments of another world leader ’s speech , " Owen Lippert says in a news release sent out by the Conservative camp on Tuesday afternoon .
" Neither my superiors in the Office of the Leader of the Opposition nor the leader of the Opposition was aware that I had done so . "
Lippert worked for Harper , then leader of the Canadian Alliance , when the speech calling for Canadian troops to be deployed to Iraq was written and read in the House of Commons .
Lippert , a former policy analyst for economic think tank the Fraser Institute , has announced his resignation from his current position working in the Conservative campaign headquarters .
The apology came hours after Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae accused Harper of plagiarizing from the Howard speech .
Tory camp dismisses issue as irrelevant
At a campaign appearance in Toronto in the morning , Rae played video showing Howard speaking to the Australian Parliament on March 18 , 2003 , alongside video of an address by Harper two days later in Ottawa .
The two speeches , which the Liberals posted to their website , appear to have lengthy duplicate passages , according to a comparison of the two parliaments '
Hansard transcripts .
Earlier in the day , Harper 's spokesman , Kory Teneycke , dismissed the issue as irrelevant , saying the video 's release was an " act of desperation " by the Liberal campaign on the eve of the first leaders ' debate .
" I 'm not going to get into a debate about a five - year - old speech that was delivered three Parliaments ago , two elections ago , when the prime minister was the leader of a party that no longer exists , " Teneycke said .
" We 're going to focus on the economy , which is the No. 1 issue Canadians want to talk about .
We 're not going to be distracted by attacks from the Liberal war room . "
' Shocking ' duplication : Rae
In an interview with Don Newman of CBC's Politics , Rae called the Conservative party 's earlier attempt to brush off the issue " totally pathetic . "
He described the 2003 address as Harper 's " big coming - out speech as leader of the opposition . "
Immediately following the speech , then - foreign affairs minister Bill Graham praised Harper for his " thoughtful and powerful presentation of his party 's case . "
Rae called the apparent duplication " shocking , " saying it reveals the ideological approach of the Harper government in shaping Canada 's foreign policy and indicates the party 's own voice on foreign policy issues was weak .
" How does a political leader in Canada 's Parliament , on such a crucial issue , in fact an issue that in many ways defined our foreign policy for a generation , end up giving the exact same speech as another country 's leader ? "
Rae said earlier in the day .
" Let alone one who was the key leader of George W. Bush 's ' coalition of the willing . ' "
Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion earlier in the day called for Harper to be expelled from the House of Commons over the affair .
" It matters a lot , tremendously , " he told reporters at a campaign stop in Gatineau , Que .
" Canadians want that their country [ to ] speak with its own voice on the world stage .
It 's true for the prime minister ; it 's true for the Opposition leader . "
Australian leader ally of Bush government
Howard was a stalwart ally of the Bush administration in the Iraq war and deployed Australian forces to participate in the U.S. - led invasion of the country in March 2003 , which other world leaders , including then Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien , opposed .
Rae pointed to Chrétien 's decision as a moment that " made us proud to be Canadians . "
" The Liberal party has always believed that Canada must have its own voice on the world stage , " Rae said .
" He did the right thing and said , ' No . ' "
The Liberals said they noticed the similarity between the two speeches only recently , when one of their staffers was searching for a copy of Harper 's editorial on the Iraq invasion published in the Wall Street Journal , the CBC's James Cudmore reported from the campaign trail .
The staffer entered a portion of Harper 's comments into Google and came up with a link to Harper 's remarks and another to Howard's .
The party said it then ordered a video copy of Howard 's speech .
The revelation came as the federal party leaders were scaling back on campaign appearances to focus on preparing for this week 's debates ahead of the Oct. 14 election .
Segments of speeches
In one segment , both leaders are heard saying :
" It is inherently dangerous to allow a country , such as Iraq , to retain weapons of mass destruction , particularly in light of its past aggressive behaviour .
If the world community fails to disarm Iraq we fear that other rogue states will be encouraged to believe that they too can have these most deadly of weapons to systematically defy international resolutions and that the world will do nothing to stop them . "
The clips then jump to Howard saying :
Liberal foreign affairs critic Bob Rae says the similarities between the two speeches show that the Conservatives ' foreign policy cannot be trusted .
( ( Canadian Press ) )
" As the possession of weapons of mass destruction spreads , so the danger of such weapons coming into the hands of terrorist groups will multiply .
That is the ultimate nightmare which the world must take decisive and effective steps to prevent .
Possession of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons by terrorists would constitute a direct , undeniable and lethal threat to Australia and its people . "
According to the Hansard transcripts , Harper said :
" As the possession of weapons of mass destruction spreads , the danger of such weapons coming into the hands of terrorist groups will multiply , particularly given in this case the shameless association of Iraq with rogue non-state organizations .
That is the ultimate nightmare which the world must take decisive and effective steps to prevent .
Possession of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons by terrorists would constitute a direct , undeniable and lethal threat to the world , including to Canada and its people . "
I have heard — and been in the middle of — arguments which make the claim that the tests is the stupid , simple part and the “ real code ” is the hard part .
One such person made the claim that interns should write the test code and “ real programmers ” should write code to make the tests pass .
This is backwards .
The tests are the program .
Without the tests , the program does not work .
Tests are not something that should be left for the inexperienced ; tests are the hard part .
To quote Code Complete :
Test cases are often as likely or more likely to contain errors than the code being testing ( Weiland 1983 , Jones 1986a , Johnson 1994 [ Johnson , Mark .
1994 .
“ Dr. Boris Beizer on Software Testing : An Interview ” ] ) .
The reasons are easy to find — especially when the developer writes the test case .
Test cases tend to be created on the fly rather than through a careful design and construction process .
They are often viewed as one - time tests and are developed with the care commensurate with something to be thrown away .
For example , the following test does not have nearly enough setup to be useful ( assigns ( : posts ) could be empty , causing this test to be something of a no - op ) .
This is a common problem ; sometimes it happens because it relies on fixtures that get lost in a refactoring , and sometimes it happens out of just not thinking hard enough .
The non -test code behind this , of course , is part of the Rails scaffold and dead simple .
context " a GET to index " do setup { get : index } should " have a link for each post " do assigns ( : posts ) . each do | post | assert_select ' a[ href= ? ] ' , post_path ( post ) end end end
The next set of tests could use a loop over % w ( index show edit ) and should_redirect_to to shorten it without any loss of knowledge ( and could even make it more clear ) .
This is a case of an accurate series of tests ( for a one - line piece of code ) that has become difficult to maintain because the developer failed to notice the pattern .
context " logged out " do setup { session [ : user_id ] = nil } context " GET to index " do setup { get : index } should " redirect to the root_url " do assert_redirected _to root_url end end context " GET to show " do setup { get : show } should " redirect to the root_url " do assert_redirected _to root_url end end context " GET to edit " do setup { get : edit } should " redirect to the root_url " do assert_redirected _to root_url end end end
It ’s interesting to note that the problem in the first example could be caused by refactoring , and the problem in the second example is caused by not refactoring .
This is a fair point , and another indication of the difficulty in writing tests : when refactoring non-test code , anything you break is pointed out quickly by the tests ; when refactoring test code , you need to make sure that it will continue to fail when needed , and continue to pass when needed .
Some tests are just so arcane or trivial that they would normally be overlooked , but if it really needs to be a specific way then it needs to be tested .
For example , ActiveRecord : : Base # to_xml is a lovely part of Rails that is often used for part of the application ’s public API .
If #to_xml changes , many customers will be upset .
Recently we had to override # to_xml with lots of special - casing ; while the special - casing did get tested , some of the more subtle parts of # to_xml were ignored .
Thus , this test was recently added in response to a bug report :
should " dasherize any element with underscores when sent # to_xml " do xml = Factory ( : message ) .
to_xml assert_no_match /<\w*_\w*>/ , xml end
Some code needs a complex maze of tests .
Advanced search is a common feature that requires careful thought to test all the options .
The Album.advanced_search method may be large and complicated , but the tests for it must be necessarily more so .
No time for laziness or ignorance here ; this test suite requires the knowledge of an advanced search expert , and the patience of a person who has a lot of patience .
context " when sent # advanced_search " do setup { create_all_sorts_of_data } %w ( producer artist mixing_engineer ) .
each do | str_opt | context " with the #{ str_opt } option " do # ... end end [ true , false ]. each do | include_compilation | context " with : include_compilations option set to #{ include_compilation } " do # ... end end # ... and then permutations of these , too end
( While researching this post I found these two interesting links : a WardsWiki page about bugs in tests , in which people argue over buggy tests , refactoring tests , and how this affects non-test code ; and a paper titled Refactoring Test Code ( PDF ] ) , which discusses “ code smells ” relevant to testing and how best to refactor these . )

The ubiquitous disinfectant may kill bacteria by unfolding their proteins .
Bleach kills bugs by unfolding their proteins .
Punchstock
It is the gold standard of sanitation , and a single drop is often all it takes to render a litre of water bacteria - free and safe to drink .
Yet the molecular tricks behind bleach 's fearsome bacteria - fighting power have not been fully worked out .
Now , researchers have found that bleach can kill bacteria by attacking proteins , quickly destroying their delicate shape .
Furthermore , the model bacterium Escherichia coli even produces a protein that is activated by bleach and rescues injured proteins before the damage becomes permanent .
It has long been recognized that bleach , which is a solution of the chemical sodium hypochlorite , can wreak havoc with proteins .
Bleach rapidly dissociates to form the highly reactive hypochlorous acid , which can attack the amino acids that make up proteins and so alter a protein's three - dimensional structure .
A protein's structure is critical to its function , and when important proteins lose their shape cells can no longer survive .
But most studies have looked at how bleach reacts with proteins and membranes in test tubes rather than in living organisms .
The unfolding
Biochemist Ursula Jakob of the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , and her colleagues became interested in bleach while studying a protein called Hsp33 , which acts as a molecular ' chaperone ' , helping other proteins to achieve and maintain their proper shape .
They found that E. coli genetically engineered to lack Hsp33 became much more sensitive to bleach .
When the researchers looked more closely at the effects of bleach on proteins in living cells , they found that treatment with bleach caused many proteins to clump together .
Their results are published today in Cell1 .
One possibility is that the proteins are damaged and begin to unfold , exposing ' sticky ' amino acids that were once buried deep inside the protein .
When those molecules become exposed , they interact with similar amino acids on other damaged proteins , eventually forming intractable , non-functional globules .
Jakob likens the process to boiling an egg : heat from the boiling water causes protein in the gooey egg whites to unfold and aggregate , gradually becoming solid .
" In the same way that you cannot unboil an egg , cells have a very difficult time resolving these aggregates , " she says .
Instead , cells use Hsp33 to prevent the aggregation from occurring by refolding proteins before they clump together .
An unlikely ' on ' switch
In fact , Hsp33 becomes more active when cells are exposed to hypochlorous acid .
When bleach reacts with some of this protein's amino acids , Hsp33 partly unfolds and assumes an active structure .
This is unusual : unfolding renders most proteins non-functional , yet for Hsp33 the process acts as switch to turn the protein on .
Another bacterial chaperone protein called HdeA is also activated by partly falling apart under very acidic conditions2 , and Jakob expects that researchers may find more examples of this counterintuitive stress response in the future .
But why would E. coli bother to develop a warning system for a disinfectant invented by humans ?
The answer to that question could be that hypochlorous acid occurs naturally as well .
Immune cells called neutrophils , for example , produce the acid to kill bacteria that they have engulfed .
However , this does not quite account for E. coli 's behaviour , says microbiologist James Imlay of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
" < i> E. coli</i > does not make a living around neutrophils , he says .
Jakob notes that one study suggests the acid may limit the growth of bacteria in insect guts3 , and says that there could be other naturally occurring sources that have not yet been identified .
Meanwhile , the study does not rule out the possibility that bleach could have other modes of action .
It is known , for instance , that bleach can react with the molecules that make up membranes .
If this occurs in living cells , it could cause the membranes to rupture , killing the cell .
But protein unfolding and aggregation seem to be an important part of the picture , filling in details that have long been missing .
" Everyone knew that bleached worked , and that was enough , " says Jakob .
" Few really cared how it worked . "
HALLOWEEN MASKS !

4 ) USERS ARE LOSERS - 5 ) A MESSAGE ABOUT SNIFFING
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. economy contracted at its fastest pace in seven years in the third quarter as consumer spending plunged to a 28 - year low , data showed on Tuesday , raising the specter of a deeper recession .
Separate reports showed U.S. home prices continued their downward spiral , with the cost of single - family homes plunging by a record 17.4 percent in September from a year earlier .
The data painted a dismal picture of the troubled economy and backed views the Federal Reserve could push benchmark lending rates to an unprecedented zero percent by early 2009 .
“ We are in the early stages of one of the worst recessions in the post - war period , even factoring in a massive stimulus program , ’ said Nariman Behravesh , chief economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington , Massachusetts .
The grim reports partially overshadowed the Fed ’s announcement that it would use up to $ 800 billion to buy mortgage - related debt and consumer debt securities .
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 36.47 points at 8,479.86 , after a choppy session .
U.S. government debt prices rallied , helped by a safe - haven bid fueled by the worsening outlook .
The dollar , however , fell a third session against the euro , handing the European single currency its best three - day percentage advance ever .
The Commerce Department revised the annual rate of decline in third - quarter gross domestic product to 0.5 percent from the 0.3 percent that it reported a month ago .
It was the sharpest fall in GDP since the third quarter of 2001 , in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks .
Corporate profits dropped for a second straight quarter and business investment fell for the first time since the end of 2006 , signaling a wariness about prospects for future sales .
Consumers , hard hit by rising unemployment and plunging home equity , held back and sent spending falling at its sharpest rate since the second quarter of 1980 .
Consumer spending accounts for two - thirds of economic activity .
Many analysts believe the United States already has joined Europe in recession , though it will take another quarter of contraction to meet a widely used definition for it -- back - to - back quarters of declining output .
The third - quarter decline in GDP was a striking contrast with the second quarter ’s relatively brisk 2.8 percent rate of growth .
The U.S. economic decline is widely predicted to accelerate in the fourth quarter and last into 2009 .
CREDIT CRISIS TO BLAME
The White House blamed the contraction in the economy on the credit crisis that has emanated from the collapse of the U.S. housing market .
“ There ’s no question the financial crisis was a major shock to the economy , and that ’s being reflected in the economic data .
We believe a big reason for this was the freezing in credit markets this fall , ” said White House spokesman Tony Fratto .
“ That ’s why we ’ve been so focused on unfreezing our credit markets and stabilizing our financial system . ”
The housing malaise has infected other sectors of the broader economy , translating into the highest unemployment rate in 14 years and a record drop in retail sales .
Steps by global authorities , including the Federal Reserve ’s interest rate cuts , have had limited impact in freeing up credit and stimulating demand .
Analysts reckon the U.S. central bank could trim the overnight federal funds by another half point at its next meeting in December after an aggressive easing campaign that has already pushed it down to 1.0 percent from 5.25 percent over the past 14 months .

“ Today ’s numbers tell us that the economy is probably in a long and deep recession , probably half way through that .
We still have a lot of water under the bridge , ” said Cary Leahey , senior managing director at Decision Economics in New York .
“ We see the Fed cutting another ( half point ) in December and following up with another quarter of a percent immediately after ... maybe down to almost zero then , ” he said .
After that , the Fed will turn to an unconventional policy of flooding the banking system with excess cash , Leahey said .
An uptick in the Conference Board ’s consumer confidence index to 44.9 from in November from 38.8 in October did little to brighten the mood .
“ The confidence index is still at the lowest level on record since 1975 and is clearly below its worst levels in each of the past four recessions , ” said Yelena Shulyatyeva , an economist at BNP Paribas in New York .
Further highlighting the deteriorating economic climate , prices of U.S. single - family homes in September plunged a record 17.4 percent from a year earlier , the Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller Home Price Indices showed .
Times are changing at Google :
You can't slack off and expect to keep your job anymore , reports a reader who says he's an employee :
Recent change in behavior here at Google ... it used to be nearly impossible to get fired for general underperformance , but about a week ago word went out to managers that this was a good time to get rid of any people who were underperforming .
There have been a couple people I know who got called into meetings with HR and told they were being let go and given a week to " say goodbye to people and come up with whatever story they wanted about why they were leaving . "
This is n't the predictable letting contract recruiters go when you are n't hiring anyone , although that 's happening too .
It 's also clearly reasonable and fair that if you do n't do much work you will lose your job , but it 's a dramatic change in how Google operates that has n't even been publicly announced to employees
This seems plausible .
Analysts say Google ( GOOG ) could be going through a rough quarter , and Google CEO Eric Schmidt told Bloomberg that Google had begun cutting costs .
Also , there 's been a sudden rash of new ad products and policies aimed at turning up new revenues .

PQ Leader Pauline Marois , ADQ Leader Mario Dumont and Liberal Leader Jean Charest chat before Tuesday night 's debate in Quebec City .
(( Paul Chiasson / Canadian Press ) )
Liberal Leader Jean Charest fended off his opponents who hammered away at his government 's health care and financial record in office in what turned out to be a feisty election debate Tuesday night .
Charest launched the two - hour televised election debate by appealing to Quebecers to trust him during these turbulent economic times .
" The issue of this election campaign is the economy , " the Liberal leader stated plainly during his opening remarks .
" The question you must ask yourselves on Dec. 8 is who you can trust to handle our economy . "
Charest , who called a snap election this fall with the hopes of securing a majority after heading up a 20 - month minority government , said the Liberal party is best prepared to handle challenges arising from the global financial crisis .
ADQ Leader Mario Dumont promises to help middle - class Quebecers . (( Jacques Boissinot / Canadian Press ) ) Parti Québécois Leader Pauline Marois , appearing in her first leaders ' debate , said Quebec needs a " government that takes decisions , and that tells Quebecers the truth . "
Voters in the province did n't want an election , she said , accusing Charest of calling an election to avoid coming clean about Quebec 's financial health .
" Mr. Charest has a new slogan – Elections Now , the Truth Later , " said Marois .
Action Démocratique du Québec Leader Mario Dumont , who drew third place for the debate 's opening statements , said middle - class Quebecers need more cash flow , and an ADQ government would help them with that .
Dumont , who is suffering from dismal poll showings in this campaign , played up his recent stint as Opposition leader in Quebec 's legislature , saying his team " is readier than ever to work for you . "
Both Dumont and Marois pressed Charest on Quebec 's pension fund , suggesting it has bled more money than the government is ready to admit .
Leaders clash over health care
Charest and Marois traded barbs about Quebec 's health care system , accusing each other of damaging the system while in power .
The Liberal leader said Marois was behind waves of nurse and doctor retirements in the 1990s when she was health minister under PQ premier Lucien Bouchard .
Her decision back then precipitated the current staff shortages , Charest said .
Liberal Leader Jean Charest was the main target in Tuesday night 's debate .
(( Jacques Boissinot / Canadian Press ) )
Marois said she'd " never do that again , " reminding Charest that when Bouchard and the PQ took power late last decade , " we faced a deficit , and we saved the health care system . "
The Liberals , on the other hand , have created a " fiasco " in their efforts to improve the health care system , Marois said .
" You have n't even been able to build a hospital , " she quipped , referring to the repeatedly derailed and bloated master plan to build a CHUM mega - health centre in Montreal .
Charest attacked the ADQ 's private sector - friendly health - care proposals , accusing Dumont of comparing health care to going to a restaurant when he talks about creating " à la carte " services .
Dumont shot back later , saying , " If I understand correctly , you do n't have any solutions , " referring to long pediatrician waiting lists .
When a viewer 's question about caregiver support was broadcast , Dumont paid subtle tribute to popular Quebec singer - songwriter Chloé Sainte - Marie , who has singlehandedly campaigned on the issue while caring for her ailing partner , filmmaker Gilles Carle .
Polls suggest health care remains a top priority for Quebec voters .
National question loses some fervour
The two - hour French - only debate at the national assembly focused on four separate topics : health , the economy , education and family , and Quebec 's future .
PQ Leader Pauline Marois says Quebecers want a government that ' tells the truth . ' (( Jacques Boissinot / Canadian Press ) )
The new debate format , with leaders sitting around a round table , did not discourage anyone from interrupting or talking over the other .
The debate frequently burst into cacophony , which prompted moderator Stéphane Bureau to interject several times in an attempt to restore order .
But when it came to Quebec 's perennial core issue – sovereignty – the discussion was more subdued than in any recent election campaign .
Marois and Dumont both indicated their intention to eventually relaunch constitutional talks , while Charest underscored the urgent need to address economic matters instead of sovereignty .
The Liberal government won more powers for Quebec by brokering agreements with the federal government on key issues , including health , Charest said .
Dumont stressed the importance of negotiating a new place for Quebec in the Canadian Constitution , while Marois reiterated the PQ's ultimate goal of achieving sovereignty to improve the province 's future prospects .
Québec Solidaire weighs in online
Left - wing party Québec Solidaire failed in efforts to join the leaders ' debate , but spokeswoman Françoise David is hosting a simultaneous online forum during Tuesday night 's event .
" People will see me in little clips , where I will talk about health , education , family , environment , culture , etc. , " David said prior to the debate .
" I will also say what I think [ about ] what the other leaders propose and [ comment ] on the debate . "
Viewers were also invited to chat online about election issues , she said .
I ’m Joe the plumber , and I ’ve decided who I ’ll vote for .
I ’m Joe the plumber , and I ’ve done some research into who will raise my taxes more , and I ’ve reached a conclusion .
It ’s not an easy choice .
I wanted to consider capital gains tax , too , because I own a home .
OK , I should clarify a few things in the interest of full disclosure .
My first name is n’t really Joe , but you can call me Joe , OK ?
And while I ’m not a licensed plumber if you ’ve ever tried to install a garbage disposal , or reseat a toilet on a new wax ring yourself , you know you want somebody else to do it for you .
OK , technically my boss is n’t running a licensed plumbing company either , but all that regulation is n’t really necessary , is it ?
I mean , sure , a bit of regulation might have helped prevent the need to bailout the rich guys running Wall Street Banks and big insurance companies like AIG , but come on – plumbers ?
What could go wrong ?
See , here ’s the thing : I ’ve got the entrepreneurial spirit .
I do n’t mean like some guy who rides in to town selling snake oil in the old wild west , either .
I want to own my own business , that ’s my version of the American dream .
I ’ll bet you ’re a lot like me – unless you ’ve always voted for the same party in every election , or you ’re a licensed plumber , of course .
So I compared McCain and Obama on other stuff , too , like their plan for health care ( ’ cause that cost matters to a guy like me – I do n’t actually even have health care right now . )
My family thinks I ’m making it .
They make light - hearted jokes , and call me “ Lord of the Rings ” when it ’s time to fix a toilet .
They think it ’s very cool that I work for a small business .
Honestly ?
I ’d be happy to earn more at a big company right now , but when the boss does n’t even take in $ 250,000 in gross receipts it ’s not like I can expect to be making six figures myself , right ?
McCain ’s an honorable man , he ’s personally avoided making outright attacks as reprehensible as , say , Congresswoman Michelle Bachman who ca n’t even figure why she should apologize for implying a Senator might be un-American !
Furthermore , he ’s actually running as much against his record of voting with Bush as Senator Norm Coleman up in Minnesota , so even if his plans are n’t as well - developed and spelled out as Obama ’s we know McCain ’s now against some of what Bush got wrong anyway .
And I know that politicians will often say anything to win , so I ’m not surprised that not everything coming out of the McCain campaign is true or that his message changes .
That ’s just politics as usual .
I sure do n’t expect that the media is covering either candidate accurately – they ’re in it to make money , after all , they want us to keep tuning in , and that ’s just business .
Based on research , endorsements by people who obviously know more than I do , and talking to friends I ’ve decided to vote for Barack Obama on November 4th .
It ’s just a lot easier for me to trust that a guy who only owns one house might follow through on his promises to work for the good of everybody .
I mean , come on : McCain ’s wife spent more on one outfit than I ’ve earned in the last 8 years , just how concerned would he be about my taxes , leaky toilet flappers , homes being foreclosed , and other issues that matter to me here in the midwest if he gets an 8th house by being elected to fix the mess George Bush made of the budget and the Middle East ?
I ’m Joe the Plumber ,
sometimes known as “ Lord of the Rings , ”
and I approve this message .

This artist 's conception shows the closest known planetary system , Epsilon Eridani , surrounded by two asteroid belts ( inner belt shown as yellowish ring and outer belt seen in the foreground ) as well as possible planets and an outer ring ( see comets originating from the outer ring in the upper right corner ) .
A nearbystar , visible with the unaided eye , is ringed with two rocky asteroid belts andan outer icy halo , making it a three - ring cosmic circus .
The inner asteroidbelt appears to be a virtual twin to the belt in our solar system .
Thepresence of the separate rings of material around the nearby star , called EpsilonEridani , suggests unseen planets lurk there , where they confine and shape therings , say the researchers .
If therewere in fact rocky planets within the inner gap between the star and asteroid belt , the worldswould likely reside within the star 's habitablezone where temperatures would be such that life could survive .
Located 10.5 light - years from Earth in the constellation Eridanus , the star is the ninthclosest to the sun .
The sun's three nearestknown stars are gravitationally bound in a system called Alpha Centaurithat 's located 4.36 light - years away .
( A light - year is the distance lighttravels in one year , or about 6 trillion miles , or 10 trillion km . )
EpsilonEridani is slightly smaller and cooler than the sun .
And it 's also younger .
While the sun is an estimated 4.5 billion years old , Epsilon Eridani has beenaround for just 850 million years .
" StudyingEpsilon Eridani is like having a time machine to look at our solar system when it wasyoung , " said researcher Massimo Marengo , an astronomer at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts .
Rockyrings
Astronomershad known about the star 's outer icy ring , but they were surprised when NASA ?
sSpitzer Space Telescope revealed two rocky rings between the icy halo and the star .
The innerasteroid belt looks identical to ours in terms of material , and it orbits at 3astronomical units ( AU ) from Epsilon Eridani ?
the same distance between thesun and the rocky asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter .
( An astronomical unitequals the average Earth - sun distance of 93 million miles , or about 150 millionkm . )
EpsilonEridani?s second asteroid belt is 20 AU from the star , or about where Uranus isin relation to our sun , and it is crowded with as much mass as Earth ?s moon .
The outericy ring , previously observed , extends about 35 AU to 100 AU from EpsilonEridani and is similar in composition to our Kuiper Belt , a region of icyobjects beyond Neptune .
Eridani's outer ring holds about 100 times morematerial than ours , however .
Newexoplanets ?
The ringsformed when the system was very young , likely when collisions between planetsand other smaller bodies resulted in small bits and big chunks of debris thattook shape as the asteroid belts and icy ring , the researchers suggest .
And the gapsbetween these rings were likely shaped by planets whose gravitational forcescould remove any excess material flung from the belts , while also keeping theshape of the rings .
Planets in our solar system exert similar shaping effects .
" Thebig planets that are now keeping those gaps are determining the geometry of thesystem of rings , " Marengo told SPACE.com .
He and hiscolleagues propose three planets with masses between those of Neptune and Jupiter could be in orbit about Epsilon Eridani .
A Jupiter - massexoplanet was detected in 2000 by the radial velocity method in whichastronomers look for wobbling motion of a star due to the gravitational tug ofa planet .
That planet is located near the edge of the innermost ring .
A secondplanet must lurk near the second asteroid belt , and a third at about 35 AU nearthe inner edge of Epsilon Eridani ?s Kuiper Belt , the researchers say .
Terrestrialplanets could reside inside the innermost asteroid belt as well , though therecurrently is no clear indication of that , Marengo said .
The research will be detailed in the Jan. 10 issue of The Astrophysical Journal .
JYVASKYLA , Finland , Oct. 10 ( UPI ) --
Deaf young people with an urge to dance in a nightclub atmosphere can do so at an aroma - oriented event in Finland , organizer Ronald Lightenberg said .
Ligtenberg said the event , called SenCity , aids deaf dancers through the use of scented oils that match the mood of the music being played , The Daily Telegraph in Britain said Friday .

Deaf dancers are also helped at the event by so - called signdancers who use dance moves and sign language to communicate song lyrics , Ligtenberg said .
The event in the city of Jyvaskyla allows a mainstream part of the youth culture to be fully enjoyed by people with the disability , Ligtenberg said .
" Often , minority cultures can get lost when merging with majority cultures , " he said .
" SenCity brings the two cultures together . "
Largely bullshit - and obviously an attempt to fan white fears of black voters .
If you can polarize on racial lines , McCain has a shot in Ohio and West Virginia .

The Malicious Software Removal Tool ( MSRT ) is a small program Microsoft pushes out to computers on Patch Tuesday to clean out a list of malware .
On this month 's Patch Tuesday , Microsoft added scans for a malware file that masks itself as security software , and it found plenty of copies .
Win32 / FakeSecSen has gone by various names , including Micro Antivirus 2009 , MS Antivirus , Spyware Preventer , Vista Antivirus 2008 , Advanced Antivirus , System Antivirus 2008 , Ultimate Antivirus 2008 , Windows Antivirus , XPert Antivirus , Power Antivirus , and Ultra Antivirus 2009 .
Furthermore , it is skinnable , so each of these variants has a different GUI , although the basic functionality is the same : bother users with warnings of malware until they pay up .
The Microsoft Malware Protection Center recently released some data on how the removal tool performed this month : FakeSecSen was removed from 994,061 machines .
That number is n't the highest Microsoft has recorded before , and the number of removals depends on which malware Microsoft adds each month and how widespread it is .
The company did note , however , that for every one thousand machines in the US scanned by MSRT during the last seven days , roughly five were infected with FakeSecSen rogues .
That 's quite high for just one piece of malware , but things could have been much worse , according to Microsoft :
Normally each FakeSecSen installation contains one EXE , one or two DAT files , one Control Panel applet ( CPL ) , one desktop shortcut and sometimes one uninstaller .
It is interesting that only 20 percent of these removals contain executables of FakeSecSen .
This indicates either the other 80 percent had at one point been infected by FakeSecSen and the threat was then manually and partially removed , or the machines were cleaned by other AV products / tools , or FakeSecSen had failed to install , etc .
Once Microsoft gets into the game of free real - time antivirus solutions , it will be worth watching how infection rates fare , instead of just taking note of cleanup numbers each month .

Gravity Anomaly detected by using 4 - way Doppler observation data from the RSTAR ( OKINA ) ( RSAT )
- New finding in study on the Origin of Dichotomy for the Moon -
JAXA announced a new finding of a gravity anomaly for both the near side and far side of the Moon by using 4 - way Doppler observation data from the RSTAR ( OKINA ) with the main orbiter , the KAGUYA .
Until now , the gravity anomaly of the far side of the Moon has not been understood well .
The gravity anomaly , which was obscure before , has been clearly revealed through observations by the Kaguya mission .
For instance , the gravity anomaly of a basin on the far side is found to be characterized by a negative anomaly in a ring like the Apollo basin .
On the other hand , the gravity anomaly of the basin on the near side is uniformly positive over the region such as with the Mare Serenitatis .
Thus , the clear difference in gravity anomaly on the near side and the far side has been newly discovered and this fact brings a different story about the structure of the underground and the history of the evolution of the far side and near side of the Moon .
The gravity anomaly map for many regions will be developed more precisely and show the difference of gravity anomaly between the near side and the far side by adding more observation data .
The latest observation data by the Kaguya will play a key role to promote the study of the origin and the evolution of the Moon .
In addition , highly accurate lunar gravity distribution data will be useful for future lunar explorers .
* Gravity anomaly :
The lunar gravity field is not homogenous .
Any region of the Moon with a higher than expected mass density will produce a gravity anomaly .
* Dichotomy of the Moon : Between the near side and the far side , clear asymmetry is called the " Dichotomy of the Moon " as in the thickness of the lunar crust and the distribution of the lunar Maria .
* RSAT / VRAD mission instrument team :
Kyushu University ( RSAT Principle Investigator ) , NAOJ ( VRAD : VLBI Satellite radio source Principle Investigator ) , Researchers from JAXA also participate as sub -PI or Co - I in the mission instrument team .

Current lunar gravity field models include large uncertainties on the far side of the Moon .
For instance , the figure in the middle shows the current gravity distribution model for the Apollo basin by LP165P .
The color of the figure shows strength of the gravity field in blue , green , yellow , and red , in that order .
Red indicates a positive gravity anomaly related to either a topographic high or a dense material in the subsurface .
In contrast , blue shows that a negative gravity anomaly related to a topographic low or less dense material .
The gravity anomaly shown in the figure on the left hand side is processed by new data taken by the KAGUYA .
The gravity anomaly in the Apollo basin is now identified as concentric rings of yellow , blue , and thin red from the center to outside .
* LP165P : Lunar gravity model developed by Konopliv et al ..
incorporating tracking data from the Lunar Prospector spacecraft into a historical data set .
A new gravity anomaly map developed by the KAGUYA reveals that not only the Apollo basin , but many other basins on the far side of the Moon are characterized by a large negative gravity anomaly .
Such a signature of far side gravity is distinguished from that on the near side .
For example , the Mare Serenitatis , the representative basin on the near side , shows a strong positive ( red color ) gravity anomaly at the center of the basin ( figure in the middle ) .
The newly found difference of gravity anomaly on the near side and the far side gives us clues to important questions regarding the structure of the lunar interior and the formation of the far side and near side of the Moon .
The gravity anomaly map will become more precise as more observation data is obtained by the KAGUYA .
The latest observation data by the Kaguya will play a key role to promote a study of the origin and the evolution of the Moon .
In addition , highly accurate lunar gravity distribution data will be used for future lunar explorations .

The uplink radio wave from the Usuda Deep Space Center ( UDSC ) is relayed to the Main Orbiter via the relay satellite ( OKINA ) , which is returned to the UDSC via relay satellite ( OKINA ) again .
Then the Doppler frequency is measured at the UDSC .

オバマ候補 大統領受諾演説の全 訳
まだどこかに、アメリカという国ではどんなことでも起こりうるということが信じられない人がいるのであれば、アメリカ建国の理念が今日も生きていることにまだ確信が持てずにいる人がいるのであれば、アメリカの民主主義の力に疑問を呈する人がいるのであれば、今晩がその答えだ。
その答えはかつてないほどの数の学校や教会を取り囲んだ長蛇の列に並んで、3時間も4時間も待っていた人々によって（そんなのは人生で初めての経験だろう）もたらされた。なぜなら、彼らは今回こそは違うと信じていたからだ。そして、彼らの声こそがその違いになったのだ。
その答えは語られた。若者によって、老人によって、金持ちによって、貧乏人によって、民主党支持者に、共和党支持者に、黒人、白人、ラティーノ、アジアン、ネイティヴ・アメリカン、ゲイ、ストレート、障害者、健常者によって。世界にメッセージを発信する全てのアメリカ人によって語られた。我々は単なる赤い州（共和党支持の州）と青い州（民主党支持の州）の集合ではないのだと（訳注：スピーチの中では雑多な個人の集合体ではない、という一節がここに入っていましたがテープ起こしに失敗してるんですかね）。我々は今も、これからもずっとアメリカ合衆国なのだ、と。
その答えは、我々が成し遂げようとしていたことに対してシニカルになれと、あるいは恐れよと、あるいは懐疑的になれと余りにも多くの人々から余りにも長い間言われ続けてきた人々が歴史の琴線に触れ,今一度それをより良き日々への希望に向けるよすがとなるものだ。
答えが出るまでには時間がかかった。が、今晩、我々が今日行った行為（投票）によって、この選挙で、まさにこの瞬間に、アメリカに変革が訪れたのだ。
ついさっき、マケイン上院議員からとても丁寧な電話を頂いた。彼は長い間ハードにこの選挙を戦ったが、彼は愛する国のためにもっと長い間、もっとハードに戦ってきたのだ。彼は我々の多くが想像し始めることさえも不可能な祖国への犠牲に耐え、この果敢にして無私のリーダーの下で我々の生活は改善してきた。私は彼とペイリン副大統領候補のこれまでの業績を称え、数ヵ月後にこの国の行く末を刷新するためにともに働く日々を楽しみにしている。
この旅路のパートナーに感謝したい。心から選挙に協力し、スクラントンのストリートで共に育ちデラウェア行きのあの電車で一緒に家に帰った仲間達のために話した男。合衆国副大統領、ジョー・バイデンだ。
この人の不屈のサポートがなければ私はここに立っていることすらできなかっただろう。この16年間の最良の友であり、我が家の要であり、我が愛であり、合衆国ファースト・レディであるミシェル・オバマ。サーシャとマリア、二人とも愛しているよ。約束どおり、ホワイトハウスに連れて行く子犬を選ぶといいよ。
そして、祖母はここにはいないけれど、彼女は家族と共に見守ってくれている。私を今の私にしてくれた家族と。今晩、ここにいないのが残念だ。彼らには、どれほど世話になったことだろう。
キャンペーン・マネージャーのデイビッド・プラウフ、主席ストラテジストのデイビッド・アクセルロッド、そして政治史上最高の選挙チーム、君達がこれを成し遂げた。そのために払ってくれた犠牲に対し、私は一生感謝を忘れない。
しかし、何よりも。私はこの勝利が本当は誰のものであるかを決して忘れない。貴方だ。この勝利は貴方のものだ。（訳注：スピーチではit belongs to you が二回でした ）
私が勝てそうな候補者であったことはなかった。資金もなければ支持もなかった。我々の選挙戦はワシントンのホールではなく、デモインの裏庭やコンコードの居間やチャールストンの玄関から始まったのだ。
それは、なけなしの貯金をまさぐらないと5ドル、10ドル、20ドルも出てこないような労働者達から始まった。次に、若者達が力をくれた。その年代は情熱を燃やすことがないという神話を否定し、安い賃金と少ない睡眠時間で働くために家を、親元を離れて協力してくれた。それほど若くない人々も極寒酷暑の中、全く見知らぬ人々の家をノックして回ってくれた。何百万人ものアメリカ人が、ボランティアとして組織をつくり、2世紀以上を経てもなお「人民の、人民による、人民のための政府」が地上から消滅していないことを証明した。これは、貴方たちの勝利だ。
貴方たちは、選挙に勝つだけのためにこれをやったのではないし、ましてや私のためにやったのでもない。貴方たちがここまでやったのは、ひとえにこの先に待ち構えている仕事が莫大であることを知っているからだ。こうして祝福している今日でさえ、明日やってくるであろう挑戦は人生で最も厳しいものになるだろうと知っている。二つの戦争、環境危機、今世紀最大の経済危機。我々が今晩ここに集っている間にも、イラクの砂漠やアフガニスタンの山で勇敢なアメリカ人が我々のために命をかけている。子供が寝た後で、どうやって住宅ローンを返済するか、医療費を支払うか、大学までの教育資金を捻出するか、悩んでいる両親がいる。制御しなければならない新たなエネルギーがあり、創出しなければならない新たな雇用があり、建設しなければならない新たな学校があり、敵が待ち構えていて、修復しなければならない同盟がある。
この先の道は長く、勾配は険しい。一年では辿り着けないかもしれないし、一期でも難しいかもしれない。だが、アメリカよ、私は今晩ほど希望を抱いたことはかつてない。私は貴方たちに約束する。我々は必ず成し遂げる。
後退することもあるだろう。道を間違うこともあるだろう。私が大統領として下す判断や政策に同意しない人は沢山いるだろうし、政府が全ての問題を解決できるわけでもない。だが、少なくとも我々が直面する課題に関して私は常に正直でいようと思う。私は貴方の言うことを聞く。同意が得られない場合には特に良く聞く。何よりも、私は貴方に参加して欲しいのだ。過去221年の間、この国がしてきたようにこの国を作り直す仕事に。1ブロックずつ。レンガ一個（1ブリック）ずつ。豆だらけの手で。
21ヶ月前の冬のさ中に始まったことが、この秋の晩に終わるわけではないのだ。この勝利それ自体は我々が望んだ変革ではない。変革を起こすチャンスを与えてくれただけだ。ここで後戻りしたら何も起こらない。貴方の協力がなければ何も起こらない。
だから、新たに愛国の精神を、奉仕と責任の精神を呼び覚まそう。我々が問題に一生懸命に取り組み、自分だけではなく互いに助け合えるよう決意するために。この経済危機がもたらした教訓を思い出そう。それは、メイン・ストリートの具合が悪いときにウォール・ストリートだけが繁栄することはできないという教訓だった。少なくともこの国では。我々は一つの国、一つの民として運命を共にするのだ。
党派心、近視眼、未熟さといった、これまでに余りにも長い間政治が陥ってきた同じ過ちに陥らないようにしよう。共和党の旗を最初にホワイトハウスに持って行ったのはこの州出身の男だったことを思い出そう。共和党は信頼と個人の自由と国家の団結に価値を置く政党だが、その価値観は我々全てが共有するものだ。今晩、民主党が偉大な勝利を手にしたが、我々は謙虚に、そして我々の進行を妨げる断絶を修復する決意を持って、この価値観を共有しよう。リンカーンは現在よりも遥かに分断された国民に向かって説いた。「我々は敵ではなく友である。情熱は友愛の絆をすり減らしたかもしれないが、絆を完全に壊してはいけない」だから、今後、私が助力を必要とするであろうアメリカ人達に伝えたい。私は貴方を選挙で勝たせることはできないかもしれない。だが、貴方の言うことに耳を傾けよう。貴方の助力が必要なのだ。そして、私も大統領の責務を果たそう。
そして、海の向こうから今晩の様子を見ている人達に伝えたい。議事堂や王宮からうち捨てられた街角のラジオに集う人々まで。我々の物語は別々かもしれないが、我々の運命は共有されている。新しいアメリカのリーダーシップの時代がやってくる。世界を引き裂こうとしている者は、我々が打ち滅ぼそう。平和と安全を希求する者は、我々がサポートしよう。そして、今でもアメリカはそれほど輝いているのかと疑問に思う者よ。我々の強さの源は軍事力でも経済力でもなく、尽きることない理念、すなわち、民主主義、自由、機会、絶えない希望なのだということを、今晩我々は今一度証明したのだ。
アメリカの真の資質はアメリカは変わることができるという点なのだ。我々の団結は完璧になりうる。これまでに成し遂げてきたことが、明日から成し遂げなければならない事への希望となる。
この選挙では多くの史上初と多くの物語が生まれ、語り継がれていくだろう。だが、今晩私の頭にあるのはアトランタで投票した女性の物語だ。彼女は、選挙を通じて声を届かせようと列に並ぶ何百万人もの人々となんら変わる所はない。唯一つ、アン・ニクソン・クーパーが106歳だということを除いては。
彼女は奴隷制直後の世代に生まれ、当時の道路には車がなく飛行機もなかった。更に、二つの理由で選挙に参加することもできなかった。彼女が女性であり、皮膚の色が違ったからだ。
そして今宵、私は彼女がアメリカで過ごした１世紀を思う。悲嘆と希望。闘争と前進。我々にはできない、と言われ続け、そのアメリカ人の信条を押し付けられた日々。
Yes we can（いや、できるさ ）
女性の声は押し殺され、女性の望みはかき消された時代。彼女は見た。女性が立ち上がり、声を上げるのを。そして今晩、投票所にやってきた。
Yes we can（そう、できるんだ ）
（ 1930年代）砂嵐の被害に苦しむ中南部には絶望が、そして国中に憂鬱が蔓延した時代。彼女は見た。ニューディール政策、新しい職と新しい公共心によって国が自力で恐怖を克服する様を。
Yes we can
爆弾が我々の湾に降り注ぎ、世界が独裁者の脅威に晒されたとき。彼女は見た。その世代の人々が偉大にも立ち上がり民主主義が救われるのを。
Yes we can
彼女は見た。モントゴメリのバスを、バーミングハムの放水を、セルマの橋を。そして、彼女は聞いた。アトランタから来た宣教師が人々に「我々は勝利する」と語るのを。
Yes we can
人類が月に到達し、ベルリンの壁は崩され、我々の科学と創造力によって世界中が結ばれた。今年、この選挙で彼女は指でスクリーンに触れるだけで投票した。106年もの間アメリカで生活し、最良のときも最悪のときも経験してきた彼女は、アメリカがいかに変われるかを知っている。
Yes we can
アメリカよ、我々はここまでやってきた。実に多くを見てきたが、実に多くが手付かずだ。だから今宵、我々は自問しよう。我々の子供達が来世紀を見るならば、私の娘達が幸運にもアン・ニクソン・クーパーほど長生きできたなら、どんな変化を目撃するのだろう？どんな進歩を成し遂げているのだろう？
これは、その問いに答えるべく、我々に与えられたチャンスだ。我々の時、我々の時代なのだ。人々を仕事に戻し子供達に機会のドアを開く、繁栄を取り戻し平和を推進する、アメリカンドリームを再生し根本的な真実を再確認する、つまり、多くの場面で我々は一体である。共に生き、共に望む。シニカルであったり懐疑的であったり、我々にそれは無理だと言い続けるような人々に出会った場合には、我々は人々の精神の総和である朽ちることない信念をもって応える。
Yes we can（いや、できるさ ）
ありがとう。貴方に神の祝福を。アメリカに神の祝福を。

びじうのログ : オバマ候補 大統領就任演説の全訳
Conservatives like to talk about personal responsibility , but Attorney General Michael Mukasey does not seem to think it applies to the Bush administration .
In a speech on Tuesday , he described the shameful politicization of the Justice Department as a “ painful ” episode in which “ the system failed . ”
Mr. Mukasey made no mention of the role played by his predecessor , Alberto Gonzales , and other members of President Bush ’s inner circle .
There is by now strong reason to believe that they were involved in plans to fire United States attorneys for political reasons , fill other important positions on the basis of partisanship rather than competence and order prosecutions designed to help Republicans win elections .
The department has never properly pursued the bad actors .
It has shown no real concern for the victims .
Mr. Mukasey ’s cynical remarks shrugging off the whole scandal should prod Congress to pursue it even more vigorously .
The Justice Department ’s inspector general and its ethics office have issued a pair of reports confirming that top aides to Mr. Gonzales improperly used political litmus tests to fill nonpolitical positions .
The politics was remarkably crude .
One example : a career terrorism prosecutor was turned down for a counterterrorism position because his wife was an active Democrat .

A classic experiment exploring the origin of life has , more than a half - century later , yielded new results .
In 1953 , Stanley L. Miller , then a graduate student of Harold C. Urey at the University of Chicago , put ammonia , methane and hydrogen  the gases believed to be in early Earth ’s atmosphere  along with water in a sealed flask and applied electrical sparks to simulate the effects of lightning .
A week later , amino acids , the building blocks of proteins , were generated out of the simple molecules .
Enshrined in high school textbooks , the Miller - Urey experiment raised expectations that scientists could unravel the origins of life with simple chemistry experiments .
The excitement has long since subsided .
The amino acids never grew into the more complex proteins .
Scientists now think the composition of air on early Earth was much different from what Dr. Miller used , leading some to question whether the Miller - Urey experiment had any relevance to the still unsolved problem of the origin of life .
By Paul Reynolds
World affairs correspondent , BBC News website
Guantanamo Bay has been at the centre of the debate on civil liberties Sir Ken Macdonald , the outgoing Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales , said in his final speech on 20 October : " We need to take very great care not to fall into a way of life in which freedom 's back is broken by the relentless pressure of a security state . "
But as governments react to the changing threats posed since the 2001 terror attacks on the US , what has been the impact on civil liberties in western societies ?
Guantanamo Bay , military tribunals , renditions , water - boarding , warrantless surveillance - all these have been part of US policy since 9/11 .
In the UK , meanwhile , detention without charge for 28 days ( and an attempt to extend that to 42 days ) , control orders and more data collection are now facts of life .
These measures demonstrate that the system of protecting civil liberties has creaked and sometimes cracked in two of the countries most at threat from terrorist attacks .
" For the first couple of years after 9/11 , the Bush administration fought terrorism without regard for human rights , " said Kenneth Roth , executive director of Human Rights Watch in New York .
But in the last two years , Mr Roth said , there had been " a reaffirmation of human rights and a scaling back of the worst abuses " .
Mr Roth said upholding human rights was a better way of improving security " [ US President George W ]
Bush said the secret CIA sites would be closed temporarily and it seems they have not been used since .
" Congress has laid down that inhumane treatment should not be used anywhere in the world and the US army produced a good field manual on interrogation which should now be extended to the CIA as well .
" The CIA lives in its own world , however .
This remains a big issue for the next US president .
" So does Guantanamo , which should be closed and the detainees either tried in the US or released . "
Aiming for balance
For many governments , the key issue has been how to balance civil liberties against civil security .
British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said earlier this year : " The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 strikes the right balance between safeguarding society and safeguarding the rights of the individual . "
Britain has been successful in prosecuting cases through the normal courts .
There has been no recourse , as there was in Northern Ireland , to abolish jury trials .
But there has been controversy .
Jacqui Smith says current anti-terror legislation strikes the right balance
The balance in the UK recently swung back when , after strong opposition , the government dropped its proposal to extend no - charge detention for up to 42 days .
Under the Human Rights
Act that incorporates the European Human Rights Convention into British law , UK courts have also held up the deportation of suspects to countries where torture might be used against them .
This is currently under appeal .
Britain still hopes to develop a huge database of e-mail and telephone traffic , collecting addresses and numbers that could be used to track terrorist contacts - something opponents fear will be used on so - called fishing expeditions by intelligence services .
It is also still using control orders ( currently imposed on 16 people ) though again the courts have set limits , for example to the hours someone can be confined indoors .
The Bush approach President Bush , on the other hand , tends to use the word " balance " in a different way .
In his State of the Union address in January he said : " This war is more than a clash of arms - it is a decisive ideological struggle , and the security of our nation is in the balance . "
In such a war , he feels , strong methods are required .
He can argue that he has stopped any further major attacks since 9/11 .
George W Bush has made tightening up US borders a priority American tactics often impact externally because that is where the main threats to the US have come from , as on 9/11 itself .
There is the additional constraint from the US constitution internally , which requires the normal use of the criminal law .
Therefore , tightening up US borders has been a priority .
The latest device is to require of EU countries that they send no less than 19 sets of details about air passengers , including details of any special diets requested and credit cards used .
The threat to the UK has more often come from internal sources , usually from young Muslim men radicalised by religion and world events .
Britain also has a large population with a family background in Pakistani Kashmir , where a tradition of militancy against India can easily be swung into antagonism against the West .
Therefore , British anti-terrorism strategy has concentrated more on internal threats .
As well as the intelligence and police campaigns against actual perpetrators , this strategy has added political , educational and persuasive tactics to prevent people from turning to terrorism in the first place .
A new round of discussions about the direction of this strategy is to begin in January .
' Terrorist narrative '
In a major speech about new trends in terrorism on 15 October , Ms Smith said : " This new terrorism actively seeks to recruit people in this country and to subvert our institutions .
" It has a detailed public narrative that claims to justify the killing of civilians .
But it has more than this - it also has the electronic means to disseminate that narrative very quickly and very widely . "
While critical of the lengthy no-charge detention period in the UK , Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch also criticised France , which he said has too low a threshold for evidence , including hearsay .
This can lead to a lengthy detention under the holding charge of " criminal association " .
In his opinion , the country which seems to come out best is Spain .
" Despite the [ Basque separatist group ] ETA threat and the Madrid bombings , Spain has in many ways proved to be a model among governments because it has prosecuted in the usual way , " said Mr Roth .
This , he said , supported his argument that security and human rights are not at opposite ends of the spectrum : Maintenance of human rights is a better way of improving security .
" Abuses are a boon to terrorist recruiters , " said Mr Roth .
" There has been a recognition that the breaking of terrorist conspiracies depends less on interrogation than on the cooperation of the public .
" If the public sees itself as complicit in a dirty war , especially if a community identifies itself with the suspects , that makes it harder . "
Breaking the rules
How is this all seen by the Human Rights Commissioner for the Council of Europe ( COE ) , the body that oversees the European Convention on Human Rights , the bedrock of human rights in its 47 member states ?
The commissioner is Thomas Hammarberg , a Swede who once headed Amnesty International .
" I think that governments have tried to stretch and break the rules , " he said .
" The proposed British 42 - day legislation was not in the spirit of the Human Rights convention . "
I think that governments have tried to stretch and break the rules
Thomas Hammarberg
COE Human Rights Commissioner
He added that the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay broke trial procedures .
" The defendant should be able to see all evidence , " said Mr Hammarberg .
" There should be well - founded grounds for any detention .
" As for the ' balance ' concept , I avoid the word .
Human rights and civil liberties should apply in all situations .
Rights are most relevant when there is a threat or a crisis .
" I am extremely worried about the data protection aspect the moment .
The danger is that there will be more trawls through the data bases according to pre-determined profiles .
This is already happening .
He said he was also concerned by the EU agreeing to supply the US with details about air travellers .
Not everyone sees data bases and other intelligence - gathering operations in a dark light .
Dr Philip Davies , a security expert and lecturer at the UK's Brunel University in London said a data base for e-mail and phone calls was not a " vacuum cleaner " .
" It is a microscope , " he said .
" You have to understand that to get at a few bits of information you have to gather lots if it .
The civil liberties argument is certainly overstated .
" It is not unreasonable to try to keep track of certain communications .
Critics often talk about the fantastically improbable as if going after one intercept is going after them all . "
Data collection is shaping up to be another battleground .

What are these ?
The President - elect of the Maldives wants to set aside funds to buy a new homeland as rising sea levels threaten to submerge the island archipelago .
Mohamed Nasheed says money would be invested in the fund from the profits of the country 's tourist industry .
Most of the land mass of the Maldive Islands stand little more than a metre above sea level .
Environmentalists believe that if global warming continues unchecked they will eventually disappear under the waves of the Indian Ocean .
The President - elect said it already broached the idea of buying land with a number of countries and found them to be receptive .
Mr Nasheed said that Sri Lanka and India were possible sites because of their proximity and similar cultures .
But he also said that Australia was also being considered because of the amount of unoccupied land there .
“ Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic . ” – Arthur C. Clarke
It ’s a curious situation– mars has abundant evidence that life did at one point exist , so what happens when we find it ?
Whether it is a living microbe or fossilized remains , what would this do for religion , culture , civilization ?
In this solar system , to find life twice would be profound .
It would redefine our perspective as sentient beings in the galaxy .
We are life , but life arises abundantly .
It bubbles up where the right conditions are met ( And these conditions vary in extraordinary ways ) , and flourishes in the right conditions .
On mars , there may have been seas with vast forms of life , rivers and forests and an atmosphere similar to ours .
If we find more evidence for these theories , how would we go about things in the future ?
Would missionaries build churches on the moon and Mars ?
How would a space age affect our religion ?
Can we conceive of the Catholic Church revamping its doctrine , and evangelical radicals postponing the rapture ?
Would new religions arise , where older archetypes evolve into new ones ; Cosmic Christ , Buddha Universe ?
It seems for sure that new things would happen .
How could n’t they ?
With every end of an age , new attitudes emerge that are reflective of them .
I ’m just wondering if we will truly shake loose some of the things we take for granted in our time .
To sum it up in a few words ,
“ Politics and religion are obsolete ; the time has come for science and spirituality . ” - Sri Jawaharlal Nehru , from The Fountains of Paradise , Arthur C. Clarke
Religion , in the sense of a crystallized structure of beliefs and worldviews , I think , has greatly begun to dissolve into new cultural attitudes .
We ’ve emerged from our nests , so to speak– if only during the past century .
Secrets of the universe are being unlocked by science , particularly within physics ( LHC and other amazing innovations ) .
We find ourselves in a ever stranger universe , and now possibly a multiverse ; the idea that we are beyond time , that there are greater dimensions to existence which we are a part of but do not see , and that we can see a greater picture of ourselves in the cosmos– these things are now compatible and often reflected on by the sciences .
A greater cosmology is at work , and perhaps in the future , it will totally shift our attitudes to re-embrace spirituality in a deeper light .
Stranger still , seeing us as space dust that has become self - aware ; what new religions might emerge from this ?
I think I ’ll write further on this , because I really do find it fascinating .
Religion as it stands today may be reaching its end , but Spirituality seems more compatible with the great cosmologies physics is unveiling .
Of course these things will eventually crystallize , become established and “ common knowledge , ” like “ cosmic consciousness soundbytes ” and Buddha - Minute meditations , but they will exist nevertheless , in the same way we may stare at ancient religious practices as odd or somehow strange , so too may societies view our own practices as most unusual .
All that being , can you think of what future ritual would be like ?
( Edit , the rest of this is an extension , due to some reader ’s recommendations .
I was focusing on the more existential stuff , but this could be fun too … )
1. Immortality –
It may seem along the lines of science fiction , but some scientists predict we will be immortal within a few generations .
Super - computers , should they break the DNA code , could cure diseases , extend life for decades and enhance positive traits .
Of course , there are nightmares that could come as well , but with any new form of technology , new dangers arise with it .
2. Genetic Art , Health , Warfare -
It ’s conceivable that we would go through terrible genetic wars , see the rise of super soldiers and super - germs .
On the other hand , genetic alterations could be considered art forms …
Life forms being created as art , human bodies not being exempt from this .
Today , we have tattoos and piercings , we dye our hair and go to tanning salons .
But tomorrow , could we change our face , eye and hair color , or even our body structure ?
Would switching genders be as easy as going to get a haircut ?
It may become easier to create the perfect heart , lungs , intestines , replace defective organs with healthier ones .
This may be looking very far into the future .
For more gender - bending science fiction , I recommend Ursula DeGuin .
This may go a bit further than religion , but the philosophy of human identity .
What would it be to be human ?
What would Christianity do to appeal to a culture that can shift between genders ?
Would patriarchy finally fade away , and some new form of ideology replace it ?
This almost goes without saying but , if we were to finally be immortal , what appeal would Heaven have on humans in the future , if any ?
You might see our age religions fading away entirely as relics from the past , just as the Greek gods are no longer worshipped or considered .
What would they be replaced by ?
Archetypes are common throughout every culture , and they evolve as the culture morphs with time and technology .
Would future archetypes , spiritually speaking , become trans - gendered , immortal beings ?
Would some archetypes be machines ?
3 . In the Net - It ’s also conceivable , as it is already somewhat of a reality , that we could link ourselves up to machines .
If these thinking machines can be connected to brain and thought commands , it ’s possible we could always be online .
Imagine surfing the internet with a thought ?
We would appear to be psychic being , truly sending each other “ instant messages , ” via thought commands and signals .
A deeper sense of connectedness might appear alarming and intriguing .
There may be groups that utilize this for prayers , rituals , and other things as one , but many .
Others may choose not to have such link - ups to the “ net , ” casting away the hive for autonomy .
3 . The Machines Who Sing , Dance and Pray : Artificial intelligence may be on its way to reality within the next 50 years .
What will these machines be like ?
Certainly not quite like us .
Could they feel without the same chemical makeup as us ?
Or would they simply be self - aware , logic based creatures ?
Imagine for a moment , a thinking machine working with a particle physics lab .
One day , amongst all the code and data crunching , it writes a poem .
Another machine spends a fraction of its time praying , or asking existential questions ?
It ’s quite possible that AI could develop the capacity to question its own existence , and ponder a greater whole .
Would a machine pray ?
Could machines create a religion ?
4. Human ’s become cyborg -
If we could link our brains up to the internet , could we also start replacing organic bodies with synthetic ones , if the artificial bodies indeed become better ?
In the far future , homo - sapien may be replaced with homo - superior , to so speak .
Would flesh then be an accessory ?
This leads to the next possibility .
Could a human brain be uploaded onto a computer - brain ?
Would it just be a copy , or could we actually transfer that same person into a different existence ?
This is talked about in 3001 , The Final Oddysey by Arthur C. Clarke .
5. Going Beyond Our Universe–
Say that , in a million years , humans have all but disappeared .
In their place , a strange species made of wire and hard drives now lives on the earth .
They also live throughout the solar system , as they cannot die , and time is quite a different matter to them .
There are inquisitive colonies on Mars , Europa and Enceladus , tampering with new - found or perhaps new - created organic life .
There are spaceships headed into deep space , as embassadors to solar systems that may have life .
These beings do not eat as we do , nor think as we do .
They have autonomy , but they are also hive - mind .
Flesh and organic parts are “ experiences , ” they can have a vocation for , but it is not necessary anymore .
Say , in the hundreds of thousands of years of reaching out into the galaxy , they unlock further secrets of the universe , the very building blocks of everything .
They understand the big- bang , dark matter , and other things we are striving to conceive of today , and they find ways to manipulate the building blocks of the universe , or multiverse itself .
What reason would they have for God ? Religion ?
Would they believe as the Buddhists do , that we are all one ?
Would God be the Singularity ?
Digging deeper into these strange possibilities , would they be a Bodhisattvic race of wise and ancient beings ?
Or would they still have drives and imperfections , as we do ?
If they unlocked the secrets of the cosmos , could they embed their own consciousness into the fabric of the universe ?
Into the 5th , 6th , and 7th dimensions ?
If so , would they be as alien to us as the greys and other such extra-terrestrial creatures are ?
Their religion and ritual , I would imagine if they had it , would be purely for the experience of oneness , unity consciousness , Nirvana , etc .
They might tell us , “ This was always so , ” and it would be true , “ You need only recognize it first . ”
Alright , I need to get back down from this trip , and go to class !

Why is n't the mainstream media reporting this voter fraud that 's happening now .
Also : Watch the Documentary " Uncounted " they show how the election was stolen for Bush in 2004 against Kerry .
We cannot allow this to happen .
https://bradblog.com/?cat=166
McCain made a statement today saying that he " Guarantee " you he 's going to win this election and he do n't believe the polls .
He said that because the exit polls numbers , he know they are rigging this election for him .
He also said the count will go on over into the night .
How does he know already the vote count will go into the night .
This is the same thing that happened in the Documentary " Uncounted " they kept saying the race was too close to call and the exit polls numbers were totally different from the machine count and they did n't know why .
McCain keep saying the race is closer than we think .
America we can't keep letting them rig these elections .
Where is the Democracy in all this .
The Diebold voting machines are owned by the Republican party .
Let 's put a stop to this right now .
A friend of mine went to early vote the other day , she was using the Diebold machine , she voted for Obama , when she pressed the VOTE button John McCain 's name came up on the screen .
This is FRAUD and something should be done about it now .

Brad , I have been reading your blog , the velvet revolution site , the wiki site , and others .
But I did n't think that this sort of thing would actually happen to someone I know .
My sister called me yesterday to tell me that she registered to vote in Nevada but her name is not on the rolls .
I gave her the phone number to the Election Protection Center and we sent a complaint to Obamas website .
She plans to make a phone call to Election Protection Monday .
If anyone on this blog has any suggestions or advice it would be appreciated .
Thanks .

" We 've been monitoring voting machines to ensure that they record the vote accurately . "
That is a ridiculous statement .
Since that part of the strategy is n't secret , they should be able to tell us everything about how they are " monitoring " the machines .
The people whose job it is to test the machines do n't even do that .
It 's an insulting statement .
Just got my copy of " Murder Spies and Voting Lies . "
Very nice !

In 2004 , my daughter in Georgia voted for Kerry and the machine told her she voted for Bush .
She cancelled it , and another flip .
Twice .
She is NOT one to take this sort of thing tamely .
She left the cubicle and confronted the officials in charge .
LOUDLY .
They tried to " Shush " her , but she does n't " Shush . "
Finally , they agreed to take the offending machine off line and allow her to vote on a different machine , which did , indeed , apparently register the vote as she cast it .
After it was all over , she asked me , " How do I know that they did take the crooked machine off line , and how do I know that my vote was actually cast the way I wanted ? "
I replied , " You do n't .
The odds are that your suspicions are well - grounded ; it was Georgia , after all ! "

Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist , but maybe the DNC does not want to reveal their monitoring tactics for fear that the republicans might circumvent it and steal the election .
Never let the enemy know what you are going to do and keep them guessing .
I hope that the DNC does have a sound strategy to ensure every vote is counted correctly and there will be no come - from - behind miracle surprise victories for McCain on election day in all of those swing states including Pennsylvania , which has Obama up in the polls by double digits .
If McCain does win , which goes against all of the polling data , including Nate Silver 's 538. com 's 10,000 computer simulations , my fear is that the " Bradley Effect " will be used to explain the disparity between the tracking polls , exit polls , and the actual vote count .
At that point , I can only hope all of the electronic voting machines will be impounded and forensic computer experts will be able to see if any of the machines were rigged to flip votes from democrat to republican .

Hey Brad !
You 're wrong about the Repug motive in their motion to intervene .
They are not attempting to help voters here .
What they 're in fact doing is attempting to piggyback themselves into the suit brought by the NAACP / Dems that challenges voter suprression tactics ( crappy e-vote machines , i.e. ) and trying to gum it up by improperly inserting specious claims of voter fraud .
Go back and read their motion .
Also discuss it with an attorney , and then pleae make updates to your post .
I do n't think you understood understood what you were reading , and because of your misunderstanding , your blog readers are currently misinformed .
The only way someone can legitimate sue and not be booted from court is if the party has " standing " and suffered " actual harm "
The Dems and NAACP can prove that their voters have suffered harm and that voters are being harmed by the crappy equipment , etc .
The repugs can't prove or show instances of actual voter fraud because it is n't there .
So they 're looking for any available avenue to cast doubt on the election .

I 've been thinking about this touchscreen mess and the obvious visual evidence that votes are being flipped .
As a neophite computer tinkerer , the only thing I can equate this to is when you remove or replace hardware such as a video card .
If you do n't remove all of the old drivers a conflict occurs with unpredictable results .
In this case I believe it 's a failure to fully remove the legitimate code when installing the malicious code over it .
In other words , this is just an example of poor installation of the theft program .
It would seem that when the installation is performed correctly , you would n't see your vote flip at all , and that it 's likely that is the majority of the cases .
If so , this is the tip of the iceberg .

ECS - I 'll take the blame for , perhaps , wording it sloppily in my article above ( as usual right around now , working really quickly on too many things at once . )
But I did not say that Republicans " attempting to help voters here . "
I said the opposite .
Or at least tried to .
In other words , I agree with you that the Repubs are trying to block voters ability to cast a vote .
Unfortunately , they are on the side of state Dems in this matter .
While Obama and the DNC did nothing to oppose the state Dems and finally the NAACP had to come in with a ( fairly tame ) lawsuit to oppose state Dems .
For an attempt at clarity : + A month ago , the PA SoS ( a Dem ) issued a directive saying no paper ballots need to be given out unless all machines in a precinct break down .
+ Obama / DNC did nothing to oppose .
+ Finally , NAACP and a local Election Protection coalition filed suit to demand paper ballots be given out if a " majority " of machines break down ( that , even though state law allows paper ballots to be given out if just one machine in a precinct breaks down !
Nonetheless , at least some action was taken by somebody . )
+ The Republicans filed to intervene , essentially taking the side of the state Dems against the NAACP , to say paper ballots should not be given out .
Hope that clarifies what I was trying to write in the original article

My son lives in Las Vegas and sent in a registration to vote .
He later checked on line to make sure he was registered .
He was not listed .
He called the elections office and was told that his registration was invalid because there were more than three days between the date on his application [ which he admits sat on his desk for a week ] and the post mark date !
My son then asked for a provisional ballot and was told that they would have to see if he was entitled to one .
They have never gotten back to him .
Yes , he 's a Democrat .
I could n't believe there was such a law - or , if there is such a law , it is yet another voter suppression " gotcha " slipped into the Nevada Law .
After reviewing the law , I concluded that the elections clerk interpreted the law improperly ( see below ) .
The statute - NRS 293.5235 - says : 7 . The applicant shall be deemed to be registered or to have corrected the information in the register : ( a) If the application is received by the county clerk or postmarked not more than 3 working days after the applicant completed the application , on the date the applicant completed the application ; or ( b ) If the application is received by the county clerk or postmarked more than 3 working days after the applicant completed the application , on the date the application is received by the county clerk .
This is the analysis of the statute that I made and which my husband agreed with ( we are both Oregon lawyers ) :
I read that to mean that the “ date of registration ” is the date RECEIVED by the registrar if the date of the application is more than three days prior to the postmark ; i.e .
Greg IS registered to vote in NV as of the date it was received by the elections office ( which I recall was about a week before the deadline ) .
This law does NOT reject voter registrations with more than 3 days between the date on the voter registration and the post mark date .
Greg needs to call his county Elections Director and tell him / her about this faulty interpretation .
If he ca n’t get satisfaction there , he needs to call the Secretary of State who directs the counties on election matters .
I will pass on the other contact information to my son provided by Brad .
He will definitely follow up .
It is one thing to pass on these " anecdotes " and say there is a real problem , and it is a whole other thing to be the voter trying to register and trying to vote and being told you can't .
This is where your constitutional right to vote is tested .
Is it worth fighting for ?
Damn right !

Go to your county registrar or board of elections .
Demand to see your voter file and the original voter registration card .
Get copies .
Tell them you will sue them for violating NVRA and have illegally disenfranchised you .
Do n't believe them if they tell you to vote provisionally .

I 'm probably dreaming , but I 'm hoping that the Dems are doing a " keep the powder dry " maneuver , watching and staying prepared to do their own flipping , if need be , when they see the Pubs trying to flip to a win .
Howard Dean knows about the flips and rigs of ' 04 and '06 .
Surely many other Dems in places of power know this , too .
Obama has been seen hanging around with Pub Senator Chuck Hagel , he of questionable election fame , as Hagel was an owner of the voting machine company that counted votes for his own " miracle upset " election .
See : http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0301/S00166.htm
If Hagel is an Obama man , maybe he 's giving advice on counter - rigs , which of course would have to be kept secret in order to be activated at the last minute to win ...
Either way , it 's insane , and Dem flipping and hacking and rigging would be just as terrible as Pub hacking and flipping and rigging .

I suspect that Kerry took a dive ( boxing term ) .
During the time between the convention and the general election , Kerry ran a miserable campaign , while raising millions of dollars for legal challenges after the election AND promissing that he would n't give up like Gore ( " until all the votes are counted " ) .
BUT after the election , he immediately CAVED .
No legal challenge , no support for the Green Party recount or the Cong. K. recount .
Where the hell did the millions of dollars he raised for legal challenges go ?
I 'd like to know .
Hopefully I 'm wrong , but I smell a big black rat named OBama .
I sure have n't seen him do anything about voter suppression and at this point in time , I have no confidence in the DNC .
Everyone is scratching their heads wondering why McCain is pulling resources from Red states and moving them into Pennsylvania .
Well , I have a one - word explanation : DRE (s ) .
Does n't most of PA use DRE (s ) with no paper audit trail ?
Computer generated voting that cannot be " recounted " ???
If McCain wins a suprise vicory in PA and NC ( I think NC also uses DRE Machines ) , Every MSN outlet will proclaim : " BRADLEY EFFECT ! " " BRADLEY EFFECT ! "
" All those white racist votes in PA and NC lied to the pollsters , they just could n't stomach a black man in the White House . "
What do we do if this scenario plays out and Obama pulls another Kerry ?
What do we do then ???
Just curious , is there a list of which states use unverifiable voting machines ?

I just saw this :
" CNN : 50,000 purged from voter rolls in Georgia " RAW STORY W/video : http://rawstory.com/news...om_voter_rolls_1027.html
Where is the DNC ?
Adam Fulford : " What is wrong with them .
Why are they being so dense ?!
Twilight Zone dense " I have a hateful and cynical theory about that .
Who benefits if the status quo is maintained ?
Who benefits now ?
Is there a doubt that the DNC is not controlled by entrenched special interests and IMO as terrified of ' transformational change ' as the RNC ?
What does it matter to a political power structure who the President is as long as they have enough votes in Congress to benefit their own interest 's which may well be different than the interest's of the voter ?
In what substantive way have the Democrats distinguished themselves from the Republicans over the last two years ?
Do we have one party or two in America ?
I believe that the Democrats came into the majority in 2006 with a plan .
In a negotiation ( And all of politics is a negotiation for power , current and future power to advance a political faction 's aims , whatever they may be . ) any basic book on the topic will tell you that the most risky , potentially damaging ( to your side ) and potentially effective tactic is to work against both your own and your opposers best interest .
I think that the Democrats made a decision that the country 's voters needed to suffer more as a spur to vote for Democrats in 2008 .
The aim was for a Democratic majority in Congress and with luck a Democratic President .
They set about facilitating the Republican agenda to achieve just that end .
All they had to do was hold a lot of hearings and stay in the news as the party of reform while the Republicans brought the country to its knees .
It looks to me to have been a successful position to take .
It worked .
Here 's the problem : Barack Obama , while hardly a liberal , is the contemporary Jimmy Carter .
Voters were so desperate to exorcise the Nixon / Republican demon that they voted for a virtually unknown Governor in response .
Carter ran a masterful two year campaign energizing the working class ( Obama 's campaign has been / is very similar . ) and once he got in office he was such an outsider the Democrats would n't work with him .
He could n't get any domestic legislation he wanted passed .
Obama is not the Party choice , he is the peoples choice .
The Party would have been ecstatic with Clinton as the nominee ; a long - time pol that knows where the bodies are buried and how the job get done but that 's not who they have as their presidential nominee .
An outsider on the wrong side of the class line ( or he gives that appearance anyway ) is who they have .
If the major political thrust of the last 28 years is class warfare with the wealth and power of the nation moving upward and being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands a ' reformer ' that pledges to halt or reverse that trend is the last person either political party wants to see .
How does the party eat its cake and have it too :
Make the race close .
Even if their guy wins there would be no clear mandate .
Inaction on election fraud could do that and all the Republicans have left is election fraud at this point , they wo n't win on merit .
This puts Obama in the same position Carter was in when he took office but with less of a popular majority .
With a Democratic majority in Congress ( and there will be a lot of Republicans that cozy up to them ) that can withstand a Republican filibuster or a President 's veto the PARTY retains power and can maintain whatever level of the status quo that benefits them .
Even if Obama were to lose there will in all likelihood still be a Democratic majority in Congress .
The same ends could be achieved .
I think the Democrats have been learning from the Republicans .
This is a way to allow the Republicans to , in essence , ' steal ' the election for the Democratic PARTY ( and ownership class ) which allows the Democratic Party to become the more powerful faction of what has become essentially the same political party .
I am totally cynical ( downright nihilistic in fact ) when it comes to politics in America but not even I believe the Democrats are so stupid and inept as to let a Presidential election be stolen THREE times using the same tactics without being in on it .
This race is n't being stolen , it 's been fixed .
I sure hope I 'm just plain foolish and wrong .

You are more wise and reasonable than even Brad on this one .
We need to WIN the election and Barack 's attoney 's are not there to FIX a broken system nor are they dumb enough to spend resources on vote problems in a solidly red state .
Casting doubts about the system could be exactly what the RW 's wish for at this point in time because they know their arse is being handed to them .
Furthermore - When Barack wins is that suppose to mean the election was n't fixed ?
As if an Obama win could mean - all voting problems have been addressed ?
That is an additional risk for the perceptions of LIV's and RW's .
Maybe it 's just me .

Former programmer .
Comment :
Any coder writing vote stealing code should not be so stupid - utterly incompetent - as to not make sure the screen displayed the voter 's choice , even tho the recorded vote be opposite .
Ditto paper .
I think what you see with the flipping is just really bad programming , which is perhaps even worse than cheating .
The problem with viewing a gross error such as what is happening now as cheating is this : when they fix the glitch , everyone will consider the voting machines " fixed " .
The machines cannot be fixed , cannot be trusted , as one never knows what code actually runs from microsecond to microsecond .
We can't have a meme start that equates a lack of screen errors = problem solved .
I do deduce that real cheating is going to happen , esp. in close congressional races that they simply cannot afford to lose , else the Demos will have supermajority .
The cheating , I think , will be in certain locations in specific districts that they need to win , as they did in Ohio in 2004 .

I was on a conference call concerning election protection with one of these " election protection " attorneys yesterday .
She improperly informed the activists who were being asked to gather news reports from the polls that they had to stay beyond the 100 foot boundary which Florida and many states have established .
However , that boundary has been held to violate freedom of the press which even citizen journalists enjoy .
See the letter to the election officers that Project Vote Count used in Ohio and Texas and the injunction in the CBS case .
Of course , the " election protection " attorney also refused to answer a question which I asked twice and which drew laughs from many on the call who follow my work and know the truth .
This unanswerable question was " is it unconstitutional to count votes in secret ? "
The answer is YES !!!
See , for examples Virginia ’s Elections Are UNCONSTITUTIONAL ?!?! and South Carolina Elections Are UNCONSTITUTIONAL !?!
Apparently , if you are working on " election protection " for one of those big well funded organizations , you are really just trying to help keep people in the dark .

I think I know why the dems are not going after this .
It 's not that they do n't want to win elections .
They do .
But they do not want to win in a landslide .
This may be even more important than winning .
A landslide victory would mean that Nader like contenders have a chance of being competitive with the repugs and that washes away excuses to keep them out of the debates and media discussions .
This would be a threat to the ruling class which is comprised of both dems and repugs , just as Nader says .
The ruling class strategy is always divide and conquer , and now they have it down to 1 supreme court vote in 2000 and a few stolen votes in Ohio in ' 04 .
Statistically very unlikely .
The dems risk losing the election but they keep the the big money coming in from bankers , big oil , and multinationals .
Unpopular repugs need all the help they can get .
Ultimately the puppeteers of this vote rigging is not just the Republican party , it 's the ruling class .
The dem 's strategy is to win , just barely .

“ The combine harvester , [ … ] is a machine that combines the tasks of harvesting , threshing and cleaning grain crops . ”
If you have acres upon acres of wheat and want to separate the grain from the chaff , a group of combines is what you really want .
If you have a bonsai tree and want to trim it , a harvester may be less than ideal .
MapReduce is like a pack of harvesters , well - suited for weeding through a huge volumes of data , residing on a distributed storage system .
However , a lot of machine learning work is more akin to trimming bonsai into elaborate patterns .
Vice versa , it ’s not uncommon to see trimmers used to harvest a wheat field .
Well - established and respected researchers , as recently as this year write in their paper “ Planetary Scale Views on a Large Instant - messaging Network “ :
We gathered data for 30 days of June 2006 .
Each day yielded about 150 gigabytes of compressed text logs ( 4.5 terabytes in total ) .
Copying the data to a dedicated eight - processor server with 32 gigabytes of memory took 12 hours .
Our log - parsing system employed a pipeline of four threads that parse the data in parallel , collapse the session join / leave events into sets of conversations , and save the data in a compact compressed binary format .
This process compressed the data down to 45 gigabytes per day .
Processing the data took an additional 4 to 5 hours per day .
Doing the math , that ’s five full days of processing to parse and compress the data on a beast of a machine .
Even more surprisingly , I found this exact quote singled out among all the interesting results in the paper !
Let me make clear that I ’m not criticizing the study ; in fact , both the dataset and the exploratory analysis are interesting in many ways .
However , it is somewhat surprising that , at least among the research community , such a statement is still treated more like a badge of honor rather than an admission of masochism .
The authors should be applauded for their effort .
Me , I ’m an impatient sod .
Wait one day for the results , I think I can do that .
Two days , what the heck .
But five ?
For an exploratory statistical analysis ?
I ’d be long gone before that .
And what if I found a serious bug half way down the road ?
That ’s after more than two days of waiting , in case you were n’t counting .
Or what if I decided I needed a minor modification to extract some other statistic ?
Wait another five days ?
Call me a Matlab - spoiled brat , but forget what I said just now about waiting one day .
I changed my mind already .
A few hours , tops .
But we need a lot more studies like this .
Consequently , we need the tools to facilitate them .
Hence my decision to frolic with Hadoop .
This post focuses on exploratory data analysis tasks : the kind I usually do with Matlab or IPython / SciPy scripts , which involve many iterations of feature extraction , data summarization , model building and validation .
This may be contrary to Hadoop ’s design priorities : it is not intended for quick turnaround or interactive response times with modestly large datasets .
However , it can still make life much easier .
Scale up on large datasets
First , we start with a very simple benchmark , which scans a 350 GB text log .
Each record is one line , consisting of a comma-separated list of key=value pairs .
The job extracts the value for a specific key using a simple regular expression and computes the histogram of the corresponding values ( i.e. , how many times each distinct value appears in the log ) .
The input consists of approximately 500M records and the chosen key is associated with about 130 distinct values .
The plot above shows aggregate throughput versus number of nodes .
HDFS and MapReduce cluster sizes are always equal , with HDFS rebalanced before each run .
The job uses a split size of 256MB ( or four HDFS blocks ) and one reducer .
All machines have a total of four cores ( most Xeon , a few AMD ) and one local disk .
Disks range from ridiculously slow laptop - type drives ( the most common type ) , to ridiculously fast SAS drives .
Hadoop 0.16.2 ( yes , this post took a while to write ) and Sun ’s 1.6.0_04 JRE were used in all experiments .
For such an embarrassingly parallel task , scaleup is linear .
No surprises here , but it ’s worth pointing out some numbers .
As you can see from the plot , extracting simple statistics from this 350 GB dataset took less than ten minutes with 39 nodes , down from several hours on one node .
Without knowing the details of how the data were processed , if we assume similar throughput , then processing time of the raw instant messaging log could be roughly reduced from five days to just a few hours .
In fact , when parsing a document corpus ( about 1 TB of raw text ) to extract a document - term graph , we witnessed similar scale - up , going down from well over a day on a beast of a machine , to a couple of hours on the Hadoop cluster .
Hadoop is also reasonably simple to program with .
It ’s main abstraction is natural , even if your familiarity with functional programming concepts is next to none .
Furthermore , most distributed execution details are , by default , hidden : if the code runs correctly on your laptop ( with a smaller dataset , of course ) , then it will run correctly on the cluster .
Single core performance
Linear scaleup is good , but how about absolute performance ?
I implemented the same simple benchmark in C++ , using Boost for regex matching .
For a rough measure of sustained sequential disk throughput , I simply cat the same large file to / dev/null .
I collected measurements from various machines I had access to : ( i ) a five year old Mini - ITX system I use with my television at home , running Linux FC8 for this experiment , ( ii ) a two year old desktop at work , again with FC8 , ( iii ) my three year old Thinkpad running Windows XP and Cygwin , and ( iv ) a recent IBM blade running RHEL4 .
The hand - coded version in C++ is about 40 % faster on the older machines and 33 % faster on the blade [ Note : I ’m missing the C++ times for my laptop and it ’s drive crashed since then — I was too lazy to reload the data and rerun everything , so I simply extrapolated from single - thread Hadoop assuming a 40 % improvement , which seems reasonable enough for these back - of - the - envelope calculations ] .
Not bad , considering that Hadoop is written in Java and also incurs additional overheads to process each file split separately .
Perhaps I ’m flaunting my ignorance but , surprisingly , this workload was CPU - bound and not I /O - bound — with the exception of my laptop , which has a really crappy 2.5 ″ drive ( and Windows XP ) .
Scanning raw text logs is a rather representative workload for real - world data analysis ( e.g. , AWK was built at AT&T for this purpose ) .
The blade has a really fast SAS drive ( suspiciously fast , except perhaps if it runs at 15 K RPM ) and the results are particularly instructive .
The drive reaches 120 MB / sec sustained read throughput .
Stated differently , the 3GHz CPU can only dwell on each byte for 24 cycles on average , if it ’s to keep up with the drive ’s read rate .
Even on the other machines , the break - even point is between 30 - 60 cycles [ Note :
The laptop drive seems to be an exception , but I would n’t be so sure that at least part of the inefficiency is n’t due to Cygwin ] .
On the other hand , the benchmark throughput translates into 150 - 500 cycles per byte , on average .
If I get the chance , I ’d like to instrument the code with PAPI , validate these numbers and perhaps obtain a breakdown ( into average cycles for regex state machine transition per byte , average cycles for hash update per record , etc ) .
I would never have thought the numbers to be so high and I still do n’t quite believe it .
In any case , if we believe these measurements , at least 4 - 6 cores are needed to handle the sequential read throughput from a single drive !
The common wisdom in algorithms and databases textbooks , as far as I remember , was that when disk I/ O is involved , CPU cycles can be more or less treated as a commodity .
Perhaps this is an overstatement , but I did n’t expect it to be so off the mark .
This also raises another interesting question , which was the original motivation for measuring on a broad set of machines : what would be the appropriate cost - performance balance between CPU and disk for a purpose - built machine ?
I thought one might be able to get away with a setup similar to active disks : a really cheap and power - efficient Mini-ITX board , attached to a couple of moderately priced drives .
For example , see this configuration , which was once used in the WayBack machine ( I just found out that the VIA - based models have apparently been withdrawn , but the pages are still there for now ) .
This does not seem to be the case .
The blades may be ridiculously expensive , perhaps even a complete waste of money for a moderately tech - savvy person .
However , you ca n’t just throw together any old motherboard and hard disk , and magically turn them into a “ supercomputer . ”
This is common sense , but some of the hype might have you believe the opposite .
Performance on smaller datasets
Once the original , raw data is processed , the representation of the features relevant to the analysis task typically occupies much less space .
In this case , a bipartite graph extracted from the same 350 GB text logs ( the details do n’t really matter for this discussion ) takes up about 3GB , or two orders of magnitude less space .
The graph shows aggregate throughput for one iteration of an algorithm similar to k-means clustering .
This is fundamentally very similar to computing a simple histogram .
In both cases , the output size is very small compared to the input size : the histogram has size proportional to the number of distinct values , whereas the cluster centers occupy space proportional to k .
Furthermore , both computations iterate over the entire dataset and perform a hash - based group - by aggregation .
For k-means , each point is “ hashed ” based on its distance to the closest cluster center , and the aggregation involves a vector sum .
Nothing much to say here , except that the linear scaleup tapers off after about 10 - 15 nodes , essentially due to lack of data : the fixed per-split overheads start dominating the total processing time .
Hadoop is not really built to process datasets of modest size , but fundamentally I see nothing to prevent MapReduce from doing so .
More importantly , when the dataset becomes really huge , I would expect Hadoop to scale almost - linearly with more nodes .
Hadoop can clearly help pre-process the raw data quickly .
Once the relevant features are extracted , they may occupy at least an order of magnitude less space .
It may be possible to get away with single - node processing on the appropriate representation of the features , at least for exploratory tasks .
Sometimes it may even be better to use a centralized approach .
Summary
My focus is on exploratory analysis of large datasets , which is a pre-requisite for the design of mining algorithms .
Such tasks typically involve ( i ) raw data pre-processing and feature extraction stages , and ( ii ) model building and testing stages .
Distributed data processing platforms and , in particular , Hadoop are well - suited for such tasks , especially the feature extraction stages .
In fact , tools such as Sawzall ( which is akin to AWK , but on top of Google ’s MapReduce and protocol buffers ) , excel at the feature extraction and summarization stages .
The original , raw data may reside in a traditional database , but more often than not they do n’t : packet traces , event logs , web crawls , email corpora , sales data , issue - tracking ticket logs , and so on .
Hadoop is especially well - suited for “ harvesting ” those features out of the original data .
In its present form , it can also help in model building stages , if the dataset is really large .
In addition to reducing processing time , Hadoop is also quite easy to use .
My experience is that the programming effort compares very favorably to the usual approach of writing my own , quick Python scripts for data pre-processing .
Furthermore , there are ongoing efforts for even further simplification ( e.g. , Cascading and Pig ) .
I was somewhat surprised with the CPU vs I / O trade - offs for what I would consider real - world data processing tasks .
Perhaps also influenced by the original work on active disks ( one of the inspirations for MapReduce ) , which suggested using the disk controller to process data .
However , there is a cross -over point for the performance of active disks versus centralized processing ; I was way off with my initial guess on how much CPU power it takes for a reasonably low cross -over point ( which is workload - dependent , of course , and any results herein should be treated as indicative and not conclusive ) .
Footnote :
For what it ’s worth , I ’ve put up some of the code ( and hope to document it sometime ) .
Also , thanks to Stavros Harizopoulos for pointing out the simple cycles - per - byte metric .
Alistair Darling warned last night that he will " almost certainly " have to inject yet more money into the economy to steer Britain out of recession .
The Chancellor admitted that his £ 20 bn spending package may not be enough to rescue the country from the financial crisis .
Gordon Brown insisted yesterday that New Labour remained alive , as he prepared to unveil a Queen 's Speech containing radical reforms for the economy , welfare and policing .
But a poll published today shows the Conservatives are consolidating a double - digit lead over Labour .
The Prime Minister , compared by Lord Mandelson to a " Moses figure " who would lead the country out of recession , dismissed claims that he had presided over a return to Old Labour after ditching Tony Blair 's long - held promise not to increase income tax .
Speaking to the annual Progress conference in London , he said : " This is the biggest New Labour project of all – to give people confidence and hope that we can build through this downturn into a better economy and society .
It will mean not a slowing down of reform , but only a stepping up in the pace of reform . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Queen 's Speech on Wednesday is expected to contain legislation focusing on the economy , as well as a beefed - up policing Bill with new powers to tackle binge - drinking , and controversial measures to force single parents back to work .
However an Ipsos - Mori poll for The Observer put the Tories on 43 per cent , 11 points ahead of Labour .
Voters were unconvinced that the Chancellor 's £ 20 bn package would improve their financial prospects or make them spend more .
And in an interview with the newspaper , Mr Darling said more measures could be needed as soon as next spring 's Budget : " You 'd be very foolish indeed to say , ' Well , that 's the job done . '
You know this is something that needs constant attention . "
Lord Mandelson yesterday warned that it was impossible to say when Britain would recover from the economic crisis .
" No one can foretell how short or long , how painful or painless , the recession is going to be , " the Secretary of State for Business told The Guardian .
Heaping praise on Mr Brown , he said : " People really do look to him like some Moses figure who is going to lead them away from this economic mess to the promised land . "
In his pre-Budget report , Mr Darling announced a new 45 per cent top rate of income tax from 2010 - 11 , triggering claims that this heralded the death of New Labour .
Lord Mandelson is understood to have held talks with senior Blairites about an official role in Government .
We have seen an unprecedented 4 - day rally in the stock market .
This is rather astounding given the parade of bad news .
New home sales hit half century lows .
Consumer spending has fallen to lows not seen since 2001 .
Unemployment claims are running at multi-decade lows .
We also just bailed out Citigroup and have committed over $ 8 trillion to holding up the financial system .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is loving it .
Over these past 4 days the Dow has rallied a stunning 15.5 % :
This is the biggest 4 day rally since August of 1932 when the Dow had a 25 % 4 day streak :
Hmmm .
Unemployment during 1932 was 24 % .
There really was n’t any good news coming out then and there is n’t any today unless you consider massive bailouts good .

Over at Coolhunting , Tim Yu has a post up about this amazing video by Seth Brau :
To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , CH friend and colleague Seth Brau recently completed the rather daunting task of bringing the words to life with motion graphics .
The result is on one hand elegant – using a two - tone palette , linear – and on the other an experimental take on scale , the use of typography and symbolism .
Given complete creative freedom and a little over a month 's time , Seth used a mix of After Effects and Illustrator to seamlessly connect the 30 articles of the document into a captivating piece .
In this case , no plan was the best plan .
Seth comments , " There were times when I had no idea what I was going to do for the next section of the document .
I would churn out something that I would hate but in that process I would come up with the idea , layout or imagery for something I ended up developing and liking . "
Cadbury says it has recalled its Chinese - made chocolates from Australia , Taiwan and Hong Kong after tests " cast doubt " on their safety .
At Cadbury 's head office in Birmingham , company officials said the deadly chemical melamine was found in tests carried out on several of its products made at its Beijing plant .
" As a result of these tests ... we have received results that cast doubt on the integrity of a range of our products manufactured in China , " a statement said .
" As a result we believe it is appropriate to take a precautionary step to withdraw from the market , all of our Cadbury chocolate products that were manufactured in our Beijing plant ... pending further supply of fresh products . "
The chocolates being recalled are Cadbury Eclairs and bulk packets of Dairy Milk chocolate .
In Australia only eclairs have been recalled from the shelves .
It is the latest fallout from the toxic milk scandal , which has sickened some 53,000 Chinese babies .
Calls placed to the company 's Asia headquarters in Singapore have not been returned .
In the statement , Cadbury said all of its Chinese suppliers have been cleared by the mainland government 's testing regime .
The 11 brands recalled include Cadbury Eclairs and bulk packets of Dairy Milk chocolate , the statement said .
No other brands have been affected , it added .
The products are the latest in an ever - growing list of China - made foods and drinks that have been removed from stores here and across the world since the scandal was first exposed earlier this month .
Four children have died in China after drinking milk or milk products laced with melamine , which is usually used in making plastics .

We knew this day would come , but Netflix has just notified their customers that a new fee will be applied to Blu-ray renting accounts .
But it 's not all bad news .
The price increase is only a buck a month for unlimited Blu-ray rentals .
Given that a Blu-ray purchase sticker price is often 30 % or more expensive than its DVD counterpart , this increase seems within reason ... to me at least .

The Federal Trade Commission won a preliminary legal victory against what it called one of the largest spam gangs on the Internet , persuading a federal court in Chicago on Tuesday to freeze the group ’s assets and order the spam network to shut down .
The group , which used several names but was known among spam - fighting organizations as HerbalKing , sent billions of unsolicited messages to Internet users over the last 20 months , promoting replica watches and a variety of pharmaceuticals , including weight - loss drugs and herbal pills that supposedly enhanced the male anatomy , according to the commission .
“ This is pretty major .
At one point these guys delivered up to one - third of all spam , ” said Richard Cox , chief information officer at SpamHaus , a nonprofit antispam research group .
The investigation provides a clear window into the business of modern spam , which by some estimates accounts for 90 percent of all e-mail sent over the Internet .
British soldiers attacked by furious mob in Kabul after American troops 'ram minibus off road killing one '
British troops were attacked by mob in Kabul today after American troops sparked a riot by ramming a packed minibus off the road , allegedly killing one civilian .
Eyewitnesses said an American armoured personnel carrier smashed into the back of the minibus , as they raced along a highway on the outskirts of the capital .
' The minibus lost control and and swerved off the road into a crowd of people , ' an eyewitness said .
Riot : Police chase stone - throwing protesters through the streets of Kabul .
Violence broke out after American troops reportedly ran a minibus off the road
' It looked like there was someone underneath it , dead . '
Both cars were traveling in the same direction when the Americans went into the back of them .
The soldiers then sped off without stopping as an angry crowd gathered around the scene of the accident .
A US military spokesman said : ' The van skidded off the side of the highway and struck a roadside shop . '
Destruction : A relative of the victim stands next to a damaged shop in the wake of the crash
A similar incident two years ago sparked widespread rioting across the city , which saw charities and UN properties burnt and looted , and seven people killed .
British troops were called to the scene yesterday , moments after the crash , when a convoy of foreign civilian contractors , who happened to be travelling behind the Americans , were surrounded by the mob .
Distraught :
The father of victim
Eyewitnesses said there was a corpse , wrapped in a white shroud driven away in a taxi .
Afghan police claimed the Brits , based nearby at Camp Souter , opened fire on the crowd .
Kabul police chief Mohammad Ayoub Salangi said : ' The troops opened fire and killed one civilian and wounded three more . '
Nato and American officials insisted none of the soldiers fired a shot .
A spokesman for the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force said : ' On their arrival , the patrol found a large crowd surrounding the contractors ' vehicles .
' It can be confirmed that no personnel in this patrol discharged their weapon during the incident .
The crowds hurled rocks and bottles at Afghan police and British Royal Marines , who came to rescue the contractors .
One said : ' They were mad .
People were chanting ' death to Bush , ' and ' death to America ' and throwing things at the soldiers .
' Afghans are sick of foreign soldiers killing their people for no reason . '
' Crushed ' :
The body of the victim shrouded in a white sheet is taken away
It came just a day after hundreds of Afghans gathered outside the United Nations headquarters to protest rising civilian casualties , caused by Nato and American coalition operations .
International troops are on high alert after a spate of suicide attacks in the capital .
A military source said : ' Everyone 's a bit twitchy at the moment .
There are reports of more bombers in the city , and the soldiers were probably scared . '
The incident has raised tensions within the military coalition , with some soldiers accusing the Americans of being ' gung - ho and careless . '
A car bomb exploded less than 500 metres from the American embassy on Thursday .
Today 's smash was just metres away from where a British army Signaller Wayne Bland was killed by a car bomb which hit his convoy in August .
Patrol : Police restore order after the riots
Black Friday !
Even its name conjures visions of a horrifying battle for survival in the most hostile environment known to humanity - the overcrowded shopping mall .
But it could be worse .
Science fiction has given us several stories of death and destruction in malls .
Just to console you as you battle crowds today , here 's our rundown of the 10 deadliest fictional mall massacres of all time .

Chopping Mall .
In this 1986 movie , a group of teens sneak into a mall after hours to have some fun " testing out " the beds .
But the mall has installed new security robots , which go haywire and turn into " Killbots . "
Every time one of the robots kills someone , it says , " Thank you .
Have a nice day . "
Best line of dialogue : " Let 's send these fuckers a Rambo - gram . "
You can watch the entire thing here , but here 's the film 's most famous exploding - head scene :
Dawn of the Dead .
The last survivors of the relentless zombie assault hole up in the Monroeville mall , and it works out okay for a while ... until a biker gang breaks into the mall intent on looting .
And those fuckers let in a huge swarm of zombies , killing everything in their path .
Fuckers .
The 2004 remake , directed by Zack Snyder , keeps the idea of people barricaded inside a mall , but no biker gang .

Rabid .
In this early David Cronenberg classic , a mutant strain of rabies spreads like wildfire , turning people into deadly zombie - like maniacs .
Rabid shoppers tear people limb from limb , and the mall 's Santa Claus gets shot to death by a careless police officer .
Here 's the trailer :
Project : New Man .
The first issue of this short - lived superhero comic is called " Mall Massacre , " and it 's just what it sounds like .
New Man has to fight a shopping - mall killer who uses a super high - tech weapon that " does n't leave a lot to body bag . "
His last rampage left 17 dead and 12 injured .

Night Of The Comet .
Thanks to Amy Vernon for suggesting this one !
A comet passes over the Earth , killing most people instantly .
Only those who are shielded by metal survive , and anyone who was partially exposed turns into a killer zombie .
So our valley girl protagonists handle the desolation the only sensible way - by going to the mall !
Ohmygod !
Unfortunately , their mall jaunt turns into a shootout , and then they 're taken prisoner by psycho stock boys :
Dead Rising .
You 're a photojournalist , trapped inside a zombie - filled mall , in this awesome video game .
Anything you can lay your hands on becomes a weapon , in your fight to survive and uncover the truth about the zombie plague .

Networks ready Election Night gizmos
Election night technology has come a long way since Tim Russert memorably held up a white board with three words scrawled on it : “ Florida ! Florida ! Florida ! ”
But when CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer talks with Candy Crowley from the Obama headquarters in Chicago on Tuesday evening , the correspondent could simultaneously appear in the New York studio — at least as a 3 - D hologram .
Really .

Although CNN 's takes the prize for most extravagant election - night bells and whistles , each network will pack studios with their entire stable of anchors , pundits , analyst and correspondents , while bringing out every gizmo in their arsenals to break down the results — including such primary night favorites as CNN ’s “ Magic Wall and Fox ’s “ Bill - board . ”
Outside of the studios , NBC transforms Rockefeller Plaza ’s ice rink into a giant U.S. map , while ABC takes over three massive screens in Times Square to display results in real time .
But despite the fanfare and the heightened viewer interest that 's propelled ratings all year — 64 million viewers tuned in on election night four years ago , and expectations are high that ratings will be even higher this time — the networks still come into election night with plenty of baggage from the past two cycles .
Network executives and political directors always say that being first does n’t matter , but there are bragging rights that come along with calling a state , or the country , before one ’s competitors .
Of course , as 2000 proved , such rushes to judgment can be disastrous .
And in 2004 , exit poll data leaked during the day to the Internet seemed to indicate that John Kerry was in the lead , an unexpected development the networks had to deal with on the air .
Sam Feist , political director of CNN , said that while new technology “ allows the network to bring information to our viewers in a way we have n’t done before , ” in the end “ election night is really a night about data . ”
Political junkies , exhausted by endless pundit speculation , wo n’t have exit poll data until early evening if all goes according to plan .
Following a post -2004 agreement , there ’s a strict embargo for all exit poll data until 5 p.m .
All five networks , along with the Associated Press , have pooled resources in conducting the polls , and each will have a representative in what ’s been dubbed a “ quarantine room , ” which wo n't expose the poll data until 5 p.m .
It ’s at that time that MSNBC 's election night coverage begins with David Gregory anchoring , along with Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann — the more outspoken duo that anchored through the conventions — in the secondary role .
At 6 p.m. , Fox News starts off with Brit Hume anchoring the last election of his lengthy career , along with Chris Wallace .
And Blitzer takes the lead on CNN , with Anderson Cooper and Campbell Brown also taking on additional anchor duties .
Among the Big Three , each nightly newscast will be stretched to a full hour , with coverage beginning at 7 p.m .
On the broadcast networks , CBS ’s Katie Couric , NBC ’s Brian Williams and ABC ’s Charles Gibson will sit in the chairs warmed by Dan Rather , Tom Brokaw , and the late Peter Jennings four years ago .
As it did during the debates , Fox goes with Shepard Smith in the anchor spot .
Of course , some of the most memorable television moments wo n’t be in New York or Washington studios , but further out in Chicago or Phoenix , where the campaigns are throwing celebrations of differing scales .
For example , when McCain delivers his remarks at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel , there will only be pooled press since the room could n’t accommodate the entire press corps .
A second " results watch party " will be open press , though .
Assigned to the McCain headquarters will be correspondents Kelly O’Donnell and Savannah Guthrie ( NBC ) ; Ron Claiborne and David Wright ( ABC ) ; Chip Reid ( CBS ) ; Molly Henneberg ( Fox ) ; Dana Bash and Ed Henry ( CNN ) ; and Carl Cameron ( Fox News ) .
The Obama press corps will include Lee Cowan and Ron Allen ( NBC ) ; Jake Tapper and John Berman ( ABC ) ; Dean Reynolds ( CBS ) ; Steve Brown ( Fox ) ; Crowley , Suzanne Malveaux and Jessica Yellin ( CNN ) ; and Major Garrett ( Fox News ) .
Clearly , the Obama team ’s event will be larger , with estimates that a million people could descend upon Chicago ’s Grant Park on Tuesday night .
Despite the differences in size — which should be apparent to televisions viewers whenever there ’s an overhead shot — ABC political director David Chalian said that the “ focus of those events are really on the candidates and the analysis of correspondents . ”
The networks , though , will spend less time surveying the crowds than they will providing viewers with numbers and analysis of what they mean — especially since more news will be made that will be more news than only who becomes commander - in - chief .
“ The potential for a filibuster - proof senate would clearly have a huge impact , ” Chalian said , adding that the “ balance of power ” story will have to be factored into covering the returns .
The key , though , remains getting the results right , no matter whether they 're delivered by a live anchor , a hologram , or a projection on a skating rink .
“ It ’s critically important that we be accurate and correct when we make a projection , ” Feist said .
“ The American people are going to find out who their next president is on television that night .
We ’re in no rush .
Being first is simply not a priority . ”
When you protest Scientology , you do it at your own risk .
That 's what members of the group Anonymous found out last Sunday when they picketed Gold Base , the Church 's headquarters in Gilman Hot Springs , Calfornia .
The small , peaceful assembly sported signs before one member received a beating from a group of the Church 's hired goons .
Gold Base is the center of the Church 's production arm , and also features a nine - hole golf course .
Oh yes , there 's also a massive brainwashing operation there called Rehabilitation Project Force .
As first reported on Mark Ebner 's Hollywood , Interrupted , five members of Anonymous picketed the building with signs , a Church guard screws with their vehicle down the road to get them to trespass onto the Church 's property , while setting up a flare to get them to come back to the car .
After they dog - tie the member of the group that returns to the truck , the guards strike down another protester .
Amazingly , two members of Anonymous were arrested afterwards by the Riverside Sheriff 's Department , as they report in their account of the situation .
This is typical stuff for the Church , who does n't just counterattack on YouTube .
But of course , as the guy holding the camera says , Anonymous thinks they win if they can bring home footage like this .
French Record Labels Suing Sourceforge , Among Others
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 18 , 2008
If you thought the RIAA had cornered the market on heavy - handed , misguided lawsuits , think again .
TorrentFreak reports that the Societe civile des Producteurs de Phonogrammes en France ( SPPF ) plan on pursuing a lawsuit against three US - based companies that develop P2P applications .
Vuze , LimeWire , and Shareaza are the applications targeted in the lawsuit .
There is a fourth company named that 's not a developer , or a P2P site -- it 's a repository .
It 's actually not just any repository .
It is , for many , the repository for open source applications -- Sourceforge .
Is it me , or does this lawsuit sound incredibly tenuous ( to use a polite term ) ?
New French legislation suggests that for P2P applications to be in the clear they must have the ability to filter and block the transfer of unauthorized copyrighted material .
The problem is , this type of filter does n't exist ( and judging from other types of filtering software , would take literally years to get to a point where it would be even reasonably accurate ) .
It seems , then , yes , the courts have given the record labels the go ahead to sue application developers for features that do n't exist , and might not ever be a technological reality .
The icing on this cookie is including Sourceforge in the suit .
Follow along : Sourceforge hosts Shareaza ( among others ) , and though using Shareaza ( or Vuze , or Limewire ) does n't mean you 're violating copyrights , you could be , and Sourceforge has the servers that host these applications ' code .
Why stop there ?
Why can't they sue the telecom that maintain the lines that connect Sourceforge 's servers to the Internet ?
It seems that any progress made on the digital rights front is a two steps forward one step back type of situation .
This case , no matter how you look at it , is just really bad footing .

ANNANDALE , Va. ( MarketWatch ) -- Richard Band is not someone who makes outlandish predictions just to get headlines .
So I sat up and took notice earlier this week when he wrote to subscribers of his Profitable Investing newsletter that the stock market was ready to " rocket higher " in an " uptrend that could carry the blue chip indexes to all - time highs by late 2008 or early 2009 .
Dow 16,000 here we come ! "
The Hulbert Financial Digest ( HFD ) has been tracking Band 's newsletter since the beginning of 1991 .
Over the subsequent 17 years , his recommended portfolio has been 35 % less volatile than the overall stock market , as measured by relative volatilities .
To use a baseball analogy , this shows that Band is more inclined to try to get a base hit than he is to attempt to belt a home run .
Band 's conservative approach is crucial to properly interpreting his newsletter 's performance .
According to the HFD , the newsletter 's model portfolios on average have produced an 8.6 % annualized return since the beginning of 1991 , in contrast to 10.9 % annualized for the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index 97199001 .
But with only two thirds as much risk , we should expect some below - market return .
It turns out that , upon risk - adjusting his newsletter 's performance , it equals that of the market itself .
That 's good enough to place it in the upper echelon of newsletters over this period , and another reason to give weight to his forecast .
Technical factors appear to have led Band to make such a bold prediction , which amounts to a 33 % return for the overall market over the next 12 months .
The first has to do with the stock market 's internal characteristics when it hit a low earlier this month .
Band argues that that low possessed " many striking technical resemblances to the great bear market bottoms of the past . "
To be sure , Band wrote that on Tuesday night , and since then the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % has dropped 230 points .
But Band says he is not particularly worried .
On Thursday night , he told subscribers not to let " Mr. Market wear you out ! "
Band continued : " We 're in a critical stage for stocks right now , what technical analysts call the ' right shoulder ' of a head - and - shoulders bottom .
The left shoulder formed on March 10 , when the Standard & Poor 's 500 index SPX , - 0.48 % touched its closing low for the year ( so far ) at 1273.37 .
The upside - down head came on March 17 , when the index broke to a new low intraday but finished at 1276.60 , slightly above the March 10 close .
Now we 're sliding down again to complete the right shoulder of the pattern .
If all goes well , the S&P should remain comfortably above the two previous closing lows .
Then we can rocket higher in April . "
Band adds that when the right shoulder of a head - and - shoulders bottom is forming , " the biggest temptation for investors is to throw up their hands and say , ' This market will never go up .
It 's doomed . '
Do n't make that mistake .
A very powerful and durable rally is in the works .
But it may need another couple of days to lift off .
Hold the fort and keep the faith ! "
Marijuana kills pain by activating a set of proteins known as cannabinoid receptors , which can also regulate appetite , inflammation , and memory .
The body also has chemicals known as endocannabinoids that naturally activate these same receptors , namely N - arachidonoyl ethanolamine ( AEA ) and 2 - arachidonoylglycerol ( 2 - AG ) .
These natural components of the cannabinoid system remain the focus of intense efforts to develop new treatments not only for chronic pain , but also for obesity , anxiety , and depression .
However , until the new paper , specific methods to study 2 - AG signalling have been lacking .
AEA 's activity has been well understood for years .
In past research , Cravatt and his team identified an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase , or FAAH , that breaks down AEA , effectively reducing its pain killing activity .
A number of compounds are now in clinical development that target and breakdown FAAH , allowing AEA to build up , reducing pain .
However , FAAH does not control 2 - AG metabolism in vivo , and therefore , the potential biological functions and therapeutic potential of this second endocannabinoid have remained largely unknown .
Teasing out 2 - AG 's specific impacts have proven challenging .
Comparable to FAAH , an enzyme called monoacylglycerol lipase ( MAGL ) breaks down 2 - AG .
But , despite numerous attempts , no group had been able to develop a chemical that inhibits MAGL specifically .
" The tools - selective and efficacious MAGL inhibitors - just were n't there , " says Jonathan Long , a graduate student of the Scripps Research Kellogg School of Science and Technology who is a member of the Cravatt lab and a first author of the new paper .
But now , a MAGL - specific inhibitor is finally available , thanks to the lab 's new work .
Key to this success was Activity - Based Protein Profiling , a unique chemical technique the group devised and has used fruitfully in other inhibitor hunts .
This system enables the rapid engineering and testing of chemical compounds against many members of enzyme families , in hope of finding effective and selective inhibitors .
For this project , the group developed about 200 compounds and found that one was a highly effective block for MAGL .
The scientists dubbed the compound JZL184 , named after Long 's initials and the order in the series of potential inhibitors tested .
JZL184 effectively blocks only MAGL among more than 40 related brain enzymes , which opened the door for the first definitive study of 2 - AG 's activity .
A New View of 2 -AG
Unlike increased AEA , which causes only reduced pain sensation , the team found that MAGL inhibition using JZL184 , and the resulting increase in 2 - AG concentration , not only reduced pain in mice , but also induced other effects associated with the cannabinoid receptors , namely hypothermia and decreased movement .
" This really does suggest a sort of segregation of labour , if you will , " says Cravatt of the differential effects of elevating AEA versus 2 - AG as part of the overall function of the cannabinoid system .
" That , I think , is a truly unique result . "
While treatments based on inhibiting FAAH show great promise for controlling pain , manipulating MAGL levels could also be a boon for treatment development , especially if 2 - AG 's other effects , such as hypothermia , can be managed .
" There are so many different types of pain , " Cravatt says , " that it 's possible some types could be more effectively treated with one treatment than another . "
Go into any high street bookshop in Britain and the European history section will groan under the weight of books about the Nazi era .
Most of the time you will look in vain for something on Bismarck or Brandt .
( If you are lucky there might be a copy of the excellent Iron Kingdom , by Christopher Clark , about the rise and fall of Prussia . )
Of course the Third Reich and World War II are an exceptionally important part of Germany 's past .
But generations afterwards many British , whistling the theme from The Dambusters , seem happy to define their relationship to Europe 's biggest country solely through this prism .
The Fawlty Towers " do n't mention the war " episode was so brilliant because it was about a British , not a German , collective psychosis .
But that I have written about elsewhere .
So how should we see modern Germany and how do the Germans see themselves ?
One seasoned diplomatic observer suggested to me that Germans defined themselves by pride in their prestigious manufactured goods .
Not fashionable clothes or designer furniture , but complex high - end technology , cars and audio equipment .
I think he's hit on something particularly with the love affair with big , black fast cars .
It is pride in a Germany that makes the best in the world , things that make life comfortable and cosy .
German efficiency is a cliche of course , but it is also true .
You get bumblers and bungling everywhere , but on the whole if Germans say they will do something , it will be done with the minimum of fuss or performance .
Meetings run to time , and mistakes are corrected .
But Germany 's own relationship with its past is crucial , however I might moan about British bookshops .
In Berlin it 's the builders who lay the ghosts by obliterating the past .
It was of course once the capital of a region and a country - Prussia , itself wiped off the map , not just by history , but by an Allied occupation law of 1947 .
I stand on a bridge in the drizzle looking at four big grey structures , like tower blocks stripped back to the raw concrete - all that remains of the parliament of communist East Germany .
Many wanted it to remain as a monument , but even these impressively sombre corner posts will be torn down in a few months .
Where Hitler 's bunker once stood there are flats , side street parking and a notice with a fairly detailed map about the complex .
There is more of the Wall left , but not a lot of fuss is made about it .
But there is also a fascination with the past , a desire to pick at the wounds .
A film has just come out about the Baader - Meinhof gang , the left - wing terrorists who murdered more than 30 people in the 1970s .
It is based on a book by Stefan Aust , who covered the events at the time .
The film is controversial and has been condemned by the children of some of the killers ' victims , but he says it gets better on every showing .
He 's seen it seven times .
I asked him what Germany 's relationship with its past meant today .
" You never get rid of that .
Everything that happens in this country we compare to the German past , to the Nazi dictatorship .
Germans are much more aware of their past than most other countries in the world .
And that is at least one thing that is good , coming out of such a terrible past . "
Why is that good ?
I wonder .
" We are very sceptical about things , so we are sceptical when people admire politicians , we 're sceptical about mass movements , we are very critical about what the police do , what the judicial system does .
I think you have to think about your past to get rid of it . "
We talk about the German attitude to war .
Before 1999 no member of the German armed forces served abroad .
Now they are the third - largest force in Afghanistan , although many allies query their wholehearted commitment .
" When Germany has to play a role in a war it is a terrible thing , and we do n't make decisions like that very easily , because of everything that happened .
So we were very sceptical about the Iraq war because we knew what it was to lose a war .
When you start a war it is very important to win it .
Right now it is very hard to see how we win the war in Afghanistan , " Aust says .
Entering Berlin's Humboldt University , where Germany 's next generation are being educated , the past is present .
In the rather grand lobby the first thing you see , in gold letters on a background of brown and white marble , is a quote from Karl Marx , the one about philosophers having to change the world , not just describe it .
Set out in this entrance hall is a temporary exhibition , large black - and - white photographs of the Nazi attacks on Jewish business : the words " Jude !
Jude !
Jude ! " scrawled across shop fronts make me shiver .
Two students , Bastian ( 24 ) and Florian ( 25 ) , who are both studying history and want to be teachers , tell me things are changing .
Bastian says : " We are the first generation who thinks rationally about the National Socialism .
" The first generation in the 1950s denied everything , our parents accepted everything , accepted the guilt and the responsibility , but we are in the middle thinking about the consequences , but we are n't feeling guilty any more .
Yeah , we 're the first rationals . "
Florian adds : " We 're the first generation as well who has grown up with a united Germany .
I was six years old when the Wall came down and that is history .
I was one of the woodpeckers at the wall , there was small me with a hammer - I did n't do much damage of course . "
How does that mean they see Germany 's place in the world now ?
" Our military presence in Afghanistan is a joke and will be for a long time , but that will change .
I am very torn : I think we should accept responsibility but people are getting killed , sons die , mums cry .
It 's an ugly business . "
" We 're still divided , " says Florian .
" On one side we see
the responsibility Germany has to have in the world but we still are saying ' yes and no ' .
It 's something we can do but should n't do . "
But what about the broader question , what it means to be German now ?
Bastian says : " What does it mean to drink beer and love football ?
I do n't know - I drink coke and love basketball .
I do n't know what it means to be German .
I am Berlin , born here , I love this city but I do n't know anything about being German . "
Florian says : " I think there is no special thing about being German , it 's just something written on your ID card . "
But he says during the 2006 World Cup things did change .
" That 's the only time we 've had something like that .
It 's only during huge sports events that you see Germany as a nation : united in front of the television or something .
You could see people wearing our flag , knotted around their necks , but if you do it and there is nothing like soccer around , Jesus : do n't , that 's a sin .
Patriotism is n't considered a bad thing any more but you'd be considered a weirdo . "
Perhaps these students are not the end of the process and it will take another generation or two before the past cease to haunt Germany .
But I am beginning to see that a sort of national humility is a key part of the German soul .
The past has made Germans reluctant to boast or strut .
When I said something to one businessman about Germany being the most powerful , important nation in Europe , he was reluctant to agree .
" It is not for us to say that .
You do n't stir your own soup . "
If this is a German saying it 's a rather odd one : clearly most people do .
But you see what he means .
The same goes for the German language .
The French are prickly if their language is not used at the top table or is slighted in any way .
And while English is in a very dominant position I have not doubt at all we would be very defensive if it was n't .
But I have been at EU news conferences given by Austrians and Germans and they did not bat an eyelid about speaking in English .
NASA ’s Space Shuttle Endeavour is set to launch into space tonight , and you can watch it live as it happens .
Endeavor is expected to take off from Florida ’s Kennedy Space Center at 7:55 p.m. ET Friday .
As of mid-morning , engineers are estimating a 70 percent chance the weather will stay calm enough for the shuttle launch to remain on schedule .
You can see the shuttle launch live at NASA TV or view our live stream below ( note that non - stop shuttle coverage may not begin until later in the day ) .
NASA also offers a host of other live streaming options — you can see specific views of the launchpad and other space facilities , as well as NASA ’s official weather monitoring channel .
Finally , NASA ’s Space Shuttle Countdown Portal offers a view of the current launch clock in real - time , along with regularly refreshed images from the various video feeds .
The Space Shuttle Endeavor will spend 15 days at the International Space Station .
Its crew will conduct four spacewalks and install new quarters , which will include a “ waste water recycling system ” about to turn urine into drinkable water .
They ’ll also be bringing a new oxygen generator .
Crews began filling the shuttle ’s external tank with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants just moments ago .
The fueling is expected to be finished by 1:30 p.m. ET .

An electronic voting machine in Adams County repeatedly failed to accept a vote for a Democratic state Senate candidate — instead registering the vote for her Republican opponent — at an early voting site last week and has been removed from service , the Aurora Sentinel reports Wednesday .
Adams County Clerk and Recorder Karen
Long told the newspaper the error does n’t reflect wider problems in the county ’s voting systems , but the candidate said the incident could lead to a lawsuit .
“ I always just trusted the machines , and it opened my eyes , ” said state Rep. Mary Hodge .
“ The way it works now , I ’m told … is that those votes throw it to Mr. Hadfield that we ’ll probably have a lawsuit and a court decision .
We ’ll have to wait and see . ”
Hodge , the Democratic nominee , faces Republican Robert John Hadfield in the race to represent state Senate District 25 .
The voter reported the problem to election judges , who canceled her ballot and allowed her to vote — this time accurately — on another machine , Long told the Sentinel .
Long said that election officials had n’t received any other complaints about the particular machine and that no other voting errors have been reported .
“ I have quarantined the machine , ” Long told the newspaper .
“ It ’s removed and it ’s sealed up and it ’s in a bag . ”
She said she is awaiting instructions from the secretary of state ’s office .
The voter contacted Hodge after the incident .
“ She said that she put in , got her stuff and it would pop up Hadfield .
She tried it three times , ” Hodge told the Sentinel .
Late last year , Colorado Secretary of State Mike Coffman decertified three of the four electronic voting manufacturers whose machines are used in the state , citing “ problems with accuracy and security , ” only to recertify them after county clerks complained .
Adams County uses electronic voting machines manufactured by Premier Election Solutions , formerly known as Diebold Election Systems , which were among those decertified by Coffman .
( Watch a demonstration of the machines here . )
On Tuesday , a legal center sent out an alert warning about “ vote flipping ” — selecting one candidate only to have another register — in some electronic voting machines used in other Colorado counties .

Nov. 10 , 2008  --
In her first interview since she became the victim of a brutal beating by a group of teenage girls , 17 - year - old Victoria Lindsay told " Good Morning America " she thought she was " going to die " on the night of the horrifying attack .
Tune in to " Good Morning America " on Monday , Nov. 10 to see the full interview .
On March 30 in Polk Co. , Fla. , Lindsay was invited to a former friend 's house where she was allegedly ambushed by six other teenage girls and beaten so viciously that at one point she lost consciousness and later had to be treated in a hospital for injuries .
The attack reportedly lasted more than 30 minutes .
A video of the attack , which was released by the Polk County Sheriffs Department , shows Lindsay literally backed into a corner and attempting to cover her head while the girls alternate pummeling her and yelling at her .
" What am I going to do ? " she told " Good Morning America . "
" I thought I was going to die , honestly .
I could n't fight back .
There was too many of them .
So my only thought was just to protect myself and not to hit back and try to move , like , away when they were punching . "
But Lindsay was unable to avoid the blows and suffered a concussion and injuries to her left eye and left ear .
One girl reportedly slammed her head into a wall until she lost conscioussness .
" It 's really unreal for me , how my friends could turn on me ... and do that to me , " she said .
That night , her parents , Patrick and Talisa Lindsay , received a call from the hospital and got the horrifying news .
When he got to the hospital , Patrick told " Good Morning America " he did not recognize his daughter .
" When I stepped into the room the nurse said she was at , I peeked around the curtain and seen a girl laying there in pretty bad shape and I left the room , " he said .
" I did n't know it was her . "
Patrick said she was huddled in the corner of her bed with her knees drawn up towards her chest .
" Then I heard her crying as I was walking out of the room , cause she seen me , and I went back in and just sat on the foot of the bed and put my arm on her leg because I was afraid to touch her .
I was afraid that I would hurt her because she was ... she was beat up pretty good . "
" I did n't know what to say , " he said .
" Words failed me at that moment . "
Lindsay 's parents ' outrage and torment was made worse when the video of Lindsay 's beating played on television and Web sites around the world .
" I was angry , " Talisa said while fighting back tears .
" How could somebody do that to my little girl ?
And how could people walk away feeling good about it ?
Videotaping it and thinking it 's funny and hilarious .
It 's not funny . "
Lasting Wounds
Seven months later , Lindsay still feels the physical effects of the attack .
" My ears are fine , " she said .
" It kind of felt like something was stuck in it after a while , but that went away eventually .
The only thing I do n't like is ... my eye .
It 's still kind of blurry .
But I think glasses may help that . "
More than any physical reminders , Lindsay 's emotional scarring was intense and her ability to trust has suffered .
" It knocks it down and it breaks it apart , " she said .
" And it 's hard for me .
I get kind of scared when I 'm in situations where I do n't know certain people .
And when I see people fighting , it really angers me . "
Lindsay is unsure why the girls decided to attack her .
" I was thinking , ' what did I do to them for them to do this to me ?'...
I thought it had a lot to do with jealousy at the time .
A lot of it had to do with boys , " she said .
" I did n't have any explanation why , and I really still do n't .
But I 'm hoping to find out . "
Some of the girls said the incident occured in retaliation for Lindsay 's trash - talking and threatening them online .
Lindsay denies the accusation .
In April eight teens were arrested and charged with kidnapping and misdemeanor battery charges .
Only five of the teens are currently charged , and they have all pleaded not guilty .
