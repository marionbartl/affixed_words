Multi - touch became trendy after iphone came up with it .
We are seeing many new laptops with multi-touch .
At hardware level , there is nothing special that you need , to make multi - touch work .
You can also do two - finger scroll and two - finger tap to right / middle click .
Also , three - finger tap , but , for me it is very hard to press three fingers at the same time ( 1 out of 10 ) .

Everybody in the news business knows you can't tell the same story in the same way every year , and if you 're going to try , you need to disguise it with a new twist .
So it is with Forbes ' annual billionaires list .
How do you keep it fresh and oh - so - exciting in a year of falling fortunes ?
Try putting in a drug dealer .
If you 've been following the news at all , there 's a good chance by now that you know that would be Joaquin Guzmán Loera , czar - is that the right word ? - of Mexico 's Sinaloa cocaine cartel .
Forbes ' much - quoted 2009 list puts his net worth at $ 1 billion .
You can almost see Steve Forbes ' deep - set little eyes twinkling .
The billionaire drug dealer !
There has n't been an idea this marketable attached to Forbes since the flat tax !
In just a few days , the billion - dollar number has been repeated so many times that 's it already certifiably truthy — the au courant term for what journalists used to call " too good to check . "
Which is exactly what makes it worth checking .
CNBC.com Original Slideshows :
Over the past days , TBM has made an effort to get to the bottom of Forbes ' number .
The magazine does give you some back of the envelope calculations .
According to Forbes ' Guzman blurb , " Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers brought in $ 18 billion to $ 39 billion in wholesale cocaine shipments to the US last year .
Guzman 's organization took in , by Forbes ' estimate , 20 percent of that - which makes for $ 3.6 billion to $ 7.8 billion in revenues .
That 's a good start .
But then Forbes punts saying simply that 's " enough for him to have pocketed $ 1 billion over the course of his career and earn a spot on the billionaire 's list for the first time . "
Well , maybe .
With assassinations going at several thousand dollars a pop , and the costs of security and the like , you 'd think that Guzman 's expenses are substantial - even considering that his earnings are tax free .
And however much money Guzman has managed to pocket , we can assume that a fair amount has been spent .
Knowing you might die any day of the week does n't exactly encourage thrifty habits .
Our first thought was to turn to Forbes for a little bit more explanation .
We were n't expecting a dollar - by - dollar accounting .
But it seemed like if you 're going to put a number out there , you might be able to divulge at least a general sense of how to value an international drug trafficking business .
No such luck .
In fact , the response we got to our query from Forbes spokeswoman Monie Begley is short enough that we can reprint it in full :
" Thanks for your inquiry .
The Forbes methodology is proprietary . "
That 's it .
Not much to go on , is it ?
Yet if you really want to , you can come up with an estimate of the value of Guzmán 's business .
The best place to start is probably at the source — by counting up how much cocaine goes through Mexico .
The latest numbers on cocaine production in the Andes show a marked increase in the last few years , with total production up to 994 tons .
The biggest cocaine bust in history was a seizure of 23 tons in Mexico City at the end of 2007 - an enormous haul for a single shipment that serves as a reality check and makes the overall number of close to 1,000 tons fairly plausible .
_____________________________________
More From The Big Money :
_____________________________________
The biggest portion of that - 55 percent , by the estimate of Colombian authorities ( you can get this number and much more in this 2008 study ) - goes through Mexico , with a much smaller part going through Venezuela and a still smaller part traveling from other parts of Latin America to Europe through West Africa , a growing but still small trafficking route .
So we can conservatively estimate the portion going through Mexico 's cocaine cartels at 550 tons .
One estimate of the wholesale price of cocaine in Mexico puts it at $ 8,000 per kilogram , or about $ 7,275,000 per ton .
That would put the total wholesale price of the cocaine shipped by the cartels at about $ 4 billion .
That 's a whole lot less than the $ 18 billion to $ 39 billion that US authorities claim , and that Forbes uses for its numbers .
Why do we think the Forbes numbers are high ?
Well , the high estimate of $ 39 billion would mean a wholesale price of close to $ 44,000 per kilo — a number much higher than almost every other estimate out there , and approaching the street level retail price of cocaine .
And that assumes all of South America 's drug production ( for which US drug authority estimates are actually a bit lower than the UN's ) went to the US .
When it comes to assessing the romantic playing field -- who might be interested in whom -- men and women were shown to be equally good at gauging men's interest during an Indiana University study involving speed dating -- and equally bad at judging women 's interest .
Researchers expected women to have a leg up in judging romantic interest , because theoretically they have more to lose from a bad relationship , but no such edge was found .
" The hardest - to - read women were being misperceived at a much higher rate than the hardest - to - read men .
Those women were being flirtatious , but it turned out they were n't interested at all , " said lead author Skyler Place , a doctoral student in IU 's Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences working with cognitive science Professor Peter Todd .
" Nobody could really read what these deceptive females were doing , including other women . "
Place 's study , published in the January issue of the journal Psychological Science , focused on the ability of observers to judge romantic interest between others because this ability has evolutionary benefits when it comes to finding a mate .
Decisions that other people around us make , said Place , can influence or inform our own choices .
" So , if you walk into a room and there 's 20 people you 've never met before , being able to know which individuals might be available and which are clearly smitten by others can make you more efficient in finding your own romantic interest to pursue , " he said .
For the study , 28 women and 26 men of college age watched video clips of couples interacting on speed dates .
Speed dating is a popular commercial method for singles to meet a large number of individuals in one evening of successive brief one - on - one conversations .
Each participant observed 24 videos , all with different men and women , and after each rated whether the man seemed interested in the woman and the woman in the man .

The speed dating sessions were all conducted in Germany while the observer ratings were all made by students in Indiana .
Despite the language difference , observers were still able to judge men's romantic interest accurately using body language , tone of voice , eye contact , how often each dater spoke and other non-verbal cues .
" How people talk might convey more than what they say , " Place said .
Observers did not have to see much of this non-verbal behavior .
They were just as good at predicting the speed - dating couple 's interest if they saw only 10 seconds of the date as they were if they saw 30 seconds .
The researchers say this showed that observers , even with limited information , could make quick , accurate inferences using " thin slices " of behavior .
There was , however , great variability in how well observers could predict the interest of any particular speed - dater , ranging from 90 percent accuracy down to 10 percent .
In five of the videos , 80 percent of the observers thought the women shown were interested when in fact they were not -- they were acting friendly even though they had no interest in the men .
Evolutionary theory , said Place , predicts a certain level of coyness or even deceptiveness in women because if a relationship is abandoned they may face greater costs , including pregnancy and child rearing .
When choosing a mate , it is in a woman 's best interest to get men to open up and talk honestly to give her a better idea of whether they would be good long - term partners .
" In a speed dating environment , you would expect to see these effects dramatically , with the women trying to get the men to be more straightforward , while they themselves remain more coy , " Place said .
" Though the pace is faster than a typical first date , the strategy remains the same . "
Readers can see how successful they are at judging romantic interest by participating in a new online study that contains the same task as the one described here .

The United States Government decides to give loans to the struggling insurance corporation American International Group ( AIG ) .
First in the amount of $ 85 billion , then increased to $ 152 billion and now it stands at $ 170 billion USD .
Then , AIG took $ 165 million USD from this loan and gave it as bonuses to its executives .
After that happened , tax payers got outraged .
Upset with what AIG did they demanded that the government do something to resolve this situation .
So , the House of Representatives quickly passed a bill that would virtually tax these bonuses out of existence by taxing them at 90 % rate .
And here we are .
So why am I talking politics on a gaming comic ?
Because this situation really pisses me off .
Look , you may not like what AIG did with the loan they received , but it was a loan .
When you receive a business loan from a bank , the bank does not specify you what you can and ca n’t do with every nickel and dime of it .
There may be guidelines or a certain direction , but mostly they just want you to pay the money back .
And hell , you may not like AIG ’s decision , but it was their decision to make .
Regardless , that ’s not what ’s pissing me off .
It ’s this bill that the House of Representatives passed that ’s got my all riled up .
Why ?
Because it ’s unconstitutional and they should know better .
The United State ’s Constitution directly says , “ No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed . ” ( Article 1 , Sec 9 . )
Which means that legislation is prohibited from punishing or penalizing a specific person or group without trial .
And that exactly what this bill is doing .
Now , I know that if this bill is ever seen before the Supreme Court it will be dismissed ( they ’ve actually read the Constitution before ) .
But it should n’t have to .
It should have never reached this .
And if the government did n’t want this money going to bonuses , they should have specified that in the loan before they gave it to AIG .
So if you really what to blame someone , blame the government .
They dropped the ball on this one and they ’re the ones back - pedaling with their tails between their legs .
Oh , and I used President Obama in the comic because it ’s his party that ’s in control of the House and he is the most recognizable / important Democrat in the world as well .
Also , a lot of you just would n’t get it if Nancy Pelosi was in the comic instead .
You ’d be all like , “ Who ’s that crusty old woman ? ”
And I ’d say , “ Do n’t you recognize your momma ? ”
And then you ’d be like , “ Oh , no he did n’t … ”
And then , I would n’t respond because I was too busy having sex with your mom .
See , this just works out better this way .
When Jim Callaghan arrived at the Treasury in 1964 , the outgoing Tory chancellor Reggie Maudling was apologetic about the lousy inheritance he was handing over .
Said Reggie to Jim : " Sorry to leave things in such a mess , old cock . "
Whichever poor cock becomes chancellor after the next election , he is going to face the grandmother of all messes .
£ 165 bn is a big number .
That is the IMF forecast of government borrowing next year , the highest level in Britain since Spitfires were dog-fighting with Messerschmitts .
Here 's an even bigger number : £ 1,000,000,000,000 .
The national debt is soaring over £ 1 trillion .
These figures are so bogglingly vast that they scare the wits out of the politicians .
Such an epic mountain of debt confronts both the government and the Conservatives with a nightmare that neither really wants to look in the face for fear that it will drive them mad with despair .
The entire New Labour project depended on a benign environment in which growth and tax revenues were buoyant .
For a decade , that allowed them to spend on the nice things - schools , hospitals , help for the poor - without having to do too many of the nasty things - hiking taxes .
Most previous governments struggled to reconcile the public 's desire for better services with the public 's reluctance to pay increased taxes .
Continuous growth allowed New Labour to smooth the hard edges of that dilemma .
Those happy days are gone .
Future choices will be very jagged indeed .
They do n't want to admit that to the voters , nor perhaps even to themselves .
Ministers dare n't ' fess up to just how skint the next government is going to be .
Gordon Brown has ever loved presenting Labour as the investors in public goods and the Tories as the mad slashers and crazy burners .
The prime minister will smudge his favourite " dividing line " if he concedes that public spending faces a severe squeeze whoever finds themselves in Number 10 .
A comprehensive spending review was due this summer .
Gordon Brown has quietly told Alistair Darling to scrap it .
To publish forward - spending figures now would be to advertise the terrible state of the public finances in neon lights and stick a " Kick Me Here " sign to the backsides of both the chancellor and the prime minister .
It would also unleash the bloodiest Whitehall spending negotiations in a generation .
Below the radar , the Treasury is already trying to do some mild slashing and burning , seeking " efficiency savings " of £ 5 bn from departmental budgets .
Some of the spending ministers are squealing about that even though it is peanuts in the context of the awesome size of the problem .
Over in the Conservative part of this thicket , David Cameron has been desperately trying to recalibrate his position since the economic crisis wrecked his original political project .
The New Tories , like New Labour , relied on the assumption that the good times would roll on forever .
It was on this sunny basis that Cameron Mark I promised he could both match Labour spending and draw on growth to produce some tax cuts .
That project lies in ruins .
There is no growth to share between spending rises and tax cuts .
There is only the horrible question of how much spending will have to go down and taxes will have to rise in the next parliament .
The Tory leader acknowledges that this will not be " pain free " while remaining opaque about which public services will suffer when the Conservatives take out their machetes .
That there will be sharp pain can not be in doubt .
George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , recently issued a secret instruction to his senior colleagues calling in all the Conservatives ' previous spending commitments .
As for the tax cuts once dangled by the Tories , David Cameron has just given a sensible and significant indication that no one should vote Conservative expecting him to be able to deliver any of those in a hurry .
He is now saying clearly that a Tory government would not have the scope to cut taxes until it had drained some of the red ink from the public finances .
In recession , it may make Keynesian sense to keep pumping money into the public sector for now .
That helps to sustain the economy when the private sector is shrinking with such painful rapidity .
But the public sector be warned : the party is over for you too .
Whether the next government is Labour or Tory , there is going to be one hell of a hangover .
This week , David Cameron will make another speech on the " post - bureaucratic age " ( ugly phrase ) .
He will advance his case that the state will have to deliver less .
The smarter people in government - the cabinet office minister , Liam Byrne , is one of them - grasp that Labour can only counter this by proving the worth of the state .
The message to all those who work for the state is that intense pressure is coming from across the political spectrum to deliver more with less .
The public sector of the future must be much more impressive at demonstrating that it is spending cleverly and effectively .
Apart from being a virtue in itself , there will be heightened voter intolerance for the squandering of public money when so many of those providing it are experiencing the squeeze of their lives .
Ministers and civil servants should be spending taxpayers ' money as carefully as if every pound came out of their own pockets .
This they are not doing .
When the Tory leader condemns the wasteful ways of Whitehall he has some ministers privately nodding along in agreement .
The quangocracy is one swollen sector over - ripe for rigorous investigation by some narrow - eyed accountants .
Some of the quangos are efficient operations , but too many have grown into bloated , pretentious organisations , interested above all else in justifying their own existence .
They spend absurd sums of taxpayers ' money on lobbying government for more taxpayers ' money .
It is time for a robust audit of how they use our cash .
Visitors to the plush citadel which houses Ofcom , the broadcasting regulator , are surprised to be offered bottled mineral water emblazoned with the organisation 's logo .
Why does a broadcasting regulator need to have its own branded water ?
Let them drink from the tap .
That product is , after all , regulated by their brothers at Ofwat .
The post - bubble era is going to be impatient of extravagance .
It will be flintier , value - conscious and much less forgiving of waste .
It will demand that the public sector justifies its existence to those who pay its bills .
More than two million people are now registered as unemployed .
Many of those still in work in the private sector are seeing their wages frozen or cut .
Their livelihoods are at the mercy of the recession and their pensions have been eaten by the great crunch .
These taxpayers will look with increasing interest and swelling envy at those employed at their expense in the public sector who still enjoy secure jobs , rising salaries and protected pensions .
Simmering jealousy will boil up into hot anger if the public sector is n't delivering value for money .
Nurses and teachers do n't need to write to remind me that there are many dedicated public servants doing tough , complex and essential jobs for society on modest salaries .
But in the more senior ranks of the public sector , there has been a great inflation in rewards which has not always been matched by commensurate improvements in results .
Salaries have raced upwards while pensions have been gold - plated and mink - lined .
This is another legacy of the bubble years .
As rewards in the City ballooned to astronomical levels , there was a ripple effect into the higher levels of the public realm .
University vice - chancellors , council chief executives , hospital administrators , quango chiefs , agency bosses and BBC managers grabbed a thick slice of the high - rolling action .
The argument was made that you would n't get talented people to work in the public sector if it could n't compete with the juicy rewards on offer from the private .
From council executives to the over - padded ranks of BBC managers , you now find amazing numbers of administrators who earn multiples of the salary of the prime minister .
Transparency is one answer and more of that is coming .
Legislation going through parliament will force councils to reveal exactly what they pay to their upper tiers of administrators .
The council tax payers of Rotherham may be cross to discover that their council pays 61 of its bureaucrats a salary which is larger than that of the town 's MP .
Some of these public sector executives are worth the money .
Scrutiny is likely to reveal that others really do not deserve to be trousering the taxpayers ' top dollar .
The Healthcare Commission 's investigation into the squalid conditions provided by Stafford hospital finds that " appalling " standards of emergency care may have led to the loss of hundreds of lives .
The report condemns a " complete lack of effective governance " which led to untended patients in filthy beds desperately slaking their thirst by drinking water from flower vases .
No branded mineral water for them .
The salary of Martin Yeates , the chief executive of that killer hospital , had risen by a third in just two years taking him to £ 180,000 a year .
Whether it be the private sector or the public , whether the culprits be bankers or hospital administrators , massive rewards for colossal failures have got to stop .
Those who earn a living which does n't depend on the state are already in the post - bubble era .
They know that this is a tougher world in which survival will require being efficient , smart , cost - conscious , customer - satisfying and good at your job .
The public sector , too , will have to wake up and smell the bitter coffee .
An article in the Financial Times caught our eye that makes plain that the TALF ( Term Asset Security Program ) is a bailout for the shadow banking system ( HT Tom ) .
The bailouts for the banking industry continue unabated despite a change in Administration on January 20th .
The Obama Administration has topped up bailout money for Bank of America , AIG and Citigroup , three of the weakest ‘ too big to fail ’ institutions without putting them through a bankruptcy process .
Now , the Federal Reserve and the Administration are set to move on the TALF program which we chronicled here in three earlier posts , “ TALF : A bailout if one reads the fine print , ” “ TALF details suggest Obama does n’t get it , ” and “ A few words from a reader on TALF mechanics . ”
Here is what the FT had to say ( my highlighting included ) :
When a group of men who got rich by buying low and selling high want to make you their partner , hang on to your wallet .
That bit of financial wisdom was amply demonstrated by the 97 per cent peak to trough drop in the common stock of Fortress Investment Group on its second anniversary as a public company last month .
Leverage cuts both ways , and its impact has been almost entirely bad for the alternative asset manager with the low point being a temporary halt to redemptions at its Drawbridge hedge fund late last year .
But investors looking over the detritus left by the financial crisis seem suddenly to realise that , having survived so far , Fortress is ideally suited to reap a future bonanza .
They looked past a hefty net loss for the fourth quarter and bid Fortress ’ shares up as much as 40 per cent yesterday on hearing its optimism about participating in the first round of the term asset - backed securities loan facility .
Fortress is one of a handful of groups that retain the size and credibility to play a role in what may prove to be a high reward and relatively low - risk exercise .
Fortress executives dub the coming period “ the great liquidation ” .
Meanwhile , much of the bleeding has stopped in Fortress ’ existing business .
About 82 per cent of its capital is long - term in nature with an average remaining life of 9.2 years , leaving plenty of time for mark - to- market losses to be reversed .
With important debt renegotiations and redemptions mostly behind it , nasty surprises are unlikely .
Management ’s optimism about the future of their hedge fund business may sound like bluster after huge outflows and no inflows recently , but it is not so implausible .
If it can build new funds while using the taxpayer as a low cost prime broker , new investors should be willing to let bygones be bygones .
I wo n’t go into specifics here because we have chronicled that in the prior three posts .
The crux of the matter is the ‘ Great Liquidation . ’
Financial service companies in the shadow banking system like Fortress are now able to rid themselves of a good portion of their Level - 3 hard - to - price , so - called toxic assets .
Now , mind you , these assets must be rated AAA and will be taken on as collateral for a haircut .
But , I sense the Fed will be stuck with these assets for quite some time as the loans they are giving for them are non-recourse .
What was once ‘ You Walk Away ‘ for home owners on their non-recourse mortgages is now you walk away for hedge funds and broker - dealers .
Quoting a good friend , this is “ a huge windfall for the hedge fund industry .
This whole exercise is designed as much as possible to restore the status quo ante .
That ’s the real scandal . ”

Sir Macfarlane recommended in a secret report in 1947 that biological and chemical weapons should be developed to target food crops and spread infectious diseases .
His key advisory role on biological warfare was uncovered by Canberra historian Philip Dorling in the National Archives in 1998 .
The department initially blocked release of the material on the basis it would damage Australia 's international relations .
Dr Dorling sought a review and the material was finally released to him late last year .
The files include a comprehensive memo Sir Macfarlane wrote for the Defence Department in 1947 in which he said Australia should develop biological weapons that would work in tropical Asia without spreading to Australia 's more temperate population centres .
" Specifically to the Australian situation , the most effective counter - offensive to threatened invasion by overpopulated Asiatic countries would be directed towards the destruction by biological or chemical means of tropical food crops and the dissemination of infectious disease capable of spreading in tropical but not under Australian conditions , " Sir Macfarlane said .
The Victorian - born immunologist , who headed the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research , won the Nobel prize for medicine in 1960 .
He died in 1985 but his theories on immunity and " clonal selection " provided the basis for modern biotechnology and genetic engineering .
On December 24 , 1946 , the secretary of the Department of Defence , F.G. Shedden , wrote to Macfarlane Burnet saying Australia could not ignore the fact that many countries were conducting intense research on biological warfare and inviting him to a meeting of top military officers to discuss the question .
The minutes of a meeting in January , 1947 , reveal that Sir Macfarlane argued that Australia 's temperate climate could give it a significant military advantage .
" The main contribution of local research so far as Australia is concerned might be to study intensively the possibilities of biological warfare in the tropics against troops and civil populations at a relatively low level of hygiene and with correspondingly high resistance to the common infectious diseases , " he told the meeting .
In September , 1947 , Sir Macfarlane was invited to join a chemical and biological warfare subcommittee of the New Weapons and Equipment Development Committee .
He prepared a secret report titled Note on War from a Biological Angle suggesting that biological warfare could be a powerful weapon to help defend a thinly populated Australia .
Sir Macfarlane also urged the government to encourage universities to research those branches of biological science that had a special bearing on biological warfare .
A clinically scientific approach is evident in a note he wrote in June , 1948 .
He said a successful attack with a microbiological agent on a large population would have such a devastating impact that its use was extremely unlikely while both sides were capable of retaliation .
" The main strategic use of biological warfare may well be to administer the coup de grace to a virtually defeated enemy and compel surrender in the same way that the atomic bomb served in 1945 .
" Its use has the tremendous advantage of not destroying the enemy 's industrial potential which can then be taken over intact .
" Overt biological warfare might be used to enforce surrender by psychological rather than direct destructive measures . "
The minutes of a meeting at Melbourne 's Victoria Barracks in 1948 noted that Sir Macfarlane " was of the opinion that if Australia undertakes work in this field it should be on the tropical offensive side rather than the defensive .
There was very little known about biological attack on tropical crops . "
After visiting the UK in 1950 and examining the British chemical and biological warfare research effort , Sir Macfarlane told the committee that the initiation of epidemics among enemy populations had usually been discarded as a means of waging war because it was likely to rebound on the user .
" In a country of low sanitation the introduction of an exotic intestinal pathogen , e.g. by water contamination , might initiate widespread dissemination , " he said .
" Introduction of yellow fever into a country with appropriate mosquito vectors might build up into a disabling epidemic before control measures were established . "
The subcommittee recommended that " the possibilities of an attack on the food supplies of S - E Asia and Indonesia using B.W. agents should be considered by a small study group " .
It 1951 it recommended that " a panel reporting to the chemical and biological warfare subcommittee should be authorised to report on the offensive potentiality of biological agents likely to be effective against the local food supplies of South - East Asia and Indonesia " .
Dr Dorling said that while Sir Macfarlane was a great Australian he was also a product of times when many Australians held deep fears about more populous Asian countries .
He said the Menzies government was more interested in trying to acquire nuclear weapons .
" Fortunately this also proved impracticable and Australia never acquired a weapon of mass destruction . "
The secretary of the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies , Peter French , said he had not yet seen the files but the whole notion of biological warfare was something that Australian scientists would not be comfortable with today .
" Viewed through today 's eyes it is clearly an abhorrent suggestion , " Dr French said .
ROME ( Reuters ) -
The global financial crisis and the collapse of the housing sector are a big blow for wood industries , but this is not necessarily good news for the world ’s forests , a new U.N. report said on Monday .
The report , published ahead of a conference on forestry held in Rome by the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , noted new housing starts in the United States had more than halved between 2006 and 2008 .
Several other countries , particularly in western Europe , have witnessed similar declines .
“ Wood demand is unlikely to reach the peak of 2005 - 2006 again in the foreseeable future , ” the FAO ’s “ State of the World ’s Forests 2009 ” report said .
“ Scaling down of production is widespread in almost all countries and all forest industries , from logging to sawmilling to production of wood panels , pulp , paper and furniture , ” it said .
Countries that are highly dependent on U.S. markets , such as Brazil and Canada , have already been severely affected , the report said , adding wood fiber demand in North America alone was expected to fall by more than 20 million tonnes this year .
While lower wood demand should be good news for the world ’s disappearing forests , FAO said the economic crisis could reduce investment in sustainable forest management and favor illegal logging .
“ A more general concern is that some governments may dilute previously ambitious green goals or defer key policy decisions related to future climate change mitigation , ” the report said .
It said European Union measures to tackle climate change , particularly auctioning emission allowances , were meeting some resistance , and the U.N. ’s REDD scheme -- aimed at using carbon credits to save rainforests -- could face similar problems .
Worldwide , the loss of forests was 7.3 million hectares ( 18.04 million acres ) a year between 2000 and 2005 , equivalent to 200 square km per day , according to U.N. data .
Deforestation accounts for 20 percent of man-made carbon emissions .
The first ID cards have been issued to foreign workers
The national identity card scheme could be " fatally " undermined by cheaply produced fake cards , a leading industry expert has warned .
Toby Stevens , of the Enterprise Privacy Group , believes a shortage of fingerprint scanners could lead to an explosion in " flash and dash " fraud .
And that , he says , could scupper the scheme before it gets off the ground .
The Home Office has said it will set up a hotline for traders concerned about the authenticity of ID cards .
But it has no plans at this stage to issue scanners to shops , banks , pubs and other commercial premises .
And there is currently no timetable for scanners to be handed - out to immigration officers , job centres and police , although the Home Office insists this will happen .
The government is pushing ahead with the controversial ID card scheme , despite vocal opposition from both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats , who say they will scrap the £ 4.7bn project on civil liberties and cost grounds .
A total of 50,000 cards are expected to be issued to foreign nationals by April and the first ID cards will be issued to British citizens later this year , when they are given to airside workers at London City and Manchester airports .
Black market
The government then plans to make the cards available to ordinary citizens in the Manchester area , as part of a " beacon " project .
The Home Office estimates that three million people will carry a card by 2010 .
We believe citizens will recognise the benefits of ID cards and they will quickly become seen as the preferred proof of identity by organisations looking to prevent identity fraud
Identity and Passport Service But Mr Stevens , who is a leading adviser to the government on ID cards from the business lobby , fears the scheme could be scuppered before it gets off the ground by a black market in fake cards .
He said : " In the early days , private companies wo n't be aware of what an ID card is supposed to look like , nor will they have the equipment to check the cards electronically , so ' flash and dash ' is inevitable .
" For this reason , there is already a black market in fake ID Cards , even though the design for UK nationals has yet to be decided . "
National identity cards will contain fingerprints and face biometrics but there is no timetable for the introduction of scanners to authenticate them , meaning staff and officials will have to rely on visual checks .
But Mr Stevens said the biggest fraud threat would not come from criminals enrolling on the ID database with false identities or creating cards linked to cloned identities but from cheaply - produced fake ID cards , which are already available on the internet .
Fears dismissed
He said : " The government needs to realise that any fraud at all associated with ID cards - even if they are ' fake '
ID cards that are not in fact a security failure in the national identity scheme - will create high - profile media headlines and undermine public and commercial confidence in the national identity scheme .
" Once ID cards are universal and pervasive in day - to - day life , the risk of this happening will be reduced , but if not properly managed then confidence could be fatally diminished . "
He said the government should ensure the scheme is rolled out as quickly as possible and focus on making the cards as " useful and attractive as possible " to promote uptake and combat fraud .
But a spokesman for the Identity and Passport Service dismissed fears that the cards will be prone to fraud .
He said : " To suggest incremental roll out of ID cards and electronic readers will undermine the security of the scheme and lead to more fraud is wrong .
" We recognise the importance of being able to validate cards .
In addition to physical and technical design features of the card to prevent forgeries , we are considering how organisations will be able to check the validity of an identity card that is presented to them using a service similar to the current Passport Validation Service .
" We believe citizens will recognise the benefits of ID cards and they will quickly become seen as the preferred proof of identity by organisations looking to prevent identity fraud . "

BHUBANESWAR , India ( Reuters ) -
An infant boy was married off to his neighbors ’ dog in eastern India by villagers , who said it will stop the groom from being killed by wild animals , officials and witnesses said on Wednesday .
Around 150 tribespeople performed the ritual recently in a hamlet in the state of Orissa ’s Jajpur district after the boy , who is under two years old , grew a tooth on his upper gum .
The Munda tribe see such a growth in young children as a bad omen and believe it makes them prone to attacks by tigers and other animals .
The tribal god will bless the child and ward off evil spirits after the marriage .
“ We performed the marriage because it will overcome any curse that might fall on the child as well on us , ” the boy ’s father , Sanarumala Munda , was quoted as saying by a local newspaper .
The groom , Sagula , was carried by his family in a procession to the village temple , where a priest solemnized the marriage between Sagula and his bride , Jyoti , by chanting Sanskrit hymns , a witness said .
The dog belongs to the groom ’s neighbors and was set free to roam around the area after the ceremony .
No dowry was exchanged , the witness said , and the boy will still be able to marry a human bride in the future without filing for divorce .
Indian law does not recognize weddings between people and animals , but the ritual survives in rural and tribal areas of the country .
The other day , I wrote a post on the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009 : HR 875 being introduced to Congress by Rep. Rosa DeLauro ( D –CT ) , in which I made the erroneous statement that her husband , Stanley Greenberg , worked for Monsanto .
I also included in this post extracts from emails sent to me by Jill Richardson , an intelligent and passionate campaigner for organic farming .
To her credit , when she read my post , she immediately sent me an urgent email , warning me that there was a great deal of misinformation buzzing around the Internet , which I had unwittingly included in my post .
She herself pointed out that ( 1 ) the bill has nothing to do with Monsanto , ( 2 ) Rep.
DeLauro ’s husband is a pollster for a company that once had Monsanto as a customer a decade ago , but he in no way ‘ works ’ for Monsanto , ( 3 ) HR 875 as it currently stands is very unlikely to even pass , and ( 4 ) the group behind disseminating this trumped - up propaganda is NICFA , whose mission statement maintains their goal is to ‘ promote and preserve unregulated direct farmer - to - consumer trade ’ and ‘ oppose any government funded or managed National Animal Identification System .
This organization has been aided by the support of a woman named Linn Cohen - Cole , whose unsubstantiated and exaggerated claims in an obsessive crusade against Monsanto , Hillary Clinton , Obama and anyone else in an imagined government ‘ plot ’ to nationalize farming does seem to indicate a serious lack of credibility .
I have since been in contact with Rep. DeLauro ’s office , and they have confirmed that Rep. DeLauro has been meeting with organic farmers to draw up a proposed list of amendments to HR 875 based on those discussions .
While these amendments are not yet public knowledge , and would be an informal document to clarify the bill , she and her staff would be happy to get the word out that the Congresswoman is indeed working very hard on improving both the bill and her office ’s relationship with organic and small farmers .
And to Rep. DeLauro , I add my personal apologies for any inadvertent misinformation regarding herself or her husband presented in my post .
To set the record straight :
There is no language in HR 875 that would regulate , penalize , or shut down backyard gardens or ‘ criminalize ’ gardeners ; the bill focuses on ensuring the safety of food in interstate commerce .
Farmer ’s markets would not be regulated , fined , or shut down , and would , in fact , benefit from strict safety standards applied to imported food to ensure that unsafe imported food does n’t compete with locally grown produce .
The bill would not prohibit or interfere with organic farming , or mandate the use of any chemicals or types of seeds .
The National Organic Program ( NOP ) is under the jurisdiction of the USDA .
HR 875 addresses food safety issues and falls under the jurisdiction of the FDA .
Monsanto and any other large agribusiness company had no part whatsoever in drafting this bill , and Rep. DeLauro ’s husband and his company do no lobbying on this issue .
HR 875 has nothing to do with any national animal ID system , which would fall under the jurisdiction of the USDA , and not the FDA .
This is n’t a done deal – the bill has n’t yet even been considered by any Congressional committee , nevermind seen any debate or proposed amendments .
There is no ‘ plot ’ to ram this through Congress and into law .
Monsanto , as bizarre as this may sound , is an innocent party in this fiasco .
On a positive note , this entire misapprehension may actually result in a more clearly defined proposed bill on food safety , highlight concerns of organic and small farmers in a more constructive environment , make genuine improvements in food safety for consumers and engender a more honest and open debate on GM food , safety , and global agriculture .
It also shows that the internet , while an arena for a great deal of misinformation and outright fabrication , has an amazing self - correcting machinery for when things do go wrong .
So while I ’m truly regretful for any promulgation of misinformation I ’ve aided in fostering , I ’m more than happy with the unplanned consequences .
Further to this , I ’ve also been having a lively email discussion with a representative of Monsanto , Mr. Bradley Mitchell , who read my original post , as well as the responses of our C&L readership with a great deal of interest .
Mr. Mitchell describes himself as a ‘ social liberal , fiscal conservative ’ , who gardens , cans food , and buys locally grown produce , firmly believing ‘ in supporting the local economy , preserving open spaces , and most of the other things buying local produce supports . ’
‘ I ca n’t argue against poor regulation of corporations ’ , he wrote to me , however , ‘ I would contend that regulator oversight varies with the industry .
I ’m pretty comfortable with safety testing for GM crops ( or I would n’t work for Monsanto ) but our agricultural policy is a mess worldwide .
It ’s unconscionable that a third of the world is starving and so many at the opposite end of the economic spectrum are overweight to the point of illness .
GM is not a silver bullet for this , but I think it is a powerful tool in addressing these problems ( which is why I work here ) . ’
Not exactly how I imagined Satan ’s minion , frankly .
I asked Mr. Mitchell if he would be interested in presenting Monsanto ’s position in this exclusive post for C&L , and he has kindly , and enthusiastically , accepted .
While I understand that much of our readership has strong emotions regarding Monsanto , I would urge our readers to respond in any comments to Mr Mitchell in a courteous and respectful manner .

" This is my Valentine ’s Day outfit .
The jacket and the pants are velvet .
I love the tie because it ’s really two ties stacked on top of each other .
( My dad had to tie it for me . )
The pink tie matched the pink shirt .
I wore brown - and - white argyle socks for a random pattern . "
Meet Arlo Weiner , America ’s most stylish eight - year old
" My mom got the jacket for me — I love it because I love Frank Sinatra and this is like something he would wear .
I wore the jacket with the pants because I like the different plaids together .
I thought the blue in the necklace brought out the blue in the pants .
It ’s a blue orb with fire around it . "
" I have a lot of black outfits these days , so I needed the red ascot to add some color .
I love red and black together — they each make the other stand out .
I ’ve worn this to school about 12 times . "
" I was going to play miniature golf with my brother Charlie .
You can see how much I like to mix patterns .
I love argyle — I was wearing argyle socks , too .
The red ascot brings out the red in the pants .
The only thing I was unsure of was whether the shirt would be weird with the rest of the outfit , but I wore it anyway because it was too hot to wear long sleeves .
The hat used to be my dad’s . "
" We were going to Getty Village and then having breakfast on the beach .
I wanted to wear black and white .
Most of my ties , like this one , are clip - ons . "
" The hat is like a Frank Sinatra hat .
I wore the jacket with the tie because green and gray are my favorite blend .
I ’m holding my dad ’s bag in the picture , but at school I use my dad ’s old brown leather satchel . "
” I love this red jacket .
I wore the black shirt underneath because I really like red and black together .
I got the jacket and pants in New York — we did a lot of shopping in New York . ”
" I thought the sunglasses would go well with the pants because they ’re both gold .
The tie on my neck — that used to be the belt for my bathrobe , but I shortened it and turned it into that .
I put the tie with the jacket because I liked the patterns together .
My grandma gave me the cane .
I thought it looked good with the pants . "
" I like to put random patterns together , so I picked out the green checkerboard tie with the gray checked jacket and then I wore the red vest underneath , because red stands out and brings the colors together . "
When you ’re the , you ’ve got serious sartorial standards to live up to .
Arlo Weiner has been creating his own style since the age of three — when he asked his parents for a top hat .
Soon he ’d moved on to striped bow ties , crushed velvet jackets , madras pants , and ascots ( yeah , he knows what an ascot is ) .
In the past five years , Arlo — named after singer Arlo Guthrie , whom he listens to along with Black Sabbath and Bob Dylan — has become one of the sharpest , most original dressers this side of second grade .
( Arlo on Dad ’s show : “ That ’s where I ’ve gotten a lot of my inspiration . ” )
His look is part Oliver Twist , part Royal Tenenbaums — eclectic and kidlike , but somehow knowingly so .
( His favorite item right now : a fez .
“ I like to flick the string , ” he says . )
Even in L.A. , a city where half the populace dresses to be noticed , Arlo stands out .
A favorite story in the Weiner family is the time perma-cool rocker Beck followed Arlo down the street , so taken was he by the kid ’s head - to - toe plaid .
Arlo , who plans to start designing his own clothes as soon as his mom gets a sewing machine , likes to mix and match bright colors and patterns .
In fact , he ’s up for trying just about anything — except sneakers and jeans .
“ They ’re really not my thing , ” he confesses .

There might be a credit crunch , but that 's not stopping solar companies from trying to lay claim to millions of acres of desert real estate .
The federal Bureau of Land Management has seen a 78 percent jump in the number of solar energy project applications since it reversed a controversial decision last July and started to accept applications again .
The number of applications has risen to 223 from 125 .
The applicants are vying to build solar power plants that are 10 megawatts or larger in California , Arizona , Nevada , New Mexico , Utah and Colorado , according to the BLM data provided by Andrew Malone in the agency 's public affairs office .
In all , these projects would occupy 2.3 million acres .
It 's difficult to say what the total power generation capacity that has been proposed is since some developers have yet to specify that information on their applications .
Many of the proposals call for building projects with hundreds of megawatts of generation capacities .
" I did n't realize they had gotten that many , " said David Briery , a spokesman for BLM's Desert District in California .
Briery is n't so surprised by the high number of projects being proposed in his district , home to the Mojave Desert and other vast tracks of sunny , rural land ( see map for proposed solar energy projects ) .
The BLM has listed on its Website 75 projects worth 51.6 gigawatts in the Desert District , but the numbers do n't reflect the total applications it has received because the list is n't updated quickly ( you can download an Excel file for the partial list on the BLM Website ) .
Overall , there are 107 applications for the BLM land in California , 71 applications in Nevada and 35 in Arizona , Malone said .
New Mexico , Utah and Colorado make up the rest .
Although the BLM oversees 258 million acres of land in the country , many tracks are not suitable for power plant developments because they are too far from the transmission lines or do n't receive enough hot , direct sunlight , which certain types of solar technologies call for .
The rush of applications is a strong indication that entrepreneurs see gold in desert land .
In fact , some locations are considered so desirable that several companies are lining up for the chance to develop the same plots .
So if the first company fails , then the second applicant can step in , Briery said .
Although the BLM has been flooded with solar energy proposals , it does n't process them quickly .
That 's because the path to getting permits for build those power plants will involve lengthy environmental and other reviews by not only the BLM but also other federal and state agencies .
" There 's always a sharp fallout between the application stage and when a plant can be successfully permitted , designed and built .
That 's the big unknown , " said John Geesman , a former member of the California Energy Commission and the current co-counsel of the American Council on Renewable Energy .
Out of the 223 proposals , only 2 projects are far enough along to undergo environmental reviews , a critical juncture in the permitting process .
The two projects come from BrightSource Energy in Oakland , Calif. , and Stirling Energy Systems in Phoenix , Ariz .
Both are proposing solar - thermal power plants which , unlike rooftop solar panels , use the sun 's heat to generate electricity .
BrightSource wants to build three solar - thermal plants totaling 400 megawatts in the Mojave Desert ( see project description ) .
The company has signed contracts with PG&E to deliver the power from the project .
Stirling Energy is proposing a 750 - megawatt solar - thermal power project to be located in Imperial County , which is south of the Mojave Desert ( see project description ) .
BLM will need more employees to review those applications promptly , Geesman said .
But whether it will get the staffing boost from a new administration that portrays itself as a solar energy booster remains to be seen .
" Until the new administration presents a budget , you are not going to know what the regional BLM staff is going to be , " Geesman said .
Given the strong interest in developing solar energy in California , the state has tried to streamline the permitting process .
For example , it signed a memorandum of understanding with the BLM in late 2007 to jointly conduct environmental reviews of each project .
That will help to speed up the process , but doing environmental reviews is an inherently time - consuming process that requires detailed assessments of each project 's impact on wildlife and other natural resources , Geesman said .
The BLM is drafting a document that it hopes will also speed up the permitting process .
The document , called the Solar Energy Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement ( PEIS ) , would carry out a comprehensive analysis of solar energy projects ' potential environmental , social and economical impact .
Each applicant will still have to carry out an environmental review of the project to gauge its specific impact , but the PEIS would serve as a reference .
The PEIS , among other things , would identify land that is suitable for solar energy development and the best procedures and practices for approving projects .
The need to do a PEIS is what prompted the BLM to stop accepting solar energy applications last year ( see BLM Lifts Moratorium on Public Land for Solar ) .
The PEIS was to take two years to complete , and the agency wanted to focus on getting the PEIS done before considering more projects .
The agency has completed a PEIS for wind and geothermal energy developments .
American critics , like Adam S. Posen , the deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , say that Germany needs to do more .
“ As a hugely export dependent economy , they have the most to gain from others ’ fiscal efforts , ” he said , “ and the most at risk if the global trade contracts further  worse if they are accused of free - riding on leakage from others ’ programs . ”
Image Michael Hartmann , whose employer in Vienenburg , Germany , cut his work hours , is using the time off to get more training .

Mr. Posen and others argue that while Germany may be doing more stimulus spending than others in Europe , it is counseling other European countries  many of which share the euro as their common currency  not to spend their way out of recession either , but to count on their safety nets to do much of the job .
“ They ’re the ones who basically browbeat other countries into not spending , ” he said , “ who give intellectual and political backbone to other countries ’ conservative leanings not to stimulate . ”
Without knowing it , Mr. Koppe ’s 25 employees are playing their small part in keeping the German economy afloat .
But nearly 70,000 employees of the automaker Daimler have been placed on short - hour status .
On the bright side , it means they are able to play with their children , tend to their gardens or  with further government incentives  receive the kind of advanced training that will make them even more skilled when orders pick up again .
Harder times all but certainly lie ahead for Germany .
Commerzbank said Monday that it expected the German economy to contract by a shocking 6 to 7 percent in 2009 , roughly double earlier projections and the worst decline of the postwar era .
Critics of the German government ’s cautious approach to stimulus fear that because Germany is feeling the brunt of the worldwide recession last , its policymakers are underestimating its force .
Indeed , to travel between the United States and Germany is to find two countries experiencing the economic slowdown completely differently .
The severity of the downturn does not appear to have sunk in yet in for Germans .
There was no real estate bubble here , and few people have a substantial portion of their savings or retirement accounts invested in the stock market .
The unemployment rate has risen more than a percentage point , to 8.5 percent in February from 7.1 percent last November .
But , significantly , the latest figure is still lower than it was just a year ago .
“ In contrast to America , our social systems are not on the decline right now , ” Mrs. Merkel said Sunday night in a widely watched interview on a television talk show .
“ Pensions are not cut , unemployment insurance is not reduced .
On the contrary , we can register stable and , in some sectors , also rising expenditures , and this makes me hope that our social market economy will enable us to cope with this complicated situation . ”
US Senator Dianne Feinstein hopes to update President Barack Obama 's $ 838bn economic stimulus package so that American ISPs can deter child pornography , copyright infringement , and other unlawful activity by way of " reasonable network management . "
Clearly , a lobbyist whispering in Feinstein 's ear has taken Comcast 's now famous euphemism even further into the realm of nonsense .
According to Public Knowledge , Feinstein 's network management amendment did not find a home in the stimulus bill that landed on the Senate floor .
But lobbyists speaking with the Washington DC - based internet watchdog said that California 's senior Senator is now hoping to insert this language via conference committee - a House - Senate pow - wow were bill disputes are resolved .
" This is the most backdoor of all the backdoor ways of doing things , " Public Knowledge 's Art Brodsky told The Reg .
" Conference committees are notorious for being the most opaque of all legislative processes . "
Obama 's stimulus bill sets aside between $ 6bn and $ 9bn for expanding American broadband into rural areas , and Senator Feinstein hopes to ( PDF ) augment this Broadband Technology Opportunities Program so that it " allows for reasonable network management practices such as deterring unlawful activity , including child pornography and copyright infringement . "
On one level , Obama 's bill is an effort to boost the American economy .
On another , it 's an opportunity for lobbyists to make a mockery American government .
According to Public Knowledge , the Motion Picture Association of America is behind Feinstein 's language .
The MPAA does n't like copyright infringement .
And you can bet the child pornography bit was tossed in for added effect .
But the " network management " bit sounds like ISP speak .
As Art Brodsky and his colleagues pointed out , network management is used to manage networks - not filter content .
Content filters are used to filter content .
But American ISPs - particularly cable ISPs - will take any excuse they can find to throttle certain traffic .
And if they 're using copyright infringement and child porn as excuses , they 'll have to start sniffing packets .
So , Feinstein 's amendment would also destroy net privacy - if there 's any out there .
Word from Public Knowledge is that Congressman Henry Waxman will back Feinstein 's amendment when it turns up in conference committee .
Representing a district near Hollywood , Waxman has long backed the MPAA and the Recording Ass. of America in their efforts to crack down on P2P file sharing . ®
WASHINGTON  The chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben S. Bernanke , called on Tuesday for a broad overhaul of financial regulation that would include a powerful new regulator to keep a much tighter grip on institutions considered “ too big to fail . ”
At the same time , Mr. Bernanke stoked a new controversy by endorsing more flexible accounting rules that would not force banks to book as many losses during an economic downturn as current rules require .
In so doing , the Fed chairman came closer than other top officials to supporting a policy known as “ regulatory forbearance , ” a phrase that became an epithet among policy makers after the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s .
Although the Fed chairman did not use that phrase , he called for reducing the “ pro-cyclical ” aspects of current regulation  the tendency of accounting rules and capital requirements to aggravate both financial retrenchment during a slowdown and financial excesses during a boom .
This just is n't going to be a good picture ---- it does n't matter how much cilantro I throw on it .
But I promise it tastes good .
I did some research on tandoori chicken last week and learned that a lot of times , the way the red coloring is achieved in restaurants is through food coloring .
The more food coloring you add , the more red your chicken will be .
I find this highly amusing , yet no one else in my family finds it as funny as I do .
But imagine .
The chicken could be * blue *! or * chartreuse *!
and still taste the same !
anyway .
If you do n't want to use food coloring , do n't .
But you wo n't get red chicken .
The Ingredients .
3 - 4 pounds chicken --- pieces or whole , your choice .
I had a whole one I bought on sale a while ago , and skinned it before I put it in the crock .
I have abnormal issues with chicken skin .
1 cup plain yogurt , divided ( you could use sour cream , instead )
1 teaspoon ginger
1 teaspoon coriander
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper ( or more to taste )
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
( the picture shows whole .
I grabbed the wrong bottle . )
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon kosher salt
6 cardamom pods , or 1/4 teaspoon ground
1 tablespoon cumin
6 cloves garlic ( I tossed them in whole )
5 - 6 drops red food coloring ( optional )
1 lemon , juiced
The Directions .
Use a 5 - 6 quart slow cooker .
Skin the bird and toss out the neck and the stuff from inside .
Shudder a few times .
In a small mixing bowl , combine 1 / 2 cup yogurt with all dry spices , and the red food coloring .
Smear all over the bird , inside and out .
Put the cardamom pods inside the bird , and lower it into the crockpot .
Toss whole garlic cloves on top , and squeeze on the lemon juice .
Cover and cook on low for 6 - 8 hours , or on high for 4 .
You can check doneness with a meat thermometer , too .
Serve with basmati rice .
After removing meat from the pot , stir in the remaining 1 / 2 cup of yogurt to make a yummy sauce to pour over the meat and rice .
The Verdict .
I really liked this a lot .
The meat was spicy where it was coated in the blend , but otherwise just slightly infused with the smoky flavor .
I was able to peel some non-spicy meat off the bones for the kids ( which they dipped in bbq sauce ) , and Adam and I piled our plates high with the meat on top of rice with lots of the tandoori sauce .
If I was going to make this for company , I 'd use boneless , skinless thighs .
The bones got in my way .
I 've saved the carcass to

GETTING to the church on time took on a whole new dimension for bridesmaid Barbara Haddrill .
A committed eco-campaigner , the 30 - year - old refused to fly the 10,500 miles to the wedding in Brisbane , Australia .
Instead Barbara , pictured , who lives in Machynlleth , decided to make the epic 50 - day journey overland to attend her best friend Helen ’s wedding .
She said : “ I ’ve been aware of aviation and the immense impact that its carbon emissions have on global warming for some time .
“ So the only solution was to make the journey overland . ”
Barbara calculated that a one - way flight from Heathrow to Brisbane would emit 5.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide – her overland journey produced about a tonne of the greenhouse gas .
She left Wales on September 1 , 2006 with a tent in one rucksack and a turquoise bridesmaid ’s dress in the other , after resigning from her job as a biologist at the Centre for Alternative Technology , in Machynlleth .
Barbara spent £ 2,000 on ticket and insurance costs for her outward journey alone , not including day - to - day food and living expenses – she said she ate local produce at all times and slept in her tent when she was not on a train or a boat .
And her return journey was even more expensive with tickets and insurance in excess of £ 1,900 .
By comparison , a direct 24 - hour flight from London Heathrow to Brisbane , spending one month in Australia , before returning again by direct flight costs just £ 797 with Qantas .
“ Due to carbon emissions I really did not want to fly , and this was the only other way to do it , ” Barbara said .
“ Plus , I did n’t take a gap year , and wanted the opportunity to really travel and see a bit of the world . ”
The trans - global adventure took Barbara from London to Moscow by bus , then she took the Trans - Siberian Railway to Beijing .
Trains and boats then took her through Vietnam , Cambodia , Thailand , and Malaysia before she boarded a cargo ship for Australia .
The culmination of her journey was being bridesmaid at Steve and Helen ’s wedding on the beach on North Stradbrook Island .
“ It was lovely – worth it all , ” she said .
But the return journey home saw Barbara break her resolution not to fly .
“ I took a short flight from Darwin to Bali in Indonesia , basically because I had not planned my route back and it was the only realistic option I could take , ” she said .
“ I did n’t want to do it , but when you look at my journey overall there was a balance to it . ”
A “ chaotic ” few days followed as she boarded buses and boats to get through Java and Singapore , before she took a cargo ship to Genoa through the Suez Canal .
“ That part of the journey was quite hectic , and there were a few times when I did not always feel as safe as I would have liked to .
“ But once I got on the cargo ship , that was a lot of fun .
“ We had hog roasts on board , there was a gym and generally more to do . ”
Barbara took a train from Genoa to Milan where she had an emotional reunion with her mother , Carol , 62 , and sister , Penelope , 32 , before travelling by train to Paris .
But even then , her journey was not over as Barbara decided to cycle to Calais before boarding a ferry to the UK and the train back to Wales .
“ There were times when , now looking back , I think I did put myself at risk , ” she said .
“ But I am a strong person , a positive person and fundamentally believe in doing things about the environment .
Anyway everything in life has its risks .
“ For me , the environment was more important than the cost . ”
Barbara is now preparing for her next travel challenge – a journey around Wales in a horse and cart .
Barbara ’s book about her overland journey to Australia , Babs2 Brisbane – Three Continents , Two Friends and One Life - Changing Journey , will be published by CAT Publications , next month , priced £ 10.99 .

Great News : Harry Reid says income taxes are voluntary !
Here ’s an absolutely remarkable video in which Senate majority leader Harry Reid repeatedly explains to a dumbfounded interviewer that paying income taxes is completely voluntary .
Please keep in mind that Reid ’s the guy in charge of getting the trillion dollar “ stimulus ” package through the senate .
This is the guy who ’s supposedly in charge of writing the tax code .
And as far as we can tell , this must be the guy who served as Tim Geithner and Tom Daschle ’s tax advisor .
We ’d like to pause now to extend our warmest congratulations to Barbara Boxer .
As a result of this video , there is now proof that she is no longer the dumbest member of the United States Senate .
— Paramedics found two men with gunshot wounds inside a wrecked car on Interstate 440 early Sunday , Raleigh police said .
A 911 caller reported seeing a single , wrecked car on the shoulder of the Outer Beltline , between Wake Forest Road and Capital Boulevard , around 3:30 a.m.
Police said that first responders found Julian Annan Quao , 24 , of Raleigh and William Deontia Hall , 25 , of Wake Forest , inside the car .
Both men were shot in the back , police said .
They were taken to WakeMed to be treated for serious but non-life - threatening injuries .
Quao was listed in good condition , and Hall has been released from WakeMed , hospital officials said .
Police said the shooting occurred sometime after Quao and Hall left the 40/30 Room nightclub on Capital Boulevard .
Quao 's injuries then caused him to crash on the Outer Beltline .
Investigators were unsure of the exact location of the shooting .
They did not have a suspect or motive Sunday evening .
A man has been bashed to death in front of passengers at Sydney Airport .
Witnesses say a group of up to 20 men attacked the man in the Qantas domestic terminal earlier this afternoon .
They say the fighting began near the departure and arrivals gate before moving to the check in area .
One witness , Phil Crew , says the group closed in on the victim , using the metal bollards in the check in area as weapons .
" It looked like two people fighting at first , and then all of a sudden a whole rush of guys came through the crowd , picked up the poles and just started smacking this guy in the head with the poles , " he said .
Mr Cruz says the group of men then fled , escaping in taxis .
" They started grabbing the metal poles that break up the check in area and swinging them almost like swords at each other heads , " said another witness , Naomi .
" Then one man with a metal pole , another man was on the ground , and [ he ] started smashing his head . "
Nurse Karen - Anne
Whyte from NSW 's far south coast , witnessed the attack and came to the victim 's aid .
" A couple of men were hitting him with one of those really large bollard things and he fell , " she said .
" I work in emergency departments and Moruya and Batemans Bay hospitals so I just commenced giving him CPR because he had a massive head injury . "
The 28 - year - old victim was taken to Prince of Wales Hospital but police have since confirmed he is dead .
Detective Inspector Peter Williams told a news conference that police were investigating outlaw motorcycle gangs over the incident .
He described the attack as " gruesome " and the perpetrators as " groups of cowards " purporting to be tough .
He said police were not ruling out a connection between the incident and a series of drive - by shootings in the western Sydney suburb of Auburn overnight .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The son of an expert on the Dead Sea Scrolls impersonated other experts in order to further his father ’s views on the 2,000 - year - old documents , New York prosecutors said on Thursday .
During a six - month period in 2008 , Raphael Haim Golb , whose father Norman Golb is a University of Chicago professor of Jewish history , created dozens of Internet aliases in the names of individuals who were active in Dead Sea Scrolls scholarship .
The scrolls shed light on the life of Jews and early Christians at the time of Jesus .
They were discovered by Bedouin shepherds in caves near the Dead Sea in 1947 .
Many scholars believe the scrolls were assembled by a Jewish sect known as the Essenes who lived close to where the scrolls were discovered .
Norman Golb has taken the position the scrolls were produced by multiple Jewish sects .
According to the Manhattan District Attorney ’s office , Golb was motivated by the belief that his father ’s theories were not taken seriously enough .
Norman Golb did not respond to a request for comment .
Golb is charged with identity theft , criminal impersonation and aggravated harassment , and faces a maximum of four years in prison if convicted .

Are the Best about Hitch 's habit of adapting trashy novels instead of great , literary ones .
The idea is that great novels depend on their language , while trash novels depend on their plot .
Since the language is n't going to make it into the movie , the idea is , great novels do n't adapt as well as bad ones .
I do n't think it 's that simple .
I think the danger with great novels is that you 'll try to adapt them faithfully .
The only novels safe to adapt " faithfully " are those which are pretty much already written with a movie in mind -- anything by John Grisham or Tom Clancy , say .
If you try to adapt even a page - turner like WAR AND PEACE faithfully , you 'll get lost in the subplots .
But you can make a pretty good movie out of it if you do n't care what readers of the book think .
When you 're adapting THE BIRDS , though , you 're not going to worry about jettisoning scenes that do n't help the movie .
The Hitch technique for adapting a novel is to read the book once , and then not look at it again .
Whatever you remember is the movie .
If there 's something you do n't remember , it is n't memorable enough for the movie .
I 've adapted books that way and it works pretty well .
I usually go back and skim the novel after I 've written a draft , to see if there 's anything I really ought to have remembered , but there usually is n't .
I think it might have been Neil Gaiman who pointed out that you can't " ruin " a book by unfaithfully adapting it to the screen .
The book is still there .
But a movie has to be its own thing .
Hopefully you can retain the tone and the theme , but ultimately your responsibility is to make a good movie , not a faithful one .

What should governments at the federal , state , and local level be doing to combat the spread of the Coronavirus ?
Does the proper response include getting out of the way of private entities better positioned to address the challenges ?
Are extraordinary measures needed in an extraordinary crisis ?
As Cato scholars continue to analyze the government and non‐ ​government response to the crisis , they will be looking for signals that public policymakers are learning from this experience and will make reforms to ensure that our system is more nimble in handling similar situations in the future .
Matt Philbin of the Business & Media Institute , which aims to expose the anti-free - enterprise bias of the mainstream media , finds fault with my list of the 12 things and people most to blame for our current financial mess .
Here ’s what seemed to bother Philbin most :
According to Time ’s Justin Fox , the financial crisis and the recession can be blamed on a mixture of phenomena ( good times , too much money ) and people ( Alan Greenspan , Wall Street executives , the ratings agencies ) .
But ultimate culpability for the recession lies with the free market and – wait for it !
– Republicans .
George Bush came in No. 9 on my list of the most blameworthy .
No. 10 was the Commodity Futures Modernization Act , which was passed by a Republican Congress ( and signed into law by Democrat Bill Clinton ) .
That , and I failed to blame Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as much as Charles Calomiris and Peter Wallison do .
Calomiris and Wallison have actually failed to make any kind of convincing case that Fannie and Freddie caused the housing mess .
What they ’ve shown is that the two mortgage giants made things worse by buying subprime and Alt - A mortgage securities in the latter days of the housing bubble .
But this does nothing to explain why subprime and Alt - A lending exploded in the first place , given that Fannie and Freddie were n’t doing any of it .
Other scholars have speculated that it was the late - 2003 sidelining of Fannie and Freddie — which for all their faults did stick to pretty conservative mortgage underwriting standards — that set off the insanity .
Then there ’s the thing about picking on the Republicans .
The Republican Party controlled the White House for the last eight years , and Congress for most of that time .
That , and it has been the dominant party at the national level for most of the past 28 years .
If there is to be any accountability in American political life , then the Republicans have to accept much of the blame for what has gone wrong .
The only way to get out of accepting that blame is to claim that Republican elected officials were so ineffectual that they played no significant role in steering economic policy over the past three decades ( this seems to be Rush Limbaugh ’s view ) , or to argue that economic policy just does n’t have much impact .
I have some sympathy with the latter point — the global economy is awfully complex , making it really hard to know what the economic effect of a particular government action is .
But is that an argument Philbin really wants to be making ?
Apple promised at WWDC 2008 that Snow Leopard would usher in a redesigned version of QuickTime that " optimizes support for modern audio and video formats resulting in extremely efficient media playback . "
According to AppleInsider , the playback interface is also getting a pretty serious overhaul as well is the latest test build of Mac OS X 10.6 .
Dubbed QuickTime X Player , the new version is said to completely dispense with the window chrome of the current version .
All controls mimic those of the current popup overlays used in QuickTime 's full - screen mode .
The only remaining window chrome is a transparent title bar that disappears when there is no active mousing .
From the " artist rendition " based on descriptions given to the site , it seems as though the player mimics full - screen mode in a moveable , floating window .
I think I like the idea of the controls being available only when necessary , though I 'm not sure eliminating the title bar is necessary in a non -full - screen mode .
Safari 4 already has its share of detractors due to its title - bar tabs that break the existing window paradigm .
A sort of floating full - screen viewport seems like it 's taking things a little too far .
On the upside , though , QuickTime X Player is also said to gain the availability to export clips in a variety of sizes , echoing earlier reports that Apple may eliminate the vestigial " QuickTime Pro " paid upgrade .
The exported clips can be sent automatically to iTunes or shared via a MobileMe account .
AppleInsider 's report further noted that the latest Snow Leopard build is currently leveraging a Core Location framework for the Date and Time control panel , marking the predicted location of a user on a world map with a pin .
Preview has gained an annotations toolbar , VoiceOver is being revved to version 3 , and Finder icons have regained their built - in QuickLook previews .
Still , the interface for accessing nested folders in stack that appeared in the last test build has disappeared .
Note that Snow Leopard is still in the refining stages , however , so there is no guarantee that some or all of these features wo n't change before the final release expected this summer .
The British Computing Society has joined the chorus of criticism of the way the government has hidden major changes to data protection law in unrelated legislation - the Coroners and Justice Bill .
The BCS said the bill " runs counter to the intentions and provisions of the Data Protection Act ( DPA ) " and " severely curtails the independence of the Information Commissioner " .
The organisation also said the law would be unlikely to pass muster under the Human Rights Act , could increase citizens ' distrust of government and " could have disastrous consequences in the hands of a less benevolent government " .
The Coroners and Justice Bill will allow more data sharing between government departments without any oversight from Parliament .
In fact the bill will allow ministers to remove any legal barrier that might exist to data sharing .
The clauses added to the bill were based on the Data Sharing Review - written by the Information Commissioner Richard Thomas " in an independent capacity " .
The only thing a minister has to do before changing data sharing laws is the get the opinion of the ICO first .
The BCS is also concerned as to why such major changes to data sharing law are included in an unrelated piece of legislation rather than in a separate bill so the issues would be properly discussed .
The statement said : " BCS believes strongly that the process being used to introduce Information Sharing Orders as part of a much larger Bill concerned with other matters precludes sufficient public debate , discussion and Parliamentary scrutiny of proposals that involve novel and very general - some would say draconian - powers of great significance to every UK citizen and organisation . "
Ian Ryder , BCS deputy CEO , said all the responses received from members agreed on one thing : " These proposals are far too ill - defined and general for their stated purpose , and are as a result potentially dangerous , and will do more harm than good . "
Ryder added that the laws , used wrongly , " would permit the restriction - and ultimately the destruction - of the right to personal and corporate data privacy " .
The British Medical Association has also criticised the bill , and asked what problem the law was trying to solve .
" The BMA is not aware of any problems with legitmate information exchanges to which this clause would be the solution . "
The doctors ' group said that clause 152 of the bill " could potentially allow any Health Secretary access to individual health records .
And it is very worrying that this Bill would allow a Secretay of State to strip patients and doctors of rights in relation to the control of sensitive health information . "
The BMA said that trust between doctor and patient was very important , and that patients would be less likely to offer information to their doctor if they knew this information could be passed onto other government departments .
Neither the Justice Ministry nor the ICO were able to respond at the time of writing . ®
Despite popular perception , even those at the top of music business have a sense of humor , something captured repeatedly in Steve Knopper 's new book , Appetite for Self - Destruction : The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age .
In Knopper 's telling , the decline of the major labels is n't just about technology or peer - to - peer programs — it 's about personalities , and his book is stuffed with stories of music execs in action .
Here 's one from late in the book :
All the SDMI tension came to a head in late August at the Villa Castelletti , an opulent hotel in hilly wine country about twenty miles from Florence , Italy .
As the executives convened in a courtyard within the villa , they could hear sporadic shotgun blasts in the distance , aimed at scattering birds from the vineyards .
The meeting went back and forth , and [ Sony Music VP ]
Al Smith was getting worked up as usual , responding negatively to something chairman Talal Shamoon had said .
Finally , Smith walked out .
Three seconds later there came a resounding " Boom ! " from a shotgun .
The SDMI members looked at each other uncertainly .
Without missing a beat , Shamoon spoke up : " I understand there 's an opening at Sony Music . "
It 's funny , but also rather sad — not because of the birds and shotguns , but because the meeting was part of the hugely expensive Secure Digital Music Initiative that the labels launched in 1998 to slap a standard DRM scheme onto music .
The big meetings took place all over the world ( and at places like the Villa Castelletti , which are ... not cheap ) , and they finally produced a watermarking scheme that was " uncrackable . "
The group started a contest and invited teams to hack SDMI ; computer science professor Ed Felten soon defeated four separate watermarking schemes , was subsequently threatened by SDMI over publication of the results , sued them back , and the whole thing was eventually dropped .
So was SDMI .
Had the music industry treated digital music sharing as it treated the CD — not obsessing over copy protection , embracing a new format , making money by the boatload — it might still be riding high .
But the industry did n't do so , and , as Knopper chronicles , it has paid the price .
Welcome to the Jungle
The music business has never been a " normal " business .
Consider , simply for the sake of illustration , an anecdote about the label Casablanca back in the 1970s :
Promo man Danny Davis , who did n't do drugs of any kinds , famously recalled talking to a radio programmer on the phone while a colleague trashed the stuff on his desk with a golf club , then lit the desk on fire .
" Almost anything could have happened at Casablanca , " says Bill Aucoin , who managed Casablanca 's most famous rock act , KISS , in those early days .
" The first offices were a converted home with a pool house .
If you went to the pool house at any time , day or night , as a record promoter or DJ , you probably could get laid at any moment . "
The industry learned to mint hits ( and therefore money ) in the 60s and 70s , but it was the CD that made record companies into global behemoths .
Knopper takes half his book explaining the CD boom , only coming to Napster 113 pages into his tale .
That 's because , in his telling of the story , the downfall of the labels in the age of digital distribution only makes sense when looking at the last major format shift and the huge profits it brought the industry .
If you 've been watching Battlestar Galactica recently — or reading your Nietzsche — you 'll be familiar with theories about the cyclical nature of history , and that 's how Knopper sets up his story .
When the CD was first introduced , plenty of record company execs hated it .
One says , even now , " I thought [ the engineers who designed it ] could have done something to stop piracy . "
Looking back at the CD era , though , it 's clear that those little plastic discs were a goldmine .
People loved the new format , many repurchased their collections on CD , and prices for recorded music went way up .
How did the industry respond to this windfall ?
By screwing the artists .
Knopper describes how the labels wrote new contracts to cover the new format , contracts which featured larger " packaging reductions " and " free goods allowances . "
In addition to the deductions , artist royalty rates were reduced .
" After labels factored in these newfangled deductions , " Knopper says , " typical artists received roughly 81 cents per disc .
Under the LP system , artists made a little more than 75 cents per disc .
So labels sold CDs for almost $ 8 more than LPs at stores , but typical artists made just six cents more per record . "
Such practices fueled a CD boom that ran from 1984 through 2000 , at which point the bottom began falling out of the industry .
After two decades of expensive music — and little support for cheap singles — labels had grown fat on pumping out albums with a couple of hits .
The other songs might be no more than mediocre , but fans who wanted a particular hit usually bought the disc anyway .
( A point proven by the fact that I once owned a copy of Chumbawamba 's Tubthumper . )
The rise of Napster made clear to the music industry that the next great format had arrived .
Knowing how much cash they earned from the last format shift , one might expect the industry to be thrilled with a system that could introduce more music fans to more music more quickly .
Turning the digital download into the " next CD " might have seemed the industry 's number one priority , but it was n't .
The industry hoped that digital would go away .
Death spiral
The sheer number of interviews that Knopper did for the book is impressive , and it lets him flesh out the personalities behind the music industry .
It also means that he has many obscure but enlightening anecdotes at his command , such as one from Liquid Audio ( remember them ? ) exec Gerry Kearby .
Kearby was trying to be the counter - Napster , the online distributor that was label - friendly and used DRM .
But when he tried to talk to the labels about distributing their music , he could n't get a commitment .
One day in a moment of pure honesty , [ a Sony rep ] said , ' Look , Kearby , my job is to keep you down .
We do n't ever want you to succeed . '
Kearby tells Knopper about the moment when he knew it would never work .
" One day in a moment of pure honesty , [ a Sony rep ] said , ' Look , Kearby , my job is to keep you down .
We do n't ever want you to succeed . '
Some of them were more interested in experimenting than others , there 's no doubt about it .
But they were , in effect , buggy - whip manufacturers , trying to keep the auto at bay as long as they could . "
One of the weaknesses of the book is that this sad tale of digital ineptitude is widely known , and Appetite for Self - Destruction does n't offer any new insight for those who have followed along at sites like Ars Technica .
Here 's the short version : after the Napster lawsuit , the labels dabbled halfheartedly with their own craptacular services ( remember PressPlay ? ) but never got serious about digital distribution .
It took Steve Jobs and the iPod to put Apple in a commanding position , one which allowed the company to launch the iTunes Music Store with major label content and offer tracks for a buck .
DRM , which the labels insisted on , meant that Apple came to dominate music sales in the US ( it would n't license its Fairplay system to others , and the iPod was the dominant music player in the market ) .
Only belatedly did the labels realize what had happened , and they finally tried to break Apple 's chokehold by dropping DRM for stores like Amazon .
There 's also a bit about KaZaA , the Sony BMG rootkit fiasco , and the futility of the RIAA 's lawsuit campaign .
But much of this is available elsewhere , and not just in article form at the various blogs and news sites that have followed the story .
Books like Steven Levy 's The Perfect Thing ( iPod ) and Joseph Menn 's All the Rave ( Napster ) tackle some of the same topics in even greater detail .
But though Appetite for Self - Destruction covers plenty of familiar ground , what sets it apart is the emphasis on personality so often missing from technology reporting .
Readers will come away from the book without much sympathy for the major labels but with a much better understanding of the people at the top who made key decisions , and why their own histories in music might have led them to make the choices that they did .
Knopper also does a fine job of connecting the Napster / iTunes / P2P story with the story about the CD boom years ( though this does produce a long and sometimes tedious chapter on " boy bands " whose relevance to the main issues seems secondary ) .
This is deliberate , and done in service of Knopper 's own argument that many of the problems that the labels had with digital distribution came from two decades of growing fat on CD album sales .
They simply were n't ready or willing to adapt to a new world of a la carte singles and lower per-track prices .
Knopper quotes Robert Pittman , the cofounder of MTV .
" Stealing music is not killing music , " said Pittman .
" When I talk to people in the music business , most of them will admit that the problem is they 're selling songs and not albums .
I mean , you do the math . "
" I realized that as an industry we 'd kind of been smoking crack , " said Universal exec Barney Wragg , after leaving the label in 2005 .
( Wragg took a job as head of digital music at EMI the next year . )
And James Mercer , the lead singer of indie band the Shins , was even more blunt .
" You see these articles about the disaster in the music business , " he said .
" When you think about how unhealthy the business has been , this is like lancing the fucking boil and cleaning it out .
It 's not a fucking disaster to regular bands out there . "
Peppered with such quotes and backed by tremendous interviewing , Appetite for Self - Destruction is a great read .
It does n't offer a lot to the technology geeks or the policy people , but it does sum up four decades of music industry history and personality for those who want to understand how the industry arrived at its current sorry state .
マルチプレイRPGから始まった，ゲーム界における「仮想空間 」 マルチプレイRPGから始まった，ゲーム界における「仮想空間」
──以前，江渡さんは 「 昨今のメタバース・ブームは，“ 何度目かの波 ” みたいなものである」とお話しされていたのですが，たしかに江渡さんがメディア・アートやIT研究に関わられた最初期（90年代初頭）に，仮想空間的な概念やその表現もまだ一般的には広がっていなかったがゆえに，関わられていた方々の入り込み方もいまとはだいぶ違っていたと思います．まずは「仮想空間の歴史」的な流れを，江渡さんご自身のお仕事や作品制作の経緯と絡めてお聞きかせいただき，その上でメタバース事業の可能性なり問題点をご指摘いただけたらと思います．
「 Island of Kesmai 」 江渡：自分の過去を振り返りつつお話ししますと，やはり仮想空間の歴史はそれなりに長いんですよね．仮想空間的な試みが，ある程度のリアリティを持って語られるようになった最初のタイトルに，「 Island of Kesmai」 という80年代初頭のオンラインゲームがあります．
実はこのゲームが出てくる前に，マイケル・トイという人物が作った「
Rogue 」という有名なゲームがありまして，これ
はUnix上のコンソールで動かす，文字だけで完結したゲームで，ひたすらテキスト表示だけでユーザーがダンジョンのなかを探検し，成長し，鎧や剣を使ってドラゴンを倒して，アミュレットを取ってくる内容でした．
先にご紹介し た 「 Island of Kesmai」 は，見た目に関しては今お話しした 「 Rogue」と同様，単純に文字だけを使ったRPGなのですが，この「 Island of Kesmai」はアメリカのパソコン通信会社CompuServeがホストしていて，CompuServeに繋がっている他のユーザーとゲーム上でコミュニケーションが取れる点が画期的でした [ ※01 ] ．
ちなみにこのゲームには，マルチプレイ機能だけ外した「 Dungeons of Kesmai」というゲームもあって……僕はそちらのほうをプレイしたことはあるのですが，残念ながら「 Island of Kesmai」のほうは話だけで，実際にプレイしたことはなかったです．ともあれ，マルチプレイRPGとしては，おそらくこの「 Island of Kesmai」 が一番最初だと思います．
「 Habitat 」 その他 に ，80年代終盤に富士通が運営していた「 Habitat」という仮想空間がありました．もともとはルーカスフィルム社によって開発されたシステムで，ユーザーがオンライン上の仮想空間を探検しながら，他のアヴァターとコミュニケーションを取ることができました．仮想空間上でユーザー同士が恋愛をしたり，結婚をしたり……みたいなトピックが話題となりました．ちなみにこの「Habitat」というシステムは，日本の富士通が「FM-TOWNS」というマシンの売り込みのために輸入したもので，80年代末〜90年代初頭ぐらいでしょうか，日本でもそれなりに熱狂的なユーザーがいました [ ※02 ] ．
少年時代の僕もそういう事例を見て興味を持ちはじめて，「こんな面白い世界があるんだ．やってみたいな」と思いましたが，その頃には実現しなかった．なぜならば，CompuServeに料金を支払ってサーヴィスを受けたり，FM-TOWNSのようなスペックのマシンが買える年齢ではなかったので，興味はあったけれど実際に参加することは叶わなかったわけです．
ちなみに僕がパソコン通信を始めたのは1985年頃……中学二年生の時ですね．当時は掲示板や電子メール，チャットとかにハマっていました．そして，いつかこれが仮想空間やオンラインゲームのようなものに発展しないかな……と思っていました．
《 PeepHole 》 江渡：しばらくは自分史の振り返りが続きますが……そんなわけで91年に，僕は慶應義塾大学のSFC（湘南藤沢キャンパス）に進学して，そこでインターネットなるものを初めて知りました．「こんな面白いものがあるんだ」と思って，世界中のコンピュータが参加できるようなネットワークがすでにあるのならば，これを使ってオンラインゲームができるのではないかと考え，3Dグラフィックスの技術を学ぼうと色々調べたり，いかにしてその技術とインターネットを融合できるかを真剣に考えていました．
そして3年生のとき藤幡正樹先生の研究室に入ったこともありまして，単純にオンライン上のコミュニケーションだけではなく，現実世界との融合を考えるようになりました．そして作ったのが《PeepHole》という作品です．これは早い話ウェブカムのようなものですが，コンピュータに接続されたカメラがウェブサーバにも接続されていて，ブラウザでそれにアクセスすると，ヴィデオカメラが捉えている風景が見えるという趣向です．カメラで写した風景がウェブブラウザに取り込まれることで，現実世界がウェブのなかに入ってくる感覚が生まれるところが非常に面白いと思っていました．また後日，この《PeepHole》を改良して，ウェブブラウザ上でカメラの向きを変えられるようなシステムを作って公開しました．
─ ─92，93年ということは，ちょうど「Mosaic」が発表された時期に重なっていますから，江渡さんはタイムリーにインターネットに出会ったということですね．
江渡：そうですね．僕 がWWW（ワールドワイドウェブ）に出会った頃
，Mosaicはまだなくて，そこへアクセスするためのウェブブラウザが色々出てきた時代でした．だけど間もなくNCSA Mosaicが決定打として出てきて，普及しました．学校でも「皆でMosaicを使いましょう」とプロモーションしていました [ ※03 ] ．

Nemo alerted me ( after in turn being alerted by Calculated Risk ) to a recent paper by Thomas Hoenig , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City , brilliantly entitled “ Too Big Has Failed . ”
Here is an excerpt :
[ T ]he current path is beset by ad hoc decision making and the potential for much political interference , including efforts to force problem institutions to lend if they accept public funds ; operate under other imposed controls ; and limit management pay , bonuses and severance .
If an institution ’s management has failed the test of the marketplace , these managers should be replaced .
They should not be given public funds and then micro-managed , as we are now doing under TARP , with a set of political strings attached .
You could call this a free market argument in favor of temporary nationalization .
Here ’s another :
[ F ] or failed institutions that have proven to be too big or too complex to manage well , steps must be taken to break up their operations and sell them off in more manageable pieces .
We must also look for other ways to limit the creation and growth of firms that might be considered “ too big to fail . ”
And my favorite :
[ S ] ome are now claiming that public authorities do not have the expertise and capacity to take over and run a “ too big to fail ” institution .
They contend that such takeovers would destroy a firm ’s inherent value , give talented employees a reason to leave , cause further financial panic and require many years for the restructuring process .
We should ask , though , why would anyone assume we are better off leaving an institution under the control of failing managers , dealing with the large volume of “ toxic ” assets they created and coping with a raft of politically imposed controls that would be placed on their operations ?
This is coming from the head of a Federal Reserve member bank , not some blogger working on too little sleep .
Calculated Risk speculates about the significance :
This strikes me as a break in the ranks , and although Hoenig is speaking for himself ( not the Fed ) , this might indicate a change in direction .
The paper is only 15 pages and is very accessibly written .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A former police officer tearfully apologized Monday for his role in an elderly Atlanta woman 's shooting death during a botched drug raid , and another told a judge he prays daily for the victim .
" I used to think I was a good person , " ex-cop Gregg Junnier said before breaking down on the witness stand during a sentencing hearing in a federal courtroom in Atlanta , CNN affiliate WXIA reported .
Junnier and two other ex-officers , Arthur Tesler and Jason Smith , face prison in connection with the November 2006 drug raid that left 92 - year - old Kathryn Johnston dead in a hail of gunfire .
Investigators later determined the raid was based on falsified paperwork stating that illegal drugs were present in the home .
The killing prompted a major overhaul of the Atlanta police drug unit .
Smith , like Junnier , apologized during Monday 's sentencing hearing .
The proceedings were expected to resume Tuesday .
" I pray daily for Ms. Johnston .
I also pray other officers in Atlanta will have the moral fortitude I did n't have , " Smith testified Monday , according to WXIA .
Smith , Junnier and Tesler pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death .
Smith and Junnier also pleaded guilty to state charges of voluntary manslaughter and making false statements , and Smith admitted to planting bags of marijuana in Johnston 's house after her death .
Tesler was convicted on one state count of making false statements for filling out an affidavit stating that an informant had purchased crack cocaine at Johnston 's home in a crime - plagued neighborhood near downtown Atlanta .
The informant denied having been to Johnston 's home , leading to investigations by local authorities and the FBI , and the breakup and reorganization of the Atlanta police narcotics unit .
Police said Johnston fired at them with an old pistol during the raid , and they shot back in self - defense .
Johnston 's one shot went through her front door and over the officers ' heads ; they responded with 39 shots , hitting Johnston five times .
" Her death was the foreseeable culmination of a long - standing conspiracy in which the officers violated their oaths of office , " Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon-Peter Kelly said , according to CNN affiliate WSB .
The officers " regularly swore falsely " to get warrants and make cases , he said .
Federal prosecutors said officers cut corners to make more time for lucrative side jobs providing additional security to businesses , often while on duty and for cash payments .
Johnston 's family was not in court Monday .
But U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes heard a letter from Johnston 's niece during the hearing , and family spokesman Markel Hutchins told WXIA he hopes an FBI report of the case can be used to prompt additional charges at the local level .
" The real culprit in this is the culture within the Atlanta Police Department and the higher - ups that laid the foundation .
Why are n't they being held accountable ? "
Hutchins asked .
The probe also led to guilty pleas by the police sergeant in charge of the narcotics unit and another officer who admitted to extortion , federal prosecutors said .

re : Colbert King 's piece -- gee what a surprise , urban jurisdiction , lenient on criminals and juvenile criminals in particular , and there are murders directly traceable to such lenience .
The " news " piece is just agenda journalism and laughable at that .
Does anyone truly believe that the ascension of Eric Holder is going to do a thing about the " face " of the criminal justice system ?

This is the thirteenth post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
In this post I will review lectures twenty and twenty - one on parallel algorithms .
These lectures cover the basics of multithreaded programming and multithreaded algorithms .
Lecture twenty begins with a good overview of multithreaded programming paradigm , introduces to various concepts of parallel programming and at the end talks about the Cilk programming language .
Lecture twenty - one implements several multithreaded algorithms , such as n x n matrix addition , n x n matrix multiplication , and parallel merge - sort .
It then goes into great detail to analyze the running time and parallelism of these algorithms .
Lecture 20 : Parallel Algorithms I
The lecture starts with an introduction to a particular model of parallel computation called dynamic multithreading .
It 's easiest to understand this model with an example .
Here is a multithreaded algorithm that computes Fibonacci numbers :
Fibonacci(n ) : 1 if n < 2 : | thread A 2 return n | thread A 3 x = < strong > spawn</strong > Fibonacci( n - 1 ) | thread A 4 y = < strong > spawn</strong > Fibonacci( n - 2 ) | thread B 5 < strong > sync</strong > | thread C 6 return x + y | thread C # this is a really bad algorithm , because it 's # exponential time .
# # see < a href = " https://catonmat.net/mit-introduction-to-algorithms-part-two ">lecture three </a> for four different # classical algorithms that compute Fibonacci numbers
( A thread is defined to be a maximal sequence of instructions not containing the parallel control statements spawn , sync , and return , not something like Java threads or Posix threads . )
I put the most important keywords in bold .
They are " spawn " and " sync " .
The keyword spawn is the parallel analog of an ordinary subroutine call .
Spawn before the subroutine call in line 3 indicates that the subprocedure Fibonacci ( n - 1 ) can execute in parallel with the procedure Fibonacci ( n ) itself .
Unlike an ordinary function call , where the parent is not resumed until after its child returns , in the case of a spawn , the parent can continue to execute in parallel with the child .
In this case , the parent goes on to spawn Fibonacci ( n - 2 ) .
In general , the parent can continue to spawn off children , producing a high degree of parallelism .
A procedure cannot safely use the return values of the children it has spawned until it executes a sync statement .
If any of its children have not completed when it executes a sync , the procedure suspends and does not resume until all of its children have completed .
When all of its children return , execution of the procedure resumes at the point immediately following the sync statement .
In the Fibonacci example , the sync statement in line 5 is required before the return statement in line 6 to avoid the anomaly that would occur if x and y were summed before each had been computed .
The spawn and sync keywords specify logical parallelism , not " actual " parallelism .
That is , these keywords indicate which code may possibly execute in parallel , but what actually runs in parallel is determined by a scheduler , which maps the dynamically unfolding computation onto the available processors .
The lecture then continues with a discussion on how a parallel instruction stream can be viewed as a directed acyclic graph G = ( V , E ) , where threads make up the set V of vertices , and each spawn and return statement makes up an edge in E .
There are also continuation edges in E that exist between statements .
In Fibonacci example there are three threads : lines 1 , 2 , 3 make up the thread A , line 4 is thread B and lines 5 , 6 are thread C .
Here is how a graph of Fibonacci ( 4 ) computation looks like :
A dag representing multithreaded computation of Fibonacci ( 4 ) .
Here the threads are show as circles , and each group of threads belonging to the same procedure are surrounded by a rounded rectangle .
Downward edges are spawn dependencies , horizontal edges represent continuation dependencies within a procedure , and upward edges are return dependencies .
Every computation starts with a single initial thread , and ends with a single final thread .
So to compute Fib ( 4 ) , first Fib( 3 ) and Fib( 2 ) have to be computed .
Fib ( 4 ) spawns one thread to compute Fib( 3 ) and another thread to compute Fib( 2 ) and sync'es .
In order to compute Fib( 3 ) , values of Fib( 2 ) and Fib( 1 ) have to be known , and to compute Fib( 2 ) values of Fib( 1 ) and Fib( 0 ) have to be known .
Fib( 3 ) and Fib( 2 ) spawn their threads and sync .
This way the computation unwinds .
Next , the lecture introduces some concepts for measuring performance of multithreaded algorithms .
First some time measures :
T p - running time of an algorithm on p processors ,
- running time of an algorithm on processors , T 1 - running time of algorithm on 1 processor , and
- running time of algorithm on 1 processor , and T ? as critical path length , that is the longest time to execute the algorithm on infinite number of processors .
Based on these measures , the speedup of a computation on p processors is T 1 / T p , that is how much faster a p processor machine executes the algorithm than a one processor machine .
If the speedup is O ( p ) , then we say that the computation has a linear speedup .
If , however , speedup > p , then we call it a super - linear speedup .
The maximum possible speedup is called parallelism and is computed by T 1 /T ? .
After these concepts the lecture puts forward the concept of scheduling and greedy scheduler .
A scheduler maps computation to p processors .
The greedy scheduler schedules as much as it can at every time step .
On a p- processor machine every step can be classified into two types .
If there are p or more threads ready to execute , the scheduler executes any p of them ( this step is also called a complete step ) .
If there are fewer than p threads , it executes all of them ( called incomplete step ) .
The greedy scheduler is an offline scheduler and it's 2 - competitive ( see lecture 13 on online / offline algorithms and the meaning of competitive algorithm ) .
The lecture ends with an introduction to Cilk parallel , multithreaded programming language .
It uses a randomized online scheduler .
It was used to write two chess programs * Socrates and Cilkchess .

Lecture 21 : Parallel Algorithms II
Lecture twenty - one is all about real multithreaded algorithms and their analysis .
It starts with a hugly important problem of multithreaded matrix multiplication : given two n x n matrices A and B , write a multithreaded algorithm Matrix - Multiply that multiplies them , producing matrix C .
The natural approach is to use divide and conquer method from lecture three , and formulate the problem as follows :
Each n x n matrix can be expressed as 8 multiplications and 4 additions of ( n / 2 ) x ( n / 2 ) submatrices .
So the first thing we need is Matrix - Add algorithm that adds two matrices in parallel .
Here is the parallel Matrix - Add algorithm :
Matrix - Add(C , T , n ) : //
Adds matrices C and T in - place , producing C = C + T // n is power of 2 ( for simplicity ) .
if n == 1 : C [ 1 , 1 ] = C [ 1 , 1 ] + T [ 1 , 1 ] else : partition C and T into ( n /2 ) < small >x </small >( n /2 ) submatrices spawn Matrix - Add( C< sub>11</sub > , T < sub>11</sub > , n /2 ) spawn Matrix - Add( C<sub>12</sub > , T < sub>12</sub > , n /2 ) spawn Matrix - Add( C<sub>21</sub > , T< sub>21</sub > , n /2 ) spawn Matrix - Add( C<sub>22</sub > , T< sub>22</sub > , n /2 ) sync
The base case for this algorithm is when matrices are just scalars , then it just adds the only element of both matrices .
In all other cases , it partitions matrices C and T into ( n / 2 ) x ( n / 2 ) matrices and spawns four subproblems .
Now we can implement the Matrix - Multiply algorithm , by doing 8 multiplications in parallel and then calling Matrix - Add to do 4 additions .
Here is the parallel Matrix - Multiply algorithm :
Matrix - Multiply ( C , A , B , n ) : // Multiplies matrices A and B , storing the result in C. // n is power of 2 ( for simplicity ) .
if n == 1 : C [ 1 , 1 ] = A [ 1 , 1 ] · B [ 1 , 1 ] else : allocate a temporary matrix T [ 1...n , 1...n ] partition A , B , C , and T into ( n /2 ) < small >x </ small >( n /2 ) submatrices spawn Matrix - Multiply ( C< sub>12</sub >, A< sub>11</sub>,B<sub>12</sub> , n/2 ) spawn Matrix - Multiply ( C< sub>21</sub >, A< sub>21</sub>,B<sub>11</sub> , n/2 ) spawn Matrix - Multiply ( C< sub>22</sub >, A< sub>21</sub>,B<sub>12</sub> , n/2 ) spawn Matrix - Multiply ( T< sub>11</sub >, A< sub>12</sub>, B<sub>21</sub> , n /2 ) spawn Matrix - Multiply ( T< sub>12</sub >, A< sub>12</sub>,B<sub>22</sub> , n /2 ) spawn Matrix - Multiply ( T< sub>21</sub >, A< sub>22</sub>,B<sub>21</sub> , n/2 ) spawn Matrix - Multiply ( T< sub>22</sub >, A< sub>22</sub>,B<sub>22</sub> , n /2 ) sync Matrix - Add( C , T , n )
The lecture then proceeds to calculating how good the algorithm is , turns out the parallelism ( ratio of time of algorithm running on a single processor T 1 to running on infinite number of processors T inf ) for doing 1000x1000 matrix multiplication is 107 , which the parallel algorithm is fast as hell .
Matrix - Multiply used a temporary matrix which was actually unnecessary .
To achieve higher performance , it 's often advantageous for an algorithm to use less space , because more space means more time .
Therefore a faster algorithm can be added that multiplies matrices and adds them in - place .
See lecture at 33:05 for Matrix - Multiply - Add algorithm .
The parallelism of this algorithm for 1000x1000 matrix multiplication is 106 , smaller than the previous one , but due to fact that no temporary matrices had to be used , it beats Matrix - Multiply algorithm in practice .
The lecture then proceeds to parallel sorting .
The classical sorting algorithms were covered in lectures four and five .
This lecture parallelizes the Merge - Sort algorithm .
Here is the parallel merge - sort algorithm :
Parallel - Merge - Sort( A , p , r ) : // sort A [ p...r ] if p < r : q = floor ( ( p+r ) / 2 ) spawn Parallel - Merge - Sort ( A , p , q ) spawn Parallel - Merge - Sort ( A , q+1 , r ) sync Merge ( A , p , q , r ) // merge A [ p...q ] with A [ q+1...r ]
Instead of recursively calling Parallel - Merge - Sort for subproblems , we spawn them , thus utilizing the power of parallelism .
After doing analysis turns out that due to fact that we use the classical Merge ( ) function , the parallelism is just lg(n ) .
That 's puny !
To solve this problem , a Parallel - Merge algorithm has to be written .
The lecture continues with presenting a Parallel - Merge algorithm , and after that does the analysis of the same Parallel - Merge - Sort algorithm but with Parallel - Merge function .
Turns out this algorithm has parallelism of n /lg2 ( n ) , that is much better .
See lecture at 51:00 for Parallel - Merge algorithm .
The best parallel sorting algorithm know to date has the parallelism of n / lg ( n ) .

Ottoman Archives Show Land Deeds Forged
A legal battle being waged by Palestinian families to stop the takeover of their neighborhood in East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers has received a major fillip from the recent souring of relations between Israel and Turkey .
After the Israeli army ’s assault on the Gaza Strip in January , lawyers for the families were given access to Ottoman land registry archives in Ankara for the first time , providing what they say is proof that title deeds produced by the settlers are forged .
On Monday , Palestinian lawyers presented the Ottoman documents to an Israeli court , which is expected to assess their validity over the next few weeks .
The lawyers hope that proceedings to evict about 500 residents from Sheikh Jarrah will be halted .
The families ’ unprecedented access to the Turkish archives may mark a watershed , paving the way for successful appeals by other Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank caught in legal disputes with settlers and the Israeli government over land ownership .
Interest in the plight of Sheikh Jarrah ’s residents peaked in November when one couple , Fawziya and Mohammed Khurd , were evicted from their home by an Israeli judge .
Mr Khurd , who was chronically ill , died days later .
Meanwhile , Mrs. Khurd , 63 , has staged a protest by living in a tent on waste ground close to her former home .
Israeli police have torn down the tent six times and she is facing a series of fines from the Jerusalem municipality .
The problems facing Mrs. Khurd and the other residents derive from legal claims by the Sephardi Jewry Association that it purchased Sheikh Jarrah ’s land in the 19th century .
Settler groups hope to evict all the residents , demolish their homes and build 200 apartments in their place .
The location is considered strategic by settler organizations because it is close to the Old City and its Palestinian holy places .
Unusually , foreign diplomats , including from the United States , have protested , saying eviction of the Palestinian families would undermine the basis of a two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The help of the Turkish government has been crucial , however , because Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire when the land transactions supposedly took place .
Israel and Turkey have been close military and political allies for decades and traditionally Ankara has avoided straining ties by becoming involved in land disputes in the occupied territories .
But there appears to have been an about - turn in Turkish government policy since a diplomatic falling - out between the two countries over Israel ’s recent Gaza operation .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Turkey ’s prime minister , accused his Israeli counterpart , Ehud Olmert , of “ lying ” and “ back - stabbing ” , reportedly furious that Israel launched its military operation without warning him .
At the time of the attack , Turkey was mediating peace negotiations between Israel and Syria .
Days after the fighting ended in Gaza , Mr. Erdogan stormed out of a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland , having accused Shimon Peres , the Israeli president , of “ knowing very well how to kill ” .
According to lawyers acting for the Sheikh Jarrah families , the crisis in relations has translated into a greater openness from Ankara in helping them in their legal battle .
“ We have noticed a dramatic change in the atmosphere now when we approach Turkish officials , ” said Hatem Abu Ahmad , one of Mrs. Khurd ’s lawyers .
“ Before they did not dare upset Israel and put us off with excuses about why they could not help . ”
He said the families ’ lawyers were finally invited to the archives in Ankara in January , after they submitted requests over several months to the Turkish consulate in Jerusalem and the Turkish Embassy in Tel Aviv .
Officials in Turkey traced the documents the lawyers requested and provided affidavits that the settlers ’ land claims were forged .
The search of the Ottoman archives , Mr Abu Ahmad said , had failed to locate any title deeds belonging to a Jewish group for the land in Sheikh Jarrah .
“ Turkish officials have also told us that in future they will assist us whenever we need help and that they are ready to trace similar documents relating to other cases , ” Mr. Abu Ahmad said .
“ They even asked us if there were other documents we were looking for . ”
That could prove significant as the Jerusalem municipality threatens a new campaign of house demolitions against Palestinians .
Last week , Nabil Abu Rudeina , a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , called the recent issuing of dozens of demolition orders in Jerusalem “ ethnic cleansing . ”
Palestinian legal groups regularly argue that settlers forge documents in a bid to grab land from private Palestinian owners but have great difficulty proving their case .
Late last year the Associated Press news agency exposed a scam by settlers regarding land on which they have built the Migron outpost , near Ramallah , home to more than 40 Jewish families .
The settlers ’ documents were supposedly signed by the Palestinian owner , Abdel Latif Sumarin , in California in 2004 , even though he died in 1961 .
The families in Sheikh Jarrah ended up living in their current homes after they were forced to flee from territory that became Israel during the 1948 war .
Jordan , which controlled East Jerusalem until Israel ’s occupation in 1967 , and the United Nations gave the refugees plots on which to build homes .
Mrs. Khurd said she would stay in her tent until she received justice .
“ My family is originally from Talbiyeh , ” she said , referring to what has become today one of the wealthiest districts of West Jerusalem .
“ I am not allowed to go back to the property that is rightfully mine , but these settlers are given my home , which never belonged to them . ”

Video : William Schulz on China and human rights
The relationship between the United States and China may well be the most important bilateral relationship in the world .
In recognition of that fact , the Center for American Progress released a comprehensive report in August 2008 , entitled “ A Global Imperative : A Progressive Approach to U.S. - China Relations in the 21st Century , ” that addressed all aspects of U.S. - China relations .
Building upon that report , “ Strategic Persistence : How the United States Can Help Improve Human Rights in China ” is designed to provide both fundamental principles that should guide U.S. policymakers in their efforts to effect positive change in China ’s human rights practices and concrete recommendations to advance those efforts .
Despite significant progress in realizing social and economic rights and even some increases in individual freedoms , China remains responsible for profound violations of its people ’s civil and political rights .
In its foreign policy , China has often backed repressive regimes around the world and watered down international sanctions against them .
None of this is in the United States ’ best interests .
Given the high degree of economic interdependence between the United States and China and China ’s growing military reach , American interests are best served by a stable China with a robust commitment to the rule of law — conditions that are undermined by a failure to respect human rights .
U.S. approaches to human rights in China have ranged from confrontation to passivity and have rarely reflected a coordinated strategy across government entities .
The key to U.S. efforts to promote human rights in China is to take a coherent , pragmatic , non-ideological approach that goes beyond easy rhetoric , taking advantage of strategic openings and recognizing the value of persistence .
Ultimately , China must be persuaded that greater democracy and human rights are in its own best interests , integral to its becoming the highly respected global leader it aspires to be .
This paper outlines eight principles that should inform the U.S. approach to improving human rights in China :
Calibrate our strategy to China ’s unique circumstances .
China is a major power and the United States has a multiplicity of interests in relation to it .
Human rights policy must take those facts into account .
Develop separate strategies for democracy promotion and human rights .
The two are related , but they are not identical .
Each deserves its own carefully designed approach .
Opt preferentially for carrots over sticks .
The United States ’ capacity to “ punish ” China is limited and generally ineffective .
The United States should not hesitate to criticize China as appropriate , but our preference should be for reinforcing positive changes .
Understanding is not condoning .
China faces an array of profound challenges .
The United States should acknowledge them in order to know better how to influence the Chinese government .
Appeal to China ’s interests and connect the dots .
Human rights are in China ’s own best interests , but the Chinese government rarely perceives that to be the case and often misjudges how others will respond to its actions .
Wherever possible , the United States should base its appeals on China ’s own needs .
Globalize the pressure and encourage China to play by the world ’s rules .
The United States cannot change China ’s human rights practices by itself .
Some of the most effective pressure will come from other nations encouraging China to live up to the global standards expected of a world leader .
Seek common ground but take advantage of internal divisions over human rights .
In some areas , such as trafficking of persons , China ’s interests and those of the United States are fully aligned .
On other issues , such as the utility of “ reeducation through labor ” camps , the Chinese are themselves divided .
The United States should be alert to both circumstances .
Ignore the rhetoric , do n’t be distracted and never give up .
China is not immutable to pressure despite its occasionally extreme rhetoric .
The United States must speak with one voice and recognize that improvement in China ’s human rights practices may be a long time coming .
This paper then applies these principles in a series of recommendations designed to increase the coherence of U.S. strategy and address openings provided by U.S. efforts to boost :
Trade and investment
Access to the Internet by Chinese citizens
Labor rights
Efforts to combat trafficking in persons
Religious freedom
Human rights in Tibet and Xinjiang
Chinese foreign policy with respect to repressive regimes
These eight principles and the recommendations that follow will , we believe , enable the new Obama administration and the 111th Congress to make substantial progress on human rights in China and in China ’s human rights - related foreign policy .
This paper concludes , however , by recognizing that persistence above all is required of those who seek to advance human rights .

Video : William Schulz on China and human rights
On the internet , you can pretend the world is flat .
Whatever country you live in , whatever language you speak , you have the same access to the accumulated knowledge of the world as every other citizen of the planet Earth .
And a growing percentage of that knowledge can and should be available in your native language .
But I believe the rules are different for programmers .
So much so that I 'm going to ask the unthinkable : should n't every software developer understand English ?
A wildly disproportionate amount of programming information is available in English .
The overwhelming majority of programming languages use English keywords .
By any metric you can possibly measure , English is the lingua franca of programming .
Now ,
In terms of cultural literacy and travel , presuming that everyone should speak English is a totally unacceptable attitude , the epitome of the ugly american .
But those rules do n't apply to us .
We 're not talking about normal everyday people .
We 're talking about programmers .
Citizens of the internet .
People who swear allegiance not to a country , but a compiler .
Hackers have their own culture , their own norms and standards for literacy .
Eric Raymond notes that functional English is required for true hackers :
As an American and native English - speaker myself , I have previously been reluctant to suggest this , lest it be taken as a sort of cultural imperialism .
But several native speakers of other languages have urged me to point out that English is the working language of the hacker culture and the Internet , and that you will need to know it to function in the hacker community .
Back around 1991 I learned that many hackers who have English as a second language use it in technical discussions even when they share a birth tongue ; it was reported to me at the time that English has a richer technical vocabulary than any other language and is therefore simply a better tool for the job .
For similar reasons , translations of technical books written in English are often unsatisfactory ( when they get done at all ) .
Linus Torvalds , a Finn , comments his code in English ( it apparently never occurred to him to do otherwise ) .
His fluency in English has been an important factor in his ability to recruit a worldwide community of developers for Linux .
It 's an example worth following .
Being a native English - speaker does not guarantee that you have language skills good enough to function as a hacker .
If your writing is semi-literate , ungrammatical , and riddled with misspellings , many hackers ( including myself ) will tend to ignore you .
While sloppy writing does not invariably mean sloppy thinking , we 've generally found the correlation to be strong -- and we have no use for sloppy thinkers .
If you can't yet write competently , learn to .
It 's difficult to communicate this idea without feeling like an ugly American programmer .
But it does n't come from a nationality , or a desire to dominate the world .
It 's nothing more than great hackers collectively realizing that sticking to English for technical discussion makes it easier to get stuff done .
It 's a meritocracy of code , not language , and nobody ( or at least nobody who is sane , anyway ) localizes programming languages .
I received this email from Slawomir , a Polish programmer , a few months ago .
He confirmed what I 've always suspected and secretly believed -- but have been hesitant to say :
I just listened to Stack Overflow podcast episode 29 where you discuss localization of developer tools .
In my opinion there is no reason to translate developer tools and documentation .
I know many developers in Poland who prefer ( as Joel mentioned ) to get English documentation rather than Polish translation and the reason for that is that translations were not always accurate .
Even Microsoft developer documentation was translated partially or with errors , so reading original English document was easier than English - Polish soup .
If everybody blogs and develops in English - our global repository of solutions and blog posts is much bigger and you have better chances of finding an answer to your problem .
Consciously choosing to switch from Polish to English reminds me why I gave up Visual Basic for C# , as painful as that was .
These languages do exactly the same things -- and the friction of choosing the minority language was severe .
I found reams of code and answers in C# whenever I searched , and almost nothing at all in VB .
NET .
I spent so much time converting code into VB.NET and introducing new bugs and errors in the process , along with countless language - only forks .
This eventually stopped making sense to me -- as it would to any good programmer .
Advocating the adoption of English as the de-facto standard language of software development is simple pragmatism , the most virtuous of all hacker traits .
If that makes me an ugly American programmer , so be it .
More must read financial analysis from DK Matai , Chairman of the ACTA Open .
8 . The population of the whole planet is about 6 billion people .
So the derivatives market alone represents about USD 190,000 per person on the planet .
7. Bear Stearns had USD 13 + trillion in derivatives and went bankrupt in March .
Freddie Mac , Fannie Mae , Lehman Brothers and AIG have all ' collapsed ' because of complex securities and derivatives exposures in September .
3 . The GDP of the entire world is USD 50 trillion .
USD 1,144 trillion is 22 times the GDP of the whole world .
Let us think about the invisible USD 1.144 quadrillion equation with black swan variables -- ie , 1,144 trillion dollars in terms of outstanding derivatives , global Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , real estate , world stock and bond markets coupled with unknown unknowns or " Black Swans " .
What would be the relative positioning of USD 1.144 quadrillion for outstanding derivatives , ie , what is their scale :
Whilst outstanding derivatives are notional amounts until they are crystallised , actual exposure is measured by the net credit equivalent .
This is normally a lower figure unless many variables plot a locus in the wrong direction simultaneously .
This could be because of catastrophic unpredictable events , ie , " Black Swans " , such as cascades of bankruptcies and nationalisations , when the net exposure can balloon and become considerably larger or indeed because some extremely dislocating geo-political or geo-physical events take place simultaneously .
Also , the notional value becomes real value when either counterparty to the OTC derivative goes bankrupt .
This means that no large OTC derivative house can be allowed to go broke without falling into the arms of another .
Whatever funds within reason are required to rescue failing international investment banks , deposit banks and financial entities ought to be provided on a case by case basis .
This is the asymmetric nature of derivatives and here lies the potential for systemic risk to the global economic system and financial markets if nothing is done .
Quadrillion ?
That is a number only super computing engineers and astronomers used to use , not economists and bankers !
For example , the North star is " just " a couple of quadrillion miles away , ie , a few thousand trillion miles .
The new " Roadrunner " supercomputer built by IBM for the US Department of Energy 's Los Alamos National Laboratory has achieved a peak performance of 1.026 Peta Flop per second -- becoming the first supercomputer ever to reach this milestone .
One Quadrillion Floating Point Operations ( Flops ) per second is 1 Peta Flop /s , ie , 1,000 Trillion Flops per second .
It is estimated that all the data found on all the websites and stored on computers across the world totals more than One Exa byte of memory , ie , 1,000 Quadrillion bytes of data .
According to various distinguished sources including the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) in Basel , Switzerland -- the central bankers ' bank -- the amount of outstanding derivatives worldwide as of December 2007 crossed USD 1.144 Quadrillion , ie , USD 1,144 Trillion .
The main categories of the USD 1.144 Quadrillion derivatives market were the following :
The Impact of Derivatives
1. Derivatives are securities whose value depends on the underlying value of other basic securities and associated risks .
Derivatives have exploded in use over the past two decades .
We cannot even properly define many classes of derivatives because they are highly complex instruments and come in many shapes , sizes , colours and flavours and display different characteristics under different market conditions .
2. Derivatives are unregulated , not traded on any public exchange , without universal standards , dealt with by private agreement , not transparent , have no open bid / ask market , are unguaranteed , have no central clearing house , and are just not really tangible .
3 . Derivatives include such well known instruments as futures and options which are actively traded on numerous exchanges as well as numerous over - the - counter instruments such as interest rate swaps , forward contracts in foreign exchange and interest rates , and various commodity and equity instruments .
4. Everyone from the large financial institutions , governments , corporations , mutual and pension funds , to hedge funds , and large and small speculators , uses derivatives .
However , they have never existed in history with the overarching , exorbitant scale that they now do .
5 . Derivatives are unravelling at a fast rate with the start of the " Great Unwind " of the global credit markets which began in July 2007 and particularly after the collapse of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in September this year .
6 . When derivatives unravel significantly the entire world economy would be at peril , given the relatively smaller scale of the world economy by comparison .
7 . The derivatives market collapse could make the housing and stock market collapses look incidental .
Three Historical Examples
1 . The so - called rogue trader Nick Leeson who made a huge derivatives bet on the direction of the Japanese Nikkei index brought on the collapse of Barings Bank in 1995 .
2 . The collapse of Long Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) , a hedge fund that had a former derivatives and bond dealer from Salomon Brothers and two Nobel Prize winners in Economics as principals , collapsed because of huge leveraged bets in currencies and bonds in 1998 .
3 . Finally , a lot of the problems of Enron in 2000 were brought on by leveraged derivatives and using derivatives to hide problems on the balance sheet .
The Pitfall
The single conceptual pitfall at the basis of the disorderly growth of the global derivatives market is the postulate of hedging and netting , which lies at the basis of each model and of the whole regulatory environment hyper structure .
Perfect hedges and perfect netting require functioning markets .
When one or more markets become dysfunctional , the whole deck of cards could collapse swiftly .
To hope , as US Treasury Secretary Mr Henry Paulson does , that an accounting ruse such as transferring liabilities , however priced , from a private to a public agent will restore the functionality of markets implies a drastic jump in logic .
Markets function only when :
1 . There is a price level at which demand meets supply ; and more importantly when
2 . Both sides believe in each other 's capacity to deliver .
Satisfying criterion 1 . without satisfying criterion 2 . which is essentially about trust , gets one nowhere in the long term , although in the short term , the markets may demonstrate momentary relief and euphoria .
Conclusion
In the context of the USD 700 billion rescue plan -- still being finalised in Washington , DC -- the following is worth considering step by step .
Decision makers are rightly concerned about alleviating immediate pressure points in the global financial system , such as , the mortgage crisis , decline in consumer spending and the looming loss of confidence in financial institutions .
However , whilst these problems are grave , they are acting as a catalyst to another more massive challenge which may have to be tackled across many nation states simultaneously .
As money flows slow down sharply , confidence levels would decline across the globe , and trust would be broken asymmetrically , ie , the time taken to repair it would be much longer .
Unless there is government action in concert , this could ignite a chain - reaction which would swiftly purge trillions and trillions of dollars in over - leveraged risky bets .
Within the context of over - leverage , the biggest problem of all is to do with " Derivatives " , of which CDSs are a minor subset .
Warren Buffett has said the derivatives neutron bomb has the potential to destroy the entire world economy , and is a " disaster waiting to happen . "
He has also referred to derivatives as Weapons of Mass Destruction ( WMD ) .
Counting one dollar per second , it would take 32 million years to count to one Quadrillion .
The numbers we are dealing with are absolutely astronomical and from the realms of super computing we have stepped into global economics .
There is a sense of no sustainability and lack of longevity in the " Invisible One Quadrillion Dollar Equation " of the derivatives market especially with attendant Black Swan variables causing multiple implosions amongst financial institutions and counterparties !
The only way out , albeit painful , is via discretionary case - by - case government intervention on an unprecedented scale .
Securing the savings and assets of ordinary citizens ought to be the number one concern in directing such policy .

Before I start this post , I just want to apologize in advance if it gets a little lengthy – it ’s my response to a Cease and Desist letter I received last week .
Recently , I wrote about Melrose Jewelers and a press release they had issued .
The release discussed actor Owen Wilson ’s suicide attempt and said that his Rolex watch had played a major part in the actor being alive today .
At the time , I personally found the release to be crass and in poor taste – it smacked of taking advantage of someone ’s personal problems for gain ( in this case , to sell more watches by Melrose Jewelers ) .
The comments in the post seemed to agree , as did numerous other views of the same press release .
To get you up to speed , I ’ll wait while you read the post , if that ’s okay .
Last week , I received a Cease and Desist letter from the Law Offices of Peter D. Cole , who is based in Los Angeles and represents Melrose Jewelers .
The letter made a number of claims against my post and requested that I remove it .
Failure to do so would result in Melrose Jewelers “ pursuing other alternatives to mitigate any damages ” .
To save time , I ’ve scanned the attorney ’s letter and transferred it to a PDF file , which you can read here .
Again , I ’ll wait until you ’ve read it so you can compare it to the post in question , if you like .
The letter is “ as is ” – there is no letterhead or registered business numbers on it ( which I had to request from Peter D. Cole for clarification ) .
I ’ll let you read the letter before continuing .
The attorney for Melrose Jewelers is ultimately saying that I ’m causing his client loss of business ; that my post is “ inciteful rhetoric ” ; that I ’m associated with another Internet watch sales business ; and that I was n’t stating facts .
I find that a slight on my character and transparency .
Additionally , the request to Cease and Desist under threat of further legal action is never pleasant .
Therefore , obviously , I felt a need to respond .
This is it ( taken from my emailed response to Peter D. Cole today , and with Cole ’s points in bold ) .
Hi there Peter , Thanks for you response , appreciate it .
With regards your client ’s “ claims ” , I would respond with the following : 1 . “ You had conversations with unnamed Rolex executives , to incite Rolex to take actions and / or make comments about my client ’s advertising . ”
There is nothing in the comments that says this .
I mentioned I was , and I quote , “ speaking to someone today about Rolex ’s awareness .
He ’s in the jewelry industry and was at a big meeting last night where the CEO of Rolex was also attending . ”
That ’s a big difference from knowing Rolex executives .
FYI , the person I was speaking to is a director of a pearl company – quite the different market from your client .
2 . “ … If you yourself are somehow associated with an Internet watch sales business , as my client is informed and believes ” .
As I mentioned , my “ relationship ” is with a pearl company – hardly a competitor .
Your client ’s statement also seems bizarre .
I ’m guessing if he knows someone that owns a fast food restaurant , he ca n’t say that he does n’t like McDonald ’s , as that would be seen as “ unfair business practices ” ?
3 . “ You describe my client as little more than a second hand watch shop ” .
By your own words , you say that people who “ cannot afford to purchase them new , to obtain them pre-owned at a significant discount in price ” .
So , they ’re not new ?
Which makes them second - hand .
My whole post was about whether or not the press release was crass ( by taking advantage of someone ’s personal situation for gain ) , as well as the editorial process that allowed it to be published .
The comments that followed from my readers bore this out .
Additionally , there are many more sites and blogs that offer a far more disparaging account of your client ’s release than I do .
My post was not to “ incite Rolex to take actions ” – more , it was to question what passes as acceptable PR and why it ’s important for brands to be aware of what ’s being said in the name of their company .
I have some questions for your client .
Did Rolex authorize this release ?
Did Owen Wilson authorize this release ?
Can it be factually proven that Owen Wilson ’s watch turned him back from the precipice of despair ?
Unless your client can answer “ Yes ” categorically to these questions , then the release ( and the original blog post it stemmed from ) are merely opinion , and not fact .
Something which separates a news release from an opinion piece .
Which is exactly what my blog referred to .
Therefore , I will be leaving the post as is .
Best , Danny .
There are a lot of things wrong with the PR industry .
There are a lot of things good about it as well .
Like any industry , there are good people and not - so - good people .
One thing that is apparent is that releases like the ones Melrose Jewelers issued do n’t help to repair the view that PR professionals are uncaring and will say anything for a fast buck .
If there is no concrete proof that Owen Wilson ’s watch helped him during some dark times , then saying that it did suggests sensationalism in order to sell more watches .
In my original post , I shared my view of that , and of using PR in this way .
I also asked the question what it would do for a company ’s reputation that was happy to use PR in this way .
The Cease and Desist letter from Melrose Jewelers gives me their answer .
I feel it ’s only fair to offer them mine .
Which is why the original post will remain .
Thanks for reading .
I ’d be interested in your take .
Is there more than PR and brand awareness being questioned here ?
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A tidal wave of man-made trash is threatening world oceans , damaging wildlife , tourism and seafood industries and piling additional stress on seas already hit by climate change , conservationists said on Tuesday .
A report by U.S. - based Ocean Conservancy detailed what it called a “ global snapshot of marine debris ” based on itemized records of rubbish collected by nearly 400,000 volunteers in 104 countries and places in a single day in September 2008 .
Close to 7 million pounds ( 3.2 million kg ) of trash -- the weight of 18 blue whales -- was collected from oceans , lakes , rivers and waterways in the 2008 cleanup , the group said in its report “ A Rising Tide of Ocean Debris and What We Can Do About It ” .
It warned of a “ tidal wave of ocean debris , ” calling it a major pollution problem of the 21st century .
Topping the list of the 11.4 million items of trash collected were cigarette butts , plastic bags , and food wrappers and containers .
In the Philippines alone , 11,077 diapers were picked up and 19,504 fishing nets were recovered in Britain .
“ Our ocean is sick , and our actions have made it so , ” Vikki Spruill , president and chief executive of Ocean Conservancy , said in a statement accompanying the report .
“ We simply can not continue to put our trash in the ocean .
The evidence turns up every day in dead and injured marine life , littered beaches that discourage tourists , and choked ocean ecosystems , ” she said .
“ By changing behaviors and policies , individuals , companies , and governments can help improve the health of our ocean , the Earth ’s life support system . ”
The full report , including a country - by - country Marine Debris Index , was published at www.oceanconservancy.org.
ANIMALS KILLED , TOURISM HURT
Detailing how refuse poisoned oceans and waterways , the report said the waste entered the food chain , injured beachgoers and weakened economies by sapping precious dollars from tourism and seafood industries .
Thousands of animals , including marine mammals , sea turtles , seabirds and others , choked or were poisoned each year by eating trash , or drowned when they became entangled in bags , ropes and old fishing gear .
The 2008 cleanup volunteers found 443 animals entangled or trapped by marine debris , releasing 268 alive .
“ Keeping our ocean free of trash is one of the easiest ways we can help improve the ocean ’s resilience as it tries to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change such as melting ice , rising sea levels , and changing ocean chemistry , ” Ocean Conservancy said .
It recommended public and private partnerships to monitor and reduce marine trash and increased funding for research on the problem .
A policy of “ reduce , reuse , recycle ” would help lower trash levels , combined with technological solutions .
“ Trash does n’t fall from the sky , it falls from our hands , ” Spruill said .
“ Humans have created the problem of marine debris , and humans should step up and solve it . ”
Ocean Conservancy said its next International Coastal Cleanup would be held around the world on September 19 .

Litter Did You Know ...
The mews and mutterings of the SAN FRANCISCO SPCA
Several weeks ago , this very blog was approached by a visitor FROM BEYOND !
This visitor was , by means of Google ’s translation service , able to read my post about pumping a bike tire , in a language that suited him / her / it better than English .
As chance would have it , visitors FROM BEYOND prefer reading Japanese to anything else .
The difficulty of written Japanese suggests that this visitor has mental capacities that exceed our own ( which tells me we should pay more attention to Japanese sci - fi films , and spend less time giggling when they talk ) .
Curious to see what sort of messages this visitor might have received from the translated post , I checked it in Japanese myself ( I am crazy ) .
However , I remained uncertain about just how much the language changed the message .
So I translated the Japanese back into English , for better clarity .
What I found could change the foundations of language and psychological research as we know it .
NEW MEANING and SECRET WARNINGS that my unconscious has been trying to tell me were pulled from my own writing .
I have placed the translated entry below so that we can mutually learn to restrain ourselves to see the femme fatale with scissors , along with other good life lessons , which have been highlighted for convenience .
Compare with the original for full effect .

“ I swear afternoon around feel frustrated as well 3:30 : I have my lips and moan , and words and how to actually form a syllable in the form of rambling in my mouth I have never learned how to achieve .
I ’m the last one has been successful is the crucible of Sisyphus improper repair the back of what I have spent hours on the long hard part : the fact that the puncture repair .
Now , I fight , I ’m on my tube of a bicycle tire pump should feel the air fill with my bicycle tires to create a seal , every time you try to get the pump , I have it If the very idea , the device , in particular , “ put air in the tires ” are not denied a bicycle tire pump called .
Also , find much bad , I dislike , cracking the plastic mouth of the pump were also damaged , and the ability to achieve that purpose .
It is not my anger .
My anger is an incredible hulk – has reached its peak .
1 , as Samsung has provoked in the jawbone of an ass , I pump on the asphalt of the chef ’s arms thrown back and get a pump in my hand I would clatters away a few feet , the target idea is to return the pump , while it is probably thrown in front , you have to restrain myself not to see a femme fatale with scissors .
“ I was at that time , the position above , the curse , I can only manage the guttural language of all of my anger and try to really not knowing where to start , ” awwwww , and poo and myself have been found . ”
25 , I ’m embarrassed , “ poo ” without saying , is an extreme threat , especially as most people feel that appeals to a number of other terms in English .
And , it is my confession .
It is 25 , I still say the word “ poo ” is frustrated , sometimes even if you say it , I have no complaints .
A few months ago , somebody talked about the conversation , I think , asked the first word ME “ was poo . ”
And then I say that out of my mouth next .
Needless to say , people are talking about the conversations that I do not come anymore .
In fact , I will confess my real topic , all of my bike , instead of suffering over the last two weeks on a bike ride , I remember .
However , at this point I have written so much already , are you “ I have a bike ” entry of the rest were lying here . ”
—
Notice the existence of the messages “ I have my lips ” and “ I will confess my real topic ” .
It seems that my unconscious predicted the discovery of these secret messages .
Much of this is still cryptic , and in an effort to decode the message I have included
Questions for Discussion :
1 . I fear that the femme fatale could be my wife .
What should I do to survive the next time she has scissors ?
2 . What are these conversations ?
You know , the ones that I do not come anymore ?
3 . What could I mean when I say “ poo and myself have been found ” ?
Am I trapped in some sort of cosmic toilet , drawn by the swirling flow of time around an inescapable bowl , and doomed to share poo ’s fate ?
Is there no path that involves climbing out of the toilet like a mutant New York rat and shaping my own mashed potato destiny ?
How can I learn to accept such a fate ?
I WAS brushing my teeth around 11 o’clock the other Sunday night when someone rang my doorbell .
The digitized chime approximates the booming gong that might sound in an old horror movie at the moment the innocent girl dashes into the haunted mansion in the middle of a terrible storm after her car runs out of gas .
Which is to say the sound can be pretty spooky under the best of circumstances , and hearing it so late at night sent a chill down my spine .
I was n’t expecting anyone .
The U.P.S. man would never come at that time , and it was far too inappropriate an hour for any of the religious proselytizers who sometimes stop by my building urging me to find God .
I crept to my bedroom window , which overlooks the street , being careful to leave the light off as I peeked through the curtain .
In the darkness , I saw a strange man in a white baseball hat looking up at me .
I shrank back in terror , wondering whether he had seen me .
A moment later , I seemed to have gotten my answer :

Mount Redoubt volcano in the US state of Alaska has erupted , sending a cloud of ash 15 km ( 50,000 ft ) into the air .
The volcano , 166 km ( 103 miles ) from Anchorage , erupted late on Sunday , with four more explosions early on Monday .
Ash from the explosion has fallen on towns north of Alaska 's largest city , Anchorage , but the city itself has not been affected by the eruption .
Alaskan Airlines cancelled 19 flights because of the ash , which can cause damage to jet engines .
Dozens of aircraft at the Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage were being sheltered as a precaution against the falling ash .
" Just kind of a light dusting , " was how Dave Stricklan , a hydrometeorogical technician with the National Weather Service , described the expected ash fall .
" There 's going to be a very fine amount of it that 's going to be suspended in the atmosphere for quite some time , " he added .
Volcanic ash can cause skin irritation and breathing problems .
Mount Redoubt , which stands 3,100 m ( 10,200 ft ) high , last erupted over a four - month period from 1989 to 1990 .
Scientists monitoring the area warned in late January that an eruption was likely .
On Sunday , officials raised the alert level after researchers recorded increased seismic activity .

Notes :
- Having fast exceptions is getting more important , for example it 's important to have fast exceptions in Python because there they are sometimes used to control flow too .
For example to convert a string to int / float the common Python idiom is to use a try / except .
- As you can see with DMD D exceptions are even slower than Python ones .
When N=4_000_000 D exceptions ( using writefln ) are about 15.8 times slower than Java ones .
This is n't good .
- In the D code I do n't know why using printf speeds up the code about two times compared to using writefln .
- I 'd like to know the timings on Linux with the LDC D compiler .
- The C code is n't fully fair , it uses a lower - level way to implement this program .
- The Java HotSpot VM shows to be quite faster than C++ , about 1.8 times when N=20_000_000 .
To test how efficiently the current main D compiler ( DMD ) supports exceptions ( on Windows ) I have used this " except " benchmark , code adapted from :

From what I read , using exceptions to control program flow is considered very bad practice , because even if exceptions are fast they have side effects which are costly and cannot be avoided in most languages , because such effects are part of the definition of exceptions in that language .
For example exceptions cause stack unwinding in C++ , which can trigger chains of destructor calls with far - reaching side effects , lots of memory deallocation , etc .
In languages with GC I think exceptions trigger special actions by the GC which depend on the context .
So even in the low level mechanic behind exceptions is fast , in a real world scenario the speed of an exception 's resolution depends on the situation , and using them to control the flow can have an unpredictable speed .
In addition exceptions can cross the program flow in any direction , by definition , so you would end up with a very loose flow which would be very hard to enforce and to document .
For example changing a catch in one place might break unrelated parts of the program which rely on some specific exceptions passing through that catch untouched , and it might be impossible to know this if the method / function which does the catch is taken out of context ( which happens quite often if you are working on a large code base ) .
If the program is large this may easily turn into a huge mess .
I think return values , dispatching , access modifiers and other traditional means of flow control allow to define much more predictable flows .
And I do n't even want to think what happens if you try to do that in a multithreaded program , since exceptions can cross threads , force to exit critical sections , etc ... :- P ( Reply ) ( Thread )
scale Link : ( Link ) Time : 2009-03-23 11:48 am ( UTC ) Clarification : as far as I can tell , exceptions are used mostly to control the flow of operations between modules which can be separated clearly .
Most typical cases are the GUI sending a command when a button is pressed and catching exceptions which are thrown if the operation fail , or a database throwing an exception to an application if a query fails .
Throwing them around between strictly related classes is not nice .
( And it 's not so different than returning values anyway , unless a language was designed specifically with this use of exceptions in mind . ) ( Reply ) ( Thread )

Nice results , thank you for your timings .
So it seems the ' fault ' is just into the DMD backend .
So LDC on Linux too may be fast .

President Ahmadinejad 's statement on Tuesday that Iran will " welcome genuine changes " in US policy and is " prepared to talk " to the new American administration has been linked by commentators in the west , as well as the wider Middle East , to President Obama 's statement just one day earlier when , in his first press conference since taking office , he reiterated his willingness to directly talk to the Islamic Republic .
It is understandable that analysts and observers are focusing on the possibility of a thaw in US - Iranian relations .
And , indeed , after eight long years of a Manichean " you 're either with us or against us " approach in Washington there is hope that this new American administration will actually pay attention to realities on the ground .
However , it is surprising that the pundits chose to focus almost exclusively on foreign politics and Obama 's effect on Ahmadinejad because the Iranian president 's new , conciliatory tone may have resulted less from the American overture than from a somewhat pedestrian rationale , based more in the domestic realpolitik of Iran .
Just two days before Ahmadinejad 's speech , Mohammed Khatami , the former Iranian president and acclaimed champion of the country 's so - called " reform " camp , announced that after long deliberations ( and much prodding from supporters ) he will run in the Iranian presidential elections in June .
Until Khatami's announcement , Ahmadinejad was considered the clear frontrunner .
There were some other possible contenders , some from the conservative camp like Ali Larijani and others from among the reformers , but none with the incumbent 's level of support among the hardline Islamists , like the Revolutionary Guards , or the folksy charm that endeared him to the Iranian masses .
Also , none of the reformers who so far had talked about challenging Ahmadinejad possessed the ability to mobilise the youth and the women ¬– the two constituencies that twice brought Khatami to power and which must be won over in order to truly challenge the conservative voting machine .
But now that Mohammed Khatami has ( finally ) made his choice , the cards are dealt anew and Ahmadinejad finds himself in a serious electoral race .
Add to this the fact that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Supreme Leader of Iran , who has both publicly backed Ahmadinejad and criticised his government and policies , is long said to personally dislike the current president and may , now that Khatami is posing a real challenge to the incumbent , very well look for another , more promising conservative candidate to back .
All this will have influenced President Ahmadinejad 's ( somewhat ) softer tone towards the " Great Satan " America in his speech last Tuesday .
If he wants to win the June election , he will have to show that he is not obstinate in his foreign policy and that he is in tune with the majority of the Iranian people who want a thawing of relations with the west .
With Iran feeling the effects of the global economic crisis , particularly much higher food prices , the oil price at under $ 40 a barrel and the last years ' profits already blown on PR projects , the Iranian president 's economic populism has failed and the country 's population is less inclined to vote for him on the grounds of foreign policy grandstanding alone .
While the vast majority of Iranians – conservatives and reformers alike – believe their country has the right and duty to play the role as regional ( super ) power , it is doubtful that many support a course of total confrontation with the west .
And with Khatami now returning to the helm of the reform camp , Ahmadinejad is likely to continue the softer tone on talks with the United States .
Should there also be meetings between American and Iranian diplomats , on however low a level , before the June elections he might actually be able to convert this talk into electoral votes .

Poll : Afghans blame US more than Taliban for violence Agence France - Presse
Published : Tuesday February 10 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) 
A nationwide survey of Afghans out Monday shows plummeting support for US and NATO / ISAF forces in Afghanistan , and a rise in the number who believe attacks on those troops are acceptable .
The poll of 1,500 people in Afghanistan 's 34 provinces , conducted by three Western broadcast networks -- ABC News , the BBC and Germany 's ARD -- also shows lower support for President Hamid Karzai and the Afghan central government .
Forty percent of Afghans surveyed say their country is heading in the right direction , down 77 percent from 2005 , according to the poll .
Afghan opinion of the United States has nosedived : 47 percent had a favorable opinion , down from 83 percent in 2005 .
US favorability plunged 18 percent in 2008 alone , according to the survey .
" For the first time slightly more Afghans now see the United States unfavorably than favorably , " ABC News said .
The biggest complaint : civilian deaths resulting from US and NATO air strikes , which 77 percent say is unacceptable because the risk to civilians outweighs the strikes ' value in fighting insurgents .
Forty - one percent blame Western forces for poor targeting , while 28 percent blame the insurgents for hiding among civilians .
More worrisome , 25 percent say that attacks on US troops or soldiers with the ISAF -- the NATO - led multinational force in Afghanistan -- can be justified , up from 13 percent in 2006 .
The survey comes as US President Barack Obama considers plans to nearly double the number of US troops in Afghanistan , and as the new administration in Washington reviews overall strategy in the region .
Only 18 percent of the Afghans surveyed believe that the number of US and NATO / ISAF forces should increase , while 44 percent want the number of foreign troops to drop .
Just 37 percent say that most people in their area supported the NATO forces , down from 67 percent in 2006 .
Obama 's election seems to offer little respite : only 20 percent believe his policies will improve things in Afghanistan .
" Thirty - six percent of those surveyed mostly blame US , Afghan or NATO / ISAF forces or the US or Afghan governments for the violence that 's occurring , up by 10 points from 2007 , " ABC said .
Only 27 percent mainly blame the Taliban for the violence , down by 9 points .
Confidence in the Afghan government has also plunged : in 2005 , 83 percent of Afghans approved of Karzai 's work and 80 percent approved of the national government .
That has dropped to 52 and 49 percent respectively .
The survey was conducted in late December and early January in personal interviews with a nationwide sample of 1,534 Afghan adults .
Field work was done by the Afghan Center for Socio - Economic and Opinion Research in Kabul , ABC said in a statement .

There is a kind of hush , that started with a muted gasp , that came from whispers of Cheney assassination squads , murmured by Seymour Hersh during topic " America 's Constitutional Crisis " at the University of Minnesota on March 10 , 2009 .
" It 's an executive assassination ring essentially , and it 's been going on and on and on , " Hersh stated .
" Under President Bush 's authority , they 've been going into countries , not talking to the ambassador or the CIA station chief , and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving .
That 's been going on , in the name of all of us . "
Source : rawstory / March_11_2009 .
Mr Hersh made reference to a March 9 , 2009 New York Times story " U.S. Halted Some Raids in Afghanistan " that revealed " The commander of a secretive branch of America 's Special Operations forces last month ordered a halt to most commando missions in Afghanistan , reflecting a growing concern that civilian deaths caused by American firepower are jeopardizing broader goals there . "
But is this new news or old news , given fresh exposure after breaking through from new media to old media , like The Downing Street Memos that took the mainstream media years to embrace , and will it have any more influence on spurring genuine investigations , trials and judgements than Downing and the many other revelations that lingered online before going mainline ?
Yet the New York Times printed a story headlined : " American Hit Squads : Rumsfeld Weighs Covert Activities by Military Units " back on August 12 , 2002 .
Authors Thom Shanker and James Risen wrote : " Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is considering ways to expand broadly the role of American Special Operations forces in the global campaign against terrorism , including sending them worldwide to capture or kill Al Qaeda leaders far from the battlefields of Afghanistan , according to Pentagon and intelligence officials " .
" Proposals now being discussed by Mr. Rumsfeld and senior military officers could ultimately lead Special Operations units to get more deeply involved in long - term covert operations in countries where the United States is not at open war and , in some cases , where the local government is not informed of their presence .
This expansion of the military 's involvement in clandestine activities could be justified , Pentagon officials believe , by defining it as " preparation of the battlefield " in a campaign against terrorism that knows no boundaries . "
The full article can be found here .
In a five page article for the New Yorker titled " Moving Targets " dated December 15 , 2003 , Seymour Hersh writes : " A new Special Forces group , designated Task Force 121 , has been assembled from Army Delta Force members , Navy seals , and C.I.A. paramilitary operatives , with many additional personnel ordered to report by January .
Its highest priority is the neutralization of the Baathist insurgents , by capture or assassination . "
In the same article , Hersh reveals Israel 's involvement in planning operations in Iraq : " According to American and Israeli military and intelligence officials , Israeli commandos and intelligence units have been working closely with their American counterparts at the Special Forces training base at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , and in Israel to help them prepare for operations in Iraq .
Israeli commandos are expected to serve as ad - hoc advisers - again , in secret - when full - field operations begin . "
Specifically mentioned in the New Yorker article is Under - Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen Cambone .
Hersh writes : " The rising star in Rumsfeld 's Pentagon is Stephen Cambone , the Under - Secretary of Defense for Intelligence , who has been deeply involved in developing the new Special Forces approach .... Cambone also shares Rumsfeld 's views on how to fight terrorism .
They both believe that the United States needs to become far more proactive in combatting terrorism , searching for terrorist leaders around the world and eliminating them . "
In a December 9 , 2003 Amy Goodman interview of Seymour Hersh , Hersh , speaking about Donald Rumsfeld , said , " And he has put in the Army positions of command people who are much more supportive of what he and some his aides want to do ; that is work with the Israelis and others to begin killing people .
And so , this is his show .
I 'm sure [ the ] President , Cheney .
They all work very closely together .
I 'm not sure where the C.I.A. is on it . "
Did the foundation of special ops assassination squads targeting terrorist leaders , that started with Rumsfeld , eventually morph into a personal killing squad for Dick Cheney once Rumsfeld was gone ?
In the Minnesota symposium , Hersh said , " Right now , today , there was a story in the New York Times that , if you read it carefully , mentioned something known as the Joint Special Operations Command .
JSOC it 's called .
It is a special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently .
They do not report to anybody , except in the Bush - Cheney days , they reported directly to the Cheney office .
They did not report to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff or to Mr. [ Robert ]
Gates , the secretary of defense .
They reported directly to him .
... "
Perhaps Rumsfeld only had High Value Targets assassinated via special squads and unmanned but man-controled drones .
Perhaps the targets were limited to Iraq and Afghanistan and the few hostile countries surrounding .
Perhaps the " collateral damage " was kept to a minimum , or not .
Once in Cheney 's exclusive control , however , did the disciplined list give way to the broader convenience for the Vice - President ?
Were political and personal enemies of himself and Bush added ?
Who else in the world who may have been a threat to Cheney 's warmongering , even to his personal and political survival , may have made the list ?
Dems gloat after Rush awards himself sole custody of Steele ’s testicles .
Just out from Gov. Tim Kaine , Steele ’s counterpart at the DNC …
“ I was briefly encouraged by the courageous comments made my counterpart in the Republican Party over the weekend challenging Rush Limbaugh as the leader of the Republican Party and referring to his show as ‘ incendiary ’ and ‘ ugly . ’
However , Chairman Steele ’s reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party , its politics and its obstruction of President Obama ’s agenda in Washington .
Just this weekend , Rush Limbaugh repeated his claim that he is rooting for the President to fail .
The last time Rush Limbaugh said he wanted the President to fail , virtually every single Republican in Congress followed his lead and voted against the President ’s plan to create or save 3.5 million jobs .
“ As Congress works to pass the President ’s budget , Republicans need to stop following divisive figures like Rush Limbaugh , stop apologizing to him and put aside the failed politics of the past so we can put our economy back on track , reform our health care system , break our dependence on foreign oil , improve our schools , and lay the foundation for long - term growth in the 21st Century . ”

Knoxville was quick to defend his actions in a blog posted not long after the incident , saying that the grenade was one of " a bunch of silly props " he was unaware was in his luggage .
" The wardrobe girl packed my luggage so I could go home and , unbeknownst to me , she packed a FAKE hand grenade in the front zipper of my luggage ... I was bummed when I realized what had happened , " he wrote .
Still , Knoxville harbors no hard feelings for the incident .
" The cops did their job and verified that it was n't real .
Also , they were cool as they could be to me , considering the situation , and it is no one 's fault but my own .
I should have checked my goddamn luggage through and through , but I did n't and now we have this incident .

There have been hundreds of books written on the subject of the evidences of the divine inspiration of the Bible , and these evidences are many and varied .
Most people today , unfortunately , have not read any of these books .
In fact , few have even read the Bible itself !
Thus , many people tend to go along with the popular delusion that the Bible is full of mistakes and is no longer relevant to our modern world .
Nevertheless the Bible writers claimed repeatedly that they were transmitting the very Word of God , infallible and authoritative in the highest degree .
This is an amazing thing for any writer to say , and if the forty or so men who wrote the Scriptures were wrong in these claims , then they must have been lying , or insane , or both .
But , on the other hand , if the greatest and most influential book of the ages , containing the most beautiful literature and the most perfect moral code ever devised , was written by deceiving fanatics , then what hope is there for ever finding meaning and purpose in this world ?
If one will seriously investigate these Biblical evidences , he will find that their claims of divine inspiration ( stated over 3,000 times , in various ways ) were amply justified .
Fulfilled Prophecies
The remarkable evidence of fulfilled prophecy is just one case in point .
Hundreds of Bible prophecies have been fulfilled , specifically and meticulously , often long after the prophetic writer had passed away .
For example , Daniel the prophet predicted in about 538 BC ( Daniel 9:24 - 27 ) that Christ would come as Israel ’s promised Savior and Prince 483 years after the Persian emperor would give the Jews authority to rebuild Jerusalem , which was then in ruins .
This was clearly and definitely fulfilled , hundreds of years later .
There are extensive prophecies dealing with individual nations and cities and with the course of history in general , all of which have been literally fulfilled .
More than 300 prophecies were fulfilled by Christ Himself at His first coming .
Other prophecies deal with the spread of Christianity , as well as various false religions , and many other subjects .
There is no other book , ancient or modern , like this .
The vague , and usually erroneous , prophecies of people like Jeanne Dixon , Nostradamus , Edgar Cayce , and others like them are not in the same category at all , and neither are other religious books such as the Koran , the Confucian Analects , and similar religious writings .
Only the Bible manifests this remarkable prophetic evidence , and it does so on such a tremendous scale as to render completely absurd any explanation other than divine revelation .
Unique Historical Accuracy
The historical accuracy of the Scriptures is likewise in a class by itself , far superior to the written records of Egypt , Assyria , and other early nations .
Archeological confirmations of the Biblical record have been almost innumerable in the last century .
Dr. Nelson Glueck , probably the greatest modern authority on Israeli archeology , has said :
“ No archeological discovery has ever controverted a Biblical reference .
Scores of archeological findings have been made which confirm in clear outline or in exact detail historical statements in the Bible .
And , by the same token , proper evaluation of Biblical descriptions has often led to amazing discoveries . ”
Scientific Accuracy
Another striking evidence of divine inspiration is found in the fact that many of the principles of modern science were recorded as facts of nature in the Bible long before scientist confirmed them experimentally .
A sampling of these would include :
These are not stated in the technical jargon of modern science , of course , but in terms of the basic world of man ’s everyday experience ; nevertheless , they are completely in accord with the most modern scientific facts .
It is significant also that no real mistake has ever been demonstrated in the Bible — in science , in history , or in any other subject .
Many have been claimed , of course , but conservative Bible scholars have always been able to work out reasonable solutions to all such problems .
Unique Structure
The remarkable structure of the Bible should also be stressed .
Although it is a collection of 66 books , written by 40 or more different men over a period of 2,000 years , it is clearly one Book , with perfect unity and consistency throughout .
The individual writers , at the time of writing , had no idea that their message was eventually to be incorporated into such a Book , but each nevertheless fits perfectly into place and serves its own unique purpose as a component of the whole .
Anyone who diligently studies the Bible will continually find remarkable structural and mathematical patterns woven throughout its fabric , with an intricacy and symmetry incapable of explanation by chance or collusion .
The one consistent theme of the Bible , developing in grandeur from Genesis to Revelation , is God ’s great work in the creation and redemption of all things , through His only Son , the Lord Jesus Christ .
Bible ’s Unique Effect
The Bible is unique also in terms of its effect on individual men and on the history of nations .
It is the all - time best seller , appealing both to hearts and minds , beloved by at least some in every race or nation or tribe to which it has gone , rich or poor , scholar or simple , king or commoner , men of literally every background and walk of life .
No other book has ever held such universal appeal nor produced such lasting effects .
One final evidence that the Bible is true is found in the testimony of those who have believed it .
Multitudes of people , past and present , have found from personal experience that its promises are true , its counsel is sound , its commands and restrictions are wise , and its wonderful message of salvation meets every need for both time and eternity .

The Federal Government will try to retrieve taxpayers ' money given to Pacific Brands in view of the company 's decision to slash 1850 jobs , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said on Friday .
Public outrage over the sackings , to be carried out over the next 18 months , is increasing as Pacific Brands prepares to send its manufacturing operations out of Australia .
" I think what Pacific Brands has done is , frankly , in so many respects , beyond the pale , " Mr Rudd said on Fairfax Radio Network .
" In terms of the money they have got from the government , we will go through all of that in terms of what can be extracted back from them . "
According to Michele O'Neil , national secretary of the Textile Clothing and Footwear Union , Pacific Brands had accepted $ 17 million from the federal government over the past two years .
It ’s really hard to answer the question : Was a release successful ?
In the jQuery project we try to look at a number of criteria .
Are users pleased with the release ?
Are users adopting the release ?
Are we meeting the needs of those who do n’t use jQuery ?
It ’s hard to put exact numbers on those points ( we listen very closely to the response on our blog , on twitter , on the mailing list , and elsewhere – and thus far it ’s been very positive ) but we do have a couple tools that we use to try and simplify that process , namely : Google Analytics and Google Trends .
Above is a Google Analytics comparison of Jan 2009 ( blue ) to Dec 2008 ( green ) for jquery.com .
We ’re currently seeing a +30 % growth in visitors day to day over December .
I ’m really pleased to see that the 1.3 release was " sticky " ( users liked what they saw and stuck around to keep using it – the daily numbers are n’t dropping to their pre-release levels ) .
Note the increase of bounce rate and decrease in pages / visit and avg .
time on site – both were linked to the 1.3 and 1.3.1 releases where people come to check out the release then leave again .
The 14th of January was the 1.3 release ( had a lot of traffic that week – we hit Ajaxian , Reddit , Hacker News , and a number of blogs ) .
We hit Digg on the week of 26th and saw no appreciable gain in traffic .
I trimmed out the Christmas - New Years time frame since traffic was very low ( and does n’t make for a good comparison ) .
None of this data includes jQuery UI or static files which are tracked separately .
Google Trends has helped us to learn some things about the use of the library .
The biggest of which is the " Christmas slump . "
j Query users largely appear to use it during their day jobs ( see the analytics stats to see the weekend slumps ) .
Every year at around the December holiday season ( Dec 23rd to Jan 3rd ) we see a major drop - off in traffic – we can see a direct correlation within the Google Trends stats , as well .
One thing that I ’ve learned while managing jQuery it ’s that there ’s a huge potential to lose users in between projects .
A developer ends a project and then re-evaluates his tool chain to see if any improvements can be made .
Every time a user finishes a project there ’s a possibility that they ’ll leave for another tool – it ’s our job to make sure that we consistently provide the best tool and experience possible so that the need does n’t arise ( better documentation , better code , frequent releases , etc. ) .
A very similar problem occurs over the holiday break .
The users are away from their code for about 1 - 2 weeks and when they come back they have a chance to choose another tool , pick up where they left off , or to become engaged and continue strong .
The question now becomes :
How well can we retain ( and hopefully grow ) the userbase over this slump ?
If we look at the slump from 2006 to 2007 we see an immediate pick - up again after the users return from their breaks .
The reason ?
j Query 1.1 was released .
But look at 2007 to 2008 – there was almost no pick - up and it took almost half a year to get back to the point at which growth had resumed .
Incidentally , there was no significant release in January .
We fixed that this time around – we released jQuery 1.3 .
Note how we instantly picked up our users and even grew our share during that time period .
From a growth perspective I ’m very pleased with the 1.3 release – I think we ’re setting ourselves up for an outstanding 2009 .
It ’s likely that we ’ll be pushing another follow - up release ( 1.3.2 ) this week to address one last 1.3 regression – but other than that , it looks like we ’re in the clear to heads toward some solid new features and fixes in 1.3.3 and beyond .
Keeping Sierra lands wild
( This is a composite photograph compiled of 5 images put together ) Perazzo Meadows , that is North of Truckee , and close to Sierraville it�s a 982 - acre wetlands area it�s the latest jewel to be purchased by Trust for Public Land .
The Trust is launching an aggressive campaign to buy as much as 50,000 that would be preserved as public land .. on Wednesday Jan 14 , 2009 in Sierraville , Calif less ( This is a composite photograph compiled of 5 images put together ) Perazzo Meadows , that is North of Truckee , and close to Sierraville it�s a 982 - acre wetlands area it�s the latest jewel to be purchased by ... more Photo : Kurt Rogers , The Chronicle Photo : Kurt Rogers , The Chronicle Image 1 of / 5 Caption Close Keeping Sierra lands wild 1 / 5 Back to Gallery
The valley known as Perazzo Meadows is a stunning landscape of woods and watershed habitat surrounded by glimmering Sierra Nevada peaks , but there is more to the high - country Shangri - La than sheer beauty .
The 982 - acre meadow northwest of Truckee is an integral piece of an unusual land grant made almost 150 years ago that left pristine forests , rivers and valuable wildlife habitat in the northern Sierra in a checkerboard pattern of alternating public and private ownership .
Bisected by a meandering section of the Little Truckee River , the remote , snow - covered meadow was in imminent danger of being sold to developers or parceled out for vacation homes until a conservation coalition purchased it and two other private properties from Siller Brothers Inc. for $ 6 million .
The Dec. 30 deal is the first major success of the Northern Sierra Partnership , formed in 2007 as part of an unprecedented campaign to take out of private hands 65,000 acres of land over the next three to five years through a combination of purchases , conservation easements and management agreements .
The $ 130 million effort is part of a broader plan , started in 1991 by the Trust for Public Land of San Francisco , to permanently protect as much as 200,000 acres of private checkerboard property in the region , which stretches from South Lake Tahoe to Lassen Volcanic National Park .
" Protecting these High Sierra meadows with creeks running through them are huge priorities , " said David Sutton , the Northern California and Nevada director for the Trust for Public Land .
" Perazzo has been a major priority for us since the mid-1990s .
Buying it means 2 1/2 miles of the lower Truckee River are protected and the threat of land conversion is ended . "
The Trust for Public Land formed the partnership with the Truckee Donner Land Trust , the Nature Conservancy , the Sierra Business Council and the Feather River Land Trust in an effort to save the Sierra 's most unspoiled forest and wildlife habitat .
The alternating one - square - mile parcels known as the Sierra checkerboard cover a total of 1.5 million acres - an area roughly 80 miles long and 40 miles wide .
On maps , it looks like a checkerboard .
The board - game pattern is the result of an 1862 scheme by the federal government to extend the Transcontinental Railroad over Donner Summit , the infamous site of the cannibalistic travails of the Donner Party 15 years earlier .
The Central Pacific Railroad Co. was granted every other square mile of property along the mountainous route as an incentive to build the tracks .
The idea was to allow for enough room for the railroad to meander through the mountains .
It also supplied the railroad with property in virtually every location where future towns might pop up , a strong inducement given the money - making possibilities .
Parcels not used were sold to timber and mining companies to help fund construction and , over time , it was all sold .
About 40 percent of the railroad land was eventually acquired by Sierra Pacific Industries , a logging company based in Redding that is now the largest private land owner in California .
Most of the public squares have since become National Forest lands .
Over the past two decades , the Trust for Public Land has negotiated the acquisition of about 25,000 acres of former railroad property .
But Sierra Pacific and other lumber companies , along with ranchers and private investment management companies , still hold some of the most spectacular parcels .
Pressure to sell
With the economic downturn , the private owners have been under increasing pressure to unload their property .
It is an opportunity for conservationists , who face the daunting prospect of trying to outbid resort developers and wealthy people looking to build second homes .
Sutton said piecemeal development of the land would destroy forest ecosystems and cut off wildlife corridors by inserting roads and introducing exotic species and domestic animals .
Such development in wildland areas also makes firefighting more difficult and prevents consistent forest management planning .
Studies predict that climate change will shrink snowpack in the Sierra , which produces 60 percent of California 's water supply , by 36 percent in the next 50 to 100 years .
Sutton said the High Sierra forest must be protected for native wildlife to survive , which is why it was so important for the conservation groups to join forces .
" The loss of forest systems are exacerbating the increased temperatures because it means less trees that absorb carbon , " Sutton said .
" You lose the productivity of the forest with low - density development , and because of increasing temperatures , wildlife is going to have to move to survive .
So if you can create solid blocks of land , you are affording those species room to move . "
The partnership plans to use foundation grants , state bond money , private donations and philanthropic contributions to protect 40 percent of the approximately 500,000 acres of private lands in the checkerboard , including important watersheds and wildlife corridors .
The idea is to create a conifer zone to the crest of the Sierra and protect watersheds on nine major forks of the American , Yuba , Bear and Little Truckee river systems .
Perazzo Meadows is home to numerous rare species , including willow flycatchers , peregrine falcons , bald and golden eagles and the mountain yellow - legged frog .
Native Lahontan cutthroat trout have disappeared from the tributary that meanders through the large , wet valley , but the Truckee River Watershed Council is hoping state Fish and Game officials will agree to reintroduce the threatened fish as part of a major restoration project .
A 400 - acre parcel northwest of Castle Peak at the edge of the Paradise Valley was also acquired from Siller .
A third property near Collins Lake , in Yuba County , was part of the deal , but it is not part of the checkerboard .
It will eventually be transferred to the state Department of Fish and Game .
The Perazzo and Paradise properties will be turned over to the Tahoe National Forest .
They are the ninth and 10th squares to be acquired near Castle Peak since the Trust for Public Land began buying property 18 years ago .
Four other parcels are still under negotiation , but Perazzo is the most valuable , Sutton said , because it includes high - mountain meadow habitat , a river and wetlands .
Wilderness hopes , fears
The partnership is lobbying Congress to create a Castle Peak wilderness area , which would cover a portion of the Perazzo property .
Such a prospect scares some local residents , whose snowmobile tracks can often be seen zig - zagging in the winter between frost - tinged willow trees and across the blanket of snow covering the meadow .
" A lot of people access their property on snowmobiles and might have to pass through the wilderness area , which prohibits snowmobiles , " said Ken Bretthauer , a longtime resident who manages a local ranch and campground .
" Locals are afraid that access to this area that they have used for years is going to be cut off . "
Perry Norris , executive director of the Truckee Donner Land Trust , said the proposed wilderness would not prohibit snowmobiling where it is now popular .
He said public access and recreational opportunities will be enhanced - a far cry , he said , from what would have happened if developers had purchased the property .
" With Tahoe basically built out , the development pressure was going to mount in the alpine areas , " Norris said .
" That is why this acquisition is so critical . "
Sutton hopes the purchase is the first of many successes in the group 's effort to save the forests and river systems of the Sierra Nevada range .
" The opportunity is greater than it has ever been to have an impact of historic proportions , " Sutton said .
" If we are going to find a way to keep the American West the way we would like to , this is the kind of solution that we 've got to come up with . "
JERUSALEM , March 19 ( Reuters ) - Israel 's military was rocked on Thursday by Gaza war veterans ' accounts of the killing of civilians and allegations that deep contempt for Palestinians pervaded its ranks .
The soldiers , alumni of a military academy , gathered last month to discuss their experiences in the 22 - day Israeli offensive that ended in January , a campaign that Palestinians and human rights groups have said warranted war crimes probes .
Disclosing details of the session , the institution 's director said the soldiers pointed to an atmosphere within the military of " unbridled contempt for , and forcefulness against , the Palestinians " .
" They talked about unwarranted fire on Palestinian civilians .
There was also talk of vandalism to property , " Danny Zamir , head of the Yitzhak Rabin pre-military programme , told Israel Radio .
Defence Minister Ehud Barak responded to the accusations by repeating Israel 's description of its armed forces as the most moral in the world .
The military said its judge advocate - general ordered an investigation of the alleged incidents .
Excerpts from the veterans ' discussion appeared on Thursday on the front page of the left - leaning Haaretz daily .
It said the airing of the " dirty secrets " would make it more difficult for Israelis to dismiss such allegations as Palestinian propaganda .
It has been rare for Israeli soldiers to speak out about the killing of Palestinian civilians in the operation that Israel launched in the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip in December with the declared aim of halting militants ' cross - border rocket attacks .
WRONG TURN
One of the soldiers , an infantry squad leader , recalled an incident in which he said an army sharpshooter killed a Palestinian mother and her two children who turned the wrong way after troops ordered them out of their house .
" The platoon commander let the family go and told them to go their right .
One mother and her two children did n't understand and went to the left ...
The sharpshooter saw ( them ) approaching him , closer than the lines he was told no one should pass .
He shot them . "
The squad leader said most of the men under his command felt " the lives of Palestinians ... is something very , very less important than the lives of our soldiers , so as far as they are concerned , they can justify it that way " .
Zamir said he conveyed the veterans ' accounts to the Israeli military .
Israeli leaders have said Hamas bore ultimate responsibility for civilian deaths because its fighters operated in crowded Palestinian areas .
Another squad leader who attended the academy said at the gathering that a company commander had ordered an elderly Palestinian woman shot as she walked on a road about 100 metres ( yards ) from a house that troops had taken over .
Describing vandalism carried out by soldiers , the squad leader said : " To write ' death to the Arabs ' on the walls , to take family pictures and spit on them , just because you can -- I think this is the main thing , to understand how much the IDF ( Israel Defence Forces ) has fallen in the realm of ethics . "
The Palestinian Center for Human Rights has put the Palestinian death toll during the war at 1,434 -- 960 civilians , 235 fighters and 239 police officers .
Israeli officials have disputed the figures .
Thirteen Israelis were killed .
Zamir said that while veterans at the alumni session had not directly taken part in war crimes , " they felt uncomfortable because they could not prevent them " .

French internet users persisting in illicit downloading of music and films could have the plug pulled on their internet if a controversial new law is approved .
Marc Guez from SCPP said users must pay for what they consume Under plans by the French government , illegal downloaders would be barred from broadband access by their Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) after three warnings .
The three - strikes law means alleged wrongdoers will first get a warning e-mail , then a letter through the post , followed by their connection being cut off for up to a year .
A proposed state agency would gather the Internet Protocol ( IP ) addresses of people involved in illegal file - sharing .
Marc Guez , managing director of France 's Society of Phonographic Producers ( SCPP ) , said record companies are losing millions in profits to piracy .
He said the internet is " killing all of the creative industries little by little " and that governments must take action against piracy .
He expects other industries to follow in the steps of record companies .
" We are the first ones , but the movie industry is going to come and the gaming industry is going to follow , and the software industry and so on , " he added .
Actual offenders
However , the scheme has faced opposition from civil liberty groups concerned about the invasion of privacy .
Websites protested against a new copyright law in New Zealand Other critics pointed out that IP addresses are not necessarily pinned to one individual , so it could be difficult to find the actual offenders .
For instance , anyone taking their laptop out for a stroll could potentially piggy - back on someone else 's unlocked wireless connection .
If the net intruder then downloaded content illegally , it would be the service 's subscriber who would receive a letter of warning .
Despite these concerns , the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry is continuing to lobby governments to get strict laws enacted across the world .
If the French scheme is given the go ahead in early April and adopted successfully , it could offer a potential model for other countries .
New Zealand is now considering whether to push ahead with a new tougher copyright law , despite protests from activists across the internet .
Sweden considered with idea but decided not to cut off their citizens ' internet , and Germany 's justice minister branded the punishment " unreasonable " .
Innovative models
The debate in France has raised the question of how to reward creativity and how music and digital content should be distributed .
This music site offers free and legal songs , plus an innovative model
One website came up with an innovative business plan by offering free music for private use , and charging those who stand to make money from it .
The founder of Jamendo.com , Sylvain Zimmer , believes that punishing music lovers is not the way forward .
" We think we will create more value and more innovative things if we reward the biggest fans of the artists , " he said .
He added that the solution is " innovation and trying to come up with new models instead of trying to enforce the old one with law " .
But Mr Guez from SCPP disagrees - he believes in the " pay for what you consume " business model already in use .
" It is a very simple model , very old , and it works , " he said .
The alternative of a flat monthly rate for downloads as part of a broadband subscription package is not out of the question for the industry - but only if it is backed up with strong piracy law .
" We want to keep the same habits of those downloading illegally and move them to sites where they can download legally from legal sites , " said Mr Guez from SCPP .
But some doubt whether the record industry would ever relinquish the enormous control they have over who and what songs become big hits .

We are witnessing what a military takeover of a superpower looks like in the new American century .
David Pertraeus became the most dangerous American general since Douglas MacArthur when George W. Bush announced that his “ main man ” would decide when , how and if an Iraq troop drawdown would occur , giving Petraeus unilateral control of U.S. foreign policy .
In the summer of 2008 , when then candidate Barack Obama started talking about a 16 - month withdrawal deadline and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki said that sounded about right , you could almost hear Petraeus screeching What a world !
What a world ! from Baghdad to Washington .
If you listened closely , you also heard the propaganda campaign to sell America on an endless occupation of Iraq click into high gear .
On February 2 , foreign policy analyst Gareth Porter revealed that in a January 21 meeting , Petraeus , Joint Chiefs chairman Admiral Mike Mullen and Defense Secretary Robert Gates were unable to dislocate President Obama from his 16 - month redeployment policy .
Porter also reported that a group of senior retired officers were preparing to support Petraeus , General Ray Odierno and their allies by mobilizing public opinion against Obama ’s decision .
I estimated that support to be part of the larger information campaign that was an integrated effort of the surge strategy from the outset .
D - Day of the latest phase of that information campaign arrived on February 8 when Pulitzer Prize winning Pentagon correspondent Thomas E. Ricks launched a series of TV interviews and Washington Post articles to promote his new book , The Gamble : General David Petraeus and the American Military Adventure in Iraq , 2006 - 2008 .
It ’s not pleasant to call Ricks out for prostituting his credentials , but you ca n’t sleep in a general ’s tent for years the way Ricks has and pretend not to be a camp follower .
Ricks has become for Petraeus what Ned Buntline was to Buffalo Bill Cody : his official legend maker .
In his 2005 book Fiasco : The American Military Adventure in Iraq , Ricks painted Petraeus as the only division commander who got it right in post- invasion Iraq .
By January 2007 , when Petraeus became the new commander of forces in Iraq , Ricks described him in an interview as a “ force of nature , ” and recalling the sight of the general doing one - arm push ups with teenage privates sent Ricks into a breathless arrhythmia .
With The Gamble , Ricks promotes Petraeus to five - star deity .
Both Brainiac and action figure , Super Dave defies the establishment and changes the course of mighty strategies to save America from the agony of defeat in Iraq .
He ’s got a PhD from Princeton , he wears Kevlar , he ’s a complicated man — but no one understands him but Tom Ricks , can you dig it ?
By the time you finish The Gamble , you ’ll pray on your knees that Dave Petraeus runs for president in 2012 .
Ricks used a crate of lipstick to make Petraeus ’s sidekick , General Ray Odierno , look presentable in The Gamble .
He savaged Odie in Fiasco : ox - like Odierno is “ confused by criticism ” that his 4th Infantry Division , the “ worst outfit ” in theater at handling prisoners and civilians , is a virtual corps of “ recruiting sergeants ” for the insurgency .
Odierno himself denies an insurgency is in progress , and is the epitome of the dysfunctional leader who does n’t want to hear the “ bad stuff .
” But in The Gamble , Odierno has experienced an “ awakening . ”
It is Odierno , more than anyone else , who is responsible for the surge ’s success .
“ White House aides and others in Washington … had nothing to do with developing ” the way the surge was executed .
Odierno made all those decisions .
You can trust Ricks on that score because he got the information straight from source : Odierno .
In fact , almost the entirety of Ricks ’s surge saga is told from the perspective of Petraeus , Odierno and the rest of the surgin ’ safari .
If Ricks picks up another Pulitzer for The Gamble , the inscription should read “ best stenography .
” Petraeus and Odierno are assisted by crafty retired Army general Jack Keane .
Big Jack wields his mighty influence to break down the doors of the Washington bureaucracy , and helps his protégés maneuver around their chain of command to place their surge concept before young Mr. Bush himself .
The three wise warriors vanquish a host of fakes , liars , fumblers and meanies , and put their enlightened counterinsurgency scheme to work in Iraq , so gosh , we ca n’t just give up now that things are going so good .
Well , better .
Sort of .
In his book , his Post columns and his interviews , Ricks manages to run through the gamut of neocon talking points on why we still need to stay the course , a compendium of doublethink mantras that in real - speak boil down to “ Buy our war or we ’ll shoot this soldier ’s dog ” and “ Do n’t forget to be afraid of Iran .
” At the same time , remarkably , Ricks generates a mountain of fog in an attempt to cover the neocons ’ tracks .
In an interview with MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews , Ricks absolved the neocons , saying they get “ too much credit and too much blame ” for Iraq .
Nothing was the neocons fault , really .
It was that mean old Dick Cheney who duped the public into supporting the war , and that grouchy old Donald Rumsfeld who ran the war so badly .
Never mind that Cheney and Rumsfeld were charter members of the Project for the New American Century , the neocon think tank that first publicly called for an invasion of Iraq in early 1998 .
Ricks makes a single passing mention of the PNAC in The Gamble .
That ’s a stunning omission when you consider that along with Cheney and Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , Zalmay Khalilzad , Scooter Libby , Elliott Abrams , John Bolton , Richard Perle , Richard Armitage and many other PNACers also held key positions on the Bush administration ’s Iraq policy team .
Eliot Cohen is a featured player in The Gamble , a key figure in the selling of the surge and , according to Ricks , the man who told Bush he should make Petraeus the top commander in Iraq .
Not once does Ricks note that Cohen is a luminary in the neoconservative constellation and that , like Cheney and Rumsfeld , he was a founding member of the PNAC .
Also noteworthy is Ricks ’s glaring omission of any reference to Rebuilding America ’s Defenses , the September 2000 PNAC manifesto that delineated the foreign policy the Bush administration would adopt in whole .
Unfinished issues from Desert Storm , it said , provided the “ immediate justification ” for an invasion of Iraq , but the need to establish a large , permanent military footprint in the geostrategic heart of the oil rich Gulf region transcended “ the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein . ” 9/11 gave the neocons the “ new Pearl Harbor ” they needed to launch their scheme , and the rest is history — as rewritten by the likes of Tom Ricks , who is now abetting them in pursuit of their original purpose .
As is the case with all revisionists , you ’ll find grains of truth along the path of Ricks ’s narrative , just as you ’ll find grain in every pile of horse manure .
The only honest thing you ’ll find picking through Ricks ’s prose , though , is the insanity behind the argument for staying in Iraq .
The real secret of Petraeus ’s “ success ” at counterinsurgency is payola .
As commander of the 101st Airborne in Mosul , “ he bought everybody off .
” The enemy “ was just biding its time and building capacity , waiting him out .
” When Petraeus left Mosul , it went up for grabs .
As top commander in Iraq , Petraeus bought everybody off again , making “ a lot of deals with shady guys ” who are “ just laying low , ” so we can never leave , or the whole country will go up for grabs like Mosul did .
Odds are things will be worse if we leave than they were under Hussein , Ricks told NBC ’s Chris Matthews .
Hussein was a toothless tyrant , but now that Petraeus has “ armed everybody to the teeth ” it ’s too dangerous to get out .
We ’ve made the Iraqi security forces strong enough that they might attempt a coup if we ’re not there to stop them .
The surge may have averted a civil war , but one colonel tells Ricks he does n’t think “ the Iraqi civil war has been fought yet , ” so we have to stick around so we do n’t miss all the fun .
As Iraq becomes more secure , it moves backwards .
There ’s a “ long - term trend toward increasing authoritarianism , ” so we have to stay in Iraq so things do n’t go back to the way they were under Hussein even though , as Ricks just told us , things were better under Hussein than they are now .
Ricks says the surge is a strategic failure because it did n’t bring about the unification government it was supposed to produce .
But that ’s okay , because an analyst Ricks knows says “ power sharing is always a prelude to violence , ” so we have to stay in Iraq to make sure we do n’t achieve our strategic objective , which will be easy because “ the whole notion of democracy and representative government in Iraq ” was “ absolutely ludicrous ” from the get go .
If you ’re thinking Petraeus was plotting all along to create a situation we could n’t extract ourselves from , you ’re right .
As Ricks notes , Petraeus needed time “ not to bring the war to a close , but simply to show enough genuine progress that the American people would be willing to stick with it even longer . ”
Even Ricks seems uncertain that we ’ve seen genuine progress ; maybe we ’ve actually just “ poured more gas on the fire , ” he says , and even though the surge is a failure , its “ attitude is right ” so it was “ the right step to take , ” and we should continue to support U.S. presence in Iraq because we ’ll be there a long time whether we support it or not .
As Ricks explained to David Gregory on Meet the Press , Petraeus and his henchmen have Obama over a barrel .
If Obama continues to stand up to them , they ’ll accuse him of betraying the troops because of a campaign promise he made to get the peace poofter vote .
If things go the way Ricks predicts , the president will fold , the military oligarchy will consolidate its hold on American political power , and the neocons will live to make other people ’s sons fight another day because they conned Tom Ricks into covering for them .
How sad it is to see that Thomas E. Ricks , dean of the Pentagon beat , has been pants down , bent - over - the - table seduced by the neoconservative cabal .
He is as mad as they are , and as madly in love with their eternal crusade in the Middle East as he is with David Petraeus .

As International Women ’s Day is celebrated , the Vatican had a novel message for the women of the world : give thanks for the washing machine .
This humble domestic appliance had done more for the women ’s liberation movement than the contraceptive pill or working outside the home , said the the official Vatican newspaper , Osservatore Romano .
“ In the 20th century , what contributed most to the emancipation of Western women ? ” questioned the article .
“ The debate is still open .
Some say it was the pill , others the liberalisation of abortion , or being able to work outside the home .
Others go even further : the washing machine . ”
The article is entitled , “ The washing machine and the emancipation of women : put in the powder , close the lid and relax ” , taking its name from the Washy Talky , the Electrolux bilingual - talking washing - machine launched in India seven years ago , which would remind the absent - minded housewife how to use the appliance .

The Catholic Church was never likely to laud the pill for its transformative power on women ’s lives .
Since Pope Benedict became the leader of the world ’s 1.1 billion Catholics , he has published a religious document condemning contraception for “ negating the intimate truth of conjugal love , with which the divine gift [ of life ] is communicated ” and has urged pharmacists to refuse to dispense the morning - after pill .
The Osservatore Romano held the pill responsible for polluting the environment and contributing to male infertility .
McCain on Palin in 2012 : ' My corpse is still warm ' Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Sunday December 14 , 2008
Print This Email This On Sunday 's This Week , Senator McCain , while discussing his recent presidential run with host George Stephanopoulos , refrained from expressly offering support for his former running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , if she were to run for president in 2012 .
" Listen , I have the greatest appreciation for Governor Palin and her family , and it was a great joy to know them , " McCain said .
" She invigorated our campaign .
She was just down in Georgia and invigorated their campaign .
But I cant say something like that .
We 've got some great other young governors ... I think you 're going to see the governors assume a greater leadership role in our Republican Party .
Pawlenty , Huntsman --"
" But why not ? " Stephanopoulos asked .
" Six months ago you thought she was the best person to succeed you if something should happen to you . "
" Sure , " McCain said , " but now we 're in a whole ... election cycle .
Have no doubt of my admiration and respect for her and my view of her viability , but at this stage , again ... my corpse is still warm . "
If history is a guide , said blogger Jon Ponder in a BRAD BLOG guest post , Palin 's chances of an ascent to the presidency are " next to nil . "
Looking at 180 years of past losing vice presidential nominees , only one has later taken a seat in the Oval Office : Franklin D. Roosevelt , who lost as the running mate of Democratic hopeful James M. Cox in 1920 , but would go on to beat Herbert Hoover twelve years later and serve four terms .
The numbers also show slim odds for a losing vice presidential nominee to lead a ticket in the future .
Two others have done so besides Roosevelt : former Vice President Mondale lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 , and former Senator Bob Dole , President Ford 's running mate in 1976 , lost his 1996 run to President Clinton .

And so suddenly here ’s marijuana -- yep , marijuana -- hogging itself another heyday , bolting into the spotlight , all but sashaying back into dialogue and shouting , “ Hey , I ’m still here . ”
Shadowed in cycles through recent decades while other legal or illegal or performance - enhancing stimulants took turns getting all the hype , marijuana has just hollered in the case of merely the most - decorated Olympian in history , Michael Phelps .
It has tried to yell from the recent past of the Super Bowl most valuable player , who alighted at Disney World only four months after a forgotten arrest .
It has appeared this week in the suitcase of an arrested college basketball point guard at an airport , and this winter in the possession of a former Dallas receiver , and a Seattle linebacker , and a Florida State receiver , and a retired NBA forward / center , and amid a Japanese sumo wrestling scandal if you can believe such , and in November with a New York Jets defensive end , and last spring in that bellwether moment on talk radio , when Dallas Mavericks forward Josh Howard readily said he enjoyed an inhale .
Marijuana ?
Who knew ?
Yeah , well , OK , pretty much everybody did .

“ It has been constant in terms of it being the most popular of the illicit drugs , ” said Roger Roffman , a professor at the University of Washington , whose study of marijuana in culture dates clear back to the Vietnam War as a social worker for the Army .
Even if its relative usage does n’t match its peak from the late 1970s , Roffman said its No. 1 ranking has remained impenetrable .
It ’s just that news coverage and human discourse run in cycles , as Roffman reminded , and seldom has any cycle known a louder clash than a 14 - time gold medalist heralded as classic Americana ramming into a photo at a party with a bong .
Such a noise far occludes even the fact that Santonio Holmes , NFL superhero and honored Disney guest , logged a one - game suspension in October after Pittsburgh police pulled him over , got a whiff of his SUV and asked if he ’d been smoking , whereupon , according to their report , he said , “ No , but yesterday I was . ”
Because sports permeates everything , those keen on the marijuana issue all along have seen the case of Phelps and his multitudinous corporate sponsors as a gauge of the American mood circa 2009 .
Quiet ruled for days .
Then Thursday , Kellogg ’s halted its sponsorship of Phelps , finding his behavior “ not consistent with the image of Kellogg ’s , ” the 103 - year - old Michigan cereal titan .
Subway , another sponsor , opted for censure but not discontinuance .
From a far different culture , the Swiss watchmaker Omega deemed it “ a non-issue . ”

“ I think there would have been a much stronger and larger fallout ” for an American gold medalist 10 or 20 years ago , said Paul Armentano , deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
In the Phelps brouhaha , Armentano has sensed a profound shift in national dialogue and in media questions , even if he does still chafe when incorrigible headline writers find double - entendres irresistible .
In his view , a swift , toned , dominant athlete who “ more than the average American is cognizant of what he puts in his body ” simply “ blows to smithereens ” marijuana ’s images of slackerdom .
“ Kellogg ’s is playing by the rules of 20 years ago , ” Armentano said .
“ Subway is playing by the rules of 1986 and the ‘ War on Drugs . ’
Those rules have changed . ”
This time around , in fact , some High Times website readers have called for a boycott of Kellogg ’s , while Roffman surmises that could lead to opponents calling for a boycott of the boycott of Kellogg’s .
That ’s because as the debate has roiled on and Roffman has followed it , he has detected four sides , all of which , he said , don “ blinders ” when regarding the other three .

Group 1 emphasizes that most adults who smoke marijuana do so occasionally and “ without really any harm , ” Roffman said , “ and that ’s a very hard thing for us to publicly acknowledge . ”
Group 2 stresses that “ a substantial number of marijuana smokers get into real trouble ” and “ derail ” from functionality .
Group 3 considers marijuana central to life on Earth and tends to live alternatively both culturally and politically , yet manages to function .
And Group 4 entails medical users , whose approval in various states -- California in 1996 -- has helped soften the stigma over time .
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , for example , trains on Group 2 and maintains in its policy statements , “ Smoked marijuana has not withstood the rigors of science -- it is not medicine and it is not safe , ” and , “ Legalization of marijuana , no matter how it begins , will come at the expense of our children and public safety . ”
More personally , a Colorado mother of a 12 - year - old swimmer said of Phelps on ABC News , “ I am absolutely appalled .
Honestly , absolutely appalled , sickened and saddened . ”
Epitomizing the dichotomy of views , 12 states have decriminalized certain amounts of marijuana possession but , Roffman said , “ Would the rest of the states pass that ?
I have substantial doubts about that . ”
In the athletic realm , there have been 1994 Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam , who said on the record that marijuana made him lazy and impeded his progress , and five - time Pro Bowl NFL lineman Mark Stepnoski , who said on the record it helped him sleep and alleviate pain without enduring painkillers or hangovers .

Had Roffman run Kellogg ’s , he said , he might have opted for a commodity rare in America : nuance .
He might have suspended Phelps but said something akin to :
We realize he ’s a role model .
We do n’t believe children and adolescents should smoke marijuana .
We also realize Phelps is an adult .
We recognize that adults often smoke marijuana without being harmed .
We also recognize that because he ’s a role model , we support his attempt not to repeat this .
That ’s too shaded for a zippy sound bite , of course , but that ’s hemp in 2009 , when a 47 - year - old statesman can admit he smoked during youth and become a decisively elected president , and a 23 - year - old athlete can succumb to a South Carolina party photographer and a British tabloid and a ruckus , but with his sponsors reacting variously .
It ’s a marijuana era clearly new but still perplexing .
“ There are n’t many places Joe and Mary Public can turn for a balanced , up - to - date , accurate , rational debate about marijuana and all of its glitter and all of its warts , ” Roffman said .
So even though the professor lacks a title just yet for his forthcoming memoir about 40 years following the bouncing dialogue , he does know that the title , for diverse reasons , will include the word “ myth . ”

Allowing some people to use marijuana for medical purposes wo n’t prompt a rash of drug crimes .
In fact , if states such as Washington are examples , it could do just the opposite in Minnesota .
At least that ’s what the former police chief of Seattle suggested to a Minnesota House committee Tuesday .
Former Chief Norm Stamper noted that overall crime , including marijuana - related violations , is down significantly in Washington .
So , what would he say if asked how its legalization is faring there ?
“ My one - word response would be ‘ well , ’ ” Stamper said .
“ My two - word response would be ‘ very well . ’ ”
Stamper endorsed a House bill that would legalize the use of marijuana for people with chronic and debilitating illnesses .
Sponsored by state Rep. Tom Rukavina , DFL - Virginia , the bill passed the Public Safety Policy and Oversight Committee on a 9 - 6 vote and was sent to a finance committee .
A similar bill is moving through the state Senate .
Stamper conceded the idea of less crime and legalized medical marijuana sounds counterintuitive .
“ The theory is that we have now made a medicine out of what formerly was an illicit drug , ” said Stamper , adding , “ It has removed the mystique . ”
Opposition in Washington state from law - enforcement officials “ has been eliminated or neutralized , ” he added .
But not in Minnesota .
At least at the hearing .
Representatives from state and local police organizations , including Public Safety Commissioner Michael Campion , spoke against the bill , even piling large bags of marijuana on a table to demonstrate how much they said someone could possess under the proposal .
They argued the bill was misguided , was n’t sufficiently restrictive and would help feed America ’s appetite for illegal drugs .
State Rep. Tony Cornish , R - Good Thunder , who is police chief of Lake Crystal , even contended Stamper showed too much support for the medical profession — at the expense of police in the hearing room .
“ They ’re not taking the risks — we are , ” said Cornish , who wore a bright yellow tie that said , “ Police Line , Do Not Cross . ”
Saying that was n’t his intent , Stamper said he believes any solution in Minnesota must include law - enforcement representatives .
He testified that Minnesota ’s proposal is more restrictive and allows less marijuana in possession than the guidelines approved by Washington voters in 1998 .
“ We have a lot more medical marijuana patients than you can anticipate here , ” Stamper said .

She built a hoax MySpace page in which she posed as the vice - principal of her school , poking fun at her strictness .
At the bottom of the page she added a disclaimer just to make sure everyone knew it was a joke .
" When you find this I hope you have a sense of humour , " she wrote .
Humour is not in abundance , it seems , in Luzerne County , northern Pennsylvania .
In January 2007 Transue was charged with harassment .
She was called before the juvenile court in Wilkes - Barre , an old coal town about 20 miles from her home .
Less than a minute into the hearing the gavel came down .
" Adjudicated delinquent ! " the judge proclaimed , and sentenced her to three months in a juvenile detention centre .
Hillary , who had n't even presented her side of the story , was handcuffed and led away .
But her mother , Laurene , protested to the local law centre , setting in train a process that would uncover one of the most egregious violations of children 's rights in US legal history .
Last month the judge involved , Mark Ciavarella , and the presiding judge of the juvenile court , Michael Conahan , pleaded guilty to having accepted $ 2.6 m ( £ 1.8 m ) from the co-owner and builder of a private detention centre where children aged from 10 to 17 were locked up .
The cases of up to 2,000 children put into custody by Ciavarella over the past seven years - including that of Transue - are now being reviewed in a billowing scandal dubbed " kids for cash " .
The alleged racket has raised questions about the cosy ties between the courts and private contractors , and about the harsh treatment meted out to adolescents .
Alerted by Laurene Transue , the Juvenile Law Centre in Wilkes - Barre began to uncover scores of cases in which teenagers had been summarily sent to custody by Ciavarella , dating as far back as 1999 .
One child was detained for stealing a $ 4 jar of nutmeg , another for throwing a sandal at her mother , a third aged 14 was held for six months for slapping a friend at school .
Half of all the children who came before Ciavarella had no legal representation , despite it being a right under state law .
The Juvenile Law Centre has issued a class action against the two judges and other implicated parties in which it seeks compensation for more than 80 children who it claims were victims of injustice .
The prosecution charge sheet alleges that from about June 2000 to January 2007 Ciavarella entered into an " understanding " with Conahan to concoct a scheme to enrich themselves .
The two judges conspired to strip the local state detention centre of funding , diverting the money to a private company called PA Child Care which it helped to build a new facility in the area .
In January 2002 , prosecutors allege , Conahan signed a " placement guarantee agreement " with the firm to send teenagers into their custody .
Enough children would be detained to ensure the firm received more than $ 1 m a year in public money .
In late 2004 a long - term deal was secured with PACC worth about $ 58 m .
In return , the prosecutors allege , the judges received at least $ 2.6 m in kickbacks .
They bought a condominium in Florida with the proceeds .
PACC's then owner , Bob Powell , who has not been charged , used to moor his yacht at a nearby marina .
He called the boat " Reel Justice " .
For a man who has agreed to serve more than seven years in jail as part of a plea bargain , Ciavarella comes across as remarkably unflustered .
He invited the Guardian into his Wilkes - Barre home where he remains free on bail pending sentencing .
Though he pleaded guilty to conflict of interest and evasion of taxes , he insists that he took the money in all innocence , assuming it to be a legitimate " finder 's fee " from the private company for help in building the detention centre .
He denies sending children to custody in return for kickbacks .
" Cash for kids ?
It never happened .
People have jumped to conclusions - I did n't do any of these things . "
He says that he regarded his court as a place of treatment for troubled adolescents , not of punishment .
" I wanted these children to avoid becoming statistics in an adult world .
That 's all it was , trying to help these kids straighten out their lives . "
As evidence , Ciavarella claims the percentage of children he sentenced to custodial placements remained steady from 1996 , when he was appointed to the court , until he stood down from it in 2008 .
Yet the facts suggest otherwise .
For the first two years of his term his rate of custodial sentencing was static at 4.5 % of cases .
In 1999 - shortly before he allegedly began the racket with Conahan , according to prosecutors - it suddenly shot up to 13.7 % .
By 2004 it had risen to up to 26 % of all teenagers entering his court .
Ciavarella hopes that with good behaviour he may spend only six years in jail .
Hillary Transue , meanwhile , is now 17 and in high school .
She spent a month in detention for the parody .
For many months afterwards she was ostracised by friends and neighbours , labelled a delinquent .
" It 's nice to see him on the other side of the bench , " she says of Ciavarella .
" I 'm sure he understands now how it feels . "

Editor 's note : Peter Bergen is CNN 's national security analyst and a fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington and at New York University 's Center on Law and Security .
His most recent book is " The Osama bin Laden I Know : An Oral History of al Qaeda 's Leader . "
Peter Bergen says it 's crucial to correctly frame the nature of a war before beginning it .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama and his foreign policy advisers and speechwriters are wrestling with one of the most important speeches of his presidency , his inaugural address .
One of their toughest conceptual challenges is how to describe and recast what the Bush administration has consistently termed the " war on terror . "
The dean of military strategists , Carl von Clausewitz , explains the importance of this decision - making in his treatise " On War " : " The first , the supreme , the most decisive act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish ... the kind of war on which they are embarking ; neither mistaking it for , nor trying to turn it into something that is alien to its nature . "
Clausewitz 's excellent advice about the absolute necessity of properly defining the war upon which a nation is about to embark was ignored by Bush administration officials who instead declared an open- ended and ambiguous " war on terror " after the United States was attacked on September 11 , 2001 .
Bush took the nation to war against a tactic , rather than a war against a specific enemy , which was obviously al Qaeda and anyone allied to it .
When the United States went to war against the Nazis and the Japanese during World War II , President Franklin Roosevelt and his congressional supporters did not declare war against U - boats and kamikaze pilots , but on the Nazi state and Imperial Japan .
The war on terror , sometimes known as the " Global War on Terror " or by the clunky acronym GWOT , became the lens through which the Bush administration judged almost all of its foreign policy decisions .
That proved to be dangerously counterproductive on several levels .
The GWOT framework propelled the Bush administration into its disastrous entanglement in Iraq .
It had nothing to do with 9/11 but was launched under the rubric of the war on terror and the erroneous claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction .
The theory was that he might give such weapons to terrorists , including al Qaeda to whom he was supposedly allied , and that he therefore threatened American interests .
None of this , of course , turned out to be true .
The Bush administration 's approach to the war on terror collided badly with another of its doctrines , spreading democracy in the Middle East as a panacea to reduce radicalism .
It pushed for elections in the Palestinian territories in which , in early 2006 , the more radical Hamas won a resounding victory , propelled to power on a wave of popular revulsion for the incompetence and corruption of the Fatah party that had dominated Palestinian politics since the 1960s .
Imprisoned by its war on terror framework , the Bush administration supported Israel in a disastrous war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in the summer of 2006 .
Hezbollah is not only a terrorist group but is also part of the rickety Lebanese government and runs social welfare services across the country , yet for the Bush administration its involvement in terrorism was all that mattered .
As is now widely understood in Israel , the war against Hezbollah was a moral and tactical defeat for the Israeli military and government .
Events in the current Israeli incursion in Gaza will determine whether history repeats itself .
Under the banner of the war on terror , the Bush administration also tied itself in conceptual knots conflating the threat from al Qaeda with Shiite groups like Hezbollah and the ayatollahs in Iran .
In 2006 , for instance , President Bush claimed that " the Sunni and Shiite extremist represent different faces of the same threat . "
In reality , Sunni and Shiite extremists have been killing each other in large numbers for years in countries from Pakistan to Iraq .
The groups have differing attitudes toward the United States , which Sunni extremists attacked in 1993 and again on 9/11 , while Shiite militants have never done so .
So , how to reconceptualize the GWOT ?
Contrary to a common view among Europeans , who have lived through the bombing campaigns of various nationalist and leftist terror groups for decades , al Qaeda is not just another criminal / terrorist group that can be dealt with by police action and law enforcement alone .
After all , a terrorist organization like the Irish Republican Army would call in warnings before its attacks and its single largest massacre killed 29 people .
By contrast , al Qaeda has declared war on the United States repeatedly -- as it did for the first time to a Western audience during Osama bin Laden 's 1997 interview with CNN .
Following that declaration of war , the terror group attacked American embassies , a U.S. warship , the Pentagon and the financial heart of the United States , killing thousands of civilians without warning ; acts of war by any standard .
Al Qaeda is obviously at war with the United States and so to respond by simply recasting the GWOT as the GPAT , the Global Police Action Against Terrorists , would be foolish and dangerous .
What kind of war then should the United States fight against al Qaeda ?
For that we should learn some lessons from the conceptual errors of the Bush administration .
Nine days after 9/11 , Bush addressed Congress in a speech watched live by tens of millions of Americans in which he said that al Qaeda followed in the footsteps " of the murderous ideologies of the 20th century ... They follow in the path of fascism , Nazism and totalitarianism , " implying that the fight against al Qaeda would be similar to World War II or the Cold War .
For the Bush administration , painting the conflict in such existential terms had the benefit of casting the president as the heroic reincarnation of Winston Churchill and anyone who had the temerity to question him as the reincarnation of Hitler 's arch - appeaser , Neville Chamberlain .
But this portrayal of the war on terror was massively overwrought .
The Nazis occupied and subjugated most of Europe and instigated a global conflict that killed tens of millions .
And when the United States fought the Nazis , the country spent 40 percent of its gross domestic product to do so and fielded millions of soldiers .
In his inaugural address , Obama should say that the United States is indeed at " war against al Qaeda and its allies , " but that as Roosevelt said in his inaugural address in 1933 , the only thing we have to fear is fear itself .
If Americans are not terrorized by terrorists , then the U.S. has won against them .
Al Qaeda and its allies are threats to the United States and Americans living and working overseas , but they are far from all - powerful .
Barring an exceptional event like September 11 , 2001 , in any given year Americans are more likely to die of snake bites or lightning strikes than a terrorist attack .
Despite the hyperventilating rhetoric of Osama bin Laden , al Qaeda 's amateur investigations into weapons of mass destruction do not compare to the very real possibility of nuclear conflagration that we faced during the Cold War .
There are relatively few adherents of Binladen - ism in the West today , while there were tens of millions of devotees of communism and fascism .
Obama should also make it clear that instead of the Bush formulation of " Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists , " the Obama administration doctrine will be , " Anyone who is against the terrorists is with us . "
After all it is only al Qaeda and its several affiliates in countries like Iraq , Lebanon and Algeria and allied groups such as the Taliban that kill U.S. soldiers and civilians and attack American interests around the globe .
Everyone else in the world is a potential or actual ally in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates , because those organizations threaten almost every category of institution , government and ethnic grouping .

Charlie Miller , the security researcher most well known for his Safari exploits that earned him cash and free MacBooks in the last two Pwn2 Own contests , sat down with Tom 's Hardware for a lengthy interview .
He detailed several areas where Apple could improve security for both Mac OS X and Safari , but ultimately , he still recommends Macs over Windows for most users .
Miller stressed that the exploits he has used took significant effort to develop .
" Yes , I took down the Mac in under a minute each time , " he told Tom 's Hardware .
" However , this does n't show the fact that I spent many days doing research and writing the exploit before the day of the competition . "
He said if he were to sit down at a machine and be told he had two minutes to hack it , he would n't be that successful .
For browser security , though , he praised Google 's Chrome for its per-tab process sandbox .
" Sandboxing helps [ security ] quite a bit , if done properly , " said Miller .
" Basically , the attacker has to get code running and then figure out how to get out of , or break , the sandbox . "
Safari does n't currently employ any such sandboxing techniques .
Further , said Miller , Mac OS X does n't fully implement current security techniques such as " no execute " memory space protection or address space layout randomization .
" The idea is there will always be bugs and vulnerabilities in software , " he said .
" But you can make it difficult for attackers to get code running on the system — and even if they do , limit the amount of damage that can be done . "
Miller described the NX bit and ASLR techniques as tough to defeat if properly implemented .
" Between these two hurdles , no one knows how to execute arbitrary code in Firefox or IE 8 in Vista right now , " he explained .
While Apple has adopted ASLR somewhat in Leopard , it 's not as complete as the implementation in Windows .
" In the exploit I won Pwn2 Own with , I knew right where my shellcode was located and I knew it would execute on the heap for me . "
If pressed to recommend an OS between Windows , Linux , or Mac OS X to an average user , Miller would still choose Mac OS X .
" I 'd say that Macs are less secure for the reasons we 've discussed here — lack of anti-exploitation technologies — but are more safe because there simply is n't much malware out there , " concluded Miller .
" For now , I 'd still recommend Macs for typical users as the odds of something targeting them are so low that they might go years without seeing any malware , even though if an attacker cared to target them it would be easier for them . "

Bangladesh blocked access to the video - sharing site YouTube after it hosted a recording of a tense meeting between the prime minister and army officials following a bloody mutiny by border guards , officials said today .
The insurrection last month claimed 70 lives , shook the two - month - old government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and raised tensions with the powerful military , which opposed her handling of the incident .
YouTube " has been temporarily blocked , " said a senior official with the government 's regulatory body that oversees the Internet , the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The official declined to provide further details and spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media .
Zia Ahmed , the telecommunications commission chairman , defended the decision , saying , " Nothing has been done that is beyond the jurisdiction of the government , " according to the online news service bdnews 24.com .
" The government can take any decision to stop any activity that threatens national unity and integrity , " said Ahmed .
The audio clip recorded Hasina defending her decision to negotiate with the mutineers while army officials shouted and jeered , drowning her out and preventing her from speaking .
The clip was being posted on blogs and overseas Web sites that cater to Bangladeshis .
Nasrin Sultana , a manager at Access Telecom Bangladesh Limited , one of the country 's major Internet providers , said the site was blocked late Sunday because of an audio clip from the March 1 meeting .
Officials at Google Inc. , YouTube 's parent company , could not be immediately reached for comment .
Military officials and others with knowledge of the meeting said the gathering was tense .
The 26 - 27 February revolt at the Dhaka headquarters of the Bangladesh Rifles , a paramilitary border patrol force commanded by army officers , left senior army officials furious at Hasina for negotiating with the mutineers instead of ordering an army attack .
The mutiny ended through negotiations , with offers of amnesty and a show of military force .
But when dozens of bodies — including those of 56 commanding officers — were discovered dumped into shallow graves or sewers on the sprawling compound , the government rescinded the amnesty for those behind the mutiny .
Four other army officers are still reported missing , and presumed dead .
The government and the army have both launched investigations into attack , which apparently began over complaints over pay , perks and promotion prospects .
The government has sought technical and forensic assistance from the FBI as well as from Britain 's Scotland Yard .
FBI agents arrived Sunday night and will join police investigators .
Police also said yesterday that they have so far arrested 36 suspects out of the more than 1,000 border guards charged in the mayhem .
HP has been selling printers via a third party distributor to Iran , in probable breach of US sanctions .
Although the print giant seems to have limited sales to low - level printers this is still likely to fall within the US 's general ban on technology exports to Iran unless specifically licensed .
HP sells kit to Iran via a distributor - Redington Gulf - based in Dubai , according to the Boston Globe .
Redington Gulf started life in 1997 only selling HP kit but it now works with 25 brands including Microsoft , Intel , Lenovo , Nokia , Samsung and Toshiba .
The Indian - owned distie only trades through resellers and is not obviously obliged to follow US law .
A spokeswoman for HP would not comment on how popular HP printers were in Iran but told the Boston Globe the firm has " a policy of complete compliance with US export laws . " .
Many other US brands are available in Iran but are usually smuggled in rather than coming through official channels .
Most types of US trade with Iran have been restricted since 1995 and in 2004 Bush tightened the screw even further .
Earlier this year Yahoo ! and Microsoft ended their bans on new registrations from Iran for free email accounts which began in 2007 apparently due to US sanctions .
In 2006 US firm Supermicro was fined $ 150 , 000 after it admitted shipping server motherboards to Dubai knowing that they were destined for Iran in breach of trade sanctions . ®
SUDDEN deaths among people being held by police in California increased sixfold in the first year after police departments there began using Taser stun guns , according to a survey by the University of California , San Francisco .
The finding appears to back Amnesty International ’s view that Tasers are a threat to life .
Taser International , which makes the weapons , says that the study is flawed because it relies on “ suspect data sampling ” from a limited number of police departments .
The researchers compared death rates in custody in the five years before and after the Taser was introduced .

Last weekend Gordon Webster came to Rochester , NY to play a dance at The Keg .
It was awesome ( of course ) and everyone had a great time .
I took a lot of photos during the course of the night ( around 360 actually ) and some of them turned out pretty nice .
A few people have wondered how I got the look I did , so I decided to write a post about it .
I 'm assuming you know what basic terms like aperture and shutter speed mean .
If not , look for a post over at LindyBloggers fairly soon about shooting dances with a point - and - shoot camera .
One of the reasons I got into photography seriously was so that I could shoot dancers and musicians .
I 've since branched out and become interested in a lot of other aspects of photography , but dancing is a huge part of my life and photographing dancers is still something I absolutely love .
I ( like many others ) thought that getting a DSLR would let me take awesome dancing photos with a bit of practice .
Well , it 's not that simple .
Dances are one of the hardest things I shoot for a couple of reasons .
Dancing , especially in a dance like Lindy Hop , involves a lot of movement .
It makes focusing a huge pain unless you 've got really good eyes .
I do n't .
When I first started out the majority ( at least 70 % ) of my dance photos were out of focus .
It 's much more difficult than shooting a still ( or even slowly moving ) target .
Moving quickly also means you need a fast shutter speed if you want anything to be sharp .
You can focus perfectly but that wo n't freeze any movement .
This would n't be an issue if it was n't for the second main problem .
Seriously , it 's terrible .
It 's always fairly dark to set the mood ; you do n't want to dance in a brightly lit place unless you 're competing .
To make matters worse , it 's almost always ridiculously uneven .
Part of the room with usually be two or three stops darker than the rest .
Only shooting in one place helps , but is fairy boring .
A lot of people will stay in the same general area for most of the night ( damn cliques ! ) and so if you only shoot one section of the floor you 'll miss a lot of people .
I 've tried a couple of different techniques to overcome these problems .
Some of them work in some situations but most of the time they leave me unhappy .
The first remedy I turned to was buying a fast prime lens ( Pentax 50 mm f / 1.4 ) so that it would let in more light .
With that lens I would turn up the ISO to 1600 or so to get even more sensitivity and hope for the best .
This kind of works , but has some issues .
Shooting with a fast prime means I only have to carry one lens around and do n't need to change it during the night .
They 're usually pretty light too , so they 're easier to work with .
50 mm is a nice focal length that lets you stand far enough away to not get kicked .
You also do n't need to annoy people with flash .
The wide apertures let more light in so you can actually get some decently exposed photos at workable shutter speeds .
The ISO is n't much of an problem as long as you expose the photo right ( if you have to bring up the exposure more than a half stop in post it looks terrible ) .
This solution really excels if you 're shooting classes or workshops .
The light there is usually much better than at actual dances but still not ideal .
The wide apertures let you soak up all of that light and you can get some really nice photos .
The example in this section was taken at Girl Jam last year during one of the classes with my 50 mm .
Focusing on moving dancers is hard enough at " normal " apertures ; trying to nail the focus when you 've only got six inches of depth of field at f /1.4 is nearly fucking impossible .
Maybe other photographers are better at manually focusing or have amazing Canon / Nikon cameras that can focus on a black cat in a darkroom , but I 'm not and I do n't .
The focal length of most fast primes is generally around 50 mm .
This is n't too bad , but I 've grown to really love wide angle lenses .
50 mm feels too far and detached for my taste .
Yours may be different , so give it a try .
For a while I was adamant that I would never use flash .
I figured it would be annoying and that the " unnatural " light from the flash would somehow look wrong .
I avoided it for a while in favor of fast primes and " natural " light .
Eventually I noticed that some other photographers shot with flash at dances and it did n't annoy me ( while dancing ) at all .
I decided to give it a shot and see how it worked , especially since I was getting really into Strobist and studio lighting at the time .
The basic idea is that you use an external flash ( preferably off camera , synched with a cord or radio triggers ) and bounce the light from the ceiling to get more even coverage .
You set the aperture to something moderate like f/ 4 or f/5.6 and the ISO fairly low .
You turn the shutter speed down as low as it will go and still sync up and let the strobe do the hard work .
You get sharp photos !
What 's more , focusing is no longer something you will curse vehemently !
When you 're shooting at f / 4 or f /5.6 you have a good amount of depth of field so the focus does n't have to be absolutely perfect .
The flash only lasts about 1/1000 of a second .
No one moves much in that time , so you get perfectly sharp photos despite the movement .
Now that you 're not relying on wide apertures you can start using different focal lengths instead of sticking with the fast prime or two that you have .
You could even use a zoom lens if you do n't want to change lenses all the time .
Bouncing from the ceiling is far , far better than keeping your flash on camera and pointing it straight at the subjects , but unless the room has obnoxiously high ceilings you 're still going to get a lot of falloff towards the back of the room .
You might not mind ; it does help isolate the subjects from their surroundings but I found myself getting tired of it pretty quickly .
You also have to carry a flash , sync cord or triggers , and extra batteries around which is kind of a pain .
I do n't mind , but if you like traveling light it could bother you .
This section 's example is one of the better results of this technique : Tango Cafe 's ceilings are very high so the light is pretty even everywhere .
High ceilings come at a price , however : you need more power from the flash to illuminate everything and so can't shoot as fast .
After using these two methods for a while I stopped and looked at my photos .
I was n't as happy with them as I would have liked .
I sat down and asked myself : " Why is that ? "
The photos were exposed well and aside from the focusing mishaps were pretty sharp .
What was missing ?
Eventually I came up with my answer : " Movement . "
Lindy
Hop is very much about movement ; it 's one of the most important parts of the dance , maybe even the most important part .
Getting tack sharp photos is great , but it 's very hard to convey movement with them unless you 're a much better photographer than I am .
Most people are not photographers .
Most dancers are also not photographers .
The majority of Lindy Hoppers will take photos with small point - and - shoot cameras , if they can drag themselves away from dancing for a little while !
The result is that we do n't usually see many dance photos ( because we 're too busy dancing to take them ) and the ones that we do see are usually blurry ( because point and shoot cameras in their default modes are just not equipped to take sharp ones ) .
Even with their flaws , we love them because they 're the few photographic memories we have of some of the best nights of our lives .
I wanted people to have the same feeling toward my photography as they do toward these informal snapshots .
I wanted to capture the essence of these pictures we 're so grateful for but use my experience to make something even better .
I think I 've finally figured out how .
What evokes the feeling of movement in the point - and - shoot shots we look at ?
I think it 's the blurriness .
Our culture is used to looking at photographs and we know that " blurry photograph " usually means " moving subject " even if we 're not always 100 % clear on the physics of it .
As photographers , we know what causes it .
A subject moving while the shutter is open produces blur .
Longer shutter speeds mean more blur .
The little cameras that most of our memories come from simply do n't have the aperture or sensitivity of our hefty DSLRs – all the poor little things can do is leave their shutters open a bit longer to get the light they need .
That 's why those cameras make blurry photos with their default settings .
So how can I add some blurriness to my images ?
Use a slower shutter speed !
I also want to keep some sharpness though , so the dancers are more recognizable .
To do this , I use flash at the same time .
The flash freezes the subjects enough to make them look good and then slow shutter speed and ambient light take over to add some movement .
What do you need to do this kind of thing ?
You can get by with any modern camera with a built - in flash , but to really have the flexibility that will make you happy you need the following things :
A camera with a hot shoe or PC jack and manual controls .
I use a Pentax K20D when I feel like lugging it out and a Canon G10 when I do n't .
. I use a Pentax K20D when I feel like lugging it out and a Canon G10 when I do n't .
An external flash .
I use an $ 80 Vivitar 285 hv which will work with anything , so no complaining about how your camera maker only sells $ 400 speedlights .
I use an $ 80 Vivitar 285 hv which will work with anything , so no complaining about how your camera maker only sells $ 400 speedlights .
A way to sync your flash with the camera .
Some of the more expensive flashes have a wireless mode .
If not , you can buy radio triggers for $ 60 or so , or buy a sync cable for $ 15 to $ 20 .
Trust me , having the flash off of the camera makes things so much easier .
The first step to getting this look is to figure out what kind of exposure you need with the flash alone to get a well - lit shot .
Turn your shutter speed down to the fastest it will sync ( 1/180th is usually fine ) and use trial and error to find a nice combination of aperture , ISO and flash power .
The actual numbers will depend on several things : how low the ceilings are , how powerful your flash is , etc .
Aim for the lowest flash power you can while still keeping a good exposure , a narrow enough aperture to make focusing easy , and modest ISO noise .
Once you figure it out you can probably keep those settings for the rest of the night , unless the ceilings are higher on one side of the room or something else equally annoying .
This is the step that adds the movement .
First , tone down your flash - only exposure by a half or whole stop .
Do this by reducing the ISO , aperture , or flash power ; any of those is fine .
Now that your photo is underexposed , turn off the flash .
It will probably be completely black now .
Do not touch the ISO or aperture to fix this .
Lengthen the shutter speed until you 're about two stops underexposed ; it will be blurry and dark as hell but this is what you want right now .
Turn the flash back on .
Do not touch any other settings – flip the switch on the flash and start shooting .
This will let the flash illuminate the subjects ( because you dialed in the power , ISO and aperture before and have n't changed them ) and the ambient fill in and add movement ( because you adjusted the shutter speed ) .
Your first few shots will probably be underexposed or overexposed and have too much or too little blur .
Do n't worry , it always takes me at least a half hour to start taking decent photos this way .
You really need to play with the settings as you go to find out what 's going to work for the lighting that night .
There are a couple of tricky parts to this style of shooting that I 'll mention .
First I 'll talk about the typical problems you 'll see right away .
More than one of these certainly might apply ; fix them one at a time .
If the background is dark or there is not enough blur , you need to use a longer shutter speed to let more ambient light in .
you need to use a longer shutter speed to let more ambient light in .
If the dancers are not sharp enough , you need more flash power .
Turn it up a little bit at a time .
you need more flash power .
Turn it up a little bit at a time .
If people 's shirts , faces and limbs are overexposed and not blurry , you need to turn down the flash .
Bring it down a bit by reducing the power , narrowing the aperture or reducing the ISO .
you need to turn down the flash .
Bring it down a bit by reducing the power , narrowing the aperture or reducing the ISO .
If shirts , faces and limbs are overexposed and blurry , you need to shorten the shutter speed to let less ambient light in .
I 'm warning you now , fixing one of these will probably fuck something else up .
It can be really infuriating , but if you slow down , stay calm and think through it logically you 'll be able to narrow it down and figure out what you need .
It 's a really good feeling when you finally nail it .
There are two other tricky problems that I 'm still working on myself :
Dances are unevenly lit .
When you walk over to the other side of the room to shoot , you 'll have to adjust the shutter speed to compensate for the different amount of ambient light .
You really only have a range of about half a stop where the ambient gives you the right amount of blur , so you have to be careful and stay on your toes .

Watch where you bounce .
In rooms with low ceilings , where you point the flash on the ceiling has a huge effect on the lighting .
You need to be conscious of what part of the ceiling you 're bouncing from to get good results .
I hope this post helped you out .
Even if you hate how my photos look and do n't want to make anything like them , at least it will show you what not to do .
I 'd love to hear comments or advice on what you like or do n't like , and what I could do better .
If you 've got questions I 'll do my best to answer them too !
Now go dance , have fun , and make beautiful photographs so we can all remember the fantastic events we make happen !
Due to the high cost of tilt - shift lenses and the demand for the miniature images they produce , programs like Photoshop and Gimp have made it possible for people to take any snapshot and , in theory , adjust its properties so as to render it toy - like .
The manipulated image has been given the rather obvious name of fake tilt - shift , which basically involves selective blurring to simulate a narrow depth of field .
As I said , in theory any snapshot in your album of photos could be made miniature , but Bitwalk , who has worked with this post - processing technique , recommends the following :
1 . The scene .
It ’s very important to pick a scene that the brain would take for a model .
Try to exclude people with extreme poses , certain vehicles that would n’t fit in etc .
2 . Angle .
Ideally I think it should look like you are looking down a display case .
So not too steep or shallow .
For those of you who not only lack the expendable income to buy a tilt - shift lens , but also the determination and time to transform your photos into models , tiltshift maker does the work for you .
In the meantime ,

ON TUESDAY March 17th , Russia announced that it would begin a comprehensive rearmament in response to the advance of NATO into parts of the former Soviet Union .
And earlier this month China said it would increase military spending by 14.9 % to some $ 70 billion this year , continuing double - digit growth that began in the 1990s .
But this pales in comparison with America 's mighty defence budget .
According to the latest comparable figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , America accounted for 45 % of the world 's military spending — $ 1.2 trillion in 2007 — more than the next 14 biggest countries combined .

The Strela 2M Russian satellite looked broadly similar to this one The collision between a US and Russian satellite in space highlights the growing importance of monitoring objects in orbit .
It also shows that there are still significant capability gaps in current systems set up for this task .
There are about 17,000 man-made objects above 10 cm in size that orbit Earth - and the tally is constantly increasing .
This in turn raises the risk of collisions between objects .
Richard Crowther , an expert on space debris and near - Earth objects , told BBC News : " It is unfortunate but inevitable , first that we would see such a collision in Low Earth orbit , and secondly - given the number of Iridium satellites in its constellation - more likely that the Iridium system would be affected rather than single satellite systems . "
The commercial Iridium satellites comprised a network of 66 spacecraft up until the accident .
According to Dr Crowther , from the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , the group also occupies " a very crowded altitude of low - Earth orbit " .
Nevertheless , some say the incident was extremely unusual .
Although there have been some near - misses and a few minor collisions , this is the first time two intact satellites have crashed into each other .
" Even with a constellation of 66 satellites , if you do the geometry there is still a huge amount of space , " said Patrick Wood , head of satellites at EADS - Astrium , Europe 's biggest space company .
The craft were travelling at thousands of kilometres per hour when they crashed into one another .
" They were travelling so fast , the timing of any collision would be extremely difficult to predict .
But also , the sheer probability of two spacecraft hitting each other is incredibly low , " Mr Wood explained .
Further threat But Richard Crowther says the debris could now threaten other Iridium satellites : " Unique to the Iridium system is that all the remaining 65 satellites in the constellation pass through the same region of space - at the poles .
" So the debris cloud that is forming as a result of the Iridium satellite breakup will present a debris torus of high ( spatial ) density at 90 degrees to the equator that all the surviving Iridium satellites will need to pass through . "
Intact satellites share Earth 's orbit with everything from spent rocket stages and spacecraft wreckage to paint flakes and dust .
There are some 17,000 man-made objects orbiting our planet
The diffuse mist of junk around our planet is the legacy of 51 years of human activity in space .
At orbital velocities , even small pieces of space debris can cause serious damage to spacecraft .
And both the Americans and Russians have networks of tracking stations to monitor objects .
The US military operates 25 centres around the world involved in space surveillance , including one at RAF Fylingdales in the UK .
Russia 's space surveillance facilities include an " Okno " optical tracking system near Nurek , Tajikistan , and a " Krona " long - range radar and optical tracking centre at Storozhevaya in south - west Russia .
China and the European Space Agency ( Esa ) are developing their own systems .
Experts would almost certainly have been tracking the orbits of these two spacecraft .
But in addition to the probability of a collision being vanishingly small , information on the positions of objects in space is only approximate , not exact .
Radars are generally used to track objects in low - Earth orbit , while optical telescopes are often used to observe objects further away from the Earth .
Radio frequency technology - a form of electronic surveillance - can be used to assess whether or not satellites are active .
This discipline is known as signals intelligence , or SIGINT for short .
An advanced ability to monitor space debris , satellites , near - Earth objects and solar activity is known as Space Situational Awareness ( SSA ) .
Many experts see this as a step to space traffic control .
But co-operation on such matters between countries are complicated by defence sensitivities .
Sharing data can betray the capabilities of a country 's sensors .
The latest incident has produced the worst field of space debris since China destroyed a defunct Fengyun 1 - C satellite with a missile in January 2007 .
That incident , designed to test an anti-satellite weapon system , produced more than 2,000 separate fragments of debris .
Risk assessment
On Christmas Eve , the US Air Force notified Esa that a European weather satellite called Metop might be threatened by a piece of debris from the Chinese A - Sat test .
Ultimately , no action was taken .
But the event highlighted Europe 's near - total reliance on the US military for knowing what is going on in space .
Nasa has said it considers the threat to the International Space Station ( ISS ) to be low , but that the orbiting outpost could carry out a collision avoidance manoeuvre if necessary .
The ISS flies at an altitude of about 350 km ( 220 miles ) , well below the point , some 790 km ( 490 miles ) up , where the Russian and US satellites collided .
But experts say the Hubble Space Telescope and Earth observation satellites at higher orbits and therefore closer to the collision point , could be at greater risk of damage .
" The problem we 've got is that there is a debris cloud which is in two slightly different orbits because of the spacecraft .
The challenge now is to accurately track that debris cloud , " said Patrick Wood .

India —
New research from Austria shows that a commercial strain of Monsanto - made GE corn causes mice to have fewer and weaker babies .
What is this doing to human fertility ?
Regulators around the world said Monsanto ’s GE corn was as safe as non-GE strains .
It has been approved in many countries and regions including the US , the EU , Argentina , Japan , Philippines and South Africa .
China approved the GE corn for animal feed back in 2005 .
Until this research , under the Austrian Ministries for Agriculture and Health , none of the regulators had seriously questioned the safety of Monsanto ’s GE corn .
The biotech industry is playing a game of genetic roulette with our food and with our health .
The major English newspapers all have editorials on Narendra Modi‘s brazen lie , without taking the name of China , that “ no one has intruded on Indian soil , nor is any one …

The DNA will tease out the differences between Neanderthals ( l ) and us ( r ) Scientists studying the DNA of Neanderthals say they can find no evidence that this ancient species ever interbred with modern humans .
But our evolutionary cousins may well have been able to speak as well as us , said Prof Svante Paabo from Germany 's Max Planck Institute .
He was speaking in Chicago , US , where he announced the " first draft " of a complete Neanderthal genome .
The genetics information has been gleaned from fossils found in Croatia .
Prof Svante Paabo confirmed that Neanderthals shared the FOXP2 gene associated with speech and language in modern humans .
A total of three billion " letters " , covering 60 % of the Neanderthal genome , have been sequenced by scientists from Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and 454 Life Sciences Corporation , in Branford , Connecticut .
The majority of the sequence comes from bones from Vindija Cave in Croatia .
The draft genome can give us clues to the genetic regions which make us " uniquely human " , Prof Paabo told BBC News .
" It was always a dream to look at the DNA of our closest evolutionary relatives .
" Now that we have the Neanderthal genome , we can look for areas in the human genome where a change seems to have swept rapidly through us since we separated from Neanderthals .
" There , something special may have happened in us .
The cool thing is , now that we have the whole genome , we can look for these changes without bias . "
Prof Paabo released details about the latest stage of his research at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) .
Tongue twister Neanderthals lived in Europe and parts of Asia until they became extinct about 30,000 years ago .
THE DNA MOLECULE
The double - stranded DNA molecule is held together by four chemical components called bases Adenine ( A ) bonds with thymine ( T ) ; cytosine ( C ) bonds with guanine ( G ) Groupings of these " letters " form the " code of life " ; there are 3.2 billion base - pairs in the Neanderthal genome Written in the DNA are genes , which cells use as starting templates to make proteins ; these sophisticated molecules build and maintain the body
They were the closest relatives of currently living humans , sharing between 99.5 % to 99.9 % of our DNA sequence .
Pinpointing the differences may reveal the crucial evolutionary changes that enabled modern humans to leave Africa and rapidly spread around the world , starting around 100,000 years ago .
Accordingly , Prof Paabo and his team have focused on genes of special interest in recent human evolution , such as FOXP2 , which is involved in speech and language .
Humans differ from chimpanzees at two key points in the FOXP2 gene .
But the preliminary results suggest that Neanderthals shared these same variations .
" There is no reason to believe they could n't speak like us , " said Prof Paabo .
" But of course there are many other genes involved in speech and language , so there are many more studies to be done . "
Breeds apart Since Neanderthals lived side by side with modern humans in Europe for many thousands of years , it has been speculated that we may have inherited some Neanderthal DNA in our genome today , thanks to interbreeding .
But Professor Paabo's team have found no evidence for this .
They focused on a gene implicated in brain development - microcephalin - 1 - which shows significant variation among present day humans .
It has been suggested that a particular variant of the gene , found commonly in Europeans , was contributed by Neanderthals .
But the Croatian Neanderthal fossils harboured an ancestral form of the microcephalin - 1 gene , which today is also found among Africans .
Overall , it seems that Neanderthals have contributed , at most , a " very limited " fraction of the variation found in contemporary human populations , said Prof Paabo .
" What is exciting now , is that we are beginning to look the other way - from early modern humans into Neanderthals . "
Professor Chris Stringer , from the Natural History Museum , London , UK , commented : " If the the Neanderthal genome data show little evidence of potential hybridisation , that would fit with my view from the fossil evidence that , while interbreeding was probably possible , it may have occurred only rarely , with trivial impact on modern humans .
" The populations had been separate for hundreds of thousands of years and I think there would have been significant physical and behavioural differences between them .
However , larger samples would be desirable to get a more complete picture , and hopefully those will follow soon . "
Dead end Prof Paabo said the team did not expect to find any clues which might help solve the riddle of the Neanderthals ' demise .
" I do n't think they became extinct due to something in their genome , " he said .
" It was clearly something in their interaction with the environment or with modern humans that caused them to be extinct .
" That will not be something you can see from their DNA sequence . "
And Prof Paabo was quick to pour cold water on any suggestion that the genome sequence would facilitate the cloning of a Neanderthal .
" We are talking about a very complex mammal , " said the 53 - year - old .
" I do n't think that technology will improve fast enough to make this possible in my lifetime .
" It is more in the realm of science fiction than science . "

One of Portland ’s customized
bike lane markings .
- Slideshow below -
( Photo : City of Portland )
2009 marks the 10th anniversary of a proud Portland tradition : our creatively modified bike lane pavement markings or what I like to call , “ bike lane guys ” .
The “ unlikely cycling hero ” who started the tradition in 1999 — according to Portlander Jim Waigand , who has documented the phenomenon since 2003 — is former City employee Todd Roberts .
In an article published in VeloVision Magazine in September 2003 , Waigand uncovered the fascinating story behind the practice .
( I ’ve uploaded that article as a PDF with permission from the publisher .
You can download it here . )
According to Waigand , Roberts ( who thinks cycling is “ boring as hell ” ) said he did it at first because he was “ just screwin ’ with my boss , seeing what I could get away with . ”
Roberts had a triangular piece of thermoplastic material left over from a job and made it into a hat .
His supervisor said “ looks good , ” and the tradition was born .
These days , Kirstin Byer is the City ’s chief of pavement markings .
She was featured in a 2005 documentary about the bike lane characters created by Portlander Joe Biel ( of Microcosm Publishing fame ) called Martinis in the Bike Lane .

I met Waigand several years ago in his Northeast Portland home .
He documents the markings by snapping photos and keeping an updated spreadsheet of their location .
The markings are constantly being paved over , so Waigand ’s photos are a valuable part of Portland ’s urban lore .
I ’ve scanned several of Waigand ’s photos , along with a few from the City of Portland archives which you can see below .
As Waigand said in his 2003 VeloVision article , “ these Portland bike lane signs add a welcome touch of humanity . ”
I agree , and I hope it ’s a tradition that continues for at least another 10 years .

Neck measurements could help estimate risk Measuring the thickness of a person 's neck may provide as many clues to their risk of developing heart problems as measuring their waist , a study says .
Researchers from the Framingham Heart Study found even those with relatively trim waistlines appeared to be at greater risk if they had larger necks .
Risk was defined as having lower levels of " good " cholesterol for instance , or higher levels of blood glucose .
The results were presented to a meeting of the American Heart Association .
The US team looked at more than 3,300 women and men with an average age of 51 .
Professor Jimmy Bell of the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre said research was starting to uncover ever more evidence that health depended not on how fat a person was , but where their fat was located .
What you do n't want is fat around your liver or heart , and this can happen even if you look fine on the outside
Professor Jimmy Bell
MRC Clinical Sciences Centre
In this study , average neck circumferences were 40.5 cm for men and 34.2 cm for women .
As neck circumference grew , so did risk factors .
For every nearly - 3 cm more of neck , men had 2.2 milligrams of less good cholesterol per decilitre of blood ( mg/dl ) and women 2.7mg / dl .
Good cholesterol - or high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) - takes cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver , where it is broken down .
Having lower than 40 mg / dl if you are a man , and 50 mg / dl if you are a woman is thought to put you at higher risk of heart disease .
Neck size made no difference to levels of bad cholesterol - or low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) - which can cause harm , but it did affect blood glucose levels - for every 3 cm more of neck men had 3.0 mg / dl more and women 2.1mg / dl .
A normal fasting blood glucose level is below 100 mg / dl - and an increased level is thought to be an accurate indicator of heart problems to come .
While risk was higher regardless of waistline , it was compounded for those who had both a fat neck and who were larger than average around the middle .
The team speculated that a fat neck may be a " crude measure " of upper body fat - which has been associated with heart risks .
Professor Bell added : " What you do n't want is fat around your liver or heart , and this can happen even if you look fine on the outside .
Dieting is n't what you need to shift this - it 's exercise . "

RBS has to be rescued by the government in November Two local authority pension funds have told the BBC they are suing Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) for compensation .
The Merseyside and North Yorkshire funds accuse RBS of withholding the extent of the bank 's problems before its government rescue last year .
They will be represented by Cherie Booth QC , wife of Tony Blair .
The legal action against RBS , which has declined to comment , has been launched in the US .
Other UK pension funds are said to be considering joining them .
Stephen Everard , managing director of class actions specialists Goal Group , thinks they should .
" Local authorities not participating in US class actions such as the RBS case risk losing out on a massive opportunity to seek compensation and plug their escalating pension gap , " he said .
But others are less sure .
" RBS is likely to object to English or European investors being included as claimants in a US class action , on the basis that the US courts do not have jurisdiction to hear those disputes , " predicted Guy Pendell , litigation partner at city law firm CMS Cameron McKenna .
Share collapse RBS gained an extra £ 12bn from shareholders following the conclusion of a successful share issue in June of last year .
The purpose of the litigation from the side of Merseyside Pension Fund is to hold management to account
Peter Wallach , head of the Merseyside Pension Fund
Yet just five months later in November , the bank needed to accept a £ 20bn rescue package from the government in exchange for a 58 % stake in the bank , which was subsequently increased to 68 % .
The then RBS bosses , led by Sir Fred Goodwin , have subsequently stood down from the bank .
At the same time , the firm 's share price has collapsed , down from 243 pence immediately after the June share issue to the current 22.5 p .
Public interest Peter Murphy , a partner at Sackers , a specialist pension law firm , said that the US legal system was better suited to this type of claim .
" US lawyers act on a ' no win , no fee ' basis and plaintiffs do not have to pay for the other side 's legal costs even if they lose , " he said .
However , he expressed surprise that Ms Booth was involved in the case .
" Her profile is mainly in UK and European human rights law , not US securities litigation .
But that is not to say she does n't have relevant expertise , " he said .
" Her involvement in the case will certainly add greater public interest to an already high - profile media event . "
Moreover , added Mr Pendell : " UK shareholders may seek to pursue these claims in the US because it is perceived to be a more claimant - friendly forum . , but that does not necessarily mean that the US should or will assume jurisdiction of the claim . "
' Inaccurate ' Peter Wallach , the head of the Merseyside Pension Fund , said he wished to ascertain whether statements made by the former RBS bosses before the share issue and subsequent government rescue " were in any way inaccurate or misleading to shareholders " .
" The purpose of the litigation from the side of Merseyside Pension Fund is to hold management to account , " he said .
" Our concern is that perhaps management did n't indicate to shareholders the full extent of the deterioration in the bank 's finances when it first came to shareholders for additional capital . "
The legal action has come in the shape of a US class action civil lawsuit , which enables a number of complainants to join together and make one , collective claim .
Mr Wallach added that the case was being taken on a no - win , no - fee basis , so there was no risk to its pension holders .
The North Yorkshire Pension Fund website says it covers employees of the county council , district councils within the region , police , fire service , universities and colleges , national parks and Yorkshire Tourist Board , among others .

" ... the most populous colonies ... are provided by queens ... in the year following their birth . "
Brother Adam
Skeptic :
Thank you for sitting down to tell us about the MythBusters pyramid power experiments .
1
Byron :
My pleasure .
That episode was quite awhile ago so I had to wrack my brain …
I ’m like , “ Oh God !
Okay wait a minute ! ” [ Laughs ]
Skeptic :
I was trying to figure out how long ago that would ’ve been for you …
Byron :
Well , for us , that was a long time ago .
Well over a year .
It was such an odd one , and it lasted a really long time because we were having a hard time getting concrete results that you could show to these people and be like , “ Look !
It does n’t work ! ”
Skeptic :
I guess the first question is , why bother with all that hassle ?
Why test it ?
Byron :
For our show , we work with urban legends and myths , and , strangely , people really still believe in this pyramid power stuff .
I do n’t know if it ’s because they ca n’t explain how the pyramids got there , how they were built ?
There ’s always some sort of fascination with this mysticism of pyramids .
But , as long as people believe these things we have to test them .
Going in we knew it was “ oogie boogie , ” 2 we knew we were going into something really nuts .
But , y’know , people believe it , so we ’re going to test it .
Skeptic :
Of course , that ’s Skeptic ’s whole reason to exist .
Byron :
Exactly !
Skeptic :
So , it ’s an oogie - boogie topic .
Were you able to go into it with an open mind ?
That would be a challenge for a lot of people .
Byron :
It was really , really hard to go in with an open mind , because I instinctively do n’t believe these sorts of things .
But , my science teacher said that if I ’m going to try to be a good scientist I have to walk in without prejudgments and just let the results do the speaking for me .
Skeptic :
Just like on CSI .
Byron :
Just like CSI !
Skeptic :
So , how did you go about it ?
How did you test pyramid power ?
Byron :
We did a lot of internet research , we read a lot of books , and we took the designs that were most commonly believed to be something that worked — the measurement of the tomb , where the king sat in the pyramid — and we used those exact measurements .
The pyramids have to be in a certain axis .
We did everything to the letter as far as our pyramid design .
And then , in the back of a lot of magazines , you can actually order little pyramid kits .
So we ordered a kit , and used their design , because they claimed that it could keep your razor sharp forever if you bought this kit .
And it was just a bunch of copper tubing and some little corners , like a Tinker Toy set .
Skeptic :
What do you suppose the mark up is on those kits ?
Byron :
The ones which probably had , like , five dollars of copper tubing — somewhere between thirty - eighty and fifty dollars , I believe , is what we spent on them .
Skeptic :
Capitalism at work !
Byron :
It was great .
It was really fun actually seeing the instructions and seeing the box it came in .
It was so ghetto !
Come on , “ Keeps your razors sharp forever ” ?
Then we looked at what people commonly tried to test these things on .
We picked milk , we picked an apple , we picked a flower , because we did n’t want to use raw meat .
A lot of people use raw meat .
We work in the shop every day .
We did n’t want to smell raw meat !
We thought maybe a raw apple we could begin with .
Even that was just disgusting .
Skeptic :
I remember the milk maggots .
Ugh .
Byron :
I know !
That gave me the creepy crawlies for the longest time .
I was so glad when it was over .
Skeptic :
What were the limits of your experiments ?
Do they allow us to say anything with confidence about pyramid power ?
Skeptic :
We were super limited on time and our sample size .
Making the show , we ca n’t spend a really long time on these questions or truly give them the proper , thorough , diligent scientific experiments we want to .
But we do what we can .
So we ended up doing this one for months and months .
It ended up just staying in the back of the shop .
We kept going back to it .
But our sample size was also very small .
We would have liked to do a much bigger sample size , but we just did n’t have the room .
So did what we could and decided to try to take some conclusions from that .
Skeptic :
With those limits , do you think we can generalize from your results ?
Byron :
I felt comfortable generalizing because the results seemed really obvious to me : the apple was n’t drying out , it was rotting ; the milk was rotting ; the flower was rotting …
And I took half of the razor an electron microscope and we looked at it up close and it did n’t look like it had gotten any sharper or stayed sharp in the least .
Even the ones we used on Tory , they tore his face to pieces !
They were obviously not staying sharp .
I would n’t say definitively we proved it , but generally , I believe we proved it .
Skeptic :
You ’re replicating a long history of larger experiments going back to the seventies ; to the very dawn of the idea .
Your findings are consistent .
So the question : is pyramid power bogus ?
Byron :
If you ’re asking me personally , I believe pyramid power is bogus .
I do n’t think it ’s true whatsoever .
I ’ve had a chance to even be inside those pyramids , I ’ve walked through them .
I did n’t feel any immense power .
Skeptic :
Did your consciousness expand ?
Or your sexual potency increase ?
3
Byron :
Not that I have seen so far .
I think I walked out the same girl I walked in .
Except , y’know , the hallways are really , really short — so , I might have walked out an inch shorter .
[ Laughs ]
Skeptic :
I spoke with Max Toth , the pyramid author to whose book you guys referred for the episode .
He told me he still has “ no doubts , ” all these years later .
To him , pyramid power is real .
Why do you think people believe this stuff ?
Byron :
Well , the world is a really hard place to explain , and there are so many things that we ca n’t explain just yet .
I think it ’s easier to have faith or put the idea of magic on something because you do n’t have to prove it if it ’s magic .
I think it ’s just a lot easier on the noggin to assume rather than to come up with some empirical evidence and discover the answers for yourself .
Skeptic :
Do you have any advice for , y’know , science fair kids attempting to replicate these experiments ?
Byron :
I would say to be as diligent as possible with the details .
There are a lot of specific details that — it could drive you insane ! — if you do n’t want to get criticized , you need to go and look for the details and try to follow them to the letter .
For example , we had a guy come in to sing for the “ Breaking the Glass ” episode , and he walked past our pyramids and said , “ Oh , you know what ?
I believe in these and your pyramids are too close together !
Their energies are crossing over ! ”
If you want to satisfy people , follow as many of the esoteric rules as possible .
And : sample sizes as big as you can possibly handle in your space !
Skeptic :
Do you think that you can ever satisfy the critics ?
Byron :
No , I honestly do n’t think you can .
I think people are very , very stubborn — I know I am — and when you believe something , you will find the results to support what you believe .
Skeptic :
“ Confirmation bias , ” they call that .
Byron :
Yeah , exactly .
Skeptic :
Can you remember some more of the criticisms that came in ?
I know you ’re thinking back a year …
Byron :
There are so many different sorts of designs and ideas on what is the proper way to do this …
Skeptic :
I noticed you guys were using disposable stainless steel blades , while some people will say the effect will only work with blue steel Gillette blades from back in the day .
Byron :
Exactly !
What we heard is that the atoms were supposed to , like , realign … I do n’t understand why it would be one blade over another .
We did get some criticism on the materials we used to make the pyramids .
Some people believed wood , some people believed copper , you know ?
It ’s like most [ paranormal claims ] …
There ’s so much information .
People who really believe in it are going to find something wrong with what you do no matter what .
Skeptic :
Okay , say you ’re a science fair kid .
You do an experiment — something like the MythBusters one — and you find that , for example , the half apple you placed under a pyramid rots slower than the half you left in the open .
What do you conclude from that ?
What ’s your advice to the kid who comes across an anomalous finding like the one you guys had on the show ?
4
Byron :
Do n’t settle for the obvious .
Never stop asking the questions !
You need to check your controls , you need to check the environment , you need to make sure the apple you ’re using was cut with something sterile ( as Tory found out ! 5 ) .
You ’re going to have to try more than one apple !
You definitely need to ask all of the questions : what makes the placement of this apple different from another apple ?
Is this one getting more sunlight ?
Is this one near something that makes it more likely that bacteria will attack it ?
You have to ask more questions .
Unfortunately , with science , usually when you start finding an answer to a question , it ’s actually just going to be a bunch more questions .
Skeptic :
Turning to general background :
How did you get hooked up with MythBusters ?
Byron :
A lot of dumb luck .
I ’m a sculptor , and Jamie had a man working in his space that was doing special effects .
My friend ’s like , “ You will love this place !
It ’s like a wet dream !
You need to come check out this warehouse . ”
So he took me in there and I was drop - jawed !
It was like , “ Ah ! Look at all this stuff ! ”
Skeptic :
That ’s about the coolest studio in the world .
Byron :
Amazing !
At the time , I had so many weird jobs .
I was , like , delivering roses , I was a secret martini taster , I was a receptionist , I was just lost , trying to find myself .
And all of a sudden I was like , “ Wait , you can do this for a living ? ”
And so I just started showing up at Jamie ’s shop until he forgot I did n’t work there .
I worked for free for a really long , long time as an “ intern . ”
I ’m way too old to be an intern .
I was out of school , and it just happened to be that MythBusters started filming at the same time that I started working with Jamie .
Jamie and Adam and I all hit it off , and Peter , 6 we all really hit it off .
I would help out behind the scenes with their experiments just for heck of it .
Help hold the weather balloons when Lawnchair Larry was going up and — that sort of thing .
Then all of a sudden they needed a Byron backside for the “ Airplane Toilet ” episode…7
Skeptic :
Ah ! [ Laughs ]
Byron :
Jamie took me in his office and he ’s like , “ Well , you know , I … this is a strange thing to ask , and I do n’t want you to think anything weird … ” I wanted Jamie to hire me so bad , I was like , “ Yes !
Yes !
Whatever it is — yes !
I will ! ” I sucked up the humiliation .
I ’m a little bit shy !
So they did a 3 - D scan of my … my rear end , and … um …
I was learning a sculptural computer tool you can make 3 - D models with .
It ’s called the Free Form Machine .
Jamie let me take the 3 - D scan of my butt , and I expanded the derriere and I put in some dimples and the whole bit , and we lowered it onto the toilet .
It was such a fun thing and I was just kind of in the background .
Then , the opportunity came up : because MythBusters is so involved , they needed more help .
They just said , “ Hey !
You wanna start being in front of the camera ? ”
And I said , “ Hell , yeah ! ”
Skeptic :
When I was spoke to Jamie last February , 8 he told me how over capacity the shop is , between the special effects work and the show .
Byron :
Oh , definitely .
Each one of these episodes takes so much work .
It ’s not like a reality show where you ’re just filming a day and then that ’s the episode .
We could take up to three weeks on one of these .
Viewers get to see the “ Best Of ” moments , but there ’s a lot of boring footage of us just doing trials and experiments !
I tested Buster ’s bones for three days to establish the proper breaking strength .
I mean , three days !
By the third day my eyes were falling out of my head .
It was just crazy .
But , it looks like we just found it right away .
Skeptic :
[ Laughs ]
Well that ’s because you guys are all such intrepid builders !
You go straight for the right solution every time !
Byron :
Oh , of course !
We never screw up !
Skeptic :
When I interviewed Adam , 9 he emphasized the instructiveness of screw - ups for the audience — that one theme of the show is that science is extremely messy .
The answers are always murky , and the questions are always trickier than you thought .
Byron :
Always !
Anything that seems simple is usually going to be the one that kills ya !
That ’s the one that ’s gonna take the longest , and it ’s gonna be the hardest !
I mean , “ Toast Drop ” ?
Are you kidding me ?
Skeptic :
That ’s one Adam mentioned in particular .
Byron :
That seems like such an easy one !
How long did that take ?
Skeptic :
It seems extremely straightforward !
But those were awfully complicated toast - dropping machines .
Due to that whole long process of getting mixed up with MythBusters , you ’re now a celebrity and a role model for young women in science .
How ’s that for you ?
Byron :
At first it made me nervous .
But I started thinking about it and now I really enjoy the idea for the fact that I was never a straight - A science student — at all .
I was very intimidated and really shy about it , and guess a lot of girls are .
It ’s nice to show them that you do n’t have to be a Brainiac .
You do n’t have to be a straight - A student , you do n’t have to have a thousand degrees to play with science : you just have to ask questions .
I like the idea that it might make girls try to be interested , or take the big dark cloud off of it that you have to be a genius to be involved in science .
Skeptic :
Now , celebrity has a flipside .
I ’ve noticed that you have this kinda huge cult following on the Internet .
Is that all bad ?
Or partly good ?
Or … how ’s that ?
Byron :
Um … it ’s definitely amusing .
It ’s kind of weird .
Especially because my mom loves the Internet …
Sometimes it ’s a little embarrassing , because I know she ’s reading some of these things .
I generally try not to … I try not to read any of that .
It ’s all so bizarre !
And … I mean as long as … I do n’t care about any of that .
As long as they ’re not saying anything scary , I ’m fine with it .
Skeptic :
Fair enough .
Do you have more sympathy for the Britney Spears ’ of the world now ?
Byron :
Um … I ’d like to say yes … but , not really .
With the kind of money those people make ?
Forget about it !
I really have n’t had … I do n’t have the kind of celebrity that I think those people do .
Most people do n’t approach me .
I occasionally get somebody walking up to me , in hardware stores mostly , but they just usually say , “ I love the show ” and it ’s more of a compliment .
It ’s always been really nice .
I have n’t had anything , so far — knock on wood — anything weird or stalkery .
Skeptic :
That ’s a relief to hear .
Now , how about your fine art practice ?
10
How has that been affected by the celebrity that comes from the show ?
Byron :
In such a cool city 11 , everybody says they do n’t have a television .
I know they ’re lying , ’ cause they all know the plotline of Lost .
But , they do n’t want to admit they watch TV .
So , I have n’t really gotten more people buying sculptures or anything like that .
It ’s still the same old people that come to my art shows .
One thing that MythBusters has affected is my time .
It is a really grueling schedule !
We ’re up early .
We stay late .
Or sometimes weekends .
And it ’s really hard to come home after a day of building things and go in and start doing sculpture which is almost the same thing I was doing all day !
I find myself really forcing myself to go in sometimes and just initiate starting a project .
It ’s definitely slowed down .
I used to spend all day doing that kind of thing , and now it ’s become more of a weekend thing .
Or , sometimes at night for stress relief .
Skeptic :
I can see that you might max out your inspiration by the end of the day .
It ’s like that .
Byron :
Sometimes I come home and I just want to just lay around and do nothing !
Skeptic :
Well , yeah , you and me both .
That ’s how I learn all the plotlines of Lost .
Byron :
Yeah , exactly !
Skeptic :
Alright , let me ask you about skepticism .
How interested are you in skepticism , or the skeptical literature ?
Byron :
Adam and Peter , they leave Skeptic magazine in the bathroom .
I enjoy reading them during filming breaks because I ’ve always been someone who loves hearing conspiracy theories …
I love the attitude of skepticism .
It ’s a lot of fun to read !
It ’s sort of that , like , fighting attitude — it ’s just the American way !
Skeptic :
Well , thank you very much for providing some background for Junior Skeptic .
I should probably let you get back to your grueling schedule .
Thanks for taking the time to talk to us .
Byron :
Thanks , Daniel !
It was great talking with you .
Let me know if you need anything else !
Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine researchers have discovered that adult animals with hearing loss actually re-route the sense of touch into the hearing parts of the brain .
In the study , published online in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the week of March 23 , the team reported a phenomenon known as cross-modal plasticity in the auditory system of adult animals .
Cross -modal plasticity refers to the replacement of a damaged sensory system by one of the remaining ones .
In this case , the sense of hearing is replaced with touch .
About 15 percent of American adults suffer from some form of hearing impairment , which can significantly impact quality of life , especially in the elderly .
“ One often learns , anecdotally , that ‘ grandpa ’ simply turned off his hearing aid because it was confusing and no longer helped .
Our study indicates that hearing deficits in adult animals result in a conversion of their brain ’s sound processing centers to respond to another sensory modality , making the interpretation of residual hearing even more difficult , ” said principal investigator Alex Meredith , Ph.D. , a professor in the VCU Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology .
“ Whether this becomes a positive feedback cycle of increasing hearing difficulty is currently under investigation , but these findings raise the possibility that even mild hearing loss in adult humans can have serious and perhaps progressive consequences , ” Meredith said .
The findings provide researchers and clinicians with insight into how the adult brain retains the ability to re-wire itself on a large scale , as well as the factors that may complicate treatment of hearing loss with hearing aids or cochlear implants .
The study was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health .
Meredith worked with postdoctoral fellows Brian L. Allman and Leslie P. Keniston , both in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology .
Pittsburgh Gets Federal Stimulus Dollars for Green Projects
March 31st , 2009 by Dave Tyler
Pittsburgh ’s plans to make itself into a hotbed for solar power and other green technology got a metaphorical fist bump last week with the visit of two cabinet secretaries to announce funding from the federal stimulus package .
[ social_buttons ]
Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced $ 11 million green stimulus funding during their trip .
They also toured a welding and heating and air conditioning training facility at Allegheny County Community College , where officials showed off the skills needed for energy efficient projects .
Allegheny County will get $ 8.1 million , City of Pittsburgh will receive $ 3.4 million out of a $ 3.2 billion pot being divvied up around the country .
Pittsburgh has been studying ways to boost its solar use .
While both Alleghany County Executive Dan Onorato and Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl say they will be examining uses for the money , they both said they hope to use it quickly .
Unlike a lot of the stimulus package , the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette points out , these energy grants go directly to counties and cites , rather than the state .
“ That allows us to be creative , ” Onorato told the paper .
It ’s not immediately clear if that creativity will extend to Ravenstahl ’s push for solar in the town .
But as a Solar City designee , Pittsburgh is pushing to prove that solar power can thrive in places other than the sun belt .
That includes developing a green jobs training center and a grant to Pittsburgh Plate Glass to develop solar panel windows that has drawn some fire .
But if these efforts create synergy , the Steel City could be on to something .

Bloomberg 's interview with Adobe 's Shantanu Narayen reveals that Adobe is developing Flash for the iPhone , it 's been in development since June 2008 , and is a customized solution just for the iPhone .

Apple has said repeatedly that regular desktop Flash is too heavy ( on CPU , and thus battery life ) for the iPhone , whereas Flash Lite is too lousy .
Jobs has coerced Adobe to create a custom solution .
From Narayan 's words of " the ball is in our court .
The onus is on us to deliver , " the engineering effort lies more in Adobe 's engineering team than in Apple's .
Adobe actually said , back in September ' 08 , that there would be a version released " in a very short time " if Apple approved it .
Obviously either Apple rejected it , or Adobe themselves decided it was n't quite resource - friendly enough to launch .

Bugs that skate on water can do it because their feet are " superhydrophobic . "
Chinese scientists applied a similar coating to a tiny copper mesh boat , and suddenly it could hold three times the weight .
Advertisement
It 's actually crazy :
The superhydrophobic coating — what the scientists are casually calling " the cooperative effect of hierarchical micro / nanostructures and a low - surface - energy wax coating " — creates a cushion of air around the boat ( or the bug 's leg ) , putting an invisible bubble between it and the water .
The boat is literally floating on air , while the water tries to touch it but can't .
What 's creepy is that the coated boats sink immediately when immersed in organic liquids like ethanol and acetone .
Now that these scientists discovered ways to make super - buoyant objects , what can be done ?
They predict a new era of " novel superfloating and drag - reducing aquatic devices , " by which they mean , either cybernetic death from the sea , or the biggest , sleekest , craziest yacht you 'll ever only see pictures of because you wo n't even know people who know people who will be able to afford it .

Two weeks ago , the world woke to the grim reminder that fringe terrorists in Northern Ireland still put fanaticism before innocent lives .
These brutal acts , so devastating in their impact on the families of those murdered , have led the people and politicians of Northern Ireland to stand as one against any return of the terrorist threat .
We should be under no illusion , however , that the biggest security threat to our country and other countries is the murderous agents of hate that work under the banner of al - Qaida .
We know that there is an al - Qaida core in northern Pakistan trying to organise attacks in Britain .
We know also that there are a number of networks here and as the head of MI5 reported recently : " There is no cause for complacency ; there is plenty of activity and the threat level remains at severe . "
It is a measure of the challenge we face - but also our success in dealing with it - that in the last two years more than 80 terrorists who planned to kill British citizens have been convicted and are now behind bars , some under the measures we have brought in since 2001 .
Al - Qaida terrorists remain intent on inflicting mass casualties without warning , including through suicide bombings .
They are motivated by a violent extremist ideology based on a false reading of religion and exploit modern travel and communications to spread through loose and dangerous global networks .
We must remain vigilant at all times .
On Tuesday , we will publish our updated counterterrorism strategy , showing why this vigilance remains so vital and showing also the success we have had , thanks to the hard work of the thousands of brave , skilled and dedicated people working to keep us safe , investigating terrorist activities , stopping them and bringing those responsible to justice .
Of the 80 terrorists now behind bars , half of them pleaded guilty .
We know this is hitting terrorists ' morale as well as disrupting more than a dozen plots that could have caused hundreds of deaths .
The approach we are taking tackles the immediate threat through the relentless pursuit of terrorists and disruption of their plots , builds up our defences against attacks and our resilience to deal with them , and addresses the longer term causes - understanding what leads people to become radicalised , so we can stop the process .
Across all these strands , our response must be international , national and local .
At the national level , we have built the strongest - ever counterterrorist framework , with investment rising from £ 1bn in 2001 to £ 3.5 bn in 2011 .
At our borders , we have brought in improved electronic checks , excluded more than 150 people from Britain on national security grounds since 2005 and toughened our approach to refusing entry to extremists .
We have better protection of crowded places , major buildings and our transport system and we are setting out a new approach to the risk that terrorists will abuse modern technology to mount chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear attacks .
Over recent years , we have set up a national security committee involving the heads of agencies and the armed forces , and a national security forum bringing in the best outside experts .
We have built up not only our national policing capability but also counterterrorist police in the regions .
But today , not only the police and security and intelligence officers , and our armed forces , but also the emergency services , local councils , businesses , and community groups are involved in state - of - the - art civil contingency planning .
Tens of thousands of men and women throughout Britain - from security guards to store managers - have now been trained and equipped to deal with an incident and know what to watch for as people go about their daily business in crowded places such as stations , airports , shopping centres and sports grounds .
This is not just about training and equipping professionals , however .
I believe that the better we inform the public , the more vigilant the public will be .
And there is a duty on all of us - government , parliament , and civic society - to stand up to people who advocate violence and preach hate , to challenge their narrow and intolerant ideology - in public meetings , in universities , in schools and online .
This is also a global challenge and Britain is at the forefront of international co-operation - from helping Pakistan investigate the murder of Benazir Bhutto to the work of our armed forces in Afghanistan and , in the longer term , our aid programme and our support for conflict - prevention and stabilisation .
In 2001 , al - Qaida were based in Afghanistan .
While they are still active there , core al - Qaida has shifted across the border into Pakistan .
More than two - thirds of the plots threatening the UK are linked to Pakistan .
Together with the new US administration , we are developing a strategy to tackle the terrorist threat across the region , the underlying causes , the extremist madrasas and the lawless spaces in which terrorists recruit or train .
A vital part of this is building up the security forces of Afghanistan and Pakistan , with the support of our own armed forces , so they can take on more of this responsibility for themselves , an approach I discuss frequently with Presidents Karzai and Zardari , urging closer co-operation between their countries .
As the threats we face are changing rapidly , we can never assume that the established way of doing things will be enough .
We will always make the necessary changes , whether through greater investment , changes to our laws or reforms to the way we do things , to ensure that Britain is protected .
And at all times , the responsibility remains the same - protecting the security of all and safeguarding the rights and freedoms of the individual .
I outlined to Parliament last week the steps we are taking to make absolutely clear that we meet the highest standards , continuing to condemn unequivocally the use of torture , never torturing nor ever asking others to torture for us .
Terrorism threatens the rights that all in this country should hold dear , including the most fundamental human right of all - the right to life .
We know that terrorists will keep on trying to strike and that protecting Britain against this threat remains our most important job .
I believe that this updated strategy , recognised by our allies to be world - leading in its wide - ranging nature , leaves us better prepared and strengthened in our ability to ensure all peace - loving people of this country can live normally , with confidence and free from fear .
We 've been waiting for Dragon Quest IX for a long time .
For most of us , we can wait a little longer for the game to come out , but not Japanese actress Keiko Awaji .
For her , it 's a matter of life or death .
Japanese film actress Keiko Awaji , now in her 70s , wants to play new Dragon Quest and pronto .
Awaji , who has appeared in over 160 movies since 1949 including Akira Kurosawa 's police noir Stray Dog , said this about DQ , " I wo n't live forever .
I 'd like to play two or three more games ...
I really want them to put out a new game once every two years . "
Do n't we all Awaji - san , do n't we all .

Awaji is a big fan of role - playing games , including Final Fantasy , Dragon Quest and Mother ( known in the West as Earthbound ) .
Dragon Quest IX was originally dated for 2007 .
In August of that year , Square Enix changed the game 's release date to 2008 .
Last fall , Square Enix dated the game " March 2009 . "
Square Enix announced last month that the game 's release date has been changed to July 11 .

Comparison of six views of homosexuality with regard to : Main biblical message
Does a homosexual orientation exist ?
Incidence of homosexuality Sponsored link .
The six viewpoints , from : " Condemnation " -- the most conservative and traditional -- to " Liberation " -- the most liberal -- are actually stereotypes .
They do n't necessarily fit the opinions of individuals .
Many people will hold beliefs that combine more than one viewpoint .
Presenting data in this way emphasizes that there are more sets of beliefs than the two extreme views that one hears so often in the media .
One sentence description ( repeated ) : Viewpoint Description or main emphasis " Abomination " Homosexuality is profoundly immoral at all times .
" Change is expected " Homosexuals can change their sexual orientation , with effort " Celibacy is expected " Homosexuals must either change or be celibate .
" Marginally acceptable " Committed homosexual relationships are the least awful option .
" Equality " Seek equal rights .
Homosexuality , is morally neutral .
" Liberation " Reinterpret the Bible .
Homophobia , not being lesgay , is the main evil .
Main biblical message : Viewpoint
What the Bible says about homosexuality " Abomination " Genesis 19 describes that God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah because of their homosexuality .
Leviticus 18:22 states that homosexual behavior is an abomination .
Leviticus 20:13 is similar , and adds a compulsory death sentence to the offender .
Judges 19 discusses the near extermination of the tribe of Benjamin because of their homosexual desires .
Deuteronomy and Kings state that there shall be no sodomites allowed in Israel .
Romans 1:26 - 27 says that homosexuality -- both by men and women -- is unnatural and a perversion .
1 Corinthians 6:9-10 says that homosexual behavior is such a serious sin that anyone who commits it cannot enter heaven .
1 Timothy 1:9-10 considers homosexuality on a par with murdering ones parents .
Jude 7 refers back to the homosexual sin in Sodom .
The Bible is totally consistent : homosexuality is a profound sin , worthy of capital punishment , which will prevent a person from attaining heaven .
However , 1 Corinthians 6:11 holds out hope for the homosexual .
If they will repent of their sins and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior , they will be cured and become heterosexual .
" Change is expected " While accepting the " Abomination " viewpoint that the Bible condemns all homosexual behavior , this group emphasizes the message in 1 Corinthians 6:11 : that a homosexual can be cured by becoming saved .
The important message of the Bible is thus for homosexuals to become saved , to seek help from reparative therapists or transformational ministries , to terminate their homosexual lifestyle and to become heterosexual .
This group heavily supports therapists and ministries in their work to cure homosexuality " Celibacy is expected "
The Bible clearly condemns homosexual behavior .
Homosexuality is , without exception , a major sin .
The message for the homosexual is to seek a cure so that they can become heterosexuals .
If therapy and / or prayer fail , as it almost always does , then the message of the Bible is for the homosexual to leave the gay lifestyle , decide to become sexually inactive , and be celibate for the rest of their life .
" Marginally acceptable " The Bible does take a negative view towards homosexual behavior .
The Bible states that all " ... homosexual practices are unnatural and Godless . "
2
But the authors of the Bible had limited knowledge of homosexuality .
The Bible is silent on the topic of sexual orientation .
In particular , it does not describe committed , loving , same - sex relationships .
Thus , we have a slight degree of freedom in determining what is moral behavior for such couples .
" Equality "
The genocide of Sodom described in Genesis 19 was motivated by the inhabitants ' uncharitable treatment of strangers and uncaring attitude towards the poor .
Homosexual rape is condemned .
But this is unrelated to same - sex behavior in a loving relationship .
Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 condemn cultic homosexual behavior in a Pagan temple .
They are part of the Holiness Code , and are not binding on Christians today .
Judges 19 is a reworked version of Genesis 19 , and contains no additional information about homosexual behavior .
The Deuteronomy and Kings passages are mistranslations in the King James Version of the Bible ; the passages refer to prostitution , not to homosexual behavior .
Romans 1:26 - 27 condemns heterosexuals who depart from Christianity , embrace Paganism , worship idols , and act against their nature by engaging in homosexual behavior .
1 Corinthians 6:9-10 is somewhat ambiguous , but apparently refers to men who sexually abuse boys , and is unrelated to consensual homosexual behavior in a committed relationship .
1 Timothy 1:9-10 carries the same ambiguous message as 1 Corinthians .
Jude 7 refers back to the attempted rape of angels in Sodom -- again unrelated to consensual homosexual behavior .
1 Corinthians 6:11 does hold out hope that sinners can be reformed and sanctified .
However , this would seem to refer to child molesters deciding to abandon their criminal .
abusive practices .
The Bible does condemn certain certain specific sexual sins between persons of the same sex .
Those are still considered immoral , and even criminal , today by almost everyone .
But it delivers no moral message about private , consensual same - sex activity by a committed , loving couple .
The Bible does talk extensively about the spiritually elevating and civilizing power of love .
It discusses the need for justice and freedom for all .
To deprive persons of elementary rights , including the right to marry , because they happen to have an unchosen and unchangeable homosexual sexual orientation is profoundly unjust .
We should concentrate on these positive biblical themes when we develop a moral code for persons with a homosexual or bisexual orientation .
" Liberation "
This viewpoint agrees with the " Equality " supporters : the Bible is silent on consensual sexual activity within a committed relationship .
On a positive note , the Bible does contain many grand themes of liberation and justice : the Exodus from Egypt , the story of Esther , the criticism of social inequality by the major and minor prophets of the Hebrew Scriptures ( Old Testament ) , Jesus ' support for the broken , poor , imprisoned , disadvantaged , etc .
These themes have inspired Christians and Jews to promote liberation theology in Central America , and an end to racial segregation in the U.S.
Now , these same themes are inspiring gays , lesbians , bisexuals and transgender persons to fight for equality .
The condemnation found in the Bible against sex outside of marriage made a lot of sense in biblical times .
It was a pre-scientific age when contraceptive techniques and methods of preventing STDs were unavailable .
They were not intended for all eras and all cultures .
In particular , they are not applicable today .
Safe , consensual , responsible , non-exploitive , non manipulative sex between mature persons -- whether of the same sex or opposite sex , whether in a committed relationship or not -- can be moral if it is genuine and spiritually elevating .
Homosexuals " ... should be encouraged to seek relationships that are meaningful and constructive , and that con contribute to the development of their personality as loving . "
Does a homosexual orientation exist ?
Viewpoint Existence of sexual orientation " Abomination " Homosexuality as an orientation does not exist .
If it did , the Bible would mention it .
Everyone is a heterosexual .
What the Bible does discuss in depth is humanity 's sinful depraved nature .
Homosexual behavior is one form by which this fallen nature is manifested .
Some people , will experience a same - sex act .
This often leads to addiction which is one form of God 's punishment for the act .
The person then will often assert that they have a homosexual orientation in order to justify their sin .
Even if the existence of a homosexual orientation could be proven , it is immaterial , because the Bible would condemn any acting out of that orientation .
" Change is expected " Opinion is divided .
Some teach that a homosexual orientation does not exist .
Everyone is basically heterosexual .
Others teach that a homosexual orientation does exist but that it can be overcome .
They do agree that some people , mainly as a result of a poor relationship with their parent of the same sex during early childhood , do seek same - sex sexual relationships during adulthood .
They are trying to fill a longing that was not satisfied during childhood .
They can be retrained through a loving , intimate but non-sexual relationship with a member of the same - sex .
Their " homosexuality " will disappear and be replaced with attraction for the opposite sex .
" Celibacy is expected " The Bible does not discuss sexual orientation .
Its writers appear to assume that everyone is heterosexual .
But they lived in a pre-scientific age before human sexuality became the focus of numerous scientific studies .
We must turn to science to learn about sexual orientation .
Numerous studies , personal testimonies , the unsuccessful struggles that countless persons with a homosexual orientation have experienced trying to become heterosexual , all point to a homosexual orientation that is unchosen and unchangeable in adulthood .
Child psychologists are able to determine with excellent accuracy which pre-schoolers will grow up to be gay or lesbian .
Studies have shown that a person with a homosexual orientation is very rarely able to become heterosexual .
The Bible calls them to a state of celibacy .
" Marginally acceptable "
This viewpoint generally agrees with the " Celibacy " group .
However , they teach that a loving committed same - sex relationship is to be preferred over a promiscuous single lifestyle .
" Equality " They also agree with the Celibacy group concerning the existence of a homosexual orientation .
A sexual orientation , whether homosexual , bisexual or heterosexual , is a gift of God to be appreciated , and explored with responsibility .
" Liberation "
Some suggest that sexual orientation is simply a social construct ... that if social pressures were removed , everyone would realize that they are bisexual .
Others , probably the majority , believe on the basis of memories and current feelings of attraction that sexual orientation is a reality .
Incidence of homosexuality : Viewpoint
How many adults are homosexuals " Condemnation "
Very few adults are homosexuals : on the order of one or two percent .
Also , sexual behavior is very fluid .
Many people change their behavior during their lifetime .
" Change is expected " Various beliefs .
" Celibacy is expected " Various beliefs .
" Marginally acceptable " Various beliefs .
" Equality " About 5 to 10 % of adults are homosexual .
This appears to be a constant percentage throughout history and among various cultures .
Sexual orientation is difficult to measure .
Simply asking a person if they are gay or lesbian during a phone interview will produce unrealistically low numbers because of lack of trust .
The only reliable data comes from person - to - person interviews in which a trusting environment is established .
" Liberation "
Agree with the " Equality " viewpoint .

MOORESVILLE , N.C. , Jan. 23 ( UPI ) --
The government of Kuwait has contracted Internet - based radiation emergency products suppler Nukepills.com for a citizen protection initiative .

Kuwait awarded the contract for the ThyroShield doses as part of an effort to stockpile nuclear radiation emergency protections .
Officials say the ThyroShield is a liquid medicine that has thyroid - blocking capabilities to prevent thyroid cancer during radiation emergencies .
" This sale is the first large - scale order of ThyroShield from a foreign government , " Troy Jones , Nukepills.com president , said in a statement .
" We are currently working on additional potassium iodide orders from other countries in the Middle East , Europe and Asia .
We hope the new U.S. administration follows Kuwait 's lead and reinstitutes the potassium iodide distribution plan to protect its citizens . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Investors not fixated on the inauguration will be bemoaning corporate health as the first big wave of quarterly results are unleashed upon the markets .
And it could get ugly .
" Analysts still have n't ratcheted down their earnings expectations enough , so we 'll probably see a lot more negative surprises than positive ones , " said Timothy Ghriskey , chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management .
" But offsetting this will be optimism about the new administration . "
Some 180 companies are slated to report results this week .
Currently , 55 S&P 500 firms , including five Dow components are on tap .
Standouts include Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ , Fortune 500 ) , IBM ( IBM , Fortune 500 ) , United Technologies ( UTX , Fortune 500 ) , Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) , eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) , Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) , and General Electric ( GE , Fortune 500 ) .
A few housing reports are also scheduled , but the week is otherwise light on economic news .
Financial markets are closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day .
Tuesday 's big event is of course Inauguration Day , when Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president .
It appears likely that Obama will waste little time making his mark on the economy : Expectations are growing that he will soon announce plans for the second $ 350 billion set aside to bail out the financial system .
Stocks should get a boost from enthusiasm about the inauguration , but any big earnings disappointments could dampen that , said Ghriskey .
Stocks have had a rough go in the new year .
A two - session advance at the end of last week took the edge off a decline that saw the Dow falling back to within range of the bear market lows it hit last November .
The financial sector has been especially battered , with the KBW Bank ( BKX ) sector index losing 28 % year - to - date versus the S&P 500's loss of nearly 6 % .
Bracing for weak earnings : Fourth - quarter earnings are expected to have slumped 20.2 % from a year ago , according to earnings tracker Thomson Reuters .
That would make it the sixth consecutive quarter of shrinking growth for the S&P 500 index .
" What 's different this time is that the weakness is spreading , " said John Butters , Thomson Reuters ' senior research analyst .
He said that in previous quarters , most of the weakness was coming from the financial sector and the consumer discretionary sector , which includes automakers and homebuilders .
During those quarters , select sectors were actually posting small gains , while others were close to unchanged .
The financial sector is still expected to be the worst performer in the fourth quarter , with analysts forecasting a decline of 98 % from a year ago .
But this time , the financials are far from an anomaly , Butters said .
Seven of the 10 economic sectors are expected to post declines , Butters said , as companies across a broad range of industries suffer amid the more than one - year old recession .
Healthcare , utilities and consumer staples are the only ones expected to see any growth , and all in the low single digits .
Earnings
Tuesday : Dow component Johnson & Johnson is expected to report earnings of 92 cents per share Tuesday morning , versus a profit of 88 cents per share a year ago , according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters .
After the market close , Dow component IBM is expected to report earnings of $ 3.03 per share , versus $ 2.80 per share a year ago .
Wednesday : United Technologies , another Dow component , is expected to have earned $ 1.22 per share , up from $ 1.08 a share a year ago .
Apple reports quarterly earnings after the market close .
The tech leader is expected to have earned $ 1.38 a share versus a profit of $ 1.76 per share a year ago .
Also reporting after the close is eBay .
The online auctioneer is expected to have earned 40 cents a share versus 45 cents a share a year ago .
Thursday : Google is expected to report a profit of $ 4.96 per share Thursday evening , up from $ 4.43 a share a year ago .
Microsoft also reports results after the bell .
The software giant is expected to have earned 50 cents per share , unchanged from the same period last year .
Friday : General Electric , a Dow component , reports quarterly results Friday morning .
GE is expected to have earned 37 cents per share versus 68 cents a share a year ago .
Economy
Wednesday : Treasury Secretary nominee Timothy Geithner 's confirmation hearing in the Senate is due to begin around 10 a.m. ET .
Geithner was considered a shoo - in but has faced questions lately about his initial failure to pay certain taxes earlier this decade , as well as the immigration status of a housekeeper .
Thursday : December housing starts are expected to have fallen to a 610,000 unit annual rate from a 625,000 unit rate in November , according to Briefing .com forecasts .
Building permits , a measure of builder confidence , are expected to have fallen to a 615,000 unit annual rate from a 616,000 unit rate in November .
Peer was subject to protests at a tournament in New Zealand last month Dubai could be removed from the women 's tennis calendar in 2010 after Israeli Shahar Peer was refused entry to the United Arab Emirates .
WTA chief executive Larry Scott said women 's tennis 's governing body will consider " what types of sanctions are going to be deemed appropriate " .
He said that would include " whether the tournament has a slot on the calendar " .
Dubai organisers said they feared a threat to the player 's safety because of public opinion on the Gaza conflict .
While playing in a tournament in Auckland , New Zealand in January , Peer had to contend with a noisy protest over Israel 's invasion of Gaza .
" Public sentiment remains high in the Middle East and fans and we have watched live television coverage of the recent attacks in Gaza .
We believe that Shahar Peer 's presence would have antagonised our fans , " tournament director Salah Tahlak said in a prepared statement .
" Ms Peer personally witnessed protests against her at another tournament in New Zealand only a few weeks ago .
Concern was raised about her well - being here and her presence triggering similar protests .
I am confident the Tour will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future
Shahar Peer " Given public sentiment , the entire tournament could have been boycotted by protesters .
" We do not wish to politicise sport but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the whole region and not alienate or put at risk the players or the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have in the United Arab Emirates . "
The Dubai tournament is one of the most prestigious on the women 's tour , with nine of the top 10 players competing this year .
Peer was scheduled to play 15th seed Anna Chakvetadze of Russia in the $ 2 m event on Monday , but the 21 - year - old 's request for a visa was turned down .
The world number 48 said she expected the WTA to act against the " injustice " .
" I am confident that the Tour will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future , and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term , " she said in a statement on Tuesday .
" There should be no place for politics or discrimination in professional tennis or indeed any sport . "
The UAE 's move has been met by widespread condemnation in the sport .
WTA rules state that no host country can deny a player the right to compete at any event on the tour for which she has qualified by ranking .
The ITF will remind the UAE Tennis Association that the ITF Constitution does not permit discrimination on any grounds
ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti Scott said he had considered cancelling the tournament when he heard about the situation , but decided to allow it to go ahead after consultation with Peer .
" It was decided not to cancel this year 's tournament , after talking to Peer and her family , and as most of the other players were already in Dubai , " he told the Daily Telegraph .
" But the fact that the tournament is going ahead , that should not be taken to mean that we accept or condone the fact that Peer has been denied a visa .
We do n't . "
The International Tennis Federation , which organises the four Grand Slam tournaments as well as the Fed Cup and Davis Cup , said it would be in contact with the UAE 's tennis federation .
ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti said : " The ITF will remind the UAE Tennis Association that the ITF Constitution does not permit discrimination on any grounds .
" The ITF believes that sport should not be used as a political tool but rather as a unifying element between athletes and nations . "
The Israeli Tennis Association ( ITA ) has called for stern action .
" The sanction has to be so severe that no one will ever attempt to boycott an athlete again , " said ITA chairman Michael Klein .
Former world number one Amelie Mauresmo was among a host of players to voice their support for Peer .
It 's very unfortunate , I feel very sorry for her
Ana Ivanovic
" It 's not acceptable , " said the Frenchwoman after clinching the Paris Open title on Sunday .
" I think sport should be above issues like that to do with religion and wars and whatever .
I 'm surprised . "
Olympic champion Elena Dementieva was Peer 's opponent in Auckland when a group of about 20 peace activists staged a protest outside the venue .
" I feel very sorry for her , " said the Russian .
" I played her in Auckland and there was some kind of demonstration during the match .
" I just feel sad for her .
She really cares about what 's going on between Israel and Palestine and it's just a very tough situation . "
Speaking in Dubai , former world number one Ana Ivanovic of Serbia said : " It 's very unfortunate , I feel very sorry for her .
" Shahar is a friend of mine and I feel sorry she 's not here .
It 's always a pity to mix politics and sport .
But the WTA is looking into it . "

As California officials see it , global warming is happening so there ’s no time to waste in figuring out what to do .
California ’s interagency Climate Action Team on Wednesday issued the first of 40 reports on impacts and adaptation , outlining what the state ’s residents must do to deal with the floods , erosion and other effects expected from rising sea levels .
Hundreds of thousands of people and billions of dollars of Golden State infrastructure and property would be at risk if ocean levels rose 55 inches by the end of the century , as computer models suggest , according to the report .
The group floated several radical proposals : limit coastal development in areas at risk from sea rise ; consider phased abandonment of certain areas ; halt federally subsidized insurance for property likely to be inundated ; and require coastal structures to be built to adapt to climate change .
Advertisement
“ Immediate action is needed , ” said Linda Adams , secretary for environmental protection .
“ It will cost significantly less to combat climate change than it will to maintain a business - as - usual approach . ”
Few topics are likely to be more contentious than coastal development .
But along the state ’s 2,000 - mile shoreline the effects would be acute , particularly in San Mateo and Orange counties , where more than 100,000 people would be affected , according to the 99 - page state - commissioned report by the Oakland - based Pacific Institute .
Detailed maps of the coastline , published on the institute ’s website , show that residential neighborhoods in Venice and Marina del Rey could find themselves in a flood zone .
Water could cover airports in San Francisco and Oakland , parts of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach , and large swaths of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach .
Roads , schools , hospitals , sewage plants and power plants may have to be relocated .
More than 330 hazardous waste sites are at risk from floods .

“ The rising sea level could be California ’s version of Hurricane Katrina , ” said Michael Woo , a Los Angeles planning commissioner and urban planning professor at USC .
“ Taxpayers and insurance ratepayers might question their responsibility to help homeowners and businesses which knowingly build in high - risk coastal areas . ”
California ’s far - reaching adaptation initiative reflects an emerging global consensus : Scientists can argue over how fast the Earth is heating up and diplomats can wrangle over emissions caps , but politicians must begin planning for the certainty of climate change .
Dozens of world - class scientists and economists , many from the University of California and state research institutes , are examining potential effects of warming on snowpacks , wildfires , crops and electricity demand .
Further reports will examine climate effects on hospital admissions , mortality rates , pollution and the habitats of the state ’s animals and plants .
Dutch experts have been consulted on how to armor the coast with improved dikes and sea walls -- controversial measures that some experts contend will only increase erosion .

Detailed studies , now undergoing peer review , are to be released over the next month .
Then the Climate Action Team is to send a comprehensive report to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Sea levels along California have risen an average of about 8 inches in the past century .
According to the Pacific Institute report , 260,000 Californians already live in flood zones , but are assumed to be protected by existing levees and sea walls .
A rise of 1.4 meters ( 55 inches ) would increase the population at risk to 480,000 .
Currently , 1,900 miles of roads and highways are at risk of flooding , which would grow to 3,500 miles under the sea level rise projections .
The report estimated that one adaptation strategy , armoring the coast with 1,100 miles of new or modified sea walls and levees , would cost at least $ 14 billion to construct , and another $ 1.4 billion a year to maintain .
The report ’s estimate of 1 to 1.4 meters of sea level rise by the end of the century was calculated using two scenarios envisioned by the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a gathering of the world ’s top climate scientists .
One scenario assumes countries will cut their emissions of planet - heating greenhouse gases , and another assumes a business - as - usual release level .
Advertisement
Despite more than a decade of warnings from scientists , global emissions continue to rise , fueled by rapid population growth and economic development in such nations as China and India .
Unless greenhouse gases are cut significantly , Earth ’s temperature is expected to increase between 4 and 6 degrees Celsius by the end of the century , according to the U.N. panel .
As water warms due to rising air temperatures , it expands , causing the sea level to rise .
But another major factor , the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets , was unaccounted for in the U.N. panel ’s models because of uncertainty over effects and timing .
Those models were designed in the mid-1990s .
Ice sheet melting has since accelerated .
Dan Cayan , a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and a lead scientist on the state ’s action plan , said the 55 - inch estimate in the report is “ probably conservative .
. . .
As temperature climbs , melting is going to proceed at a greater pace .
It is not necessarily going to proceed linearly , in the same proportion as it did in the past , because melting begets more melting . ”
Low - income people will be disproportionately vulnerable to sea level rise , according to the report .

In Alameda County , 66,000 residents would be affected by flooding , of whom 60 % are African American , Latino and Asian , the report said .
Mary Nichols , chairwoman of the state ’s Air Resources Board , which is charged with implementing a statewide plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions , called the sea level report “ blunt but realistic . ”
“ The recommendations are sensible : Defend what is worth protecting , move what can reasonably be moved , try to avoid doing further harm , consult affected communities , prepare to respond to emergencies . ”
Environmentalists hailed the report as a call to action .

“ We ca n’t pretend that the future will behave like the past , ” said Matt Vander Sluis of the Planning and Conservation League .
“ The ostrich has to take its head out of the sand or , in this case , it ’s going to be underwater . ”

US resident already had the pleasure / disgrace ( take your pick ) of buying non-Apple computers with Mac OS X pre-installed through PsyStar .
European customers were left out in the cold , as PsyStar is a US - based company which undoubtedly makes shipping across the pond rather expensive .
Despair no longer , European clone enthusiasts : German PearC is here .
PearC is basically selling machines very similar to the ones offered by PsyStar , with three possible base models ranging from 499 EUR to 1499 EUR , all with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard pre-installed .
The machines range from an Intel Pentium dual core E2200 to Intel Core i7 machines with options of up to 12 GB of RAM .
For the rest , they offer a range of options and upgrades to choose from .
They ship their Macintosh clones to Belgium , Denmark , Finland , France , Greece , Ireland , Luxembourg , Italy , The Netherlands , Austria , Poland , Portugal , Sweden , Spane , and the UK .
The website is in German , which I happen to speak rather well .
The FAQ of the website contains a question concerning the legality of this whole setup .
The answer :
Die Deutsche Gesetzgebung ist in diesem Fall auf der Seite Endverbraucher .
Enbenutzer - LizenzvertrÃ¤ge werden in Deutschland nur dann zum Vertragsbestandteil , wenn Sie vor dem Kauf der Software vereinbart wurden .
Die EinschrÃ¤nkung , die Apple fÃ¼r sein Betriebssystem Mac OS X in der EULA macht , haben daher in Deutschland keine rechtliche Bewandnis ( BGB Â§307 ) .
Wir sind daher davon Ã¼berzeugt , dass unser Produkt in Deutschland legal ist .
Basically , it reads that end - user license agreements in Germany are only valid if they have been offered before the transfer of goods / money , which in the case of Mac OS X does not happen .
As such , PearC claims , the clause in Apple ’s EULA binding Mac OS X to Apple hardware is unlawful .
There is no word from Apple yet , but seeing the legal action undertaken against PsyStar , Apple Germany might start similar legal action against PearC .
With German law probably being quite different from US law , such a possible case could follow an entirely different path than the US one .
It also raises the question : where will this end ?
If every country gets its own clone maker , will apple go after each and every one of them , forced to take all the local laws and regulations into account ?
MONTREAL–Life is tough if you 're a billionaire – these days at least .
Amid a global recession , Canadian billionaires , like their global counterparts , have been shorn of shockingly huge chunks of their net worth , while others are no longer billionaires at all .
According to Forbes Magazine , which made its annual compilation of billionaires public tonight , 355 of the world 's ultra-rich dropped off the rarefied list , including five from Canada .
It 's the first time since 2003 that the number of billionaires in the world actually shrank .
There are 793 billionaires in the world , compared to 1,125 last year .
Canada has 20 .
" The people on the billionaire 's list , maybe 95 per cent of their wealth or more is in stocks and shares , " said Jim Davies , professor of economics at the University of Western Ontario .
" And so with all these indexes down by about 50 per cent , you could make a rough guess what would happen to your average billionaire .
I 'd expect they 'd lose half their wealth compared to a year earlier . "
Topping Canada 's list like last year was the Thomson family , involved in various media ventures and information distribution company Thomson Reuters , with a net worth of $ 13 billion ( U.S. ) , significantly down from last year 's estimate of $ 18.9 billion .
Next is Galen Weston of food giants Galen Weston Ltd and Loblaw Co. , with a net worth of $ 5 billion .
That 's down from $ 7 billion last year .
The Irving family of Saint John , N.B. , owners of oil , forestry and newspaper companies , came in third at $ 3.9 billion , down from $ 6.7 billion .
Montreal 's Paul Desmarais and Guy Laliberte , founder of the famous Cirque du Soleil , rounded out the top five .
Laliberte was the only Canadian billionaire – and one of just 44 in the world – whose net worth actually increased in the last year .
Part of that is the result of his sale of 20 per cent of his dramatic stage enterprise to an investment arm of Dubai World and a real estate developer Nakheel .
Laliberte kept more than $ 400 million from the deal , according to Forbes .
The richest man in the world was once again Microsoft founder Bill Gates , who lost that enviable perch to investor Warren Buffet last year .
Even though he lost $ 18 billion over the last year , he is still worth $ 40 billion .
Buffet lost $ 25 billion from the value of his company Berkshire Hathaway , and is now worth $ 37 billion .
The total net worth of all the billionaires is down nearly by half , off $ 2 trillion to $ 2.4 trillion .
In tough times , businesses will do nearly anything to get new customers — look at the big markdowns at retailers and the cheap financing at auto dealerships .
But there is an exception to the rule : these days , credit - card companies are trying to get rid of customers .
They ’re shutting down accounts , shrinking credit lines , and , in some cases , actually paying customers to go away .
American Express recently offered some of its customers three hundred dollars if they would pay off their balance and close their account .

This is a pretty startling change of direction for the lords of plastic .
For decades , they ’ve been deluging Americans with come-ons ( in 2007 , 5.2 billion offers for new cards were sent out ) , so much so that , as of 2006 , there were nearly 1.5 billion charge cards in circulation .
And these cards did not go unused : between 2000 and 2006 , even as Americans ’ real income was essentially stagnant and their savings rate negligible , credit - card borrowing rose by about thirty per cent .
Our willingness to spend beyond our means served the credit - card companies well : their profits jumped forty - five per cent between 2003 and 2008 .
But while making borrowing easier boosted the companies ’ profits , it also increased the risks they faced , risks that started to hit home once the economic slowdown began .
According to Fitch Ratings , credit - card chargeoffs — debts that companies determine they will not be able to collect — rose to almost 7.5 per cent in December , up forty per cent from a year earlier .
And , as unemployment continues to rise , so , too , will the number of people who are unable to pay their bills .
It ’s little wonder , then , that credit - card companies are now scrambling to shed the customers they think are most likely to default , and to limit the amount that others can spend .
In effect , they ’re trying to follow the advice given by Larry Selden and Geoffrey Colvin in a book called “ Angel Customers & Demon Customers . ”
Not all customers are equal , it turns out : some are tremendously profitable , while others , like the guy who calls customer service six times a day to check his account balance , cost more than they ’re worth .
To boost profits , you must cultivate the angels and protect yourself against the demons .
That sounds easy enough .
But credit - card companies have created a strange business , in which there ’s a fine line between good and bad customers .
Their best customers are n’t those who dutifully pay off their balance every month ; instead , they ’re the ones who charge a lot and pay only a little every month , carrying a sizable balance and racking up interest charges and late fees .
These are the “ revolvers , ” and the credit - card business feeds on them .
Credit - card companies do n’t necessarily want revolvers to pay off their debts ; if they did , there ’d be no interest or fees to collect .
They want their loans to be , in the words of a banking regulator , “ a perpetual earning asset . ”
And they ’ve thought a lot about how to keep those interest payments coming .
For instance , they used to keep minimum payments relatively high .
But , over time , companies started lowering minimum payments , sometimes to just two per cent of the balance .
The lower the minimum payment the less people pay off each month and the longer they stay on the hook .
The catch is that while revolvers are the companies ’ best customers , they ’re also more likely to default , which would make them the worst .
That ’s why credit - card companies have had to rein in their lending and shed accounts .
Since that risks shrinking profits , they ’re also trying to get as much as they can out of their existing customers , by doing things like sharply increasing their interest rates .
This increase is partly a response to the greater risk of default , but it also takes advantage of the recession .
Many cardholders do n’t have enough money to pay off their balance in full , so when interest rates rise they are n’t able to just close their account and get a different card .
Effectively , they ’re captive customers .
And since credit - card companies , unlike most lenders , are allowed to change the terms of their loans at any time , people who borrowed a big chunk of money at , say , nine per cent may now be paying seventeen per cent on the loan .
These tactics are not going to improve the credit - card industry ’s dismal reputation .
They ’re also not going to help an economy in recession , since reduced credit lines take away an important cushion for consumer spending , and higher interest rates and increased fees are likely to drive more people to default .
But the odd thing is that while less access to revolving credit is a bad thing for us in the short run , having people rely less on credit cards is a good thing in the long run .
The easy availability of credit cards encouraged people to live beyond their means — studies suggest that people really do spend more when they can pay with a credit card , and that big credit lines further encourage extravagance .
And the high price of credit - card debt meant that billions of dollars in interest and late fees went to credit - card companies instead of to more productive uses .
Smaller credit lines and less borrowing make sense .
But in the short run they ’re going to throw a lot of sand into the economy ’s gears .
This is the paradox of deleveraging : it ’s good for borrowers to reduce their debt , and good for lenders to be more rigorous in their standards , but when everyone deleverages at once it does real damage .
It ’s like a drug addict whose dealer cuts him off : it ’s good to stop using , but withdrawal is painful .
The end of the credit - card boom is n’t going to wreak as much havoc as the end of the housing boom .
But it is helping to put a brake on our spending .
And , at this point , every little bit hurts . ♦
More bad news from the UK : Measles cases rose 36 % in 2008 over the previous year , from 990 to 1348 .
Health Protection Agency experts said most of the cases had been in children not fully vaccinated with combined MMR and so could have been prevented .
Immunisation expert Dr Mary Ramsay said the rise was " very worrying " , adding measles " should not be taken lightly " .
No , it should n't , given that it can lead to pneumonia and encephalitis .
This news comes on the heels of an antivax diatribe by " journalist " Jeni Barnett on LBC radio in England .
Science advocate Ben Goldacre , who writes Bad Science , takes her to task here and here .
Continuing on with irrationality : LBC lawyers told Ben to take down the clip of her irrational spewings .
Of course , that 's their right ; he posted all of it , so they have a copyright claim .
However , doing something as dumb as that just means people will take all the more glee to get the word out there , as I 'm doing now .
And , of course , it 's still all over the web .
It 's on YouTube thanks to Rachel Dunlop , for example .
A series of skeptics have posted transcripts of it , too , so you can read what Ms. Barnett said .
You really have to read it for yourself to see the level of nonsense on display , like this :
I want to know from some kind of expert what measles is and what is in the vaccine , and why people have a reaction to it , and really my question is : what is wrong with childhood illnesses ?
Is it - to hark back to the first hour - because we do n't have parents at home looking after the children ?
What 's going on ?
Is there something wrong with having mumps ...
So she does n't know what measles is , or what 's in the vaccine , or what 's wrong with childhood illnesses , or what 's the problem with mumps ... but she goes on the radio railing against vaccination ?
What mad world ?
I 'm sorry that antivax crackpots are not restricted to only the US .
But if you run across one , send 'em here , send 'em to Orac ( who has written about Ben 's post as well ) , send 'em to Ben .
We 'll win this yet .
Online - poker forums have turned the gambler ’s time - honored “ bad beat ” story — a tale of a seemingly surefire victory gone wrong — into a literary art .
A timely literary art .
When it comes to online poker , bad - beat stories entertain an inevitable , if unspeakable , contemporary worry : the Internet is rigged .
And who does n’t brood on that from time to time ?
Facebook is taking our data ; our surfing patterns are being tracked ; the bill for all this free info is bound to come due someday .
Someone on Wikipedia defines it with uncommon eloquence : “ ‘ Bad beat ’ is a subjective term for a hand in which a player , who had what appeared to be strong cards , nevertheless loses . ”
In a bad beat , four aces are always losing to a fluke straight flush , and some idiot opponent is always lucking into great cards at a statistically improbable time .
An exemplary bad - beat narrative sounds like this : “ I went all - in on the flop with aces , the board was AKQ rainbow , got called by 57 suited who also called my huge raise preflop , and lost to runner runner flush . ”
( Thank you , Doron Singer at Part Time Poker . )
Whether or not poker interests you , the bad - beat story is a form to study ; everyone needs to know how to tell one .
It ’s an especially useful genre during a recession .
With its combination of numbers , magic , hunches and statistics , the bad - beat story furnishes a nice range of narrative devices to frame a lament about losing , while making it crystal clear that the loss was n’t your fault .
Bad - beat stories might be considered the manly answer to a more feminine narrative : the “ vanishing date ” story .
This is the one that bemoans how , in spite of how good you looked , how little you talked and how carefully you refrained from texting him afterward , your date still ( unaccountably ) did n’t ask you out a second time :
It ’s not painful ; it ’s just really weird .
And if the honest , jerky reply to a vanishing - date story is “ He ’s just not that into you , ” then the equally honest , equally jerky response to a bad - beat story is “ Face it : you lost . ”

She quickly discovered that traditional methods were n’t for her and that she had to throw out the old playbook .
A new University of Georgia study suggests that health agencies investigating Salmonella illnesses should consider untreated surface water as a possible source of contamination .
Researchers , whose results appear in the March issue of the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology , tested water over a one - year period in rivers and streams in a region of south Georgia known for its high rate of sporadic salmonella cases .
The team found Salmonella in 79 percent of water samples , with the highest concentrations and the greatest diversity of strains in the summer and after rainfall .
“ Streams are not routinely tested for Salmonella , and our finding is an indication that many more could be contaminated than people realize , ” said Erin Lipp , associate professor in the UGA College of Public Health .
“ We found our highest numbers in the summer months , and this is also the time when most people get sick . ”
Lipp , who co-authored the study with former UGA graduate student Bradd Haley and Dana Cole in the Georgia Division of Public Health , said that although contaminated water used to irrigate or wash produce has been linked to several well - publicized outbreaks of salmonellosis in recent years , the environmental factors that influence Salmonella levels in natural waters are not well understood .
She said understanding how Salmonella levels change in response to variables such as temperature and rainfall are critical to predicting — and ultimately preventing — the waterborne transmission of the bacteria .
The team studied streams in the upper reaches of the Suwannee River Basin , which begins in south Georgia and flows into central Florida .
The study area contains a mix of forested lands , row crops , pasturelands , wetlands and small cities .
The researchers chose sampling sites near a variety of those environments but found little variation in Salmonella concentrations by location .
The diversity of Salmonella strains , however , was highest near a farm containing cattle and a pivot irrigation system , suggesting that close proximity to livestock and agriculture increase the risk of contamination .
The researchers also found a strong and direct correlation between rainfall for the two days preceding sample collection and the concentration of Salmonella , suggesting that runoff contributes to the contamination .
Salmonella can be found in the intestinal tracts of several species of animals and in humans .
The bacteria are shed in feces , but Lipp said recent data suggest that they can persist and possibly grow in water if given the right conditions .
Her study found that the diversity and concentration of Salmonella increased as temperatures increased .
The highest concentrations and greatest diversity of strains were found in August , the warmest month of the year .
Lipp adds that her study , which was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Joint Program on Climate Variability and Human Health , lends support to the idea that Salmonella illnesses could increase as a result of global warming .
Lipp notes that her study area had 58 cases of Salmonella illness per 100,000 people in 2007 , the last year for which figures are available , compared to a state average of 22 cases per 100,000 people and a national average of 15 cases per 100,000 people .
She said the exact mechanisms by which people in her study area are being exposed to environmental Salmonella are unclear , but the most commonly detected strain in the studied streams was among the top ten associated with human infections in the health district .
The porous nature of the soil in the study area means that surface water and groundwater are prone to mixing , especially after rainfalls , and Lipp said that poorly sited wells might be a factor in many illnesses .
Another possibility , especially common among children , is so called incidental exposure by which people become infected with the bacteria when playing in or near contaminated waterways .
“ Understanding the environmental factors that contribute to salmonella illnesses can guide our efforts to educate people about how they can avoid being sickened through the proper construction and maintenance of wells , basic hygiene such as hand washing and good food safety practices , ” Lipp said .
“ We also have the potential to decrease the likelihood of larger outbreaks related to produce , because in many cases contaminated irrigation water , and not the produce itself , may be the cause of the outbreak . ”

Two soldiers were shot dead outside a military barracks in Northern Ireland last night .
Four other people , at least two of them civilians , were wounded when they were hit by two bursts of automatic fire at Massereene Barracks , Antrim .
Its understood a car or van pulled up outside the main gates .
Soldiers and security staff thought pizzas were being delivered and walked straight into an ambush .
Dissident republicans opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process were immediately blamed .
View Larger Map
Ian Paisley Jr , a member of the Policing Board , said afterwards : " This could be a defining moment in the history of Northern Ireland . "
The attack happened just 36 hours after Northern Ireland Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde confirmed that undercover soldiers had been called in to carry out surveillance operations on dissidents amid warnings that the threat against his officers and military personnel was at its highest for almost a decade .
Witnesses reported hearing two long busts of gunfire as a car drove by the barracks .
At least six ambulances and three paramedic vehicles rushed to the scene as emergency sirens blared from inside the complex .
The injured were taken to Antrim Area Hospital , about a mile away .
The area around the barracks was sealed off and a massive security operation was under way .
Nobody has yet claimed responsibility for the attack .
Last year dissident Republicans tried to kill PSNI officers in separate incidents in Derry City and Dungannon Co Tyrone .
Last month security forces also defused a 300 lb bomb in Castlewellan Co Down which may have been intended for an attack on a nearby barracks .
Mr Paisley , a Democratic Unionist member of the Northern Ireland Assembly , said : " For the last 10 years , people believed things like this happened in foreign countries , places like Basra .
Unfortunately it has returned to our doorstep .
" There are people who have been intent on murdering police officers or soldiers , or someone else , to strike home and galvanise support for some mad cause .
This is where we are tonight .
" Some people also tried to exaggerate that message , and if this shooting is attributed to dissident republicans , then it was no exaggeration .
" The police have managed to keep the lid on this and they have had some successes against these people which they 've kept quiet .
They have disrupted and harried them , but its the people of Northern Ireland who will suffer . "
Security chiefs had warned for months that dissident republicans were determined to inflict fatalities .
Five police officers , two of them off - duty , were wounded in separate gun and bomb attacks in Londonderry , Dungannon , Co Tyrone , near Castlederg , also Tyrone , and not far from Roslea , Co Fermanagh , where the threat has been at its highest .
There have also been a series of failed bomb attacks , one just a few weeks ago near Castlewellan , Co Down .
The last soldier to be murdered in Northern Ireland was Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick , 23 , who was shot by an IRA sniper at a checkpoint in Bessbrook , County Armagh in February 1997 .
The 38 Engineer Regiment has been based at Massereene Barracks since August last year but is due to be relocated to RAF Aldergrove in Co Antrim by the end of 2010 .
The relocations were announced in April last year by Armed Forces Minister Bob Ainsworth who said Massereene Barracks would then be closed and disposed of .
Kylie McLaughlin , who lives near the scene , told the BBC : " It was constant fire like a machine gun .
" It was very scary , we were not sure what was happening .
We just can't believe it has happened here . "
The SDLP's Thomas Burns MLA said : " We condemn this attack .
" This has taken us back to the bad , bad old days which we have left long since behind .
" It will cause the power sharing executive to wobble a bit - we are all very , very concerned about that . "
He added : " We are interested about moving Northern Ireland forward .
" We want to see a prosperous Northern Ireland , we do n't want to see people getting shot in the street . "
Northern Ireland 's First Minister and Democratic Unionist Party leader Peter Robinson said he was postponing a trip to the United States as a result of the shootings .
He said they were a " terrible reminder of the events of the past " .
Mr Robinson added : " These murders were a futile act by those who command no public support and have no prospect of success in their campaign .
It will not succeed . "
Some reports suggested the attackers arrived at the barracks in a taxi vehicle to evade suspicion .
The SDLP condemned the attack which it branded as brutal and despicable .
South Antrim MLA Thomas Burns said : " Like many , we had hoped and prayed that nights like this were firmly in the past .
" It is important we unite as a community and send out a message to those responsible that they have absolutely no support .
" Tonight the two families are in mourning as a result of this despicable attack . "
He appealed to anyone with information to contact the police .
It emerged last week that intelligence service MI5 was still allocating 15 % of its resources in 2007 - 2008 to anti-terrorism activities in Northern Ireland .
The Intelligence & Security Committee Report also said that dissident republicans continued to pose a threat in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK .
He said : " My thoughts are with the families of those killed and injured in this murderous attack .
The Prime Minister is being kept closely informed .
" The contrast between those who serve the community and those who would destroy it could not be clearer .
" The people who did this will be pursued and they can be assured that they will never be able stop political progress in Northern Ireland . "
Downing Street added in a statement : :" This is a terrible incident that we utterly condemn and the prime minister 's thoughts , first and foremost , are with the families of those killed and with those seriously injured in this attack .
" In recent days action has been taken to increase security in Northern Ireland .
This is because of the increased threat from those who , even at this late stage , wish to ignore the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland and attempt to derail the peace process .
" The full facts of this incident are being investigated .
We will do everything we can to ensure those responsible are brought to justice . "

Anonymous Creditors and Debtors ...
The diagram illustrates the true function of a bank .
In the small town where I grew up the bank played an active role in my life .
I knew everybody in it and they knew me .
My savings went as loans to finance my neighbor 's car , or to me to open a bar room .
If I wanted to invest foolishly , there was somebody there to caution me .
With the giant national banks there is no real customer service or connection .
If the client is late on a payment , out he goes .
They group him in a Collateralized Debt Obligation and that 's that .
If we compound that with 19 millions other families , the country collapses from anonymous creditors and debtors .
Looting the Treasury ...
My immediate gut feel was to return the foreclosed property to the home owner or renter .
They would work out new payment terms with the mortgage holder .
Especially when whole neighborhoods suffer foreclosure the properties deteriorate badly .
If they enter a resale market , the re-saler will often pay the bank $ 150,000 or $ 200,000 for 100 properties .
He 's lucky to sell them for $ 3000 or $ 4000 apiece .
Failing this , the first order of business is to re-institute the Glass - Steagall act of 1933 .
This would sever the ties between banking , investment and insurance subsidiaries .
Then , the regulators could fire management , break up the bank operations into salable pieces and bankrupt the section that held toxic securities .
As soon as the present intact banks benefit from Federally guaranteed prices for toxic instruments , they will plunder the USA .
The Sins of Tim Geithner
Arianna Huffington : Tim Geithner 's actions throughout his career , including his time as Treasury Secretary , are proof that the toxic thinking that got us into this mess is part of his DNA .
That 's why every proposal he comes up with is déjà vu all over again -- a remixed variation on the same tried - and - failed let - the - bankers - work - it - out approach championed by his predecessor , Hank Paulson .
The Reconstruction Finance Corporation
The alternative course , which is winning converts across the political spectrum , is a variant on the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the Roosevelt era .
With an R.F.C. temporarily taking over the insolvent banks , you would n't have to bribe hedge funds and private equity companies to speculate on toxic securities .
Government would take over zombie banks and use government auditors to determine just how much new money was required to bring a vastly simplified financial system back to life .
Shadow banks , loan securitization , and convoluted high - risk schemes would loom smaller , not larger .
The process would have far greater simplicity and transparency .
And it would be far more likely to get the banking system working again , more quickly and at less public expense .
- Robert Kuttner
Roll ' Em Tide
The Bloomberg Financial channel was in all - a- flutter today .
The ample bosoms of the female broadcasters were heaving with delight .
Tim Geithner leaked enough of his plan to fleece and bankrupt the citizens to convince .
The Wall Street bandits roared as the market soared 200 points .
" We 've hit the bottom !
Buy !
Buy ! Buy ! "
Is the Public Really that Dumb ?
Possibly
This euphoria will continue for a period of time , but ultimately it will fail .
The Wall Street gang wo n't play the game with toxic assets until the government assumes all risks inherent in the program .

Cruise Ships Routinely Dump Trash in the Caribbean Sea By By Christine Mattice Mar 3 , 2009 in Lifestyle Cruise ships are dumping solid waste into the Caribbean Sea , despite a ban , and there ’s nothing anyone can do about it right now .
In 1993 , the United Nations banned dumping of solid waste in the Caribbean Sea , ruling that such refuse should be treated on land .
Since then , officials have been waiting for the surrounding nations to report their “ refuse ” capacity … and waiting …and waiting .
The ban cannot take effect until a certain number of the nations that own the Caribbean Islands report this capacity .
While officials wait for the Islands to report their refuse capacities , cruise ships are routinely dumping ground glass , paper , and other trash into the open Caribbean Sea .
Other parts of the sea , however , are prohibited from such dumping .
The Has already taken effect in the Antarctic , the Baltic Sea , the North Sea , and the Persian Gulf and is due to come into force in the Mediterranean in May .
These are the areas that the United Nations Maritime Organization has ruled to be vulnerable to the dangers of solid waste dumping .
The ban prohibits any refuse , except food scraps , from being tossed at sea .
The Caribbean Islands , however , are still following the “ pre-ban ” regulations , which allow them to dump garbage three miles from shore , as long as it is ground to less than an inch .
The type of garbage they can dump includes metal , paper , and glass .
This incensed environmentalists say that such dumping can upset the delicate ecosystem of the ocean and disable and kill sea creatures .
But the Caribbean Islands are not thinking of the ecology but of their economy , say critics .
Tourism from cruise ships is a $ 1.5 billion - a- year industry for the islands .
Moreover , the islands compete with each other for these tourist dollars .
This has prevented them from coming to “ common ground ” over the ocean dumping issues .
They are afraid , says the International Herald Tribune , of imposing restrictions on cruise ships that might cause them to go to their competitor islands .
Although officials have tried to persuade the Caribbean Island that garbage washing up on shore is also a danger to their tourism business , they are , so far , not listening .
The Caribbean Islands claim that their resistance to the ban is a matter of space , says the International Herald Tribune , but others believe that it is a matter of their $ 1.5 billion - a - year tourism industry .

BWAA released , new releases of Ast2Cfg , Cfg2 Dot From the abstract of my thesis :
" Busy waiting occurs whenever a process repeatedly checks a condition until it becomes true without influencing that condition itself , thereby effectively wasting system resources and introducing the risk of system failure due to race conditions .
Hence , busy waiting is considered bad programming practice and can be avoided by the use of higher communication facilities .
In the development of critical systems , for which correctness and robustness are of vital importance , software quality assurance is of great value .
However , it is difficult and impractical to manually discover busy waiting in existing program code , which is why a static analysis tool is needed for that purpose . "
BWAA , the Busy Wait Analyser for Ada , is such a tool based on static control flow analysis methods and uses the CFG - based datastructures provided by Ast2Cfg .
It is now available for download .
Detailed documentation can be found in my thesis which may also be downloaded .
Development of Ast2Cfg has also been continued and for Cfg2 Dot a few bugs were fixed .
Check out the new versions .
Ast2Cfg Presentation Slides FOSDEM '09 available
The slides for the presentation in the Ada Developer Room on the FOSDEM '09 which will take place today are ready for download .
FOSDEM '09 , New Release of Ast2Cfg and Ast2 Dot Next weekend we will present the Ast2Cfg project on the Free and Open Source Software Developers ' European Meeting , the FOSDEM '09 .
The presentation will take place on Sunday from 12:00 to 13:00 in the Ada Developer Room organised by Ada-Belgium .
This is a good occasion to release new versions of Ast2Cfg and Ast2 Dot , since quite a few changes were made since the last release .
A lot of nasty bugs were resolved , hopefully without introducing too many new ones , and some necessary changes to internal data structures guarantee more stability .
So , do not hesitate to download the new versions .
Happy New Year !
The Flow World Team wishes you a Happy New Year !
All the best for 2009 !
Still looking for a new year 's resolution ?
Ada-Europe 2008
We are looking forward to present our recent paper at the 13th International Conference on Reliable Software Technologies the Ada -Europe 2008 in Venice .
Our presentation will be on Thursday , June 19 .
After our talk , we will of course make the slides available for download .
New Release of Ast2Cfg and Cfg2Dot
There is a new version of Ast2Cfg and Cfg2 Dot available in the download section .
Especially Ast2Cfg has undergone heavy developement because lots of new features have been introduced in the post transformation phase .
We also fixed a lot of bugs , so usage of older versions is not recommended .
New Ast2Cfg version Version 0.1.1 of Ast2Cfg is available in the downloads section .
As the new version number indicates , this new release contains only bugfixes , but no new features .
Technical report online .
" Generating Control Flow Graphs for Ada Programs " is the title of our technical report that basically documents Ast2Cfg .
It was finished last month , however , additional proofreading and acquiring a report number delayed the download until now .
If you are seeking in - depth information on Ast2Cfg do n't hesitate downloading it .
New Cfg2 Dot version
When we first released Cfg2 Dot a few days ago , we forgot that it was still lacking the possibility to control the level of output .
For us , this was perfectly fine , since we always wanted to see the maximum output , however , most people certainly do n't want several megabytes of status messages .
Now , in version 0.6.1 , per default only errors and warnings are printed ( apart from the dot output of course ) .
With the option -v Cfg2 Dot gets more verbose and - vv leads to maximum output .
The downloads are ready .
Finally , we found the time to create some tarballs for our recent projects .
All of them are related to the static analysis of Ada programs .
Let 's start with the smallest program , Ast2 Dot , which outputs the abstract syntax tree as it is generated by ASIS in dot format .
The version 0.9.1 which is now available in the downloads section is pretty well tested and wo n't be modified much anymore .
The project we have been heavily working on for the last months is Ast2Cfg which is a library that generates a control flow graph out of the abstract syntax tree that is provided by ASIS .
Its version number is currently 0.1 , however , it already works pretty well .
Also Cfg2 Dot made it to a release .
It outputs the control flow graphs generated by Ast2Cfg in dot format , so be sure to install Ast2Cfg first before you download Cfg2Dot .
Its version number is 0.6 since the code is also pretty mature .
If you want to use Ast2Cfg , have a look at how Cfg2 Dot uses it first , it 's a good example .
Have fun , and do n't hesitate to contact us in case something does n't work as expected .

Alex Jones has received a secret report distributed by the Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) entitled “ The Modern Militia Movement ” and dated February 20 , 2009 .
A footer on the document indicates it is “ unclassified ” but “ law enforcement sensitive , ” in other words not for public consumption .
A copy of the report was sent to Jones by an anonymous Missouri police officer .
Click on above thumbnails to see larger images .
The MIAC report specifically describes supporters of presidential candidates Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , and Bob Barr as “ militia ” influenced terrorists and instructs the Missouri police to be on the lookout for supporters displaying bumper stickers and other paraphernalia associated with the Constitutional , Campaign for Liberty , and Libertarian parties .
“ Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) provides a public safety partnership consisting of local , state and federal agencies , as well as the public sector and private entities that will collect , evaluate , analyze , and disseminate information and intelligence to the agencies tasked with Homeland Security responsibilities in a timely , effective , and secure manner , ” explains the MIAC website .
“ MIAC is the mechanism to collect incident reports of suspicious activities to be evaluated and analyzed in an effort to identify potential trends or patterns of terrorist or criminal operations within the state of Missouri .
MIAC will also function as a vehicle for two - way communication between federal , state and local law enforcement community within our region . ”
MIAC is part of the federal “ fusion ” effort now underway around the country .
“ As of February 2009 , there were 58 fusion centers around the country .
The Department has deployed 31 officers as of December 2008 and plans to have 70 professionals deployed by the end of 2009 .
The Department has provided more than $ 254 million from FY 2004 - 2007 to state and local governments to support the centers , ” explains the Department of Homeland Security on its website .
Missouri is mentioned as a participant in this federal “ intelligence ” effort .
Last month , the ACLU issued a news release highlighting the activity of a fusion center in Texas as the “ latest example of inappropriate police intelligence operations targeting political , religious and social activists for investigation , ” in particular “ Muslim civil rights organizations and anti-war protest groups . ”
The MIAC report does not concentrate on Muslim terrorists , but rather on the so - called “ militia movement ” and conflates it with supporters of Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , Bob Barr , the so - called patriot movement and other political activist organizations opposed to the North American Union and the New World Order .
The MIAC document is a classic guilt by association effort designed to demonize legitimate political activity that stands in opposition to the New World Order and its newly enshrined front man , Barack Obama .
In September of 2008 , Missouri sheriffs and prosecutors organized truth squads to intimidate people opposed to Obama and threatened to arrest and prosecute anybody who ran “ misleading television ads . ”
Missouri governor Matt Blunt eventually denounced the use of “ police state tactics ” on the part of the Obama - Biden campaign .
MIAC claims members of a “ rightwing ” militia movement organized in the 1990s — generally in response to the Oklahoma City bombing and the events at Waco — “ continuously exploit world events in order to increase participation in their movements .
Due to the current economical and political situation , a lush environment for militia activity has been created ” and supposedly exploited by “ constitutionalists ” and “ white supremacists , ” the latter an oft - employed canard used to demonize activists as dangerous and potentially violent lunatics .
MIAC notes many of the political issues cited by the so - called patriot movement — the Ammunition Accountability Act , the impending economic collapse of the government , the possibility of a constitutional convention , the North American Union , Obama ’s “ Universal Service Program , ” and the implementation of RFID , issues that are not limited to the patriot movement but are shared by a wide array of political activists .
The MIAC document includes a map of the North American Union not dissimilar from one released by NASCO , the North America SuperCorridor Coalition ( see the NASCO map here ) .
The MIAC report is similar to one created by the Phoenix Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Joint Terrorism Task Force during the Clinton administration ( see page one and page two of the document ) .
The FBI document explicitly designates “ defenders ” of the Constitution as “ right - wing extremists . ”
The MIAC report expands significantly on the earlier document .
[ efoods ]
In order to artificially heighten the perceived threat threshold , MIAC rolls in Christian Identity , white nationalism , “ militant ” anti-abortion activists , opposition to illegal immigration , and income tax resistance .
MIAC deceptively blurs the lines between these disparate political ideologies and underscores the possibility for violence in a summary of the organizational structure of the militia movement and a section describing how members strive to train in “ combat readiness . ”
The MIAC effort to characterize Libertarians and Constitutionalists as racists is reminiscent of an attempt by the corporate media in early 2008 to portray Ron Paul as a racist by attempting to link him to a series of vaguely racist newsletters produced in the 1980s .
Paul did not exercise editorial control over the newsletters and went so far as to apologize for them , but this did not prevent the corporate media from characterizing him as a racist .
According to MIAC , opposition to world government , NAFTA , federalization of the states , and restrictive gun laws are a threat to the police .
“ The militia subscribes to an anti-government and NWO mindset , which creates a threat to law enforcement officers .
They view the military , National Guard , and law enforcement as a force that will confiscate their firearms and place them in FEMA concentration camps , ” the document claims in a section entitled “ You are the Enemy . ”
In regard to supposed militia movement literature and media , the MIAC report mentions Aaron Russo ’s America : Freedom to Fascism and William Luther Pierce ’s The Turner Diaries — the latter was penned by the former leader of the white nationalist organization National Alliance and the former by a Libertarian filmmaker .
In order to underscore the absurdity of the MIAC attempt to link Pierce ’s novel and Russo ’s anti-tax documentary , it should be noted that the late Aaron Russo was Jewish and The Turner Dairies posits a Zionist government in America ( or ZOG , the Zionist Occupation Government ) run by Jews .
The award - winning film Zeitgeist , featuring Alex Jones , is also mentioned as terrorist material .
The MIAC report is particularly pernicious because it indoctrinates Missouri law enforcement in the belief that people who oppose confiscatory taxation , believe in the well - documented existence of a New World Order and world government ( a Google search of this phrase will pull up numerous references made by scores of establishment political leaders ) , and are opposed to the obvious expansion of the federal government at the expense of the states as violent extremists who are gunning for the police .
It specifically targets supporters of mainstream political candidates and encourages police officers to consider them dangerous terrorists .
MIAC is attempting to radicalize the police against political activity guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
If Missouri police indoctrinated by MIAC propaganda overreact to political activists and supporters of Ron Paul in their state and injure or kill people involved in entirely legal and legitimate political activity , MIAC , the governor of Missouri ( his name appears on the MIAC document ) , and the DHS and federal government should be held directly responsible and prosecuted the fullest extent of the law .

Saving water is the right and important thing to do !
March 10 , 2009 at 9:27 pm
Water has become the the most important commodity here in drought stricken California .
You may have read that along with our usual desert climate restrictions on rainfall , we also are being prevented on gaining a sufficient supply from the Sacramento River delta due to endangered species concerns .
Fortunately my home town , Long Beach had some time ago instituted a water use reduction plan and we should be able to live within our allocation this summer .
However that does n’t mean that I and others should look for additional ways to save water or at least use as efficiently as possible .
Our first item along those lines comes via Ecofriend.org ( http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-gadgets-compact-dishwasher-recycles-water-for-subsequent-cycles/).
This device is s dishwasher sized for a bachelor apartment that recycles the water used in the pre-wash faze to use in the second cycle .
Sounds pretty interesting and might be truly useful if it can be scaled up for use by a conventional family .
The other story is also about reusing water and in this case using the gray water .
The story on Teehugger.com ( http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/03/gray-water-safe-legal.php) cover teh subject well , even including a link to a video about building your own system .
What they do n’t do is define what gray water is .
Here is the link to the Wikipedia page that explains it all : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greywater.
As always I thank you for your time and interest .
Please take the time to Digg , Stumble Upon or add to the other social network of your choice to help me spread the word about these issues .

By Seamus Anthony
Today I had one of those “ Little Kensho moments ” where I just suddenly saw things exactly as they are , and in this moment I truly realised the inherent truth and power in the famous Yoda quote :
“ Try not .
Do , or do not .
There is no try . ”
In my case what I was thinking about was my three main goals for this year – to lose weight / get fitter , to greatly improve my French and to re-establish myself as a regular fixture on the Melbourne live music scene .
Of the three of these , the only one I have really been doing properly is the latter ; I have been getting out and playing lots of gigs , networking and getting right back into the groove of being a busy , active musician again .
I am just doing it .
There ’s miles to go yet but I have started the journey ; I ’m doing what needs to be done .
As for the other two , well I have been learning some more French , and I have been doing some exercise and have at least not gotten fatter – but the truth is I have been making excuses .
Excuses like “ I find it hard to find the time to practice my French skills ” or “ I ca n’t enjoy life without ( excessive amounts of ) designer beer and fine food ” .
And so at the end of the day , I just have n’t been “ doing it ” .
To do it just means to do it .
Simple as that .
And as the wise green grommit said , you ’re either doing it , or your NOT doing it , there is no middle ground .
Reading about how to do it , is n’t doing it .
Thinking about doing it is n’t doing it .
Talking about doing it is n’t doing it .
Only doing what needs to be done in order to get the result you seek is doing it , everything else is just bullshit and excuses .
Moving Stones Around
The qualitive difference in my two experiences , “ doing it ” and “ not doing it ” , is marked .
In the case of getting my music out there again , I feel a flow and a sense of satisfaction that I have n’t felt in years .
In fact , yesterday and today I was even happy to do very little ( in this area ) for the first time in a while , without a nagging feling that I should be doing something more constructive .
I felt free to rest for a bit because I know I have some good momentum going .
It ’s like a bike ride : it ’s not all uphill , you get to coast down some hills here and there .
But in the two cases of French and Fitness , I feel blocked ( or at least I did until today ) .
I felt frustrated and like I keep trying but to no avail .
The mistake I am making ?
There is no try !
Only
Do or do not !
But why have I been “ Not doing ” ?
Well , I believe it has to do with what ’s going on in my head ; my internal dialouges and beliefs are getting in my own way .
The lines of dialouge directly preceding the featured Yoda quote do a nice job of exploring this :
LUKE
Master , moving stones around is one thing .
This is totally different .
YODA
No !
No different !
Only different in your mind .
You must unlearn what you have learned .
In case you do n’t remember or know , this whole scene tells the story of Yoda teaching Luke Skywalker to use the Force to raise Luke ’s stricken X - Wing fighter from the swamp .
Luke believes it is easy to make stones levitate but that he ca n’t use his mind to lift up the spacecraft .
And that ’s what I have been doing , moving stones around instead of “ doing it ” for real .
I have been going for a jog here and there , I stopped putting sugar in my coffee , but really it ’s not enough to stem and reverse the middle aged spread that ’s been threatening to engulf my hips .
And I have been learning new French words at a nice steady pace with my little 16 month old daughter , but I still have n’t been knuckling down to learn all the “ difficult ” grammar stuff that will really mean the difference to my French language skills .
And why ?
Because in my mind , these actions are associated with displeasure and negative beliefs .
I believe I find grinding through French grammar “ boring ” .
I believe I ca n’t enjoy life without eating too much cheese and sweet food and drinking too much beer .
In my mind , these hurdles were too big for me to leap , to which Yoda would say :
“ No !
No different !
Only different in your mind . ”
The truth is there is plenty of pleasure to be had from both these activities – but my mind has just gotten stuck in a couple of little dead - ends .
If I am going to find my way to my destination , I need to reverse the old brain - car and meander back through the suburbs of my skull until I find the way through to the destination I want to end up at .
There I will enjoy the pleasure of understanding what the hell all those Frenchies in my life are always rabbiting on about so effusively .
There I will not feel like such a bloated old toad when I am on stage singing my little heart out .
And along the way there will be plenty of enjoyable milestones too .
“ You must unlearn what you have learned . ”
The funny thing is , a couple of years back I was in just the same mental dead - end with gig- hunting .
I had convinced myself that the way I felt about getting on the phone and hustling up live music gigs was still the same as it was when I was a depressed , marijuana - addicted , slightly paranoid 23 year old ( I hated it then ) .
In fact this was not the case , and once I broke that barrier I have enjoyed applying all the skills I have since learned towards this task , and have had no problems at all with it , in fact I am enjoying it even more than I did when I was a gung - ho 19 year old kid .
So on the one hand , it ’s all a process , and sometimes you just ca n’t rush things …
But on the other , that ’s probably just another of those mental ideas that I need to unlearn in order to speed me on my way .
I will leave you with another pertinent bit of dialogue from The Empire Strikes Back :
LUKE
I do n’t … I do n’t believe it .
YODA
That is why you fail …
So the USB2VGA dongle is n't much fun to program -- especially since I have n't found a spec for the SiS315 graphics chip .
I started out by porting very tedious Linux code like this : ret |= SETIREGAND ( SISCR , 0x5b , 0xdf ) ; ret |= SETIREG ( SISSR , 0x05 , 0x86 ) ; ret |= SETIREGOR ( SISSR , 0x20 , 0x01 ) ; ret |= SETREG ( SISMISCW , 0x67 ) ; for ( i = 0x06 ; i <= 0x1 f ; i++) { ret |= SETIREG ( SISSR , i , 0x00 ) ; } for ( i = 0x21 ; i <= 0x27 ; i++) { ret |= SETIREG ( SISSR , i , 0x00 ) ; } and after a while I reached the important realisation that these hundreds of numbers that you need to send the dongle in order to boot it are completely boring .
There 's no sense in filling up source files with boring numbers , so I changed strategy .
I recorded what Linux sends over USB to make the dongle boot and checked whether I could just blindly replay exactly the same traffic .
This turned out to be easy and fun !
Capture USB traffic while plugging in the dongle : tcpdump - w trace .pcap - ni usb0
Open the trace in wireshark and Print as ascii like this : Frame 3 ( 14 bytes on wire , 14 bytes captured ) USB URB URB id : 0x00000000de478380 URB type : URB_SUBMIT ( ' S ' ) URB transfer type : URB_BULK ( 3 ) Endpoint : 0x0e Device : 3 URB bus id : 1 Device setup request : not present ( ' -') Data : present ( 0 ) URB status : Operation now in progress ( - EINPROGRESS ) ( - 115 ) URB length [ bytes ] : 6 Data length [ bytes ] : 6 [ Response in : 4 ] [ bInterfaceClass : Unknown ( 0xffff ) ]
Application Data : 420044D00000
Filter and massage the printed trace : #!/usr/bin/env awk -f / Endpoint :/ { ep = " " } / Endpoint : 0x0 [ de ] / { ep = strtonum ( $ 2 ) } / Application Data :/ && ep != " " { printf ( " SND %.2x %s
" , ep , $ 3 ) ; } to resemble a script : SND 0d 1F002403000004000000 SND 0d 1F006403000004000000 SND 0d 1F008403000004000000 SND 0d 1F000001000000070000 SND 0d 0F0004000000 ...
Write a traffic - replaying interpreter for the trace in ( for example ) Forth : d# 128 constant / buffer / buffer dma-alloc value buffer \ buffer in DMA - friendly memory .
0 value line : SND ( " endpoint " " data " -- ) line 1 + to line get - hex# ( endpoint ) safe - parse - word decode - hex ( endpoint adr len ) dup >r ( r : len ) buffer swap ( endpoint adr buffer len ) cmove ( endpoint ) buffer r> rot ( adr len endpoint ) bulk - out ? dup if . " usb error on write = " . . " line " line .
abort then ;
Then plug the dongle into my OLPC XO and execute the Forth code in Openfirmware and -- drumroll -- the dongle boots !
I see the contents of the framebuffer appear on my monitor .
Cool !
Poking around a little more at the Forth prompt reveals that the screen is initialized to 800x600 in 16 bpp RGB - 565 mode .
I can either settle for that or make a new trace of Xorg initializing some specific display mode of my liking .
Beats writing it by hand :-)
HARARE , Zimbabwe , Feb. 28 ( UPI ) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe says he will continue to seize farm lands from whites .
BBC reported Saturday the president told rally attendees in Chinhoyi that there would be " no going back " on planned and already executed land seizures .

Mugabe also said the Southern African Development Community tribunal in Namibia had no right to intervene on the farmers ' behalf .
The panel in November ruled that Zimbabwe 's plans to seize dozens of white - owned farms were illegal .
" Farms will not be returned back to former farmers , " Mugabe said .
" Some farmers went to the SADC ... but that 's nonsense , absolute nonsense , no - one will follow that . "
Zimbabwe 's Commercial Farmers Union says that , in the past month , operations at about 150 farms have been disrupted .
Mugabe made the comments at a celebration for his 85th birthday .
Prime Minister Morgan Tvansgirai of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Party declined to attend the event in Harare , saying the birthday party is a political function so he is not obligated to attend as prime minister , CNN reported .

以下の内容は 、Lunascape5.0 rc2以降には当てはまらない。レンダリングエンジンがGecko 1.9.1b3preに変更されたためである。安定性に配慮した今回の措置には素直に賛辞を送りたい。
書こうかどうしようか迷ったけど、いちおうMozilla系情報ブログみたいなスタンスでやってる以上は、スルーもできないかなあ。わかってる人に向けて書いても意味ないので、説明のいる用語はできるだけ使わない方向で。
" Lunascape5.0 rc " が最近リリースされ、「最新 の Geckoエンジン、1.9.2α1を搭載」して「世界最高速のJavaScript動作速度」を実現したと謳っている。
現在 、Firefox 3.0.x系列のベースになっているのが、Gecko 1.9.0.x。たとえば、Firefox 3.0.5であれば、Gecko 1.9.0.5というエンジンが対応する。これに対し、Firefox 3.1で はGecko 1.9.1がベースになる。「1.9.2α1」は、正確には「1.9.2a1pre」と呼ぶべきもので、今のところ1.9.1と大差ないが、新しい修正はまず1.9.2a1preに入り、重要な修正や安定性を損なわない修正だけが1.9.1側にも入る仕組みになっている。その意味で、最新のエンジンには違いない。
注意してほしいのは 、Gecko 1.9.1でさえもまだ開発中だということ。より高速で安定したものを目指して、改良が続けられている途中だ。それでも、Firefox 3.1の基盤となるエンジンだけに、既に述べたとおり投入の許される修正が制限され、アプリケーションの動作に支障が出ないように配慮されている。
他方 、Gecko 1.9.2a1preに対してはそうした制限がない。開発者の手を縛らないように、Firefoxの将来のバージョン（仮に3.2としよう）の基盤となる予定の1.9.2a1preは、レビュー済みの修正であれば投入が認められている。それでも問題が出るときは出るので、実際にプログラムを動かしてみて異常があれば、犯人である修正を撤回して対処する。また、一見動作に問題がないように見えたが、別の修正を入れたときに隠れていた問題が顕在化することもあり、それは新しいバグとして扱われる。1.9.2a1preの開発プロセスではごくふつうのことだ。
つまり 、Gecko 1.9.2a1preは最速かもしれないが、安定性の保証はほとんどゼロ。はっきりいって、これをベースに製品を構築することは想定されていない。したがって、Lunascape5.0 rcの安定性を保証するのは、開発元のLunascape Co. , Ltd.だけということになる。もしこのブラウザを使って不具合が出たとして、それを理由にMozillaの技術力を疑問視する人がいるとすれば、それはお門違いだ。
繰り返しになるが 、Firefox 3.1は安定性にも十分配慮したGecko 1.9.1エンジンをベースにする。加えて、Mozillaの品質点検チームは大量のテストケースを日々蓄積していて、正式版に近づくほど厳しいテストを課す決まりになっている。当然これをクリアするまではリリースできない。
Firefox 3.1はまだβ版の段階で、Beta 3の手前で足踏みしている状態だが、実際のところ個人的に最新の開発版を使っていて、動作に不安を感じることはない。それでもMozillaは、内部で定めた開発目標を達成するまでは、前述の品質テストにさえ回さないことにしている。そうしたストイックな姿勢だからスケジュールに遅れも出るので、もっと基準を緩めれば早くリリースできるのだろうが、これまで築き上げてきた製品の信用に傷をつけないことが第一だ。何しろ相手はMicrosoftやAppleのような大企業なのだから。
速いに越したことはないが、速ければそれでいいというものでもない。この当たり前のことを、もう一度ここで確認しておきたい。
For the second time in less than a week , Facebook has been forced to squelch a rogue application targeting users of the site .
In the most recent attack , Facebook users receive notices stating they have been reported for violating Facebook 's terms of service by someone in their friends ' list .
A link in the notification leads to an application called " " f a c e b o o k - - closing down !!! " being installed .
The application in turn spams messages out to the victim 's friends that are similar to this one : " [ Friend 's name ] has just reported you to Facebook for violating our Terms of Service . -
This is your official warning !
-
Click here to find out why you were reported !
- Request Facebook look at what has happened and rule immediatley . "
According to Sophos , Facebook appears to have removed the application .
However , the challenge of what to do about securing third - party applications remains .
Roughly a week ago , users were hit by a similar application called " Error Check System , " which posted fake error notifications in a Facebook user 's profile in its attempt to spread .
Whoever was behind that initial scheme did not stop there , though .
If victims put the phrase " Error Check System " into a Google search , one of the top results led to a site that attempted to trick visitors into downloading rogue anti-virus software .
While security vendors offered no numbers to indicate how many users had been affected by the attacks , researchers at Trend Micro noted this second attack caused enough of a stir for Facebook users to create a " Facebook Group " for those hit by the malware .
" One of the problems is that Facebook allows anybody to write an application , and third - party applications are not vetted before they are made available to the public , " blogged Sophos Senior Technology Consultant Graham Cluley .
" So , even as Facebook stamps out one malignant application , it can pop up in another place like a poisoned mushroom with a different name . "
Facebook has repeatedly said that the responsibility for securing third - party applications lies with the developers themselves .
However , some security pros fear that rogue applications will be an ongoing challenge for social networks .
" Surely these two events in just a single week mean that it's about time that Facebook reviews its application hosting policy , " blogged Trend Micro researcher Rik Ferguson .
" Prevention of rogue applications with extremely dubious intent to propagate freely within the site is needed .
Users are advised to exercise extreme caution when surfing . "

I will begin this post with a bit of an explanation .
Between one and two weeks ago , there appeared two momentous news about the manufactroversy regarding vaccines and autism .
No doubt , many SBM readers were expecting that I , as the resident maven of this particular bit of pseudoscience , would have been here last week to give you , our readers , the skinny on all of this .
Unfortunately , as some know , my wife ’s mother died , coincidentally enough , on the 200th anniversary of Darwin ’s birthday and a day when one of those two momentous bits of news was released to the public , which is why I used one of my handful of posts written and then held in reserve .
I ’m back now , though , and I do n’t think it ’s too late to comment on these bits of news because now that over a week has gone by what I ’ve seen has led me to draw some conclusions that I might not have been able to do , had I done my usual bit and been first off the mark ( at least among SBM bloggers ) discussing the story .
2008 : The Best of Years for the Antivaccine Movement
But first , let ’s take a look at last year .
In 2008 , Jenny McCarthy was the new and fresh celebrity face of the movement that believes that autism and all manner of other neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by vaccines and that the government and big pharma are suppressing The Truth .
She had emerged in the fall of 2007 after having tried to erase from the Internet her previous involvement in the “ Indigo Child ” movement in preparation for becoming an “ autism advocate ” who could write a book that could land her on Oprah ’s show .
Thanks to her and , perhaps even more so to the star power of her boyfriend Jim Carrey , who is just as wrong about vaccines and medicine as Jenny is , the antivaccine movement came roaring into prominence in a way that it had never managed to pull off before .
After all , let ’s face it , a former Playboy Playmate of the Year and a famous comedian are far more “ interesting ” public figures for various media outlets to interview than previous celebrities who spearheaded the vaccine manufactroversy , such as Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. or Don Imus and his wife Deirdre .
Indeed , Jenny ’s combination of good looks and utter obnoxiousness led to her showing up all over the media in 2008 .
For example , on April 1 ( appropriately enough ) , she appeared on Larry King Live !
and shouted down physicians who had the temerity to tell her that her Google University knowledge was just plain wrong .
The pinnacle of her influence came during the summer , when , having now supplanted J.B. Handley as the public face of the antivaccine group Generation Rescue and transforming GR into “ Jenny McCarthy ’s autism charity , ” she led the “ Green Our Vaccines ” rally in Washington , DC .
True , at most there were several hundred people there , but it got wide news attention , and Jenny was all over the news .
She rapidly followed it up by releasing a second book Mother Warriors : A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds and appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show yet again .
When Amanda Peet joined the fray on the pro-vaccine side , it let the media to portray the vaccine issue as a celebrity cat fight .
Meanwhile , thanks to Jenny ’s ties with the Playboy organization and her celebrity friends , she was able to fill Generation Rescue ’s coffers with the proceeds of celebrity “ autism ” events where luminaries such as Britney Spears , Charlie Sheen , and Hugh Hefner would show up .
Add to that her promotion of Celebrities Against Autism and her partnering with professional wrestling and celebrity poker events with Lance Armstrong , and that ’s a chunk of change that ’s allowed GR and the equally antivaccine and quackery - friendly TACA to rebrand themselves in the eyes of the public as respectable autism charities , rather than crank organizations pushing a scientifically discredited idea and thereby endangering public health .
Then there was the Hannah Poling case , which has been extensively discussed here , both by me and Steve Novella .
In brief , the government awarded compensation for vaccine injury through the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to the family of a girl named Hannah Poling , manifested a regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder after a “ catch up ” vaccination session .
It was later determined that Hannah suffers from a highly unusual mitochondrial disorder , which rendered her susceptible to neurologic injury from high fevers .
She had high fevers after the vaccine , but she had also had a series of ear infections .
The antivaccine movement has done its best to make Hannah its poster child as “ smoking gun proof ” that the government had admitted that vaccines can cause autism in susceptible children , when it had done nothing of the kind .
Because the science is difficult , and because mitochondrial disorders are so uncommon , though , David Kirby and his fellow mouthpieces at Age of Autism had a field day twisting the scientific evidence and , as Mark Crislip likes to say , making therapeutic ( or , in this case causative ) mountains out of clinical molehills .
Truly 2008 was the high water mark of the antivaccine movement .
Still , not all was positive for the the disease promotion movement , even in 2008 .
For example , the second half of the year , after at least four years of no activity there was actual pushback against it .
Amanda Peet spearheaded the Every Child By Two initiative , which was designed to encourage parents to have their children vaccinated .
Not long after , Dr. Paul Offit , to antivaccinationists the Dark Lord of Vaccines , a veritable Darth Vader , Lord Sauron , and Satan Incarnate himself , released his excellent book telling in clear , easily accessible language , exactly why scientists conclude that vaccines do not cause autism and why the various “ biomedical treatments ” recommended for “ vaccine injury ” in the form of autism are virtually all quackery .
Finally , as the year wound to a close , a group of scientists from Cornell tried to replicate the results of one of the godfathers of the antivaccine movement , Andrew Wakefield .
Wakefield ’s studies , starting in 1998 in The Lancet , had concluded that the measles virus in the MMR vaccine somehow invaded the gut and caused a syndrome that led to regressive autism and inflammatory bowel disease–and found no correlation between MMR vaccination and any such syndrome .
Andrew Wakefield , as you recall , is the man who , more than anyone else , caused the anti-MMR scare in the U.K. and Europe that has resulted in the resurgence of measles .
Indeed , he is a hero of the antivaccine movement , so much so that the antivaccine propaganda blog Age of Autism gave him the “ Galileo Award ” for 2008 , completely ignoring the fact that , for a “ maverick scientist , ” it is not sufficient to be reviled .
One must also be right , which Wakefield was most assuredly not .
Because one of the two body blows to the antivaccine movement that have already occurred in 2009 involves Andrew Wakefield , this is the perfect place to segue from the best of years for antivaccinationists to ( thus far ) the worst of years .
2009 : The Worst of Years , thanks to Andrew Wakefield
As 2009 dawned , the antivaccine movement seemed strong and getting stronger .
Having successfully framed themselves as “ pro-safe vaccine , not antivaccine ” and popularized the cleverly Orwellian slogans “ Green Our Vaccines ” and “ Too Many Too Soon , ” they had stoked fear of vaccination on both sides of the Atlantic , to the point where vaccination rates had begun to fall below the level necessary for herd immunity , and outbreaks of vaccine - preventable diseases were becoming apparent .
In the U.K. , thanks to Andrew Wakefield and the antivaccine movement his work had spawned , over the last decade , MMR vaccination rates had fallen below 80 % ( and in some parts of London , below 60 % ) , leading a disease once considered defeated to come roaring back to the point where last year U.K. health authorities had to admit that it is once again endemic .
Meanwhile in the U.S. , outbreaks of vaccine - preventable diseaseas were occurring among unvaccinated populations , such as in Minnesota , while measles was also making a comeback .
One thing I could never understand about Andrew Wakefield is why so many believed him .
The British press ate his bad science up and were complicit in contributing to the decline in vaccination rates that endanger public health now .
I , for one , was not at all surprised at the first blow to the antivaccine movement that occurred in 2009 , namely Brian Deer ’s revelations that Andrew Wakefield had almost certainly falsified data used in his original 1998 Lancet paper .
Specifically , and in brief , this is what Wakefield was found to have done :
However , our investigation , confirmed by evidence presented to the General Medical Council ( GMC ) , reveals that :
In most of the 12 cases , the children ’s ailments as described in The Lancet were different from their hospital and GP records .
Although the research paper claimed that problems came on within days of the jab , in only one case did medical records suggest this was true , and in many of the cases medical concerns had been raised before the children were vaccinated .
Hospital pathologists , looking for inflammatory bowel disease , reported in the majority of cases that the gut was normal .
This was then reviewed and the Lancet paper showed them as abnormal .
A detailed account by investigative journalist Brian Deer ( whom I met during his visit to the University of Michigan two weeks ago ) can be found here , as can an account of how the MMR scare led to a return of the measles .
It ’s not as though this revelation should have come as a surprise .
After all , the signs had all been there right from the beginning that something was not right , indeed at least as early as 2002 .
Indeed , advocates of science - based medicine everywhere owe Brian Deer a huge debt of gratitude for having pursued this case for so long , as this is what he found out about Wakefield and his work .
Moreover , it ’s not as though warning signs were n’t there in the very paper .
As Brian Deer described at the University of Michigan a couple of weeks ago , something did n’t smell right in the Lancet paper .
What he meant was that the results looked too good to be true .
The original 1998 Lancet paper made two key claims based on its findings studying twelve children , which , according to the Wakefield , had been , “ consecutively referred to the pediatric gastroenterology unit at the Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine in London .
First , it claimed that eight of the twelve children studied had manifested developmental regression within two weeks of the MMR vaccine , and one had developed regression after a measles infection , the clear implication being that there was a close temporal relationship between MMR vaccination and the onset of regression in 75 % of the children .
The second claim was that all 12 of the children demonstrated “ intestinal abnormalities , ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration . ”
Although the paper stated that the authors “ did not prove an association between measles , mumps , and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described ” and that “ virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue , ” Wakefield at his press conference to announce the findings stated that he had preliminary virological evidence showing measles virus in the gut .
It took him four years to follow up these results with a paper in Molecular Pathology that reported measles virus in 75/91 children with ileal inflammation and children with developmental disorders .
Although Wakefield was careful not to use the word autism in the actual text of the paper–or even the word vaccine – the implication of the paper was plain , and , if it was n’t to some , Wakefield made sure to drive home what he thought the implication was :
That the MMR is associated with a syndrome of developmental disorders , including autism , and inflammatory bowel disease .
Unfortunately for Wakefield , Deer ’s instincts ultimately proved to be correct .
The first shoe to drop was Deer ’s 2004 Channel 4 documentary exposing Wakefield ’s incompetence and conflicts of interest .
As it turned out , Wakefield did not have the viral data in 1998 .
Indeed , a young investigator named Nicholas Chadwick had been unable to detect measles virus in any of the samples from the 12 children and had told Wakefield .
Wakefield kept that data out of the original Lancet paper because it did not support his hypothesis .
How , then , to explain Wakefield ’s subsequent paper in 2002 that reported the detection of measles virus sequences in a large proportion of the ileal biopsy specimens of children with “ autistic enterocolitis ” ?
In 2007 , during the beginning of the proceedings for the test cases in the Autism Omnibus case ( more on that in the next section ) , Stephen Bustin , arguably the preeminent expert in the use of the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) to detect DNA sequences , testified for the government about the methods used in the laboratory that did the PCR analysis for Andrew Wakefield .
Suffice it to say that this had to be about the sloppiest laboratory I ’ve ever seen .
Also suffice it to say that the negative controls were amplifying measles sequence , meaning that it was impossible to tell a signal was a true signal or a false positive .
In fact , Bustin ’s investigation concluded that what Wakefield was reporting was almost certainly all contamination from plasmids made in an adjacent laboratory .
Ironically , this was the same laboratory that participated in the 2008 attempt to replicate Wakefield ’s results .
Clearly , it had cleaned up its act by then .
The other problem revealed in the 2004 documentary was that Andrew Wakefield had a massive conflict of interest .
Teamed up with antivaccination crank extraordinaire Hugh Fudenberg , he had come up with a combination single agent vaccine / therapeutic ( which he characterized as a “ cure for autism “ ) agent based on the quack favorite “ transfer factor . ”
Not only this , but he had filed patent applications for this concoction .
In other words , Wakefield stood to profit handsomely if the MMR was discredited as being safe .
Not long after these revelations , ten of the thirteen authors of the original 1998 Lancet report renounced its conclusions and asked to have their names removed from the paper .
But it was even worse than that .
At the end of 2006 , the second shoe dropped .
It turned out that Wakefield ’s conflict of interest was even worse than that .
In fact , it turned out that Wakefield had been paid by lawyers seeking to sue vaccine manufacturers for “ injury ” due to the MMR .
In fact , his services had been bought and paid for to the tune of paid £ 435,643 in fees , plus £ 3,910 expenses .
Neither this conflict of interest nor the conflict of interest inherent in having an alternative vaccine for measles , a single vaccine , with its patent pending were reported in the Lancet paper .
It was these revelations that triggered an investigation by the General Medical Council in the U.K. into research malfeasance and ethic violations .
But it was even worse than that .
Unfortunately , it took two more years to find out just how bad .
Two weeks ago , Brian Deer reported in the Sunday Times that , not only had Andrew Wakefield had massive conflicts of interest , but he had falsified data in his original paper .
Indeed , consistent with the revelations that there had never been any detectable measles viral sequences , Deer reported that one father had taken his child ’s specimen to be tested by a different laboratory and that that laboratory had failed to find any trace of measles virus .
More importantly , however , none of the children studied for the Lancet paper actually even came from the Royal Free Hospital ’s catchment area of North London ; indeed , none of them even came from London .
In fact , they were not “ consecutively referred , ” either .
Rather , they had been recruited through the anti-MMR antivaccine underground and 11/12 of them were involved in anti-MMR litigation .
Thus , they were a highly selected group .
In addition , ccording to Deer ’s account of the records examined by the GMC , in most of these children autistic features were present before they had received their MMR vaccination and in others such features only became apparent after a much longer interval than a few days after MMR .
In other words , what was reported in the Lancet paper in 1998 and what was found in the children ’s medical records differed significantly .
In other words , one of two things happened , neither of which is flattering to Wakefield .
Either he took the history only from parents , who were litigants in vaccine injury cases and for whom confirmation bias could easily have led to remembering incorrectly that their child ’s behavioral changes were noted shortly after the MMR rather than before it or months later .
If this was the case , Wakefield was incompetent for not having examined the medical records .
Alternatively , Wakefield did examine the medical records and lied about them in the Lancet paper .
If this is the case , he is dishonest .
In fact , I might have been willing to give Wakefield somewhat of the benefit of the doubt , viewing the discrepancies between the medical records and what he reported in the Lancet paper as being yet more evidence of his incompetence and his resultant shoddy research methodology rather than dishonesty , were it not for the major discrepancies between what Wakefield said about the histology of the biopsy specimens in the paper .
What was reported in the paper does not jibe with what the pathologists who first examined the specimens saw , where , in all 12 cases , no abnormalities had been reported on the initial examination of the specimens .
Yet Wakefield reported a distinctive pattern of gut inflammation , specifically “ colitis and ileal - lymphoid - nodular hyperplasia . ”
The Lancet paper had pointed out the “ uniformity ” of the pathological changes .
What had happened ?
Not happy with the readings of the pathologists , apparently Wakefield ’s research team met for a “ research review ” of the biopsy specimens .
This in and of itself is not unusual .
However , it is unusual that the research team overturned the original readings of so many of the specimens .
It is even more unusual ( i.e. , suspicious ) that the reinterpretations of the original readings all went in the same direction : towards a reading of inflammation consistent with Wakefield ’s hypothesis that the measles virus from the MMR was somehow involved in causing gut abnormalities and autistic regression .
Even if I wanted to attribute Wakefield ’s problems to incompetence , it ’s pretty hard to do , given the confluence of evidence from multiple sources pointing to malfeasance .
2009 : The Worst of Years , as the Special Masters Weigh In
If the revelations about Andrew Wakefield ’s research fraud were the only event thus far , 2009 would already be shaping up to be a bad year for antivaccinationists .
However , less than a week after Deer ’s revelations were reported , the long - awaited ruling in a huge legal action made up of approximately 5,000 parents who are convinced that vaccines caused their children ’s autism .
I ’m referring to the Autism Omnibus proceedings .
In the U.S. , because of rising litigation that jeopardized the vaccine program and threatened to drive pharmaceutical companies out of the vaccine business , Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 ( Public Law 99-660 ) , which created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ( VICP ) .
The idea was to create an alternative to the tort system through which people injured by vaccines could be efficiently compensated .
Vaccine litigants , if denied compensation , could still sue in conventional courts , but all claims for compensation had to go first through the VICP .
Moreover , the standards of evidence in the Vaccine Court of the VICP are arguably markedly lower than in conventional federal courts .
For example , Daubert rules for scientific evidence do not apply .
Indeed , all that is necessary is a scientifically plausible - sounding mechanism by which a plaintiff might have been injured by vaccines , and compensation can be awarded .
In essence , lowering the Daubert standard and allowing “ science ” that has not yet been peer reviewed makes meeting the standard of evidence showing a 51 % or greater chance that the plaintiff was injured by the vaccine in question easier because it opened the door to an antivaccinationist version of the Gish Gallup , forcing the defense to answer and refute all sorts of bad science .
Be that as it may , as the number of litigants claiming that vaccines caused their children ’s autism ballooned to close to 5,000 , threatening to bankrupt the VICP unless massive infusions of new money from Congress were provided , it was decided that the proceedings should be bundled into one massive legal action known as the Autism Omnibus .
As part of this proceeding , litigants were to choose what they considered to be the best cases representing their hypothesis of causation by which vaccines could produce autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders .
The court would hear these cases , make a rulings , and then these rulings would be used as the basis for all similar cases as follows :
The Petitioners ’ Steering Committee ( PSC ) has advanced three different theories of “ general causation , ” i.e. , how the vaccines involved can cause autism , in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding .
The Office of Special Masters ( OSM ) has assigned three Special Masters to resolve the autism cases .
The OSM instructed the PSC to designate three “ test cases ” for each of the three theories , a total of nine test cases .
The three theories of “ general causation ” are : ( 1 ) the theory that MMR vaccines and thimerosal - containing vaccines can combine to cause autism ; ( 2 ) the theory that thimerosal - containing vaccines can cause autism ; and , ( 3 ) the theory that MMR vaccines , without regard to any thimerosal additive , can cause autism .
After more than a year and a half after the proceedings began , on February 12 , the Special Masters released its decisions on the first three test cases , Cedillo v. HHS ( Case No. 98-916V ) , Hazlehurst v. HHS ( Case No. 03-654V ) and Snyder v. HHS ( Case No. 01-162V ) .
In all three cases , despite the “ best ” that the antivaccine contingent could throw at the courts , the Special Masters decisively rejected all three hypotheses of causation .
Indeed , the results surprised me , as I had expected , given the extremely low bar for evidence , that there would have been a little bit of wiggle room in the decisions that would leave the door open for the antivaccine fringe to claim that there was a possibility that further causation cases would be entertained .
No such wiggle room was granted .
Since the decisions together run hundreds of pages , this article has become quite long , and other bloggers have posted excerpts , I will be judicious in selecting key quotes .
First , from the ruling on Cedillo v. HHS , written by Special Master George L. Hastings , Jr. , we have these :
“ This case , however , is not a close case .
The overall weight of the evidence is overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners ’ causation theories .
The result of this case would be the same even if I totally ignored the epidemiologic evidence , declined to consider the video evidence , and / or excluded the testimony of Dr. Bustin .
The result would be the same if I restricted my consideration to the evidence originally filed into the record of this Cedillo case , disregarding the general causation evidence from the Hazlehurst and Snyder cases .
The petitioners ’ evidence has been unpersuasive on many different points , concerning virtually all aspects of their causation theories , each such deficiency having been discussed in detail above .
The petitioners have failed to persuade me that there is validity to any of their general causation arguments , and have also failed to persuade me that there is any substantial likelihood that Michelle ’s MMR vaccination contributed in any way to the causation of any of Michelle ’s own disorders . ”
“ Nor do I doubt that Michelle ’s parents and relatives are sincere in their belief that the MMR vaccine played a role in causing Michelle ’s devastating disorders .
Certainly , the mere fact that Michelle ’s autistic symptoms first became evident to her family during the months after her MMR vaccination might make them wonder about a possible causal connection .
Further , the Cedillos have read about physicians who profess to believe in a causal connection between the MMR vaccine and both autism and chronic gastrointestinal problems .
They have visited at least one physician , Dr. Krigsman , who has explicitly opined that Michelle ’s own chronic gastrointestinal symptoms are MMR - caused .
And they have even been told that a medical laboratory has positively identified the presence of the persisting vaccine - strain measles virus in Michelle ’s body , years after her vaccination .
After studying the extensive evidence in this case for many months , I am convinced that the reports and advice given to the Cedillos by Dr. Krigsman and some other physicians , advising the Cedillos that there is a causal connection between Michelle ’s MMR vaccination and her chronic conditions , have been very wrong .
Unfortunately , the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty , in my view , of gross medical misjudgment .
Nevertheless , I can understand why the Cedillos found such reports and advice to be believable under the circumstances .
I conclude that the Cedillos filed this Program claim in good faith . ”
Next , from the second case , Hazlehurst v. HHS , Special Master Patricia Campbell - Smith concluded :
Having carefully and fully considered the evidence , the undersigned concludes that the combination of the thimerosal - containing vaccines and the MMR vaccine are not causal factors in the development of autism and therefore , could not have contributed to the development of Yates ’ autism .
The weight of the presented evidence that is scientifically reliable and methodologically sound does not support petitioners ’ claim .
Petitioners have failed to establish entitlement to compensation under the Vaccine Act .
Finally , from the third case , Snyder v. HHS , Special Master Denise Vowell wrote :
To conclude that Colten ’s condition was the result of his MMR vaccine , an objective observer would have to emulate Lewis Carroll ’s White Queen and be able to believe six impossible ( or , at least , highly improbable ) things before breakfast .
The families of children with ASD and the court have waited in vain for adequate evidence to support the autism - MMR hypothesis .
Although I have the deepest sympathy for families like Colten ’s , struggling emotionally and financially to find answers about ASD ’s causes , and reliable therapies to treat ASD ’s symptoms , I must decide Colten ’s case based on the evidence before me .
That evidence does not establish an adequate factual basis from which to conclude that Colten ’s condition was caused by his vaccines .
Petitioners have not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Colten ’s condition was either caused or significantly aggravated by his vaccinations
Thus , they have failed to establish entitlement to compensation and the petition for compensation is therefore DENIED .
Ow .
That last one ’s going to leave a mark .
A more emphatic refutation is hard to imagine .
Even better , Special Master Hastings recognized one of the main drivers of the scare over the MMR and vaccines in general as a “ cause ” of autism : Money .
Indeed , a veritable cottage industry of “ biomedical ” quackery , dubious therapies , and pseudoscience depends upon keeping the idea that vaccines cause autism alive .
“ Luminaries ” of this cottage industry include the aforementioned Andrew Wakefield , who has now infested the United States ( the State of Texas , specifically ) with his brand of quackery at Thoughtful House , now that the U.K. is investigating him .
Also included are Mark and David Geier , who have been touting the use of a powerful anti-sex steroid medication to treat autistic children , and , until recently , Dr. Rashid Buttar , who is now facing sanctions by the North Carolina Board of Medical Examiners and has been banned from treating children .
Add to that ambulance - chasing lawyers like Clifford Shoemaker , who have been raking in money hand over fist , thanks to the fact that the VICP actually pays the petitioners ’ attorney fees regardless of whether the petition results in compensation , and it is easy to see why this industry wo n’t easily let parents be disabused of the fears over vaccines that it has stoked .
( Indeed , Shoemaker even tried to abuse the subpoena process in order to quash reports of how much money he was making representing VICP litigants , an action for which he was sanctioned by the courts . )
In the case of Andrew Wakefield , attorneys looking for big payouts from the pharmaceutical industry have even paid for research .
Meanwhile , as documented on this blog before , some researchers producing reports implicating vaccines in autism are actually petitioners in the Autism Omnibus , for example , Laura Hewitson , whose husband works for Wakefield , while compounding pharmacies advertise their supplements and other dubious “ remedies ” right on the Age of Autism .
Those of us who support science - and evidence - based medicine were quite heartened by the revelations about Andrew Wakefield and the ruling in the Autism Omnibus .
True , we wondered why it took 11 years for the revelations about Wakefield ’s incompetence and outright fraud to see the light of day , but we were glad that they finally had .
One reason is that , to the vast majority of lay people who are parents , the science is hard to understand , and the antivaccine movement had , more or less successfully , framed the issue as big pharma protecting its interests and a conflict between “ brave maverick ” doctors against government and pharma experts .
However , fraud is something that people understand all too well .
Demonstrating that Wakefield ’s results were riddled not just with conflicts of interest but with outright scientific fraud made the issue very clear , driving home that there was no scientific basis to suspect that the MMR had anything to do with autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders .
Similarly , the ruling of the Vaccine Court on the first three test cases surprised me .
As I mentioned earlier , I had expected some wiggle room and was heartened to see that , contrary to what I had expected , science won unequivocally and resoundingly in court , at least in this case .
Antivaccinationists circle the wagons
The reaction of the antivaccine fringe to the rulings of the Special Masters and the revelations about Andrew Wakefield ’s scientific fraud are instructive .
Let ’s examine the reaction to the Wakefield revelations first .
I do n’t know about you , but if I passionatedly believed that the MMR vaccine causes autism or , even worse , caused autism in my child , I would be feeling very betrayed right now .
In fact , I ’d turn on Wakefield like a wild boar .
But that ’s just me .
Apparently , that ’s not the reaction of most of the antivaccine fringe .
Indeed , the antivaccine propaganda blog Age of Autism and David Kirby , along with other antivaccine groups , immediately orchestrated a smear campaign against Brian Deer based on the flimsiest of pretenses .
For example , in response to Keith Olbermann ’s having correctly picked Andrew Wakefield as his “ worst person in the world ” for February 10 , 2009 , David Kirby cleverly played upon Olbermann ’s hatred of Rupert Murdoch , pointing out that The Times of London is a Murdoch paper .
This allowed Kirby to brag before the February 11 “ Worst Person in the World ” segment that he had persuaded Olbermann to name Brian Deer as one of the “ worst persons in the world , ” even publishing the script .
Truly , Olbermann had been played for a fool by the antivaccine movement .
The specious claim ?
That somehow Deer had a huge conflict of interest because he made the complaint to the GMC about Wakefield , a meme started by the British version of David Kirby , Melanie Phillips .
It ’s also a claim that , even if true , would mean nothing , as it does absolutely nothing to refute the findings in Deer ’s reporting or the results thus far of the GMC ’s investigation .
Indeed , the ad hominems went beyond that .
For example , Jane Bryant of OneClick Group has tried to paint Brian Deer as “ out of control , ” during which she could n’t seem to resist trying homophobia on for size , stating :
By all accounts a gay man and therefore unlikely ever to have to face the multiple vaccine risk agonised over by parents from around the world in relation to their children , Brian Deer has made it his business to portray the parents of these autistic vaccine damaged children as deluded mendacious chancers .
I find this particularly ironic and despicable , given that chief antivaccine propagandist David Kirby is almost certainly also gay and that his previous jobs have included reporting for Outweek and The Advocate .
One ’s sexual orientation is completely irrelevant to one ’s arguments .
Only data , evidence , reason , and science should matter .
Finally , when all else fails , the antivaccine movement plays the conspiracy card , as John Stone of the British antivaccine group Cry Shame did on –where else ?
–Age of Autism :
And yet the medical and political establishment has been constructing its case against Wakefield on Deer ’s reporting for the last five years .
It was on the back of his first report that Wakefield was held to be “ discredited ” and the world was brow - beaten into believing it was so .
UK National Health Service websites link up to Deer ’s website , and the longest medical disciplinary hearing in British history was launched on the basis of his complaint .
It is a game in which everybody hides behind everybody else , pretending they ca n’t be seen – but actually they are all standing there , and their trousers are down .
Never once does it occur to Stone or , for instance , any of the pro-Wakefield commenters here that the reason Wakefield is in such trouble is because he is a dishonest , incompetent , and unethical scientist .
This , of course , is a perfect segue into the reaction to the Autism Omnibus rulings , which cranked the antivaccine fringe into ever more histrionic fits of conspiracy mongering .
Indeed , leave it to our “ old friend ” J.B. Handley to connect the two by insinuating that the U.S. Department of Justice had tipped off Brian Deer somehow , so that his revelations could be published in close temporal proximity to the announcement of the first Autism Omnibus rulings :
That said , I found it rather odd that Brian Deer torpedoed Andy over the weekend with a seemingly made - up outrage piece , only days before the judges ruled in the Vaccine Court .
The timing struck me as odd .
Meanwhile , the ever- reliable antivaccine advocate Kent Heckenlively , whose understanding of science is astonishingly bad , posted “ analyses ” of each decision .
Some tidbits follow .
Regarding the Cedillo decision :
In his closing remarks he notes that the decision was not even close , and that the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who saw an opportunity to take advantage of a family who thought their child had been injured by a vaccine .
As much as those of who have children with autism and choose to help them are under great stress , I just viscerally respond to this attack against those physicians who are doing their best to help our children .
They choose to enter this fight , knowing they will be attacked , but strengthened by the conviction they can help some of our children .
To many of them , we owe our children ’s future .
And when they have not been able to find the answer , they continue to fight .
It is apparent to anybody who looks at this unfolding tragedy that the pharmaceutical companies have no interest in helping us , the medical universities and research facilities can offer us no help , and now we know we have no friends in the vaccine court .
Regarding the Hazlehurst decision :
The sad truth of the matter is that we are massively out - gunned in terms of research dollars .
The medical personnel who undertake our cause do it knowing full well there will be many defeats .
Judges will be dazzled by experts who claim to know so much , except for the question of what causes autism .
And , finally , regarding the Snyder decision :
I ’ve tried to figure out how to explain this decision , and the best I can come up with is an example from the book , “ Blink ” by Malcom Gladwell .
In the book Gladwell recounts the difficulty female musicians had in being hired by professional orchestras , particularly for the wind instruments .
They were thought to lack the lung capacity of men .
But when the auditions began to use screens , so the conductors could n’t see the gender of the person playing , the number of women hired by professional orchestras increased five - fold .
Now the conductors would probably have sworn they were free of sexism , and may have truly believed it , but something else was clearly at work .
Although the claim was made that they were simply listening to the music and picking the best people , the different results obtained after the use of the screens showed a significantly different mental process going on .
I can only conclude that something similar is at work in the minds of the Special Masters , and perhaps many people who will look at what we allege .
Despite their efforts to carefully weigh the evidence , something else is tipping the scales .
I do n’t believe it ’s money , at least in the crudest sense of the word .
It ’s money in the sense that it ’s built the entire edifice and world - view in which the Special Masters are looking at these claims .
Or , to translate :
The pharmaceutical companies paid for the verdict , and the judges were unconsciously biased against all those “ brave maverick doctors ” testifying for the plaintiffs .
But perhaps clearest , most blatant “ it was fixed ” argument comes from Dr. Jay “ Do n’t Call Me Antivaccine ” Gordon in two posts he wrote for that repository for antivaccine posturing , The Huffington Post , entitled “ There Is No Proof that Cigarettes Cause Cancer ” and The Vaccine Court Was Wrong .
Let ’s take a look at his first bit of idiocy :
It took fifty years before the courts finally acknowledged that cigarette smoking causes cancer .
There were billions of dollars at stake .
The dozens of court decisions that there “ was no proof ” were supported by physicians , expert witnesses of all types and hundreds of millions of dollars spent on attorneys .
Experts and doctors alike stated over and over again that we need not continue studying this issue because there was just no proof .
Let me state very simply , vaccines can cause autism .
No real scientist would encourage us to stop studying this possibility .
Note the blatant straw man argument ( “ No real scientist would encourage us to stop studying this possibility ” ) .
Note the specious and false comparison that antivaccine advocates love to use : Comparing tobacco research to vaccine research .
No matter how easy it is to demonstrate how wrong they are , they think it ’s a slam dunk comparison that bolsters their paranoid , conspiracy mongering world view .
After all , decades ago , scientists kept finding scientific and epidemiological evidence that tobacco smoking causes lung cancer and all manner of other health problems .
Tobacco companies funded a well - financed denialist campaign of lies , bad science , and outright pseudoscience to try to convince the public that there was no link between smoking and cancer in order to protect their profits and forestall the regulation or banning of cigarettes by the government .
So to antivaccinationists , it seems perfectly reasonable to claim that claiming that vaccines cause autism is the same thing , except with the evil big pharma vaccine manufacturers suppressing the “ truth ” to protect their profits and keep themselves safe from lawsuits .
Note another thing .
Note the absolute certainty with which Dr. Jay states unequivocally that “ vaccines can cause autism . ”
He even uses boldface and italics in the font , but that is n’t even enough to convey his level of certainty .
He has to underline it too !
( I congratulate him for his restraint in not using all caps as well . )
Note that Dr. Jay ’s certainty comes with no scientific evidence presented whatsoever to support it .
None . Zero. Zip. Nada .
This is very consistent with his past behavior , in which he apparently believes that simply asserting something is the same as proving it .
It is n’t ; argument by assertion is the lamest form of argument .
In any case , apparently , just like the antivaccine movement for which he is an apologist , Dr. Jay just knows that vaccines cause autism , science be damned .
Indeed , he demonstrates this utter belief–not science , belief –that the “ proof ” will someday be found :
The proof is not there yet .
It will be found .
Let ’s hope it does n’t take another fifty years and hundreds of court cases to convince the government and the public .
Private industry is once again duping the FDA , doctors and the public .
The conflicts of interest are obscene and illegal .
The diseases against which we vaccinate are still dangerous and still present in other countries and in America but simple risk / benefit analysis would show that the risks from the way vaccines are manufactured and administered far outweighs the risks of harm from these relatively rare illnesses .
Sure thing , Dr. Jay , and The Truth Is Out There .
Fox Mulder and Dana Scully have taught us this , and Dr. Jay wants to believe .
Oh , does he ever want to believe !
And that ’s why these two victories for science will not , as many hope , put a damper on the antivaccine movement .
They just wo n’t .
To those who cling to the scientifically discredited idea that vaccines cause autism against the mountains of evidence that do not support it , as Kev points out , it is not about science .
It is about winning and convincing people that they are right .
It is about finding someone or something to “ blame ” for their children ’s autism .
To them , doctors have no authority .
Scientists have no authority .
The Special Masters have no authority .
The scientific method means nothing .
Only their personal experiences and the conclusions they draw from them , no matter how fallible humans are at drawing inferences from them , matter .
To them , as Dr. Jay Gordon made explicit when he spoke to the “ Green Our Vaccines ” rally last summer , and said that his die hard belief that vaccines cause autism is based on states that he bases his conclusions that vaccines probably cause more harm than good on “ over 30 years ” of his own experience and above all ( emphasis mine ) “ listening to you , ” meaning the parents who believe vaccines “ injured ” their children .
That ’s because the battle between parents who believe that vaccines cause autism and scientists is a battle about , more than anything else , two world views .
Scientists , knowing how easily humans fool themselves into confusing correlation with causation when drawing conclusions from personal experience and anecdotes , rely on epidemiology and the scientific method to answer the question of whether vaccination is associated with autism .
In contrast , the believers cannot accept that they can be fooled .
Dr. Rahul K. Parikh described this conflict well in a recent article on the Omnibus decision :
Among those expressing shock and disappointment was Rebecca Estepp , the mother of an autistic child , who is one of the claimants and the national manager of the advocacy group Talk About Curing Autism .
“ It ’s tough when you ’re taking parent support calls and you hear the same story day after day , ” she told the Wall Street Journal .
“ When does anecdotal evidence become enough ? ”
Her question is n’t a new one , especially in a society where belief , emotion and science so often conflict .
For scientists , the answer to Estepp ’s question is never .
Developing a hypothesis from anecdotes or observations ( whether one or a hundred of them ) is merely the first step in a longer process .
Next comes the hard part : testing that hypothesis to see if you can back it up with hard data , and then sharing the data with others to see if they can reproduce the findings , often multiple times .
Even more accurately , Dr. Parikh states :
Now , read that headline again : “ Vaccines Did n’t Cause Autism , Court Rules . ”
It does n’t say , “ Vaccines Did n’t Cause Autism , a Decade ’s Worth of Rigorously Conducted and Verified Medical Research Rules . ”
That may not be as sexy as the recent headline , but it is the truth .
The scientific community disproved the vaccine - autism connection long ago , multiple times .
Which is true ( except that it ’s well over a decade ’s worth of research ) , and to which I would add :
The scientific community only continues to study the vaccine - autism connection , churning out negative study after negative study because it hopes to convince those who are unconvinceable by science .
Indeed , just how unconvinceable they are is summed up in this poem by Rolf Hazelhurst , the father of one of the three complainants :
If we win , we keep going .
If we lose , we keep going .
If we win , the going will be easier .
If we lose , the going will be more difficult .
However , the Court rules , we will keep going .
That is a religious , cultish attitude .
A little thing like a news report revealing the hero of the antivaccine movement to be a scientific fraud or a court ruling that , even under the most favorable standards of evidence imaginable , vaccines do not cause autism will not change the mind of someone like this , nor will it make the antivaccine movement have second thoughts about its cultish beliefs .
The only hope that we who support science - based medicine can have is that these two body blows to the antivaccine movement will finally –finally !
– drive home the message to the media that , when it comes to the claim that vaccines cause autism , there ’s no there there , as they say .
We can also hope that the fence - sitters , those parents who may have heard Jenny McCarthy ranting about how vaccines caused her son Evan ’s autism and how she cured him with various biomedical interventions may see these two repudiations of the myth that vaccines cause autism and be reassured .
A guy can hope , ca n’t he ?
BBC refuses to show emergency relief appeal for Gaza
By Niall Green
28 January 2009
There has been broad condemnation of the decision by the British public service broadcaster the BBC to refuse to show an appeal for humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza organised by the Disasters Emergency Committee ( DEC ) of aid charities .
The corporation is the only terrestrial broadcaster in the United Kingdom to refuse to air the appeal , which aims to raise funds to provide emergency relief to the thousands of Palestinians facing a humanitarian catastrophe in the war - torn Gaza Strip .
The DEC is a blanket organisation representing many aid charities , including the Red Cross , Christian Aid , Islamic Relief , Oxfam and Save the Children .
Their appeal requested support from the British public to buy food , medicine and blankets for the tens of thousands of Gazans left hungry and homeless by the Israeli assault on territory .
BBC Director General Mark Thompson claimed that airing the DEC appeal would put the corporation 's impartiality at risk by giving the impression the BBC was " backing one side " over the other .
" The public wants us to be very strict about our impartiality , and it is my job to protect that impartiality , " said Thompson , who denied claims that the decision had been made to appease pro-Israel lobbyists .
The director general also offered the unsubstantiated suggestion that the BBC could not guarantee that aid would reach the victims .
According to the Guardian newspaper , Brendan Gormley , the DEC 's chief executive , had informed the BBC that the appeal would raise money " for all those affected by the recent conflict , " indicating that they would provide aid to people in southern Israel if needed .
Veteran Labour MP
Gerald Kaufman claimed the BBC had responded to " nasty pressure " from " very active and not very pleasant Israeli diplomatic representation in Britain . "
Over 11,000 viewers have contacted the BBC to complain about its refusal to air the appeal .
The other main television broadcasters ITV , Channel 4 and Five aired the DEC message Monday evening .
The decision is widely opposed within the BBC itself .
Former BBC journalist and independent MP Martin Bell wrote in the Guardian : " The refusal to transmit the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal has left it isolated and exposed .
Its senior journalists feel betrayed , but dare not speak out because of their terms of service . "
One unnamed BBC news sources stated : " Feelings are running extremely high and there is widespread disgust at the BBC 's top management .
There is widespread anger and frustration at the BBC 's refusal to allow people to speak out about it . "
In a joint statement journalists ' union the NUJ and the broadcaster 's union BECTU said the BBC 's choice was " cowardly and in danger of being seen as politically motivated . "
Several artists and broadcasters have criticised the BBC , including actress Samantha Morton , who claimed she would never work for the corporation again due to its " horrific " and " disgusting " decision .
Mohammed Shafiq , head of the Ramadhan Foundation , a British Muslim youth organisation , condemned the BBC .
" Whatever our positions or views on the Gaza crisis the innocent victims in Gaza need our help and support and the BBC has a public duty to broadcast this appeal , " Shafiq said .
The Sky News channel , part of the media empire of the staunchly pro-Zionist billionaire Rupert Murdoch , has also refused to show the DEC message , insisting that it would be " incompatible " with its objectivity .
Sky News announced its decision a few hours before the appeal was due to be broadcast on the other main channels .
Despite the BBC 's claim that it is only interested in defending its " impartiality , " the corporation has broadcast DEC appeals for aid in other war zones .
For example , it showed DEC films requesting aid for the victims of the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Darfur region of Sudan .
Last year the BBC showed an appeal for victims of the cyclone that hit Burma , despite the politicisation of aid by the Western powers and widespread criticism of the Burmese junta 's commitment to distributing supplies .
The BBC has form when it comes to refusing to air public appeals on the grounds of " impartiality . "
The BBC used this justification regarding an appeal for aid to Lebanon in 2006 following the Israeli war against Hezbollah and its supporters , in which hundreds of civilians died and much of the country 's infrastructure was targeted for destruction .
When it comes to charitable appeals , the BBC are quite prepared to show them if the plight of the victims can readily be attributed to regimes such as those of Sudan or Burma , which are subject to the threats of London and Washington .
But when the victims are civilians slaughtered and made destitute by a key ally of British imperialism such as Israel it seems that Broadcasting House cannot seek to raise the flag of impartiality quickly enough .
In fact , the claims of " objectivity " and " impartiality " that Thompson and the BBC are using to justify their decision not to show the charity appeal stand in contrast to the actual content of their news reportage on the Gaza conflict .
Despite the overwhelming devastation that was rained down on the almost completely defenceless and impoverished population of Gaza , BBC news reports insisted on giving roughly equal coverage to the few homemade rockets being fired by Hamas militants into southern Israel .
At the end of Israel 's assault on Gaza the Palestinian death toll stood at over a thousand , the majority civilians , including hundreds of women and children .
Israel suffered 13 fatalities , ten of them soldiers .
Throughout the conflict , the corporation treated Israel 's claim that it was acting in self - defence as good coin .
It provided Israeli military spokespeople with ample opportunity to state their case , usually with few or no probing follow - up questions from journalists .
Opposing statements by Hamas or Palestinian Authority representatives were rarely shown .
Nor did the BBC seriously take up the Israeli government 's refusal to allow international journalists into Gaza in an effort to cover - up the scale of IDF atrocities .
Around 120 Members of Parliament have backed a parliamentary motion criticising the BBC and Sky for not showing the appeal .
Cabinet ministers Douglas Alexander and Hazel Blears weighed in .
Alexander , the International Development Secretary , called on the BBC to consider that " People are suffering right now ; many hundreds of thousands of people are without the basic necessities of life . "
The prime minister 's website posts a link to the DEC appeal .
All this is sheer hypocrisy .
Alexander , like the rest of the Labour government of Gordon Brown , has refused to condemn Israel 's war crimes in Gaza or its blockade of the territory since Hamas came to power in 2006 .
The British government fully endorsed the Israeli claims that it acted in " self - defence " against " terrorist " Hamas , despite Israel 's bombardment of civilian targets including United Nations run schools and hospitals .
The government 's criticism of the BBC effectively sealed the corporation 's decision regarding the DEC appeal .
BBC Trust Chairman Sir Michael
Lyons warned that such comments from government ministers came " close to constituting undue interference in the editorial independence of the BBC . "
Thus , Thompson could not reverse his decision , even if he wanted to , as it would appear he had bowed to political demands .
The publicly - owned broadcaster is an anathema to a substantial section of the British bourgeoisie , who resent it as a limitation on its ability to make profit and for its supposedly " pinko liberal " editorial views .
While issuing crocodile tears for the civilians in Gaza , most of the British press has used the issue as a stick to beat the BBC with .
Melanie Phillips , commentator for the right - wing tabloid the Daily Mail supported Thompson 's refusal to show the appeal but said this was nonetheless an indicator of how the BBC had " lost its way . "
Attacking the BBC news for being pro-Hamas and directed by " left - wing " executives , Phillips insisted that " licence - fee payers are increasingly questioning its very existence as a publicly financed broadcaster . "
My uncle Anna has lived through a thousand moons !
To celebrate , Anna — literally big brother in Tamil — and his wife Manni will reenact their marriage from 1951 .
But today is not about him .
Today is about the women .
It is mangali pondugal , the Brahmin ceremony to remember , honor and seek the blessings of the women who have come before , in anticipation of my aunt and uncle ’s remarriage .
Three of my father ’s four sisters have gathered at their house , and all of his three brother ’s wives .
A couple cousins .
A close friend .
The few men in attendance sit outside , reading the newspaper and sipping coffee , ignored .
Inside , the sisters are swathed in nine - yard saris , gold and colored silk wrapped a dozen times around their bodies , which move more slowly than they used to .
They set up an altar with two banana leaves , a mirror , fresh flowers and a gold necklace .
An oil lamp burns in the corner .
They draw designs in rice flour to mark place settings on the floor .
They bend down and wipe turmeric paste on their feet as I watch , unsure of when I can participate and when I can’t .
This motion is for the married ; that one for the eldest ; a hundred unspoken rules I do n’t know .
With each return to India , the years creeping up on me at the same relentless rate as it for my aging aunts , my ignorance of what to do during the Hindu ceremonies seems more glaring .
I once could play at the Hindu rituals as a child , and even a young woman , in a way I never could at my friend ’s Catholic churches , at their Jewish synagogues .
In the temple , it all seemed exotic and removed .
But now I am a grown woman and the same motions feel fraudulent in any culture , in all the religions I do n’t believe in .
I sit on the couch next to my aunt Akka and Nitya , a cousin ’s cousin through marriage , her 8½ - month belly extended beneath the fabric of her sari .
Beside her is her 98 - year - old great grandmother , frail and tired , yet fiercely alive .
It is the most natural thing in the world .
This continuity of lifelines , blood and birth and memory and an endless history that repeats itself , each time a seemingly singular event .
Miracle upon miracle .
What used to be a quaint anomaly , my resistance to marriage or my dull inability to find someone to undertake it with , turns into something more sad and unspeakable here with time .
To be single in New York City can be an oddity but also the stuff of hit TV shows .
To be single in south India is to be a freak of nature .
An uncomfortable rift in the Order of Things .
The poking jokes from previous trips about finding me a husband have ceased .
I am lost in these thoughts when my aunt Santhi draws me into the fray .
She comes and kneels before me , first wipes the turmeric paste across the smooth tops of my feet and then draws a line in another paste , a deeper red that will dye the skin for days , encircling the circumference of my long , bony , half - south Indian feet .
I ask her what it means , and she laughs .
Tells me it ’s just for decoration , nothing else .
She brings me over to where the sisters have gathered tightly in the corner of the room , as though a wind has swept them there like leaves .
We turn towards Manni as she swishes red water around a shallow stainless basin , repeating mantras with another sister ’s prompts .
We bow towards her as she tosses flowers upon us , the calendula petals landing on the crowns of our heads — bright yellow against hair black , silver , degrees of black and silver .
Aunt Akka remains on the couch , the only sister present who has lost her husband .
Though she is a modern - day widow — ignoring the ancient edicts to shave her head , shed her jewelry and forgo the bindi on her forehead — she will not participate .
It seems wrong that I can partake more than she can , though she has brought four children into this world , walked seven times — one for each vow — around the marriage fire , known the smell of the funeral pyre .
I have only known campfires , helped my farmer friends deliver kid goats , smelled the deep rich smell of many men .
I have buried dear friends , and one lover , but the closest thing I ’ve had to a husband is alive and well , although I do n’t talk to him much these days .
I am from some other world than this tribe of women who have known me all my life , who I am at once connected to and separate from .
Their beliefs guide their rituals which guide their beliefs , completing some perfect circle that starts with the start of life and ends with the end of death , which they know is only another beginning .
I only believe in compost and daisies and the thunderous force of lightning storms .
In the ability of a baby falcon to fly the first time it leaves the nest .
I do n’t believe in their gods , though they are colorful and enticing , nor the godheads of the western world I was raised in , whom I find morose and unappealingly asexual .
I do n’t believe that Hanuman jumped to Sri Lanka or that Vishnu shape - shifted into a woman to lure the bad guys away from the ambrosia or that Moses parted the Red Sea or that God recited anything to anybody anytime .
But I understand the aching need for the rituals .
I believe in my grandmother , who I can imagine somewhere between the heat of the oil lamp and the smell of the rice and curry offerings laid out on the banana leaves at the front of the room .
She has died all over again , with this return to India , my first since her death two years ago .
When she died , I was in Brooklyn , alone , without ceremonies or gods or belief in anything other than the harsh biological knowledge that the generations had shifted up a notch , the family tree growing skyward , leaving me stranded , by my own clumsy will , on a branch that was rising higher from the ground with time .
I have cousins who are grandmothers but , now , I have no grandmother on this earth .
No god can change this fact .
Everyone else here — the aunts clustered in the corner , the one contentedly alone on the couch , the uncles that will come later to eat — witnessed her final days that were too many in too much discomfort .
They spread her ashes where they spread my grandfather ’s ashes , at the union of the stagnant waters of the Adyar River and the salty waves of the Bay of Bengal .
They fed her spirit food for fourteen days and then left out the salt on the fifteenth day , telling her it was time to go .
They waited a year , and marked the passage with more of these Hindu rituals that all seem the same to me .
Oil lamps .
Platters of fruit and flowers and gold .
Food , eaten and offered .
A priest .
But , wait , there is no priest today .
The puja is short .
After the decorated feet and the tossed flowers , it is time to eat .
There are women cooking in the kitchen and there are women around the table , and there are women on the couch and sitting cross-legged on the floor before bright green banana leaves , wiped clean with a handful of water and glistening in anticipation .
The cooks make the offerings at the altar before passing down the line to serve us — steaming rice and ladlefuls of a half dozen vegetable curries , and golden , deep - fried vadas , crispy on the outside and soft in the middle that we dip into fresh ground chutneys of cilantro , of coconut .
The sisters are loud and talk on top of each other , mouths full of food and tumbling Tamil .
They reminisce about when their father , fed up with the noise of his eight children , decreed silence during mealtimes .
For months the quiet dragged on , nothing but the sound of curd rice and curries lapped up through fingers , until one day , when my cousin Kumar was just a baby , he peed .
They only put nappies on girls , not boys in those days , Santhi tells me in English , and Kumar , he just peed , right straight into my grandfather ’s pile of white rice .
They laugh now as they must have then .
The silence ended , then and there .
The cooks clear the banana leaves , sweep the floor clean by hand .
And then there is one more motion we are required to make , lining up in pairs .
We get down on our knees , curling our bodies to the floor , closing our eyes , bowing to something or someone that resides in the altars of our own making .
With our namaskarams , we bend , all of us on our knees , shared blood and belief and disbelief .
SEATTLE  The Seattle Post - Intelligencer will produce its last printed edition on Tuesday and become an Internet - only news source , the Hearst Corporation said on Monday , making it by far the largest American newspaper to take that leap .
But The P - I , as it is called , will resemble a local Huffington Post more than a traditional newspaper , with a news staff of about 20 people rather than the 165 it had , and a site with mostly commentary , advice and links to other news sites , along with some original reporting .
Other newspapers have closed and many more are threatened .
But the transition to an all - digital product for The P - I will be especially closely watched in an industry that is fast losing revenue and is casting around for a new economic model .
For one thing , the closing may end up putting greater pressure on the surviving and financially struggling Seattle Times , because of the end of a joint operating agreement between the two papers .
It may even bring closer the day when Seattle has no local paper at all .

NEW YORK , March 27 ( Reuters ) - New
York state relaxed harsh Rockefeller drug laws from the 1970s that required prison sentences for nonviolent drug crimes and will let judges send addicts to treatment programs , state officials said on Friday .
Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith , at an Albany news conference joined by Governor David Paterson and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver , estimated this will save the state about “ a quarter of a billion dollars ” a year .
The governor and the legislative leaders are all Democrats , and Friday ’s announcement was a breakthrough for them as years of efforts had produced only limited changes to drug laws .
Until last November , the state senate was run by Republicans who repeatedly thwarted campaigns to ease the drug laws .
( Reporting by Joan Gralla ; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )
Kim Rossmo of Texas State University , who has worked with the military to find terrorists told USA Today : " The idea of identifying three buildings in a city of half a million especially one in a country the authors have likely never visited is somewhat overconfident . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Senate wrapped up Thursday night after hours of sometimes acrimonious work without voting on a massive economic recovery plan championed by President Barack Obama .
President Obama wants to sign the stimulus bill by Presidents Day .
The Senate had worked its way through dozens of proposed amendments to the plan when Majority Leader Harry Reid -- who earlier had vowed to work " through the night " -- called it quits shortly after 8:30 p.m .
Reid abruptly changed his mind and decided to give a bipartisan group of senators one more day to find compromise on an economic stimulus plan , after consulting by phone with the White House , according to a senior Democratic source .
" I think staying here later tonight would not benefit us , " he said .
As official work went on the Senate floor , a group of moderate Democrats and Republicans met for hours going " line - by - line " to trim spending from the plan , which currently will cost just under $ 900 billion .
Senate Democratic leaders and White House officials admit they are about three votes shy of the 60 votes needed to pass Obama 's economic plan , and it would have been too big of a risk to hold the vote and have an embarrassing failure .
Reid has given senators a Friday deadline to forge a bipartisan compromise , but he also warned about a possible weekend vote .
Sen . Arlen Specter , R - Pennsylvania , told reporters they were making some progress and hoped to find common ground on a bipartisan bill , but multiple senators acknowledged that finding that compromise has proven extremely difficult .
In fact , a Democratic leadership source told CNN that many Democrats not involved in the bipartisan negotiations were very concerned about a working draft that includes proposed cuts in education spending .
Reid said he remains hopeful of crafting a plan that can pass the chamber by Friday .
" Everyone 's going to have to give a little and understand this is a process and we have to move this ball down the court , " he said .
" I 'm cautiously optimistic we can do that . "
At a House Democrats retreat in Virginia , Obama said he valued " the constructive criticism and healthy debate that 's taking place around this package , " but added that speedy passage of the bill was essential .
" We 're not moving quickly because we 're trying to jam something down people 's throats , " he said .
" We 're moving quickly because if we do n't , the economy 's going to keep getting worse . "
Obama rejected calls for more tax cuts and significant slashing of the bill 's cost , and said complaints the package was a spending bill rather than a stimulus bill were off base .
" What do you think a stimulus bill is ? " he said .
" That 's the point . "
The plan , which supporters hope will help turn around a crumbling economy that seemingly spawns more bad news every day , includes tax cuts , money for transportation and infrastructure projects and aid to states to keep workers on their payrolls among its many provisions .
Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson , a Democrat , and Republican Sen. Susan Collins said they are having a difficult time finding the right balance of cutting some Democrat - backed programs while adding spending on infrastructure , which Republicans want .
" It 's been a painstaking , very thorough , very comprehensive process , " Collins said .
Republicans have objected to some provisions in the bill that they say have nothing to do with stimulating the economy .
iReport.com : Can Obama fix the economy ?
Obama held a series of one - on - one meetings in the Oval Office on Wednesday with key senators who were still on the fence .
Collins , of Maine , said she went through some specific programs with the president to see which ones he would be willing to cut .
" We do n't want a package that is too small , because that will end up just wasting money , " she said .
" On the other hand , we 're very leery of having an enormous package that would not be necessary and would just boost the federal deficit . "
Earlier Thursday , Obama ratcheted up the pressure on Congress to pass the plan , arguing that failure to act quickly would make a bad situation worse .
" This is not some abstract debate , " he said during an address to employees at the Energy Department .
" The time for talk is over .
The time for action is now . "
The House passed an $ 819 billion version of the stimulus plan last week , but no Republican voted in favor of it .
The president will need at least some Republican support to get the 60 votes needed to bring the bill before the full Senate .
The Senate has 56 Democrats and two independents who usually vote with them .
There are 41 Republicans .
On Wednesday , the Senate approved an amendment to offer a $ 15,000 tax credit to people who buy a home in the next year .
The housing amendment , introduced by Sen. Johnny Isakson , R - Georgia , was seen by some as a move to sweeten the deal for Republicans .
But some GOP members appeared dead - set against the plan and bridled at Reid 's suggestion that time is of the essence .
" I am here today to point out the fact that this is not bipartisanship , " said Sen. Lindsey Graham , a Republican from South Carolina .
" This process that we are engaging in is not smart , we are not working together , we 're about to spend $ 800 or $ 900 billion , and nobody 's got a clue where we 're going to land , but we 've got to do it by tonight .
" If this is the solution to George Bush 's problems , the country is going to get worse .
...
If this is the change we all can believe in , America 's best days are behind her , " he said .
President Obama was privately telling senators in both parties that he is confident his plan will pass in the Senate by the end of the week , according to two senior administration officials and two Congressional officials .
Getting the bill through the Senate by the end of the week would keep the legislation on track to be signed into law by Presidents '
Day , February 16 , which has been Obama 's target .
CNN 's Ed Henry , Dana Bash and Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report .

Using jQuery With Custom XHTML Attributes And Namespaces To Store Data
I was talking to Brian Swartzfager yesterday about his new jQuery plugin for editable tables when I started to think about various ways to store meta-data in an XHTML document .
I only recently learned about the jQuery data ( ) method , which totally blew my mind !
The data ( ) method allows you to store arbitrary data with an XHTML DOM element .
But then , I got to thinking about custom attributes .
In XHTML , you can use namespaces to add custom attributes to your XHTML DOM elements .
I thought maybe custom attributes would be another way to store custom data .
I know that namespaces do cause some problems in jQuery when you are searching for DOM elements ; but , as far as setting and getting them , I figured that would be worth an experiment .
In the following demo , I am creating IMDB link elements based on existing custom attributes :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " >

jLI.each ( function ( intI ) { var jThis = $ ( this ) ; var jLink = $ ( " < a ></a > " ) ; //

Set the link href based on the IMDB // attribute of the list item .
j Link.attr( { " href " : j This.attr( " bn:imdb " ) , " bn:rel " : " Pretty Cool Ladies " } ) ; //

Joe " The Plumber Wurzelbacher reporting from Israel for pjtv.comWhen Pyjamas Media asked me to be a reporter on the war in Israel my immediate reaction was " yes . "
But my fool mouth has got me in trouble before , so I told them I would sleep on it .
After some extra thinking I said " hell yes . "
You know why ?
Because one voice has been lacking in the midst of all this war .
That is the voice of the average man .
The elites in the world think they run everything , but if I learned one thing about global politics from my 17 years as an unlicensed plumber , it 's that elites just mess everything up .
Think about it .
When was the last time you heard of an average guy messing up the economy ?
Or an average guy starting a war ?
Never happened .
Only elites have the time to think about that stuff .
Average guys just wanna look out for their family .
They do n't have time for starting a war .
What would they even want to start a war about ?
Things are looking fine to me here in America .
As long as you do n't come for my guns or one red penny more of my hard - earned money or to make me join a union or get my plumber 's license I got no gripe with you .
So I boarded a jet to Israel to find out the real story of the war between Israel and Gaza .
It was a long flight and they served chicken with something called rice pilaf .
Very interesting stuff .
I will have to see if we can get it back home .
I got off the plane and my guide was a very nice guy named Moshe Ben-David .
You pronounce it " moy - she . "
Moshe said that first he would take me to ground zero where the Gazans have been shooting rockets at Israel .
Then he would drive us to a hill where I could see the fighting in Gaza .
" The attacks are frequent , " Moshe said .
" How many people died ? " I asked him .
" A lot of people over the many years it has been going on and recently one , " Moshe said back .
I nodded sadly to him .
" So it 's sort of like your 9 - 11 ? " I asked him .
" Hmm , " Moshe said as he thought about my question .
" I think you could say that .
Yes . "
Israelis struggle to recover from brutal Hamas rocket attacks .
The tragedy of the attacks for people like Moshe is that they come so suddenly .
No one expects the rockets .
Imagine a 9 - 11 , only the planes could land anywhere .
They could land among the family of the Israelis .
" A siren sounds and you have one minute , " Moshe said .
" You have to get to the shelter or your basement . "
Moshe took me to a neighborhood not far from the border with Gaza and showed me some buildings that had been damaged by rockets .
He pointed to a room where the rocket had blasted into the floor .
" A baby was sleeping only two rooms away and a few hours before this rocket hit .
If he was still sleeping he could have been slightly injured by debris . "
Moshe showed me pictures .
One picture was of a child who was dusty .
Another picture was of a man making a very upset face .
" What happened here ? " I asked and pointed to the face .
" Oh , " Moshe said sadly .
" He is upset because a rocket hit his yard . "
After the rocket attacks became too much to handle the Israelis were forced to act .
With their airforce they used precision guided bombs to attack the rocket launchers .
Some of these were situated in mosques and inside of the houses of families and at weddings and UN hospitals .
" The Hamas are monsters , " Moshe said .
" They use everyone as human shields .
We have no choice .
There are , unfortunately , some civilian casualties . "

Governor Deval Patrick is taking aim at a time - worn Beacon Hill practice that , on the surface , seems paradoxical : state government hiring expensive lobbyists to influence state government .
Buried in the governor 's budget proposal unveiled last week is a little - noticed provision that would bar state agencies from employing outside lobbyists to influence the Legislature or other branches of state government .
A Globe review of public records showed yesterday that members of the Beacon Hill lobbying corps earn hefty sums to represent various state entities , from big ones like the MBTA to more obscure ones like the Massachusetts State College Building Authority .
The review , which was not comprehensive , found that more than 20 agencies hired lobbyists in 2008 , collectively spending well more than $ 1 million .
" This longstanding practice of some state entities hiring outside lobbyists to represent them in front of our own state agencies is archaic and an inappropriate use of limited resources in this time of tight finances and difficult budget cuts , " said Patrick spokesman Joe Landolfi .
Two lobbyists , who did not wish to be quoted , said they are now lobbying to defeat the measure .
Patrick was on a trade mission to the West Coast yesterday and unavailable for comment .
His administration said the lobbying ban for state agencies is part of a package of changes the governor is proposing to tighten lobbying rules at the State House , which has suffered from a series of ethical controversies and scandals this year .
The language in Patrick 's budget proposal went largely unnoticed last week , except by lobbyists , several of whom refused to comment about the proposal yesterday .
Paul Pezzella , the lobbyist for Worcester State College , said the measure will " merit real consideration because of fiscal concerns .
" It 's a way of cutting back costs and people should appreciate that , " he said .
" On the other hand , some of these agencies need specific help with specific problems , and sometimes it 's wise to retain outside help .
It depends on the situation and the circumstance . "
But the initiative won plaudits from the state 's chief enforcer of lobbying regulations , Secretary of State William Galvin .
Galvin called it odd that so many public agencies have their own hired political guns .
" Everyone has to have a lobbyist ?
Why ? " he said .
" The philosophical core is that public monies should n't be spent to game the process , that spending decisions should be on their merits . "
In addition to covering state agencies , the prohibition would extend to groups that receive state funding such as the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association .
The association 's lobbyist , Robert White , helped the DAs win from the Legislature a two - step , $ 31,000 - a- year pay raise in 2007 .
MassDevelopment , the state 's finance and development authority , last year paid its lobbyist , former Suffolk County sheriff Dennis Kearney , $ 100,000 .
A spokeswoman for MassDevelopment , Janet Hookailo , said Kearney 's firm " provides a very valuable service in helping us track legislative developments and generally interface with legislative leaders . "

One of the consistent themes of SBM since its very inception has been that , when it comes to determining the efficacy ( or lack thereof ) of any particular medicince , therapy , or interventions , anecdotes are inherently unreliable .
Steve Novella explained why quite well early in the history of this blog , and I myself described why otherwise intelligent people can be so prone to being misled by personal experience and anecdotal evidence .
Unfortunately , as I have also demonstrated , it ’s not just patients who can allow themselves to be misled by anecdotes , but certain physicians who do not understand the scientific method but in their hubris think that their “ personal clinical experience ” trumps science , clinical trials , and epidemiology .
None of this is to say that there are n’t frequent instances when applying data from population - based studies to individual patients is problematic .
It can indeed be .
However , it often goes beyond that , and , indeed , if there is one defining characteristic of a quack that I ’ve never failed to find when looking at individual cases , it ’s a belief that he is able to identify when a treatment works based on his own personal experience and anecdotes .
Unfortunately , it ’s not just quacks who sometimes fall prey to this , because humans are cognitively wired to infer causation from correlation .
This tendency , which was no doubt adaptive early in our evolution , simply does n’t work well when it is applied to medicine and science .
Without a doubt , it is the key driver , for example , behind the widely believed myth that vaccines somehow cause autism and that chelation therapy and other biomedical quackery can “ cure ” autism , a view popularized most recently by the very popular but very ignorant Jenny McCarthy in the U.S. and before that by the outright dishonest Andrew Wakefield in the U.K .
One of the other reasons why testimonials for quackery seem convincing is because most people simply do not know enough about disease , be it my specialty ( cancer ) or any other disease , how it is treated , and what its natural course can be expected to be .
That is why , when I came across an example of just such a testimonial , specifically a breast cancer testimonial , I saw what is known as a “ teachable moment .
This teachable moment occurred on the very popular science blog Pharyngula , written by the ever sarcastic biology professor from Minnesota , P.Z. Myers .
It actually surprised me in that the usual topics on Pharyngula include evolution , biology , the pseudoscience known as “ intelligent design ” creationism , politics , and atheism .
P.Z. does n’t usually dabble much in the realm of medical quackery , but my guess is that he was attracted to this particular piece of pseudoscience because of the religious angle .
Specifically , the quackery under consideration is known as God ’s Answer to Cancer ( GAC ) .
Basically , it looks a lot like any number of quack electronic devices that promise to cure cancer ; examples include Bill Nelson ’s Electro Physiological Feedback Xrroid ( EPFX ) machine ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) , Hulda Clark ’s parasite zapper , or Alan Back ’s Advanced Bio-photon Analyzer .
All of these devices promise , in essence , to use low level electrical energy to “ boost the immune system ” and “ replenish your life energy ” plus or minus an additional promise to “ zap parasites ” ( Hulda Clark ’s unique spin on these devices , in which she claims that all cancer , AIDS , and most other diseases are due to a liver fluke , which her device supposedly “ zaps . ”
Like these devices , the maker of GAC promises vague “ immune system boosts , ” but with the added twist that he claims that all disease is due to original sin ( along , apparently , with the conventional alt - med “ toxins , ” diminished qi , and uncharacterized immune dysfunction ) .
Amusingly , the Monsignor who created this device also disses Hulda Clark and advocates the use of laetrile and Linus Pauling ’s orthomolecular medicine .
The main difference is that he claims to have received the design for the device from God through a dream .
A discussion of these various forms of quackery is beyond the scope of this post , and some of them have already been discussed before on this blog .
such as Linus Pauling ’s advocacy of vitamin C. Suffice it to say that it is quackery , with no basis in science .
What caught my interest was a testimonial by a commenter on P.Z. ’s blog .
He was most unhappy at some of the snarky comments and decided to provide a very typical cancer testimonial for alt - med that I thought to be worth deconstructing as a learning exercise .
It began with a discussion of the Royal Rife device , which , suffice it to say is also quackery , albeit a form of quackery that has n’t much been discussed on SBM .
( Hmmm .
Perhaps some blog fodder for next week ? )
The commenter , going by the ‘ nym “ gp , ” began :
The research of Royal Rife is largely obscured in mystery , and very few folks have been able to replicate his results based upon that secrecy .
The work of Dr. Bob Beck on the other hand is well documented and with measurable results .
Actually , the reason that no one has been able to replicate the work of Royal Rife is because it ’s pseudoscientific nonsense .
Bob Beck ’s protocol is n’t any better .
In essence , it consists of what Beck calls “ microcurrent ” therapy , and a brief description of it should convince most readers of just what nonsense it is ( although I do reserve the right to use it as more blog fodder in the future , as a detailed discussion may be worthwhile ; perhaps a general post about a number of these devices ) :
The Bob Beck Protocol started out as an electromedicine treatment for AIDS / HIV , however , it has turned out to be a superb cancer treatment .
There is certainly no other electromedicine treatment for cancer that is anywhere near as effective as the Bob Beck Protocol .
It is far better than any Rife Machine , far better than any Multi-Wave Oscillator ( MWO ) , far better than anything Hulda Clark has out , and so on .
The reason the Bob Beck Protocol is so absolutely superior to other electromedicine treatments is that it is the direct result of an incredible discovery in medicine .
Two medical doctors , Dr. Kaali and Dr. Lyman , discovered , in 1990 , that a small electric current could disable microbes from being able to multiply , thus rendering them harmless .
It was , in fact , the greatest medical discovery in the history of medicine because virtually all diseases are caused by , or enhanced by , a microbe .
Their discovery was a cure for almost every disease known to mankind .
A video can be found here , which postulates something called “ blood electrification . ”
A good rule of thumb , one that I have yet to find to have been wrong , is that , whenever someone says their device or treatment is a “ cure for almost every disease known to mankind , ” it ’s quackery .
Run , do n’t walk , away from anyone telling you that .
Moreover , when someone like Beck tells you that his therapy wo n’t work if you take any other therapy , be it conventional chemotherapy , surgery , and radiation , or even any other “ alternative ” therapy , that ’s just icing on the cake for identifying quackery .
In any case , that gp believes in Beck ’s protocol so strongly should tell you what ’s coming next , namely an anecdote :
With that said , my wife was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma ( 3.5 cm tumor ) last year with metastatic lymph node activity , the lay translation of which is terminal breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes .
Although I ’m sorry that gp ’s wife developed breast cancer , having just watched my mother - in - law die of the disease a mere three and a half weeks ago , my personal feelings wo n’t stop me from pointing out the misunderstanding of breast cancer here .
Unless his wife had metastatic disease in distant sites other than the lymph nodes under her arms , she did not have “ terminal ” breast cancer .
In fact , even if a lot of lymph nodes under her arm were positive for metastatic breast cancer , she would still be potentially curable .
Granted , depending on the number of positive lymph nodes , gp ’s wife could be as high as a stage IIIA or , if the primary tumor was considered inoperable due to extension to the chest wall , stage IIIB , but stage III breast cancer is still potentially curable .
As I guide you through the rest of the testimonial , I ’ll try to fill in what probably really happened based on educated guesses .
You will see that what probably happened does not support the efficacy of the quackery pursued .
But , before I do , let ’s look at three questions in reading alt - med cancer testimonials that can , if answered properly , can be indicative that an “ alternative ” therapy might actually have value .
These questions were provided by our ever - intrepid commenter and occasional gadfly here around SBM , the retired Australian cancer surgeon Peter Moran :
Was cancer definitely present , as shown by reliable tests , when treatment was commenced ?
Did it go away ?
( or clearly respond otherwise , as judged by the same tests )
Was the advocated treatment the only one used ?
( within 2 - 3 months of the apparent cancer response )
Thus far , the answer to question number one appears to be “ yes . ”
However , I would say that Dr. Moran ’s list is incomplete in that I would add to it :
Was sufficient reliable information presented in the testimonial to allow me to do a reasonably accurate staging of the tumor ?
In other words , if a person giving a testimonial says that the cancer was “ incurable ” with conventional therapy , was it , in fact , incurable ?
In this case , as I pointed out before , we can answer fairly confidently that gp ’s wife ’s cancer was not incurable .
It is possible , even likely , that it was a fairly nasty tumor ( more on that later ) , but it does not appear to have been stage IV disease , because it ’s a pretty safe bet that if it were gp would have pointed out that his wife had metastases to lung , liver , bone , or wherever , in order to emphasize the hopelessness of the situation .
Let ’s continue with gp ’s testimonial :
I interviewed and met with three separate cancer specialists including the head of oncology for a cancer research center in the top 10 worldwide ; the answer to her cancer was an extensive regiment of cytotoxins followed by radiation , despite her heart tests which came back with less than 50 % efficiency for her left ventricle .
Whether gp ’s wife ’s axillary lymph nodes were positive or not , a 3.5 cm primary tumor would mandate at least some chemotherapy ; positive lymph nodes would indicate the need for a longer and more intensive course of chemotherapy .
In addition , radiation therapy is standard of care for any form of breast - conserving therapy .
As I tell patients , if your breast stays in place , you need radiation .
There are only a few exceptions .
Without it , the risk of local recurrence can be as high as 30 % or slightly more .
Of course , as I ’ve pointed out before , this very fact ( namely that about 2/3 or more of women who undergo lumpectomy will do fine without radiation ) often leads to other testimonials by women who have had a lumpectomy , eschewed radiation in favor of some alternative woo or other , and and then attributed their doing well not to the surgery , but rather to the woo .
The same goes for chemotherapy .
Remember , surgery is the main curative modality in breast cancer that is curable .
Radiation is the icing on the cake that sharply decreases the risk of local recurrence , and chemotherapy reduces the risk of distant recurrence ; i.e. , recurrence outside of the breast or axillary lymph nodes , such as in the bone , liver , lung , or other organs .
Finally , gp ’s comment about his wife having “ less than 50 % efficiency ” refers to a MUGA scan , which is indicated before the use of Adriamycin - based chemotherapy regimens , which can indeed injure the heart .
Radiation to the left breast or chest wall can also “ leak ” and injure the heart , but the risk is very small with modern techniques of planning and advanced equipment aiming the beam , which now allow for very accurate radiation dosage , with little or no collateral damage .
Clearly , Mrs. gp ’s oncologists thought that her cardiac reserve was adequate to handle it .
gp continues :
I personally challenged each of her oncologists to a simple question and answer session about the mortality rates associated with chemotherapy used in conjunction with radiation ; they were only able to cite the statistics published by the American Cancer Society which are now deceptively reported within a 5 year window ( if there is no reoccurance of cancer within 5 calendar years , the patient is cured of cancer ; if there is a reocurrance after the 5 year window , they are reclassified as a new patient ) .
Her oncologists had not one suggestion for a change in her diet , a change in aerobic activity , or any solution other than the administration of very expensive cytotoxins followed by a 30 day bout of nuclear medicine , to further suppress and completely annihilate her immune system to get the cancer out of her .
Napalm for humans .
The reason doctors have no suggestions other than generic suggestions is because there is no evidence that specific dietary interventions can treat an established cancer .
There is , of course , that diet can influence our risk for cancer , and there is even weak and controversial evidence that an extremely low fat diet might be able to slow the progression of very early stage prostate cancer with favorable histology , but that is a far cry from treating an established cancer .
Moreover , one can’t help but note that gp is parroting the usual alt - med tropes about cancer therapy , including the classic “ poisoning ” and “ burning ” ( although I ’ve never seen anyone refer to it as “ napalm for humans ” before ) , in addition to the exaggerated fears of “ annihilating ” the immune system .
In fact , the immune system recovers quite well from breast cancer chemotherapy .
As for gp ’s claim that the American Cancer Society has somehow jiggered its statistics on survival , there ’s no other way to put it , I ’m afraid , other than that it ’s nonsense .
It is true that about five years ago the ACS changed its statistical models for estimating the number of cancer cases and cancer deaths ; this was done to reflect more accurately the incidence and number of deaths using the SEER database .
It should also be remembered that the ACS state - by - state reporting of cancer incidence and deaths is not intended to estimate how successful treatments are , because it does n’t break the data down stage by stage , treatment by treatment , but rather only by tumor type .
Results of randomized clinical trials and other studies looking at stage - by - stage survival rates are required for this purpose , and such studies , I assure gp , do not count recurrences after 5 years of breast cancer as new cancers .
Breast cancer is well known as a cancer that has a propensity to recur later than five years , which is why survival rates for breast cancer are often reported as ten year survivals .
Indeed , from the landmark clinical trials in the 1970s and 1980s by the NSABP that now have 25 and 30 year survival rates reported .
The literature on this subject is long and deep , and , even if the ACS were “ jiggering ” its figures in the way described by gp , it would not affect that literature .
The story continues :
The cancer research center ( Moffitt Research here in Tampa ) has a McDonald ’s in the lobby .
I had a Big and Tasty with a large Coke each day while she was in the hospital recovering from the bi-lateral mastectomy .
From this we learn that gp ’s wife had a bilateral mastectomy .
It is not mentioned whether she also underwent an axillary dissection on the side of the tumor , but presumably she did if she had a positive lymph node there .
No competent breast surgeon would be willing to do just a mastectomy under those circumstances without a fight .
Indeed , if Mrs. gp had stage IV disease , it is also very highly unlikely that any surgeon would want to perform a bilateral mastectomy on her right off the bat .
It is true that there is retrospective evidence suggesting that removing the primary tumor in patients with metastatic disease might be helpful in terms of prolonging survival , but that ’s only in patients who have stable disease after chemotherapy .
Be that as it may , assuming Mrs. pg had a modified radical mastectomy on the side of the tumor ( includes the lymph nodes ) the answer to Peter ’s second question is :
Yes , the tumor did go away .
You ca n’t make a non-stage IV cancer go away any more effectively than to remove both breasts .
However , the tumor went away before any alternative therapy was tried , thanks to a trusty neighborhood surgical oncologist at Moffit .
It would be interesting to know whether his wife chose a bilateral mastectomy .
Personally , as a breast surgeon , I am very reluctant to perform a mastectomy on the other side unless ( 1 ) there is another cancer there ( which gp did n’t mention ; so I presume that there was n’t ) or ( 2 ) a documented mutation in a gene like BRCA1 that predisposes to hereditary cancer .
I admit that these days I ’m a bit of a dinosaur that way , because increasingly women are demanding bilateral mastectomies , even though there is no evidence that their routine use improves survival .
In any case , that Mrs. gp required a mastectomy implies that her surgeon judged her tumor too large to perform a lumpectomy or partial mastectomy with a decent cosmetic result .
Another interesting wrinkle is that these days giving chemotherapy before surgery can often shrink such tumors to the size where lumpectomy is possible , allowing preservation of the breast .
However , for this approach to work , the woman has to be willing to undergo both chemotherapy and radiation , and Mrs. gp was unwilling to accept either :
We then opted to decline chemotherapy ( you will be dead within a year ) as well as decline radiation ( seriously , you are really dead within a year now , take the chemo and radiation you crazy person with cancer ) and instead began the Beck Protocol based on Dr. Robert Beck ’s open source schematics ( the “ quackery ” referenced in the previous two posts ) which he published in 2002 , originally as a way of bulking up the immune system of individuals diagnosed with HIV .
I do n’t know where gp and his wife got the idea that chemotherapy and radiation would lead his wife to be dead within a year .
Most breast cancers , even metastatic ones , do n’t necessarily lead to death within a year .
Median survival is in general over a year ; so a significant number of women with metasatic breast cancer live longer than a year .
Some can even live several years .
As for the Beck protocol , gp describes it thusly :
For the ozone generation component we opted for a clinical grade ozone generator and oxygen concentrator purchased from Longevity Resources ; cancer itself is an anaerobic function so increasing blood / oxygen saturation is a key component to fighting cancer of any type .
Ozone is used primarily in Europe as a disinfectant and has only recently been adopted by U.S. hospitals to disinfect operating rooms , burn units etc .
For the blood electrification equipment we went with a vendor that replicated the work of Dr. Bob Beck ’s open source schematics and in accordance with the research of Dr. Kaali and Dr. Lyman ’s report from 1990 , which is now the core focus of electroporation equipment ( that curiously also uses the same square wave advocated by Rife ’s research ) now approved by the FDA and in clinical trials with cancer research centers here in the U.S .
The unit I bought for the blood electrification is non-FDA approved , built to spec as described by Kaali / Lyman / Beck .
For the magnetic coil pulser I ordered a unit from Australia with measurable output according to the Beck Protocol , non FDA approved .
For the silver component we went with 2 gallons of medical grade collodial silver from a supplier here in the U.S. with a lab certified 20 ppm content ( Utopia Silver , http://www.utopiasilver.com).
We also used a daily dosage of 60 bitter apricot pits initially ( now a 20 pit per day maintenance routine ) due to high concentrations of Laetrille / B17 ( illegal for resale in the U.S. per the good folks at the FDA ) .
My goodness , the Beck protocol is a panoply of cancer quackery !
It ’s all there , even laetrile !
Of course , there is one bit of possible non -woo in with all the woo , and that ’s the electroporation equipment .
Electroporation is sometimes used to potentiate DNA vaccines , to increase the uptake into the skeletal muscle cells of the plasmid DNA being used to immunize the patient .
It does not surprise me that the device gp picked up is not FDA - approved .
As for colloidal silver , apparently gp is unconcerned with what I like to call the “ Blue Man syndrome ” but what is more commonly called agyria that can occur as a result of its use .
Finally , let me just address the ozone issue .
Apparently the idea is to increase the blood saturation of oxygen somehow by increasing the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood .
The problem is that the vast majority of oxygen in the blood is bound to the hemoglobin in the red blood cells .
Only a small minority of the oxygen in the blood is dissolved .
Moreover , the oxygen binding curve for hemoglobin is saturable ; if the hemoglobin is greater than 90 % saturated ( as it is in most people at sea level or near sea level ) , it ’s impossible to increase the oxygen content of the blood by more than a couple of percent by adding more oxygen .
Worse , ozone is a very strong oxidant .
Did it ever occur to gp that there ’s a reason it ’s used as a disinfectant ?
It kills bacteria , but its oxydizing properties do exactly the same thing to normal cells .
So how did Mrs. gp do ?
Let ’s see :
Her initial tumor markers were off the charts in all areas ; after three months of treatment and her surgery , she scores 1 out of 40 for her tumor markers – and she refused chemotherapy or radiation .
We use http://www.caprofile.net/ for bi-monthly blood tests that show her progress in terms of her cancer markers and the other empirical indicators of cancer ( PHI enzyme levels , hCG levels , etc ) .
We have to pay the $ 300 for this test out of pocket as insurance will not cover it ; the blood tests from her oncologist ( covered by insurance and 10X the costs ) do n’t even show the basic levels associated with cancer such as PHI and hCG .
Note what he says : After the surgery .
Of course her tumor markers fell .
Remove the tumor , and the tumor markers will usually fall .
Now ’s as good a time as any to answer Peter ’s third question , and the answer is a resounding “ yes . ”
She did receive other therapy .
She received the primary therapy for her tumor .
In fact she received highly aggressive surgical therapy for her tumor .
Once again , I reiterate : Chemotherapy and radiation in this setting are adjuvant therapies .
Surgery is the primary therapy , and they are useful for decreasing the risk of cancer recurrence .
Back in the “ old days ” before there were effective adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy regimens , surgery was the only treatment for breast cancer , even relatively advanced tumors .
The survival rate was n’t fantastic , but a significant minority of women were cured of their cancers by surgery alone and still are .
It is highly probable that gp ’s wife falls into that category , although , at the risk of being pessimistic , I have to point out that we do n’t know how far out she is from her surgery .
She ’s still not out of the woods yet by any means .
I wish her only the best , but really wish she had increased her odds of overcoming breast cancer by accepting conventional treatment .
Finally , there is the issue of all those “ tumor markers . ”
The following of tumor markers for breast cancer is a complicated and controversial minefield .
In fact , there are a number of tumor markers for breast cancer of wildly varying validity and reliability , the vast majority of which are n’t much good .
Indeed , breast cancer tumor markers are in general not closely followed after primary surgery for breast cancer ; rather they are sometimes followed in the case of advanced disease .
Some oncologists I ’ve known do n’t follow them at all , thinking them to be a waste of time .
Unfortunately , those of us who take care of breast cancer do n’t have a marker as reliable as CEA is for colon cancer and would very much love to have one whose high degree of utility is science - and evidence - based .
There ’s a reason why insurance companies do n’t pay for that many of them , and I can only guess at what other dubious markers gp was paying quacks to measure .
No testimonial , of course , would be complete without an appeal to emotion and conspiracy :
Simple , rational logic dictates that cellular toxins of any sort destroy the body ’s ability to fight cancer , as does radiation .
Simple , rational logic also dictates that nuclear medicine is proven to cause additional forms of cancer and debilitating diseases , all of which are considered by modern day oncology as “ effective ” means of combating metastatic cancer which is now at epidemic levels worldwide .
Simple , rational logic says that the body ’s immune system is the first line of defense against any form of life threatening illness , and bolstering – not destroying – the body ’s immune system is the most effective way of combating cancer of any sort .
Further , Big Pharma and their minions at the FDA would rather allow corporate profit motives to drive cancer research , while only treating the symptoms of cancer and never the root causes of what causes cancer in the first place .
“ Simple , rational logic ” is , alas , all too often only the former of the two based on a profound misunderstanding of biology .
It is true that chemotherapy is toxic , but the point is that it ’s more toxic to cancer cells that are rapidly dividing than it is to normal cells .
The same thing is true of radiation when administered correctly .
Indeed , the concept of “ fractionating ” radiation ( i.e. , giving it in small daily doses over 30 or so fractions , which is what is done with breast cancer ) is predicated on the fact that normal cells can repair their DNA after such low doses but cancer cells can’t .
The cancer cells thus accumulate damage , while normal cells repair themselves during the “ rest ” periods .
Moreover , although it is true that secondary malignancies are a risk with radiation therapy and chemotherapy , numerous studies have been done on this issue , and it turns out that the risk of these secondary malignancies is far outweighed by the therapeutic benefit of the chemotherapy .
The problem with so many mavens of alt - med is that they are like antivaccinationists in that they seem to think that there must be medical interventions with absolutely zero risk .
All medical treatment is composed of a risk - benefit analysis .
For a disease like cancer , which has the potential to kill , more risks are considered acceptable to wipe it out .
gp ’s testimonial illustrates very well the inherently deceptive nature of the vast majority of alt - med cancer testimonials .
This deception is rarely intentional ; rather , far more commonly it is the result of a poor understanding of cancer , how it ’s treated , its prognosis , and the extreme variability of its course .
Indeed , breast cancer is a disease with a particularly variable course , which , when coupled with its high degree of prevalence ( it ’s the most common cancer diagnosed in women ) , virtually guarantees large numbers of women who are “ outliers , ” doing much better than expected .
Some of these women will take alternative medicine and attribute their good fortune to alternative medicine rather than their tumor biology .
The reason that these testimonials often sound convincing is that the people listening to them are not physicians and do not know enough about the expected natural course of a specific cancer , how that cancer is normally treated .
Another common misunderstanding is what the role of chemotherapy and radiation is for treating solid tumors , for which the primary treatment is almost always surgical and for which surgery can often be curative .
Finally , not how gp claims that “ conventional medicine ” treats “ only the symptoms ” of cancer rather than the “ root cause . ”
This is a frequently claim made by alt - med advocates not just about cancer but about virtually all human disease .
It is also one I consider most ironic , given that scientific medicine actually does try to discover the actual cause of cancer and treat it .
It looks at genes , the functions of the proteins they express , and how the environment interacts with them .
They study tumor biology and how seemingly “ normal ” stroma can influence the growth of tumors for good or ill .
Science modifies its views in response to new data , observation , and experiments .
The contrast with “ alternative ” medicine could not be more stark , where we false causes of cancer are identified and targeted : Liver flukes causing “ all cancer ” ; vague disorders in unmeasurable “ life energy ” ; unnamed “ toxins ” ; uncharacterized immune system “ weakness ” ; or , my favorite when it comes to inanity , the claim that cancer is not a disease at all , but rather a manifestation of internal conflict .
Unfortunately , if gp or his wife sees this , no doubt they will see it as yet another example of a close - minded physician .
However , I am a physician who sincerely hopes that Mrs. gp does not become like some women described by Peter Moran :
The studies < 1,2 > that predict a favourable outcome for many with lumpectomy alone predict misery for others .
The women on the wrong side of the gamble , those trying to cope with persistent cancer either eventually have to accept further medical care , usually mastectomy , or can be observed making fleeting visits to their old Internet stamping grounds , asking for advice on what to do about the pain or smelly discharge , or regarding what last - ditch methods they should try , having by now used most of the treatments on offer …
Amazingly , some of these unfortunate women still fly the “ alternative ” flag , remaining proud that they have have “ treated ” their breast cancer “ without using any conventional methods ” .
This is a tribute to the occasional success of malicious propaganda that claims , despite mountains of evidence to the contrary , that medical treatment of cancer does n’t work or makes things worse .
The truth is that the prognosis for cure of breast cancer is very good , especially if found early via screening .
In fact , even when all stages of the disease are included [ 4 ] 80 % of women with breast cancer survive for ten years , with most of these being cured permanently .
I ’m also reminded that I ’ve just returned home from a meeting in Phoenix , where I met a former fellow from my old program who now practices in nearby Scottsdale .
She happens to have read this blog , and our discussion turned to the fact that Arizona is ground zero for a whole lot of woo , which led her to describe a couple of patients whom she ’s seen in just a year and a half of practice with advanced , fungating tumors that had been treated by , as she put it , “ naturopaths putting various salves on them . ”
I concluded that I would have a hard time practicing in Arizona , as in eight and a half years in New Jersey I had never seen such a case .
I had seen neglected tumors due to denial , but I had never personally seen one treated by a naturopath .
I was also reminded yet again that this sort of quackery kills .

Alvaro Acosta , chief of one of the police forces in Mexico City , was arrested recently for hiring hit men to shoot municipal prosecutor Victor Hugo Moneda .
Moneda , a prosecutor for the district attorney ’s office of the capital city , was gunned down in December of 2008 .
Hit man Darkin Emanuel Grimaldo Lopez was arrested and charged as one of the shooters and investigators say that information obtained from Grimaldo eventually led them back to Acosta .
Acosta now stands accused of masterminding the murder of Moneda .
The Milenio newspaper reports that while Moneda was carrying out his regular charge of overseeing police investigations , he uncovered evidence that Acosta had been providing protection to prominent local crime bosses .
Widespread corruption among police departments has made it incredibly difficult for Mexico to fight and contain the drug cartels .
Acosta paid 10,000 pesos , or the rough equivalent of $ 711 , to each of the hit men involved in the murder , including Grimaldo .
Three other suspects remain at large .

When I was growing up , children were commonly taught : " do n't talk to strangers . "
Strangers might be bad , we were told , so it 's prudent to steer clear of them .
As it turns out , this is profoundly bad advice .
Most people are honest , kind , and generous , especially when someone asks them for help .
If a small child is in trouble , the smartest thing he can do is find a nice - looking stranger and talk to him .

The Supreme Court agreed Friday to hear two schools cases , one to clarify the law on searching students for drugs and the other to decide whether taxpayers must cover private school tuition for a child with a disability before the student has tried a public school .
The drug case began when school officials in southern Arizona decided to crack down on the use and abuse of prescription medications , including ibuprofen .
The Constitution protects against “ unreasonable searches ” by the government , and the court in 1985 extended this protection to students .
But school officials also were told by the court that they could search students , their backpacks or their lockers whenever there was reason to suspect they had drugs or had violated other school rules .
Now , the court will decide whether a strip search is reasonable .

Last year , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld a student ’s right to sue her assistant principal for ordering her to be taken to a nurse ’s office and examined in her underwear .
Officials in her middle school were alarmed about the abuse of prescription drugs , including prescription - strength ibuprofen .
One student had fallen violently ill from ingesting these pills .
Savana Redding , 13 , was identified by another girl -- wrongly , it turned out -- as having brought the pills to school .
The search in the nurse ’s office turned up nothing .
The girl described the strip search as humiliating , and she and her parents sued the Safford Unified School District and the assistant principal for violating her constitutional rights .
In its 6 - 5 decision , the 9th Circuit judges said the assistant principal should be held liable for “ a grossly intrusive search of a middle school girl to locate pills with the potency of two over - the - counter Advil capsules . ”
The judges said that this full - body search was clearly unreasonable in light of the circumstances .
Before the case could go further , the school district appealed to the Supreme Court .
Its lawyers said the ruling , if allowed to stand , would “ create enormous confusion for school officials in trying to determine when and how searches may now properly be conducted . ”
They also said that because judges do not understand the “ shifting trends in drug abuse , ” they should defer to the judgment of school officials .

A lawyer for Savana said students should not be deprived of their rights .
“ It offends both common sense and the Constitution to undertake such an excessive , traumatizing search based on nothing more than an uncorroborated accusation of ibuprofen possession , ” said Adam Wolf of the American Civil Liberties Union .
The court voted Friday to hear the case of Safford vs. Redding in April .
An Oregon case the justices agreed to take up will decide a dispute over special education .
Federal law says schools must provide a “ free appropriate public education ” to students with a disability .
This can include paying tuition at a private school , but it is unclear whether parents first must try a public program before they can claim reimbursement for the cost of a private school .

The court will hear the appeal in April .

No , it 's not your imagination - gas prices really are going up .
Why ?
Months after soaring fuel prices spurred U.S. drivers to cut back on their driving , demand for gasoline is slowly coming back , helping to push up depressed oil prices .
Demand for gasoline has nudged up above last year 's levels for the past couple of weeks , government data released Thursday show .
Gas prices have been hovering under $ 2 a gallon since November , but now that they have been low for a while , consumers might be getting bolder about their gasoline use , analysts say . [...]
The feeble U.S. economy is expected to remain a drag on gas demand and prices .
While consumption is firming up , the increase from last year is tiny -- a four - week average of 0.8 % last week , despite gasoline prices that are more than $ 1 lower than during the same period last year .
Some energy experts , including the Department of Energy 's Energy Information Administration , predict that this year 's gasoline demand will be lower than in 2008 overall .
" A return to $ 4 a gallon is probably not something we 're going to see anytime soon , " said Tom Bentz , senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York .
It 's bad news for the rest of the world , though :
What an iDiot !
A Manhattan woman led cops to the dummy who stole her iPhone after the clueless crook used it to take pictures of himself and send them via her e-mail , police sources said yesterday .
“ There he is .
Is n’t he stupid ? ” victim Sayaka Fukuda , 29 , wrote on her blog next to the photo of Daquan Mathis , whom cops busted for the robbery .
Fukuda , a shoe designer who immigrated from Tokyo three years ago , was on the N train platform at the Fifth Avenue station near 59th Street at 4:30 a.m. on Feb. 21 when the robbery took place .
“ It was a scary night , ” she told The Post .
“ It was stupid that I took the train that late . ”
Mathis , who was with an accomplice , came up and grabbed the phone from her , she said .
After a struggle , he allegedly threw her purse onto a train and got on , she said .
“ I kept screaming .
‘ No ! No ! No !’ ” Fukuda recalled .
She reported the theft to cops , went home and got the surprise of her life .
“ I checked my e-mail and saw something in my outbox , ” she wrote on the Japanese - language blog .
“ I knew I did n’t send anything .
“ I opened the attachment , and there he was with his black and red knitted [ Spider - Man ] hat .
The same hat I described to the police officers . ”
She sent the photos off to cops who combed through mug shots and quickly zeroed in on Mathis , 18 .
He had sent the pictures to his own e-mail account , the sources said .
Meanwhile , Fukuda began a correspondence with the man who allegedly robbed her .
She e-mailed him , “ Thank you for your picture .
I sent them to the cops , you ’re going to get arrested soon , ” according to the blog .
She said he e-mailed back the next day , “ I will kill you !
I know where you live , I know where you work .
I ’ll send people . ”
Fukuda said , “ When I read this , I was crying and shaking .
But I wrote him back anyway , ”
Despite the alleged threat , she begged him to do the right thing , writing , “ Do n’t ruin your life for a cellphone .
Go to the cops before it gets worse . ”
The thief wrote back , “ You ’re right , but I ’m not going to the cops . ”
Mathis was busted Thursday and charged with robbery and grand larceny .
After his arrest , Mathis confessed to two other crimes including another robbery on an N train in which he stole an iPod at gunpoint , police sources said .
Mathis ’ stepfather , Sterling Wade , said police came to his house several times over the last two weeks looking for him .
“ They said he was wanted for armed robbery , ” he said .

My compiler students are getting to the point where they should be deep in writing a parser for their language .
Walking back from lunch , I was thinking about some very simple things they could do to make their lives -- and project -- better .
1. Start .
Yes , start .
If you read the literature of the agile software development world or even of the life hacker world , people talk about the great power that comes just from taking the first step .
I 've always loved the old Goethe quote about the power of committing to a course of action .
But is n't this all cliché ?
It is so easy to put off tracing your language grammar , or building those FIRST and FOLLOW sets , or attacking what you know will be a massive parsing table .
It is so easy to be afraid of writing the first line of code because you are n't sure what the whole app will look like .
Take the first step , however small and however scary .
I 'm always amazed how much more motivated I feel once I break the seal on a big task and have some real feedback from my client or my compiler .
2. Always have live code .
Live code is always better than ideas in your head .
Brian Marick tells us so .
One of the Gmail guys tells us so :
We did a lot of things wrong during the 2.5 years of pre-launch Gmail development , but one thing we did very right was to always have live code .
...
Of course none of the code from my prototype ever made it near the real product ( thankfully ) , but that code did something that fancy arguments could n't do ( at least not my fancy arguments ) , it showed that the idea and product had real potential .
Your code can tell which ideas are good ones and which are bad ones .
It can teach you about the app you are building .
It can help you learn what your user wants .
I hear this all the time from students : " We have a pretty good handle on this , but no code yet . "
Sounds good , but ...
Live code can convince your professor that you really have done something .
It can also help you ask questions and be submitted on the due date .
Do n't underestimate the value in that .
As Buchheit says from the Gmail experience , spend less time talking and more time prototyping .
You may not be Google , but you can realize the same benefits as those guys .
And with version control you do n't have to worry about taking the wrong step ; you can always back up .
3 . Do n't forget what you know .
Okay , I have to admit that this did not occur to me on my walk home form lunch .
This afternoon , a former student and local entrepreneur gave a department seminar on web app security .
He twice mentioned that many of the people he hires have learned many useful skills in object - oriented design and software engineering , using system languages such as Java and Ada .
When they get to his shop , they are programming in a scripting language such as PHP .
" And they throw away all they know ! "
They stop using the OOP principles and patterns they have learned .
They stop documenting code and testing .
It 's as if scripting occurs in a different universe .
As he pointed out after the talk , all of those skills and techniques and practices matter just as much -- no , more -- when using a language with many power tools , few boundaries , and access to all of his and his clients ' data and filesystem .
When building a compiler in class , or any other large - scale team project in a capstone course , all of those skills and techniques and practices matter , too , and sometimes for the first time in student 's career .
This is likely the largest and most sophisticated program they have ever written .
It is the first time they have ever had to depend on one or two or five other students to get done , to understand and work with others ' code , to turn their own code other for the understanding and use of their teammates .
There is a reason that you are learning all this stuff .
It 's for the project you are working on right now .

Last week I instructed an in - house performance tuning course and explained the participants about the threading optimizations in the Java 6 VM .
We run the exercises of the course on Java 6 update 11 and when I told them that Escape Analysis did not work properly yet , I realized I did not really know this for a fact for this update of Sun ’s Java .
So , it is time to re-run the benchmark and find some unexpected results .
I again use the same LockTest benchmark as discussed in my InfoQ article which I performed on jdk update 4 .
My source at Sun told me back then that I could expect improvements in lock elision by escape analysis in the update 10 and following releases .
So , good enough reasons to do the test again .
Escape Analysis not improved ; other locking optimizations deteriorated
When I started doing measurements , I quickly found out that unfortunately lock elision by escape analysis has not improved from update 4 to the most recent one , update 12 .
However , I found some other unexpected performance changes between update 4 and update 12 .
The next figure illustrates that .
Figure 1 . Average measured times [ ms ] of LockTest for Sun jdk 6 update 12 compared to update 4 with default settings .
The range denoted by the arrows covers 67 % of the distribution of measured times .
I did each test seven times on the same type of laptop as in the InfoQ article with the server VM and default settings .
I calculated the average and standard deviation assuming a normal distribution .
The red arrows are drawn from avg – stddev to avg + stddev to show the distribution of measurements .
A number of interesting conclusions can be drawn from these measurements .
First the good news is that Sun has achieved to improve StringBuilder performance by about 10 % in this benchmark .
The bad news however , is that StringBuffer performance has deteriorated by about 10 % !
The threading overhead is thereby increased from 36 % to a whopping 66 % , making it more expensive to use locking , at least on a dual core Intel machine .
Furthermore , the variation in the times of StringBuffer has increased substantially , as shown with the red arrows .
The cause of this variation needs further investigation .
The next figure shows the results of further measurements with switching on and off the –XX : + UseBiasedLocking and –XX : +EliminateLocks JVM options .
By default they are both on .
Figure 2 . Average measured times [ ms ] of LockTest for Sun jdk 6 update 12 , StringBuffer times with JVM different settings compared .
The range denoted by the arrows covers 67 % of the distribution of measured times .
I did these tests on my new laptop with a newer Intel Centrino CPU , therefore the absolute times are shorter than in previous test .
The relative times are about equal .
The figure shows that something weird is going on with the EliminateLocks feature .
With update 4 we saw that BiasedLocking sometimes appeared to not fully work sometimes .
That is no longer the case ; it has a healthy , low variation in times now as seen with the most right hand side bar in the figure .
However , both options off and only EliminateLocks on now result in a surprisingly high variation , which was not that high in update 4 with the same benchmark .
And that shows to a lesser extend with the default settings .
And even more striking is that while with update 4 the default setting resulted in the best performance , now the EliminateLocks optimization actually turns out to work counterproductively in this single threaded benchmark .
We get the best results with disabling the EliminateLocks feature and just use biased locking instead of with the default settings .
I can only guess about what is going on inside the VM and how it works with the CPU and caches .
The eliminate locks feature has varying effectiveness in seemingly similar situations and seems to get in the way or even conflict with biased locking .
This however does not mean that you should switch off this feature for your application .
Remember to Beware of the Benchmarks , they give an answer to a specific question .
In this case : What is the thread safely overhead of StringBuffer , influenced by the VM threading optimizations ?
Furthermore , we might elevate effects in this micro- benchmark that do n’t show up in real applications .
It would be interesting to see results of other threading benchmarks comparing these updates .
Based on this benchmark , I would say there is room for improvement for the Hotspot JVM developers .
Results on the IBM JVM
Just as a side note , the IBM virtual machine is reported to have Escape Analysis fully functional .
It can be downloaded for Windows as part of the IBM Development Package for Eclipse .
Let ’s run the benchmark on that one .
\ibm_sdk60\bin\java.exe - showversion - Xmn1g - Xgcpolicy : gencon LockTest
java version " 1.6.0 "
Java( TM ) SE Runtime Environment ( build pwi3260sr1-20080416_01 ( SR1 ) )
IBM J9 VM ( build 2.4 , J2RE 1.6.0 IBM J9 2.4 Windows Vista x86-32 jvmwi3260-20080415_18762 ( JIT enabled , AOT enabled )
J9VM - 20080415_018762_lHdSMr
JIT - r9_20080415_1520
GC - 20080415 _AA )
JCL - 20080412_01
Starting test
StringBuffer : 976 ms .
StringBuilder : 1006 ms .
Thread safety overhead of StringBuffer : - 3 %
Wow !
Escape analysis now fully shows its face .
I do n’t think I need to draw the bars to make clear that this JVM does a much better job at executing this benchmark .
Hats off to the J9 guys .
Profoundly disabled young men were forced into " fight club " style battles by the people hired to care for them in a Texas residential facility , US police say .
The staged battles - which appear to have been going on for at least two years - were discovered when police reviewed the video on a mobile phone camera found lying in the road .
" It 's some of the worst child abuse I 've seen in over 30 years , " Corpus Christi Police Captain Tim Wilson said .
" Sometimes we see isolated incidents .
What 's appalling about this is that it appears to be organised . "
The video footage showed staff members provoking the young men until they became physically violent , then shoving them at each other to make sure they fought .
Enlarge By Citizens United Hillary Rodham Clinton is surrounded by reporters in this image from a movie critical of the former first lady .
WASHINGTON 
When a special three - judge panel considered the scathingly critical Hillary :
The Movie last year , the judges deemed it a campaign ad with the unmistakable message that people should vote against then - presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton because she " is unfit for office . "
The conservative Citizens United , which produced the 90 - minute movie partly with corporate funds , said it was merely making a documentary about the issues .
The court rejected that argument and agreed with the Federal Election Commission that the movie was subject to campaign - financing law restricting when messages can be aired and advertised .
Now the issue is before the U.S. Supreme Court with the potential to greatly affect the regulation of political speech by corporate , labor and other big - money interests .
If Citizens United wins its most sweeping argument , the result could be a flood of corporate money in upcoming elections .
If the Supreme Court curtails rulings of earlier decades allowing limits on big donors , the case could end up " a blockbuster , " says Richard Hasen , a Loyola Law School - Los Angeles professor and election law expert .
" For generations , federal law has limited the ability of corporations and unions to use their enormous wealth to influence federal elections .
If ( key court precedent ) were reversed , I expect hundreds of millions of dollars of corporate and union money to pour into … races . "
At its narrowest , the case to be argued Tuesday tests whether Hillary : The Movie is a corporate " electioneering " message so it could not have been shown , as Citizens United wanted , through a cable television video - on - demand service during the primary election season .
More broadly , the case tests government 's ability to limit corporate and union spending without impinging First Amendment speech rights .
The dispute is the latest in a series of challenges to the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform
Act , which passed after years of wrangling and is often known by the names of its lead Senate sponsors , Arizona Republican John McCain and Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold .
In the law were tighter restrictions on corporate election contributions and enhanced disclosure rules for contributors .
The high court has signaled in recent cases , including in a 2007 dispute , that it may do more scrutinizing of such rules that limit corporate interests ' political speech .
David Bossie , president of Citizens United , says he was inspired to make Hillary : The Movie by Michael Moore 's 2004 documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 .
" I saw the enormous impact a documentary film could have on political discourse , conservative or liberal , " said Bossie , a longtime foe of Hillary Clinton who in the 1990s was an investigator on a House committee probing alleged Clinton White House wrongdoing .
Citizens United , a non-profit advocacy group that has produced other movies on causes such as illegal immigration , is represented by former solicitor general Theodore Olson , a onetime vocal Clinton critic himself .
Olson is taking a dual approach before the court : arguing that Hillary : The Movie was not a campaign ad to get viewers to vote against Clinton in the Democratic primaries but rather a recounting of events of her time as U.S. senator and first lady , and arguing that the court should rule certain limits on corporate spending barred by the First Amendment .
The movie , released through theaters and DVD sales in early 2008 , is a fast - paced collection of news footage and commentary against Clinton , now secretary of State .
She is called ruthless and deceptive , and the only nice words are offered , ironically , by conservative critic Ann Coulter : " Looks good in a pantsuit . "
Bossie says Citizens United sought to provide a full picture of Clinton as a Democratic Party leader , not as a candidate .
The movie covers controversies involving the firing of the White House travel office staff in 1993 , the failed health care plan and presidential pardons .
The Federal Election Commission said the movie fell under a provision of the 2002 law that bars corporations and labor unions from financing any " broadcast , cable or satellite communication that refers to a candidate " within 30 days of a primary election or convention .
That restricted Citizens United from making the movie available through video - on - demand broadcasts and from advertising it on TV during primary season .
A related question for the court is whether disclosure and reporting requirements of the 2002 law can be applied to ads for the film .
The U.S. Justice Department , defending the campaign law , characterized the movie as a clear " appeal … to vote against Senator Clinton for president . "
" Every element of the film , including the narration , the visual images and audio track , and the selection of clips , advances the clear message that Senator Clinton lacked both the integrity and the qualifications to be president of the United States , " acting U.S. Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler says in the government 's brief .
The Justice Department took the same position in 2008 , during the Bush administration , when the case began .
Olson counters that the movie differs from the usual campaign messages financed by corporate interests that government seeks to restrict .
" Although ( a ) compelling anti-corruption interest may be served by government restrictions on 30 - or 60 - second broadcast advertisements that constitute express advocacy , " Olson wrote , " that interest is categorically inapplicable to … feature - length movies " a viewer has specifically requested on cable .
Most significantly for future cases , he has asked the court to overturn a 1990 decision that allows government to limit corporate spending on elections because of the potentially " corrosive " effect and that requires corporations to set up separate , independent funds for political spending .
The high court has been narrowly divided , particularly in recent years , over how far government may go to regulate campaign speech .
In 2003 , the court broadly upheld the 2002 campaign - financing law .
Four years later , with new members Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito , the court scaled back a provision that curtailed so - called issue ads financed by corporations and unions before an election .
Roberts said , " The First Amendment requires us to err on the side of protecting political speech rather than suppressing it . "

The term ' 3 strikes ' is well known in file - sharing circles - infringe on copyrights and face Internet disconnection .
But every coin has two sides , day can eclipse night and evil can be countered by good .
Free music service Jamendo continues the theme by shunning ' 3 Strikes ' and embracing ' 3 Thanks ' for downloaders .
Proposals for disconnecting people from the Internet are a hot - topic at the moment but they are surrounded with such negativity that just writing about them can prove depressing .
But thankfully not all music suppliers want to be associated with such misery .
Luxembourg - based music platform and community Jamendo has well over half a million members , more than 100,000 album reviews and in excess of 17,000 albums on offer – all of them free to download .
Jamendo lets artists keep 50 % of the revenue generated and almost 100 % of the donations received by the site go to the artists too .
In order to make a statement amidst escalating discussion on ‘ 3 Strikes ’ regimes , Jamendo has launched a scheme of its own .
Called ‘ 3 Thanks ’ , Jamendo has turned the music industry ’s strategy on its head .
From now on , Jamendo will send a ‘ thank you ’ email to anyone who downloads any of the tracks ( currently around 200,000 ) from the site , while encouraging them to share with their friends .
Jamendo’s ‘ 2nd Strike ’ will be signaled by the most active downloaders receiving not a warning letter , but a ‘ thank you ’ note bundled with an “ accomplice kit ” containing stickers and other goodies .
In complete contrast to the plans of IFPI ( which plans to disconnect people on their ‘ 3rd Strike ’ ) , Jamendo will seek out their most active supporters who are able to convince a bar , restaurant , shop or hotel to sign up to the PRO service , and actually pay their ISP bill for the month .
TorrentFreak caught up with Jamendo creator Sylvain Zimmer who told us that he is delighted to be able to launch this initiative worldwide .
Clearly Jamendo feel there are better methods of doing business than lobbying for punitive measures against consumers .
But what should be done instead ?
“ We strongly think that the music economy is all about the relation between the artist and its fans : punishing them wo n’t do any good , ” Sylvain told Torrent Freak .
“ On Jamendo we try to make that relationship stronger , and we have seen over the years that it creates much more value , even for the artist though great feedback , donations , a large community / fanbase , loyalty and viral marketing .
Our job is to make the artists understand that , and we have 10,000 of them on the platform now that do , ” Sylvain added .
Sylvain told us that punishing downloaders will only alienate artists from their fanbase and make them less popular .
“ Maybe we have to help amplify that backslash , and make it the accepted standard to put your music online for free and monetize other revenue streams , such as concerts , music licensing , Jamendo PRO etc . ”
Visitors to torrent sites will be aware that Jamendo artist torrents are appearing there more and more .
We asked Sylvain if this is helping Jamendo to grow .
“ Yes we have partnerships with Mininova , is oHunt and Vuze among others , and yes they did help us grow a bit , ” he said .
“ I think what ’s also important is the service for the artists , it is one of our advantages compared to competitors .
We offer the artists that upload on Jamendo a very large reach , mainly via these partners . ”
As torrent sites struggle to be accepted as a legitimate platform for media distribution , Sylvain feels that a relationship with Jamendo can be a reciprocal one .
“ Through our partnerships , we also help them prove that their torrent websites can be used for legal content , so it ’s win -win for everyone , ” Sylvain told us .
All downloads on Jamendo are completely free for everyone , but users are encouraged to support any of the bands if they like what they hear .
The Pro package on the other hand is interesting for owners of bars , restaurant and other public spaces .
They avoid paying the traditional royalties and the money goes directly to the artists .

The Republican wing of the House voted en masse against the Obama stimulus plan .
Their criticism ?
Not enough tax cuts .
As Paul Krugman and others have often noted and indeed the Congressional Research Service has noted , tax cuts do n’t stimulate the economy .
In other words , they do n’t work .
The only people who actually spend a tax cut are people who are broke .
They usually spend it on necessities .
The rich invest them .
The middle class banks them .
Total stimulus ?
0 . Zero . Goose egg .
Nada .
So why keep pushing tax cuts .
Could it be a fundamentalist belief in Reagonomics ?
The trickle - down that never reaches bottom ?
No , I think these guys are lamely following their de facto party leader , Rush Limbaugh .
Does n’t it make you feel great to know that your Congressman might be a ditto - head ?
And what does commissar Rush want ?
To push Failure into Obama ’s face .
Who cares if the nation suffers from their obstructionism , the party is more important than mere people .
The senate was nearly as bad , but three senators had the guts to break ranks , realizing that the sooner something was done , the better it was for the American people .
Thank you Arlen Specter , Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins .
You showed true patriotism and courage .
Quite unlike the American Taliban , Pete Sessions of Texas .
Democrats are n’t the enemy , Pete .
The screwed - up economy is .
Oh , that ’s right , I forgot .
You ’re one of the ones who wants it screwed up .

AIG in lawsuit with govt .
over millions in tax payments Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday March 20 , 2009
Print This Email This Update at bottom : AIG and Countrywide sue each other Lost for the most part in the public furor over the AIG bonuses was the news that the insurance giant is already involved in a lawsuit with the federal government over hundreds of millions in tax payments , many of which were collected from offshore tax havens .
Though news of the lawsuit over $ 306 million in taxes AIG wants back was first reported on at the beginning of the month , the story did n't get much traction beyond the financial press and bloggers .
But then the tsunami of outrage surrounding the executive bonuses hit and the story looks like it may now be getting more attention as can be seen with this Friday report by The New York Times .
AIG filed suit against the government in February in an attempt to get back tax payments , collected in large part , reports The Times , " from its use of aggressive tax deals , some involving entities controlled by the companys financial products unit in the Cayman Islands , Ireland , the Dutch Antilles and other offshore havens . "
As the federal government has an 80 percent stake in the company , AIG is effectively suing its majority owner , notes The Times .
" The company is in effect asking for even more money , in the form of tax refunds , " reported The Times .
" The suit also suggests that A.I.G. is spending taxpayer money to pursue its case , something it is legally entitled to do .
Its initial claim was denied by the Internal Revenue Service last year . "
When AIG first filed suit , it was just one of many financial giants that had taken a handout from the federal government .
But since the news last weekend that company executives in the same financial products division responsible for nearly taking the country to the brink of collapse last year would be receiving $ 165 million in retention bonuses , populist rage , fueled by harsh rhetoric from pundits and congressmen , has crested to new heights against AIG .
Whether the company decides to continue its lawsuit in the face of that public anger remains to be seen .
Fear of lawsuits from AIG and other financial companies was what lead Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner to urge Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CN ) to insert a loophole into legislation that limited executive compensation in companies receiving bailout funding from the federal government .
That loophole exempted contractually obligated bonuses agreed to before Feb. 11 from the new restrictions .
On Thursday , the House of Representatives did away with that restriction , by overwhelmingly passing a bill that would tax 90 percent of any bonuses received this year of employees with incomes greater than $ 250,000 who work for companies getting $ 5 billion or more in money from the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program .
AIG accuses Countrywide of breach of contract A unit of AIG filed suit in federal court in California on Thursday against Countrywide Financial Corp. , charging that the company had misrepresented the health of loans that AIG insured , resulting in massive losses .
United Guaranty Mortgage Indemnity Co. , a unit of AIG , has accused Countrywide of breach of contract , fraud , negligence , and unfair competition and business practices , according to a report from Businessweek .
The suit claims that Countrywide " abandoned its own underwriting guidelines to boost its market share and then misrepresented the quality of its loans so that United Guaranty would provide insurance coverage for them . "
AIG , no doubt , is reacting to the lawsuit filed against them on Wednesday by Countrywide , which alleges that the insurer failed to cover more than $ 43 million in losses from failed real estate loans , many of which were bundled and sold as securities .
Countrywide is claiming that it more than $ 342 million in premiums to insure the loans .
AIG is seeking unspecified punitive damages and wants the insurance policies on the loans and its payments on the policies to be canceled , reported Businessweek .
Until Bank of America bought the company in July 2008 for roughly $ 2.5 billion , Countrywide was the nation 's largest mortgage lender .
" This is a lawsuit between two of the most vilified companies in America , " said Kurt Eggert , a Chapman Law School professor , in an interview with The Los Angeles Times .
" Here Countrywide displays a huge amount of chutzpah because it 's suing because its loans went bad , and it claims United Guaranty should have done better underwriting , when it 's the failing of underwriting by loan originators that got us into this stuff . "

Jindal and Palin
Posted on by jwb0581
I may be alone on this , but as a lifelong independent conservative I do n't know how anyone can compare Palin to Jindal .
Do n't get me wrong - I love Palin as a person and I love her positions on the issues .
But some of the interviews were just embarrasing .
I dislike Gibson and Couric more than anyone , but at times she was non-sensical or just plain empty in her answers and that can't be blamed on anyone but Palin .
I have seen others have their conservatism questioned because they have reservations about Palin .
Just because someone has conservative positions that I agree with , does n't mean they are presidential material .
My grandmother has great positions on the issues but she would not make a good president .
Jindal may come off as a geek , and maybe he 's too young to run in 2012 .
But this guy is the most brilliant , capable conservative I 've seen in years .
I live in Louisiana so I have watched him up close .
He is the real deal .

I agree with you about Palin .
But you 'll be told it was an insurmountable conspiracy .
She really DOES know of a SCOTUS decision she disagrees with .
In those debates , when she kept falling back on the strategy of using talking points instead of answering the question , that was a media conspiracy , too .
She 's actually Ronald Reagan .
As for Jindal , he IS a geek , and he IS too young , and he simply does n't look like presidential material to me .
It 's hard to believe the GOP is so barren , but apparantly it is .

Palin has exponentially more draw with the base than does Jindal .
Jindal whilst conservative is sorta lackluster and I think his main draw for many here is his uniqueness which I think is the wrong path for conservatives .
Identity picks .
Palin inspires folks and scares the hell out of the left .
Haley Barbour speaks much better and very disarming and affable but quite potent and is just as conservative but he ’s a chunky late middle aged white guy with a southern accent .
Why not him instead of Jindal .

Palin does n't even inspire the entire base .
Obviously there are some , like myself , quite uninspired .
She 's definitely a draw .
I 'd put her on the undercard of any rally for that reason .
But top of the ticket ?
Hell , I would n't even put her ON the ticket .
As for Haley , he 's a good old boy .
He 's a good debater .
Not sure if he has the type of salesmanship skills / gifts I 'd like to see in a presidential pick .
But then , neither did McCain .
Neither did GWB .
Neither did Bob Dole .
Neither did Bush1 .
The GOP looks rather pathetic .

Do you really want to start a war ?
Palin is my favorite , but I like Jindal too .
Let s give it some time and see how things play out before we tear down the top conservative contenders .
I pretty much agree with your position .
Palin was set up in a number of ways .
The media went into an insane feeding frenzy , and she had to stay on script for McCain rather than being herself even while knowing the media would take anything she said out of context .
I do n't think that her incoherent answers ( and she did have some ) are a sign of a lack of intelligence .
Given what I 've seen from her when she 's herself , the poor showings were far more likely due to a combination of edited interviews and trying to balance the McCain view with her own view under pressure and knowing that she was sitting across from reporters who hated her , hated her baby , and hate God .
As for 2012 , I 'm hoping Palin will earn the nomination in 4 years .
Like you though , I want her to earn it .

Musicians including Robbie Williams , Annie Lennox , Billy Bragg , Blur 's David Rowntree and Radiohead 's Ed O'Brien said last night that the public should not be prosecuted for downloading illegal music from the internet .
The Featured Artists Coalition , which consists of 140 of Britain 's biggest rock and pop stars , said at its inaugural meeting that companies such as MySpace and YouTube should be required to remunerate the artists when they use their music for advertising .
Bragg told The Independent that most of the artists had voted against supporting any move towards criminally prosecuting ordinary members of the public for illegally downloaded music .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The musicians will express their views to Lord Carter , who suggested that individuals downloading music illegally should be brought to justice .
While Lennox was not able to attend the meeting , she sent a message of support , as did Peter Gabriel , while David Gray , Fran Healy from Travis , Pink Floyd 's Nick Mason and Mick Jones from The Clash turned up in support .
Bragg was speaking as a key member of the coalition , which was set up to give a collective voice to artists who want to fight for their rights in the digital world .
It is pushing for a fairer deal for musicians at a time when they can use the internet to forge direct links with their fans .
" What I said at the meeting was that the record industry in Britain is still going down the road of criminalising our audience for downloading illegal MP3s , " he said .
" If we follow the music industry down that road , we will be doing nothing more than being part of a protectionist effort .
It 's like trying to put toothpaste back in the tube .
" Artists should own their own rights and they should decide when their music should be used for free , or when they should have payment . "
The artists wanted to tell Lord Carter " that we want to side with the audience , the consumer " .
O'Brien said it was a " defining time for the industry " , adding : " A lot of the rights and revenue streams are being carved up , and we need a voice ...
I think all the major players want to hear what we have to say . "
Today , Apple unveiled the new iPod Shuffle , which is only half the volume of the previous iPod Shuffle , which itself was about the size of a quarter .
The new one looks like a sleek aluminum tie clip , or maybe a slightly elongated stick of Trident gum ; a AA battery hides it completely .
There ’s just enough room on the back for a mirror - finish spring clip for fastening to your clothes .
( If you order from apple.com , you can get a custom message laser - etched onto the clip . )
When I told someone that the Shuffle now holds 1,000 songs ( in its 4 gigabytes of memory ) , he laughed .
“ It ’s like a ‘ Saturday Night Live ’ skit about smaller and smaller iPods , ” he said .
“ Or like the micro-cellphone in the movie ‘ Zoolander . ’ ”
And indeed it is .
Apple says that it ’s the smallest music player on earth .
Let ’s put it this way : it ’s really , really small .
It ’s so small , in fact , that there ’s no room for a screen , or even buttons or controls ; it ’s just a tiny , sleek slab with pleasantly rounded corners .
Instead , Apple has put a tiny remote control right on the earbud cord .
It has three clickable spots : + and – to control the volume , and a center button that acts as a play / pause button .
Yet incredibly , even though this Shuffle is even smaller than the previous one , it ’s actually more useful .
No iPod Shuffle has ever had a screen , and therefore you ’ve never been able to identify the song or band you ’re hearing .
You ’ve also never been able to work with playlists , since there ’s no user interface with which to navigate them .
Now there is .
You can tell all this stuff not by looking , but by listening ; according to Apple , the new Shuffle is the world ’s first talking music player , thanks to a new feature called VoiceOver .
( It ’s not the first , actually .
Older iPods have had talking menus to help blind people .
But anyway . )
If you hold down the center clicker for one second , you hear , in your earbuds , a crystal - clear male voice identifying the song and the performer ; it knows 14 languages , so it can handle Italian aria names , for example .
If you hold down the clicker longer , until you hear a beep , the voice starts rattling off the names of your playlists ( “ Jogging Tunes … Purchased … Makeout Music . ” )
You click the clicker when he gets to the one you want , or use the + and – buttons to go forward or back through them .
You can also flip the power switch off and on again to hear him tell you how full your battery is — for example , “ Battery 50 percent . ”
Apple says that a single charge plays music for 10 hours .
It ’s looking like 2009 may be the year that synthesized voices go mainstream ; this talking iPod comes hot on the heels of Amazon ’s Kindle 2 , which can read your e-books aloud to you .
In the Shuffle ’s case , this is an especially interesting development , because it means that the player itself can be out of sight .
It can be clipped deep inside your clothes , for example , away from subway iPod thieves .
Yet you can still operate and navigate your music using only the earbud clicker and feedback from Mr. VoiceOver .
You should know , however , that the voice you hear differs depending on whether you ’ve loaded up the Shuffle from a Mac ( clear , American , accent - free voice ) or a Windows PC ( much more synthesized - sounding , vaguely Scandinavian accent ) .
But hey — all ’s fair in business , right ?
Microsoft has given the Mac universe slightly stunted versions of its programs for years ; now , evidently , it ’s payback time .
Instead of the built - in USB connector of the original Shuffle , or the tiny plastic dock of the second - generation one , this third - generation Shuffle comes with a tiny , three - inch white USB cord .
That ’s how you charge it , and that ’s how you load it up with music and podcasts from a copy of iTunes 8.1 ( a required download before you can use the Shuffle on your Mac or PC ) .
Now , overall , new design is ingenious .
The solid - slab - of - aluminum approach surely makes this the most rugged iPod ever .
The sound is fantastic .
And the price is right :
The new Shuffle is available in black or silver aluminum for $ 80 .
But the old , square Shuffle is still available ( half the capacity , $ 70 ) .
And why would you want it ?
Because the new Shuffle locks you into using Apple ’s earbuds .
No other headphones have the clicker on the cord , and so ca n’t make the music play music at all .
Personally , I ’m in love with the Arriva.com headphones for the old Shuffle .
It ’s a headband that goes around the back of your head , placing the earbuds neatly into your ears without any cords or tangling ; the Shuffle itself clips into the middle , at the back of your head where you can easily reach it .
The whole thing is inconspicuous , does n’t fall off and does n’t interfere with glasses — and if you have long hair , you can listen to the iPod completely undetected ( hello , PTA meetings ! ) .
The new Shuffle , however , would n’t work with those headphones .
Apple says that it has been working with headset makers to help them design Shuffle - compatible headphones ; announcements should be forthcoming shortly .
For now , though , potential Shufflers should be aware that it ’s the included earbuds , Apple ’s $ 80 in - ear earbuds , or nothing .
As iPods ’ size approaches that of atomic particles , some online are pointing out that they ’re becoming ever more likely to get lost .
I ’m not convinced that that ’s an issue ; that three - foot white strand of earbud cord makes a pretty good landmark when you ’re rooting through a purse or a drawer .
No , the only real cause for pause is that headphone - selection issue — and whether you might prefer an iPod with a screen ( which would give you photo and video playback , plus compatibility with the zillions of iPod chargers , car adapters , speaker docks and other accessories ) .
But if you want really big sound in a really small package , the iPod Shuffle may be speaking your name .
P.S. –This Sunday morning , March 15 , “ CBS News Sunday Morning ” plans to air my report on A Better Place .
It ’s software millionaire Shai Agassi ’s audacious plan to solve the climate crisis and eliminate our dependence on oil .
The crux : Replace all of the world ’s automobiles with electric cars that contain swappable batteries .
Sound unattainable ?
Guess what : 5 countries , 3 American states , at least 2 car companies , and armies of investors ( over $ 500 million so far ) have already signed on to make it happen .
As always , the lineup may change , but this is the current broadcast plan .

According to the lawsuit , Dupree was standing from four to seven feet above the concrete jail floor on a bunk with his hands raised in a defensive posture Feb. 27 , 2007 , when he was stunned with a Taser gun , which delivers a 50,000 - volt shock .
The suit alleges Dupree fell and , instead of giving him medical treatment , sheriff ’s supervisors ordered him to stand up and deputies carried him to the fingerprint area and dumped him on the floor .
Blake Dupree filed the federal lawsuit for battery , assault and negligence against the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department , several deputies and two sheriff ’s supervisors for the incident , much of which was captured on videotape .
The two supervisors are the subject of an internal misconduct investigation for authorizing the use of a stun gun because Dupree refused to come out of his cell and submit to electronic fingerprinting .
A man left paralyzed below the chest after he fell from the top bunk of a jail bed at the Lakewood sheriff 's station when a deputy used a stun gun on him sued the department today for violating his civil rights .
“ Defendants ’ actions rendered Plaintiff paraplegic .
Plaintiff has no use of his mid to lower torso or legs , and limited use of his arms , ” wrote Dupree 's attorney , Justin Sanders .
" Deputies knew Dupree ’s muscles would be incapacitated by the electro - muscular disruption of the Taser rendering him unable to break his fall . "
Sheriff Lee Baca told The Times last year that " common sense " should have dictated that using the Taser on Dupree was inappropriate while he was on the bunk and likely to fall as a result of being shocked .
The suit was filed after settlement negotiations broke down with the 22 - year - old Dupree in Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in Downey .
After the incident , the Sheriff ’s Department launched an investigation to determine whether use of the Taser violated department policy , Sanders said .
Department rules prohibit using the device on " persons in danger of falling or becoming entangled in machinery or heavy equipment which could result in death or serious bodily injury . "
Despite the prohibition , the policy allows for supervisors to decide whether use of a Taser is warranted on a case - by - case basis .
Lt. James Tatreau Jr. , who authorized the use of the device on Dupree , was reassigned to administrative duties along with an unnamed sergeant .
Tatreau , a former driver and bodyguard for Baca , had previously organized a game called " Operation Any Booking , " in which deputies competed to see how many people they could arrest .
Dupree had been arrested after he allegedly took his mother ’s car without her permission .
At the jail , he acted erratically and refused to cooperate , deputies said .
According to Sheriff ’s Department reports obtained by The Times , Dupree was given a verbal warning by Tatreau , who had conferred with the sergeant on the scene , and a deputy was ordered to fire the equivalent of a warning shot by activating the Taser , allowing Dupree to hear its buzz .
After the warnings , Dupree stood on the bunk and began to move toward the edge , in the direction of the deputies , according to sheriff ’s spokesman Steve Whitmore .
It was then that a deputy shot Dupree with the Taser , causing him to fall to the floor .

Air New Zealand Successfully Trials Weed Biofuel
Remember back in June how Air New Zealand announced it was going to be trialling a biofuel mix in a 747 aircraft based on the jatropha plant ?
Well , they did it , and according to The Register , everything went off without a hitch .
The plane used a 50 - 50 mixture of the biofuel and regular fuel in one engine , while the other three all had regular fuel running through them .
They tested out a series of mid-air manoeuvres like engines stops , restarts , and got full power from the biofuel mix .
The reason they were using the jatropha plant is because it thrives in arid regions , and does n’t require fertile land otherwise needed for forests or food farmland .
Ideally , they could begin farming the plant in the middle of the Australian desert , although whether they could be mass - produced is still being debated .
Still , it ’s great to see an airline taking a real pro-active approach to the problem they ’re facing with fuel – ultimately , fossil fuels are destined to run out , so the further we can stretch them and the quicker we can come up with an alternative , the better .

Child Custody and Support -
As introduced , states that a parent not in possession of a child is entitled to video chat with the child as part of the right to unimpeded telephone conversations if the technology is available to both the parent and the child ; states that a parent is not required to purchase any device in order to allow the other parent to video chat with the child .
- Amends TCA Title 36 , Chapter 6 .
As a web user , you might have noticed that some sites look beautifully designed , with attractive pictures and stylish typefaces , while many others look cluttered or even crude .
You might also have noticed that hardly anybody uses some of the pretty ones , while some of the uglier ones are extremely popular .
For example , Amazon , Craigslist , Digg , eBay , Expedia , Facebook , IMDb , MySpace , TripAdvisor , Yahoo and Wikipedia would n't win any beauty contests , but they 're all among the most successful sites on the web .
How can this be ?
The answer , of course , is that most people do n't go on the web to look at sites , they go to use them .
They want to buy or sell something , book tickets , find information , share thinks , or chat to friends .
So our key criteria are how useful and how usable sites are , which is not the same as how they look .
Websites are not glossy magazines , they are software applications .
Pixel - perfect graphic designs have their place , but on the web , appearance is usually less important than usability , readability , reliability , speed , and the quality of the content .
As it happens , there 's a web site about usability that scores well in all these areas : Jakob Nielsen 's UseIt.com .
But it 's not pretty , and this tends to get web designers frothing at the mouth .
Nielsen is the man they love to hate .
This is a pity , because UseIt.com is where Nielsen publishes his Alertbox columns .
He does usability research , writes papers , produces books and organises courses through Nielsen Norman Group , the company he runs with a former Apple Fellow , Don Norman , so his advice has plenty of commercial value .
And through Alertbox , he 's been giving it away since 1995 .
Over the years , Nielsen has published several columns about common mistakes in web design , with the latest updated in 2007 .
Often these " mistakes " are obvious , and almost every web user will recognise them .
But it does n't stop countless web sites from making them .
Still , is n't it odd that Nielsen does n't defuse criticism by updating UseIt 's defiantly old - fashioned appearance ?
His answer is that it 's a Purple Cow , which refers both to a rhyme and to a book by marketing guru Seth Godin that says : Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable .
" Keeping the same website for 10 years does make for a sort of purpleness , and that makes it hard to abandon it , " Nielsen says .
" Purple is not actually a great colour for a cow , but it does stand out .
And in the modern world , you have to stand out .
" Redesigning it would take away the real value : I 'd be just one out of 10 million .
But I 'm probably the only one who could get away with it . "
Although some graphic designers claim they hate UseIt , ordinary users tend to like it .
We usually want sites to be usable , and we get frustrated when they 're not , even if we do n't really know what 's wrong with them .
Nielsen helps us to understand the problems , and that they 're not necessarily our fault .
One of the first things I do every year on the first of January is have a look at what happened with the IP address stockpile during the previous year .
We started 2008 with 1,122.85 million unused addresses left and we ended it with 925.58 million .
So the world used up 197.27 million IP v4 addresses in 2008 , increasing use of the total address space from 69.7 percent a year ago to 75.3 percent now .
The IP address space is managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ) , which is part of ICANN , the people who normally debate the virtues of .xxx domains .
IANA maintains a list of 256 blocks of 16,777,216 IP v4 addresses each , identified by the first 8 - bit number in an IP address .
Each of those " / 8 " blocks is either delegated to a Regional Internet Registry ( RIR ) , is unallocated ( available for future delegation ) , has legacy status , or is reserved for a special use .
The table below shows the overall distribution of IP v4 addresses among the regional registrars .
Delegated to / status Blocks +/- 2008 Addresses ( millions ) Used ( millions ) Available ( millions ) AfriNIC 2 33.55 9.18 24.37 APNIC 30 +4 503.32 454.36 48.96 ARIN 31 +4 520.09 446.06 74.03 LACNIC 6 100.66 68.88 31.78 RIPE NCC 26 436.21 423.65 12.56 LEGACY 92 +1 1543.50 1363.29 180.21 UNALLOCATED 34 -9 570.43 570.43 Totals 221 3707.76 2765.42 942.34
APNIC ( Asia - pacific region ) and ARIN ( North America ) both got four new / 8 blocks last year — ARIN got two of those just before Christmas .
LACNIC ( Latin America and Caribbean ) and especially AfriNIC ( Africa ) still have a lot of address space to work with , but it looks like the RIPE NCC ( Europe , Middle East , former USSR ) will be receiving more address space from IANA soon .
The block that was added to the legacy pile is 7.0.0.0/ 8 , which was given out to the US DoD Network Information Center , which apparently did n't want this information to appear in the IANA list , but it 's now listed as " administered by ARIN . "
( See my full report for additional caveats . )
Things get more interesting when we look at the top 15 list of largest IP address - using countries .
The US is still at the top , having 52.4 percent of all IP v4 addresses in use — which includes the vast majority of the legacy space .
However , a few years ago this was at 60 percent , so 52 is actually an improvement .
Despite that , the US was still the largest user of new IP v4 addresses in 2008 with 50.08 million addresses used .
China was a close second with 46.5 million new addresses last year , an increase of 34 percent .
Rank Was 2009 - 01-01 ( millions ) 2008-01-01 ( millions ) Increase Country 1 1458.21 1408.15 4 % United States 2 3 181.80 135.31 34 % China 3 2 151.56 141.47 7 % Japan 4 120.29 120.35 0 % Europe general 5 86.31 83.50 3 % United Kingdom 6 7 81.75 72.46 13 % Germany 7 6 74.49 73.20 2 % Canada 8 68.04 67.79 0 % France 9 66.82 58.86 14 % Korea 10 36.26 33.43 8 % Australia 11 12 29.75 23.46 27 % Brazil 12 11 29.64 24.04 23 % Italy 13 16 24.01 19.83 21 % Taiwan 14 18 23.18 17.01 36 % Russia 15 14 21.67 20.42 6 % Spain
Although China and Brazil saw huge increases in their address use , suggesting that the developing world is demanding a bigger part of the pie while IP v4 addresses last , what 's really going on is more complex .
India is still stuck in 18th place between the Netherlands and Sweden at 18.06 million addresses — only a tenth of what China has .
And Canada , the UK , and France saw little or no increase in their numbers of addresses , while similar countries like Germany , Korea , and Italy saw double - digit percentage increases .
A possible explanation could be that the big player (s ) in some countries are executing a " run on the bank " and trying to get IP v4 addresses while the getting is good , while those in other countries are working on more NAT ( Network Address Translation ) and other address conservation techniques in anticipation of the depletion of the IP v4 address reserves a few years from now .
In both cases , adding some IP v6 to the mix would be helpful .
Even though last year the number of IP v6 addresses given out increased by almost a factor eight over 2007 , the total amount of IP v6 address space in use is just 0.027 percent .
A quadriplegic since she was 14 , Jessica Grimm learned long ago how to work around her body 's limitations .
She lives alone , uses a computer , has a job , even drives a car .
But the Arlington , Texas , student must rely on a coterie of assistants to help her dress , cook and get through each day .
Now 27 , Grimm is eager for more independence .
So much so that she traveled to Costa Rica last month for a controversial stem cell treatment that 's unavailable in this country .
Grimm and her family raised about $ 20,000 to cover her trip to the Institute for Cellular Medicine , where doctors injected her with adult stem cells .
" I was actually able to take a few steps on my own before I left , which I 've never done , " she said .
" My mom was crying .
Then my physical therapist started crying . "
The feat thrilled Grimm , who previously had some mobility in her legs and hand .
But she still has no idea whether the treatment actually succeeded .
Doctors told her it could take months to see results .
And it 's possible that the real credit for her footsteps should go not to the cell injections , but to the strenuous physical therapy she did in Costa Rica .
" I do n't know if it was the physical therapy or the stem cells .
But it definitely showed me I need to get back into physical therapy , " Grimm said .
" If I can build more muscle , there 's no telling . "
That kind of ambiguity troubles some U.S. researchers , who worry about a rise in " stem cell tourism " as foreign clinics promote treatments for multiple sclerosis , Alzheimer 's disease and a host of other illnesses .
They contend that doctors from Ukraine to Mexico are pitching risky procedures on the Internet to vulnerable patients , with no science to back up their claims .
It 's unclear how many people are traveling abroad for stem cell therapy or even how many clinics offer the treatments .
But one biotech company , which boasts 24 hospitals in China , claims to have treated more than 3,000 patients at its facilities alone .
The promise of stem cells , which are found in embryos and in various body tissues , comes from their ability to develop into many different types of cells in the body .
Proven stem cell treatments exist for only a handful of conditions , mainly affecting the blood and immune system .
But advocates believe that the cells can be used to repair damaged or diseased tissue in many parts of the body .
Laurie Zoloth , who directs the Center for Bioethics , Science and Society at Northwestern University , said legitimate researchers worldwide are experimenting with stem cells , using a methodical approach to scrutinize the safety and effectiveness of their treatments .
Without such controlled trials , stem cell clinics have no evidence that their treatments work , she said .
" They 're not doing science .
They 're selling a product and making claims .
But they have no way to test it , no way to make it safe , " Zoloth said .
" It 's just on the basis of pure trust . "
A study published recently in the journal Cell Stem Cell raised similar concerns .
Researchers from the University of Alberta who reviewed 19 Web sites found that stem cell clinics portray their treatments online as " safe , effective , and ready for routine use in a wide variety of conditions . "
Yet they found little clinical evidence - and sometimes none at all - that stem cell therapies can treat Alzheimer 's disease , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , spinal cord injuries or strokes .
In December , the nonprofit International Society for Stem Cell Research released guidelines for developing stem cell treatments aimed largely at addressing " rogue clinics " that market treatments directly to patients .
In its accompanying patient handbook , the organization - of which Zoloth is a member - urged patients to ignore claims based solely on patient testimonials .
Dr. Fabio Solano , who is medical director of the stem cell institute in Costa Rica , dismissed the criticism and said opponents " are generally speaking out of ignorance . "
Solano said he warns patients of potential risks and accepts only those who stand to benefit from his treatments .
" I do not make any promises of results to patients , " he said in an e-mailed statement .
Solano treats patients with stem cells derived from umbilical cords or with cells harvested from their own bone marrow or fat , he said .
He cited several examples of successful cases and insisted that his treatments are similar to natural processes in the body .
" Your dog and your horse can get treated with fat stem cells in the U.S. , but not your brother , " Solano wrote .
" If a critic asks me ' How can I do this ? ' my answer is , ' How can I not ? ' "
One believer is Fort Worth police Sgt. Preston Walker .
Walker , who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2001 , underwent stem cell therapy last May at Solano 's clinic in San Jose , Costa Rica .
Before the treatment , he grappled with memory loss , depression and fatigue so severe that he was exhausted by 8 every night .
Now , Walker said he 's virtually free of symptoms .
He has lots more energy .
And he has given up three prescription drugs that he used to take routinely .
" I really believe I 'm a walking testament to what they 're offering , " Walker said .
" It was a big , big leap in faith . "
Zoloth acknowledged that some patients , like Walker , do show improvement after treatment .
But unless stem cell clinics conduct meticulous studies that experts can review , she said , there 's no way to explain those results or to tally how often therapy succeeds .
" That sort of trial is the only way to know if something works , " Zoloth said .
" I know the desperation of patients .
I know the desperation of people who look at their child and just wish it could be fixed .
...
But we really can't know the answer until we take it through the course that , since the Enlightenment , science has used to try to find truth .
And that 's the experimental method . "
Of course , that approach can take many years .
Walker said he was n't interested in waiting while his symptoms worsened .
He never hung his hopes on the Food and Drug Administration approving stem cell therapy .
And he wondered what the price would be if American physicians offered stem cell therapy someday .
" So many people have expressed some concern about going to a Third World country , " Walker said .
" Just looking around , and seeing just what 's happening in the United States and people dragging their feet , I knew I was going to have to go .
So I prepared myself for an overseas visit . "
Walker spent upward of $ 20,000 on his visit to Costa Rica , where he got a combination of physical therapy , spinal injections and IV treatments .
He began to sense improvement after the second injection and felt significantly better by the time he flew home , Walker said .
The changes have endured so far , although Walker said he experienced one particularly miserable day after the treatment and still has trouble with short - term memory .
Walker , who now knows about 30 people who have had treatment at the Costa Rica clinic , concedes that some of them have n't seen much relief .
" I wish I could say this is going to be the same for everybody , but it 's apparently not , " he said .
" I definitely took a gamble . "

WHAT TO CONSIDER
Considering stem cell therapy ?
Here are some questions to ask before getting treated :
• Have preclinical studies been published and reviewed by other experts ?
• Is the provider approved by the appropriate regulatory agency ?
• What 's the scientific evidence that this treatment works for my condition ?
• What are the possible benefits I can expect ?
• How will this be measured and how long will it take ?
• How is the procedure done ?
• What 's the source of the stem cells ?
• How are they delivered to the right part of the body ?
• What are the risks and side effects ?
• Whom do I contact for emergency care ?
• Who 's the doctor in charge ?
What training does the physician have ?
• What are my rights if I 'm injured ?
• What are the costs of treatment ?
• What are the costs of emergency care if something goes wrong ?
Who pays for that ?

The votes are not officially tabulated yet , and it will take a while for the implications [ . pdf ] of the recent provincial elections in Iraq to become apparent .
But it is not too early to take note that they were conducted almost entirely by the Iraqis themselves , under Iraqi rather than American direct supervision , and that they were carried out almost completely peacefully .
Though some charges of ballot fraud have been registered , the elections seem to have at least met the standards of Chicago or Louisiana for honesty .
While the neocon fantasy of a model democracy the rest of the Middle East will rush to emulate is unlikely to emerge anytime soon , it is nonetheless a moderately hopeful omen .
While there may already be efforts under way to deter President Obama from his stated decision to begin U.S. troop withdrawals promptly and complete them within 16 months , the elections offer no substantial reason for delay .
If anything , the outcome is reason to make sure the process of giving Iraq back to Iraqis is not delayed unduly .
Results from these provincial elections , a prelude and perhaps precursor to national elections likely to happen later this year , are still somewhat preliminary , and , as Ted Carpenter , vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian - leaning Cato Institute , emphasized when I talked to him last week , they were leaked by various parties with an interest in spinning perceptions .
But if the reported trends hold , it appears that Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and his Dawa Party have performed better than most had expected , not only in Baghdad but in Shia - dominated southern Iraq , and especially in Basra .
The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq ( ISCI ) , which is more overtly religious than Dawa and has closer ties to Iran , had floated the notion of a semi- autonomous southern region , but that idea did n’t seem to get as much traction as some had expected .
Another surprise is a comeback by Iyad Allawi , the first prime minister after the Coalition Provisional Authority , who is somewhat more secular than Maliki .
Allawi saw his supporters gain more seats than had been expected .
This is generally seen as a sign that at least a fair number of Iraqis prefer a secular regime to a religious one .
They also appear to favor a relatively strong central government to keep Iraq together as a nation instead of splitting it into three states ( de jure or de facto ) , as some ( including me at various times , as well as Joe Biden ) have argued might be the least disruptive way for those who live in that region to live with minimal conflict .
Marina Ottaway , director of the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , told me that if the preliminary trends hold , this might well demonstrate little more than the power of incumbency , " the oldest story in the Arab world , " which could have benefited Maliki and to a lesser extent Allawi .
She thought that Maliki might also have done so well in the southern port city of Basra in part because voters there turned out to be grateful for the controversial decision by Maliki to send national troops to Basra to break the hold of Shia militias , which had ruled the city and its outskirts by a ruthless and rather arbitrary application of Sharia law .
Ottaway is not quite ready to say that the results indicate a real resurgence of nonsectarian nationalism .
While the Shi’ites and Sunnis were divided into several factions and parties  some 14,500 candidates ran for only 440 provincial council seats  most Iraqis still did n’t cross sectarian lines to support candidates .
Sunnis generally voted for one of the Sunni parties , and Shi’ites did likewise .
Rather than voting for a strong central government , then , the Shi’ites may have simply been voting to make sure that whatever government of whatever strength emerged , it would be dominated by Shi’ites .
Given that the Shi’ites were persecuted when Saddam ran the country with his Sunni Tikriti henchmen , this is hardly surprising .
There were trouble spots that could lead to violence .
In Anbar province , where the " Anbar Awakening " changed sides , took U.S. money , and subdued al - Qaeda in Iraq , making the U.S. " surge " ( which the Awakening preceded ) look good , the sheiks are restless .
Awakening candidates did not do as well as expected , and Awakening spokesmen have charged voter fraud by the Sunni Iraqi Islamic Party , rooted both in the Muslim Brotherhood and Saddam ’s Ba’ath Party , which in early , possibly unreliable leaked results was getting about 40 percent of the vote .
A curfew was declared as Awakening people murmured darkly that if things did n’t change or vote fraud was proven , they might have to handle their opponents the way they did al - Qaeda .
In Mosul in the north , Sunni Arabs and Kurds have been struggling for dominance , and early results show Sunni Arabs with the electoral upper hand .
Mosul is on the outskirts of traditional Kurdistan , but the Kurds have been moving people there in hopes of dominating the city .
Bad feelings and perhaps even violence could be brewing there .
Despite the relative smoothness with which the elections were pulled off , then , there are reasons for caution .
Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies warned in a paper [ . pdf ] that it will be months before the results can be judged properly for the simple but often overlooked reason that in the long run capability to govern is more important than which faction one represents :
" It is not yet clear how well the vast majority of those candidates who are elected in this election will actually do in office , " he writes .
" For many , it will be a learning experience  to put it mildly .
It will also be a sobering  if not grim  experience in dealing with a central government that has deep divisions of its own , has deep elements of factionalism and corruption , often acts to the narrow advantage of its leaders , and which has not demonstrated the capability to allocate its budget effectively , much less actually spend it .
These problems will be compounded by the fact that Iraq is moving from a surplus of oil export income to major problems with its coming national budget and economy . "
So Iraq might have budget and economic problems almost as severe as those facing the United States .
Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of these elections is that the status or role of the U.S. seemed to play little role in the campaigning or in the positions taken by various parties .
Presumably most of the Iraqi factions assume that the U.S. is on its way out , that Iraqis of some stripe or another are actually going to be running things fairly soon , and that now is the time to scramble for whatever piece of power they can grab as a new order emerges .
It would be amazing if there were n’t at least a latent fear that Uncle Sam will stick around and insist on being the big brother , but at least the parties did n’t go out of their way to show that this one or that one resented the occupiers more than its adversaries did .
The lesson to take from this is that what Iraq becomes will be determined by Iraqis .
There are likely to be democratic elements in the country that emerges , but democracy will mainly be used to justify the power arrangements that show themselves in coming months and years .
There will be tussles for power .
The country might even devolve into three semi-autonomous regions .
It is unlikely that changes will be accomplished without at least some bloodshed .
But it is just possible that after all the violence of the last several years , most Iraqis , whatever their sect or persuasion , are sick and tired of the killing and ready to embark on a process of building a society and allocating power and resources with less violence than before .
Even if the next few years witness violent clashes , the capacity of U.S. forces to be effective as peacekeepers or disinterested arbiters is much less than it might have been even a few months ago , and it is likely to decline .
The Iraqis wo n’t get it right the first time , and they might take years to work things out .
But the U.S. is more likely to complicate matters than to facilitate solutions , if only because of its limited capacity to understand the correlation of forces .
Max
Boot seems to think that the election is a setback for Iran , but that is almost certainly wishful thinking .
Iran is more powerful regionally than it was when the U.S. invaded Iraq , but the death of Saddam ensured that anyway .
ISCI may be closer to Iran than Dawa , but Iran is likely quite content with Maliki , who gave Iranian boy president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a royal welcome last year .
The Iranians might have preferred a closer ally , but their strategic interest is to make sure no attack is launched against them from Iraq , and Maliki will do just fine in that respect  especially if the U.S. begins exiting in a way that reassures people that it ’s not planning to leave any significant combat force behind .
Anthony Cordesman thinks the emerging Iraq will still need a lot of help from the U.S. and the international community .
" Even ‘ Iraq good enough ’ is still far from any kind of certainty , " he writes .
I would suggest , however , that the more certain the Iraqis are that the U.S. is really leaving  in an orderly way that will take a while , but really leaving  the more it will be clear that the burden of putting together an " Iraq good enough " lies on them rather than on Uncle Sam .
The longer it appears U.S. forces are staying , the more Iraqis are likely to postpone taking the kind of full responsibility the U.S. has said it wants them to take .
One doubted such protestations when the Bushies uttered them , suspicious that they really wanted to leave enough troops behind to run things ( building on the vast success of the Coalition Provisional Authority , no doubt ) .
But maybe an Obama administration will mean it .
We can hope .
It would seem that LaCie have taken the Key Drive moniker and really run with it , creating a range of flash drives that look much like regular door keys .
These stylish , yet potentially confusing key drives include the jokingly named ItsaKey and IamaKey in capacities of up to 8GB , plus a PassKey which incorporates a Micro SDHC reader in the head .
All three key drives utilize USB 2.0 and come with a tough metal , nickel coated surface that should get you plenty of use … until you lose your set of keys that is .
Lacie claims its Key Drives are lightweight and get 30 MB /s read and 10 MB / s write speeds , with the IamaKey featuring a gold SIP water and scratch - resistant connector .
Both the IamaKey and ItsaKey are available in either 4GB or 8GB capacities , with the PassKey limited only by the size the MicroSD card you insert into it .
Aside from the novelty value , the design of these drives seems like a really good idea .
The metal enclosure should protect the drive from the elements better than plastic and would likely be less fragile .
The drives will apparently be available for sale shortly , with prices ranging from $ 9.99 ( £ 7 ) to $ 27.99 ( £ 20 ) direct from LaCie .

Introduction and Specifications
In early January , back from our roadtrip to Vegas with CES show buzz and bewilderment still fresh in our minds , we brought you an interview with Drew Henry , General Manager of NVIDIA 's MCP products .
Drew gave us a first - hand glimpse at a new small form factor PC platform that NVIDIA was developing based on their recently released GeForce 9400 M chipset with integrated graphics .
In this new era of HTPCs , netbooks , nettops and all things tiny in general , NVIDIA 's Ion reference platform for the Intel Atom processor offers the promise of an ultra low - profile , low power device that quite literally fits in the palm of your hand , and thus could be easily tucked away in various small places in a number of different usage models .
Though the sixty - four thousand dollar question is which of NVIDIA 's 3rd party partners will come to market first with an NVIDIA Ion - based product ( we 're hearing Q2 should be the magic time frame ) , NVIDIA has given us unfettered access to their tiny , low power , multimedia , all - in - one PC .
We 've only had it in our test labs for a few days , but we thought we'd share with you our first impressions and a deeper dive on the performance and features of Ion , which will give you a sense of what lies ahead for the platform , as retail products are introduced to market , hopefully in the not too distant future .

DPC Data is one of four firms recognized by regulators as municipal securities information repositories .
For the study , Peter J. Schmitt , DPC ’s chief executive , examined trades that involved issuers that had recently filed so - called distress notices , indicating that they were experiencing financial problems .
Mr. Schmitt found that an alarming number of these beleaguered issuers ’ securities were purchased by individual investors at nondistressed prices  100 cents on the dollar ( known as par value ) or higher .
This indicates that brokerage firms executing the trades may not have been aware of the issuers ’ troubles or failed to give investors full disclosure about them , Mr. Schmitt said .
“ The fact that these rules , which were meant to stimulate disclosure , have been swept under the rug and that the market has been allowed to go forward on poor and inconsistent information does n’t say a lot about how assiduously regulators are pursuing investor protection , ” Mr. Schmitt said .
It comes as no surprise that defaults and other stresses on municipal issuers rose significantly in 2008 as the credit crisis deepened .
Some 348 distress notices were filed last year , up from 187 in 2007 .
Although the economy was tanking , DPC data found that almost 28,000 trades took place in securities that issued a distress notice at some time during the year .
Some 9,643 of those trades were sales to customers , both institutions and individuals ; more than half of them  5,798  were bought at par value or higher .
Mr. Schmitt dug deeper , analyzing how many customer purchases were made after a distress notice was filed by the issuer .
He found 1,782 such trades , of which 667 were sold at par or more .
Obviously , when evidence emerges that a debt issuer is under stress , one would expect the price of its bonds to fall .
And yet hundreds of trades of exactly this kind of debt were priced at par or higher , which Mr. Schmitt finds troubling .

There have been a number of abuse allegations against US troops in Iraq
An American military jury has found a US army officer guilty of the murder of an Iraqi detainee .
The jury in Fort Campbell , Kentucky , also convicted 1st Lt Michael Behenna of assaulting Ali Mansour Mohammed near Baiji , north of Baghdad , last May .
Behenna had argued that he was defending himself when he fatally shot Mr Mohammed during an interrogation .
He was found not guilty of the more serious offence of premeditated murder , the Associated Press reported .
The defence argued that Behenna had only intended to interrogate Mr Mohammed about a roadside bomb which had killed two members of his platoon .
Defence attorney Jack Zimmerman said Behenna was suffering from acute stress disorder at the time , and had acted in self defence when Mr Mohammed had reached for a gun .
But US military prosecutor Capt Jason Elbert said it was clear from Behenna 's behaviour at the time and threats he made that he had intended to kill the detainee .
He said Behenna had " controlled the whole situation as an officer of the US Army , armed and protected and under no threat " .
Last week another US soldier , Sgt Michael Leahy Jr , was found guilty of the murder of four Iraqi detainees who were shot and their bodies dumped in a canal .
The US has about 142,000 military personnel stationed in Iraq , but President Barack Obama has said that most troops will be withdrawn by August 2010 .
Tumour blood vessels ( in red ) , surrounded by cancer cells ( in blue ) A type of drug designed to stunt tumour growth has actually been found to fuel cancer if given at too low a dose .
UK scientists were investigating a kind of drug called an anti-angiogenesis , still under development , which hampers the growth of tumour blood vessels .
Avastin and Sutent , which act in a similar way , have been proven to work and were not covered in this research .
But cancer experts say the study in Nature Medicine could help make those drugs more effective .
The researchers focused on a drug called Cilengitide which is designed to prevent blood vessel cells sticking together and moving - an important part of angiogenesis .
Previous tests on people have found that a few patients with brain tumours benefited from high doses of the drug , but that it failed to work for most .
Knowledge of this mechanism will help us develop new ways to make these drugs as effective as possible
Dr Andy Reynolds , Institute of Cancer Research
In this research , tests carried out on mice showed that low doses of Cilengitide actually stimulated the growth of cancers .
Further investigation showed it did this by switching on a molecule called VEGFR2 , which triggers the angiogenesis process .
That is significant because although when a patient is initially given a drug , its level in the blood rises quickly ensuring a big dose goes to the tumour , after a while levels start to fall as the body begins to deal with the drug .
This is likely to be why trials of the drug have shown such poor results .
Caveat Dr Kairbaan Hodivala - Dilke of the Institute of Cancer , who led the study , said it was important that the trials looking at this drug continued .
" We 've got evidence now that low doses can enhance tumour growth .
So there is no benefit of giving a high dose , which then drops , and then a high dose again .
" But that 's not to say it can't work at all .
It can , but there is this caveat . "
She said it may be more effective to give the drug via an infusion pump , which would allow the dosage to remain topped up at an effective level .
Sutent and Avastin have proven effective enough for use in the NHS but there is still need to understand why they can sometime fail
Dr Lesley Walker , Cancer Research UK Dr Andy Reynolds , from the Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre at the Institute of Cancer Research , who also worked on the study , said : " Knowledge of this mechanism will help us develop new ways to make these drugs as effective as possible .
" In the future , we may be able to combine these inhibitors with other drugs to maximise their effectiveness for patients . "
Dr Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK , which helped fund the research , said : " This study is important because it may help to explain the mixed results previously seen in patients and turn around disappointing results so people may still benefit from the drug without the potential harm . "
But Dr David Reardon of Duke University Medical Center in the US who is involved in the trials of Cilengitide , said the drug had shown promise for patients with glioblastoma ( brain tumours ) .
He added : " If sufficiently positive , the results of these trials will lead to its approval to further improve outcomes for patients with this devastating disease . "
Mechanisms
The research also has implications for the existing drugs Sutent , used to treat kidney cancer , and Avastin , for colorectal cancer .
They work by the same process , but on different targets .
At the moment , they can extend a patient 's life by several months .
Experts hope that this research could lead to a better understanding of the drugs ' mechanisms and so to ways of making them more effective .
Dr Walker said : " Sutent and Avastin have proven effective enough for use in the NHS but there is still need to understand why they can sometime fail .
" It may be that there are similar mechanisms at work . "
Last month , the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence - the NHS 's drugs appraisal body - said Sutent could be considered for people with advanced kidney cancer .
However , it decided against recommending Avastin for advanced colorectal cancer .

The video download , which may claim to contain hidden camera footage of you , or a famous celebrity , then encourages you to download an updated version of the Adobe Flash Player plug - in .
Other newly emerging threats include fake Facebook alerts from malicious third - party applications that say your friends are having trouble viewing your profile or have reported you for a violation of the company 's terms of service .
Notification messages typically read : " Error Check System " or " F a c e b o o k - closing down !!! "
Whoever clicks on these inadvertently sends the same notification to everyone on their friends list , replicating the malware and opening access to all of their personal profile data .
" A major motive for this type of attack is to give a person third party access to your computer .
Primary infection is generally not what causes the damage , " said Adam Biviano , a spokesman for security software company Trend Micro .
No stranger to Facebook malware is PR manager , Caroline Simpson , whose computer was infected with the Koobface worm in December after clicking on a video link sent from a colleague in the US .
" It told me I needed to update my Adobe Flash to see the video , but no video came up .
I clicked it again and then closed down the computer .
When I opened up the computer later that day I was n't able to access any files .
A pop-up said I had downloaded a virus and offered to sell me a package to remove it .
" We wasted about half a day or more removing the malware after trawling through the web and Facebook looking for instructions on how to get rid of it " .
Thousands of Facebook users have flocked to groups on the website dedicated to viruses and other malware , some just issuing warnings , others who learned about the threat the hard way .
" Just got my computer back today from Computer Depot and they said I had a very bad virus from Facebook , it just about killed my system completely ... so please be aware , " said one user .
" I have the virus on my laptop , and I cant open up ANY programs sensibly or do anything really ... all these virus scanners that come with the virus go crazy when I turn on my computer , " said another .
Although Facebook disables malware applications reported by users , it maintains a hands off policy when it comes to approving applications uploaded to its website .
" We 've tried to make the process of building on the Facebook Platform relatively easy in order to stimulate innovation - and to allow the kid in a college dorm room to compete against the big corporation .
" . . .our developer community has more than 660,000 developers . . .
The drastic measures others have suggested is akin to saying , ' there have been two robberies , we need to implement martial law in the city ' , " the company said .
" Graham Cluley , a senior technology consultant at security company Sophos said that while it was impractical to expect Facebook to check every single application that users upload , that did n't mean it should do nothing .
" The first thing would be that anyone wanting to write a Facebook application would have to prove their identity and contact details .
" My proposal would be that Facebook application developers would need to jump through several hoops before they were approved to unleash their applications on the networks ' 150 million plus users . "

Learn How ... Obama Justice Dept. defends Rumsfeld in torture case Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday March 13 , 2009
Print This Email This Exclusive : Attorney had hoped Obama admin would take ' stronger moral stance ' on torture
In a brief filed Thursday evening , Obama Justice Department lawyers extended many of the same arguments made by Bush attorneys -- that top government officials have qualified immunity from prosecution and that Guantanamo detainees do not have constitutional rights to due process .
The Department of Justice has asserted that a Supreme Court ruling reaffirming the rights of Guantanamo detainees to habeas corpus does not apply to plaintiffs in a case against former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld because the plaintiffs were released from prison four years prior to the Supreme Court 's decision .
" It is fair to say that the current brief that is filed by the new administration supports a lot of the arguments that were made by the previous administration , " said Kate Toomey , an attorney with Baach Robinson & Lewis who is representing the former detainees in an interview with RAW STORY .
" They continue to assert that torture was in the scope of employment and could be reasonably expected .
They continue to assert that these [ top officials ] be entitled to immunity .
They also continue to argue that detainees at Guantanamo do n't have constitutional rights . "
The brief was filed as part of the Rasul v. Rumsfeld lawsuit of four former detainees , who include the " Tipton Three , " and are seeking damages for their detention and reported torture at Guantanamo Bay against Rumsfeld , the Chairmen of the Joint Chief of Staffs and other top military officials .
The suit charges them with violations of the Fifth and Eighth Amendments , the Alien Tort Statute , the Geneva Conventions and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
The plaintiffs are individually each seeking $ 10 million in damages .
The men were held for more than two years at Guantanamo where they were reportedly subjected to regular beatings , death threats , sleep deprivation , extreme temperatures , forced nakedness , interrogations at gun point and religious and racial harassment .
They were never charged with any crime .
The men were released in March 2004 and returned to their home country of Britain .
The plaintiffs are also being represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights , which has a full background of the case , including all court documents here .
Thursday 's brief is the latest action in the case after the Supreme Court in December granted the former detainees ' petition to review their case in light of the court 's June 2008 ruling in Boumediene v. Bush that Guantanamo detainees do have a right to habeas corpus .
All charges in the case had previously been dismissed by the D.C. Circuit of the Court of Appeals except for the charge of violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
" Boumediene - decided four years after plaintiffs ' detention ended - cannot support a finding that the law was so clearly established that a reasonable official would have known that his or her conduct violated the Constitution or the RFRA statute , " the brief states .
The department 's request that the Boumediene ruling not be considered in the Rumsfeld case puts the Justice Department directly at odds with statements made by President Obama during the 2008 campaign .
" Habeus corpus ... is the foundation of Anglo - American law , which says very simply , if the government grabs you , then you have the right to at least ask , ` Why was I grabbed ? ' and say , ` Maybe , you 've got the wrong person , " said Obama at a early Sept. 2008 campaign rally where he seemed to refer to just such exactly the case posed by the the Tipton Three .
Shortly after 9/11 , the former detainees were in Afghanistan reportedly doing humanitarian work when they were grabbed by a local warlord and handed over to American forces allegedly in exchange for the bounty the military was offering for suspected terrorists .
" The reason we have that safeguard is we do n't always have the right person , " said Obama at the campaign rally .
" We do n't always catch the right person .
We may think this is Muhammad the terrorist .
It might be Muhammad the cab driver . "
Given statements like these made by President Obama , Toomey said she and others involved with the case had been hopeful that the new Justice Department would have taken a stronger stance on some of the most criticized policies of the Bush administration .
" We had hoped that they would file something that separated them from the former administration and obviously we had hoped that they would be taking a stronger moral stance about what should be anticipated from senior officers including the Secretary of Defense on legally standing prohibitions , " Toomey said , adding , " There 's no question that the U.S. law forbids people from ordering torture .
And so it 's unfortunate that they have sort of squandered an opportunity to have made that point . "
The Obama Justice Department extends the argument made by the Bush Justice Department that top government officials have qualified immunity when it writes :
" Because government officials are not 'expected to predict the future course of constitutional law ' ... decisions that post - date the conduct in question cannot be used to deny qualified immunity . "
Language used in the brief of the individual defendants in the case , including Rumsfeld , having a " clear entitlement to qualified immunity " casts doubt on the hopes of civil and human rights activists that the Justice Department will take up calls to launch criminal prosecutions into the architects and policy designers of some of the most criticized Bush policies such as waterboarding , extraordinary rendition and warrantless wiretapping .
Further light on the department 's position on individual prosecutions of members of the Bush Administration can be gleaned from statements like this in the brief :
" The prospect of individual liability increases the likelihood that officials will make decisions based upon fear of litigation rather than appropriate military policy . "
The brief also makes the claim that it is " unnecessary " for the Supreme Court to address the question of whether the former detainees have " constitutional due process rights . "
" Plainly , the constitutional rights asserted by plaintiffs , which are still not established today ... were not clearly established at the time of the alleged acts in question here .
Accordingly , this Court was correct in concluding that a reasonable officer would not have concluded that plaintiffs here possessed Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights while they were detained at Guantanamo . "

CCTV: A video of NYPD officers grabbing cash and stuffing it in their pockets during a gambling bust on Staten Island has become an Internet hit .
The video is from a Nov. 14 , 2007 , raid on Beer Goggles , a bar in Staten Island .
A bald officer is seen counting cash before giving to other officers .
Three different officers are seen taking some of the money and putting it his pocket before handing the wad of cash to another officer .
No official judgment has been made on whether the officers seen on the tape were doing anything criminal , but they told their superiors things were done according to procedure , according to the New York Post .
The police reported confiscating approximately $ 700 and arrested three workers for promoting gambling at the bar .
The surveillance tape popped up on the Web under the headline " NYPD corruption at its best . "
The video was first screened at a separate departmental trial for Sgt. William Lewis .
Many of the police actions were led by Lewis , a 24 - year veteran .
The Internal Affairs Bureau investigated Lewis for five months before suspending him and leveling corruption charges in March .
Several cops from the raiding party testified against him .
No decision has yet been reached .

Boxed milk and juices are a supermarket staple , but one company is now selling boxed water .

Boxed Water
Is Better sells water in cartons , ditching the plastic bottles while reducing the overall carbon footprint of packing and distribution by 80 % .
20 % of the company 's profits are passed along to reforestation ( 10 % ) and water relief ( 10 % ) while you sip on the sweet hydrogen / oxygen nectar of Minnesota and a few parts per billion of paper pulp .

But while Boxed Water is undoubtedly more sustainable than bottled water , I can't help but think the product 's absurdity does less to open a new market than close an old one .
In other words , Boxed Water is a ridiculous solution to an even more ridiculous problem — that we 'd rather buy packaged water than drink it for nearly free out of the tap .

This is a super - simple version of chicken curry that anyone , and I mean anyone , can make .
Not only can anyone make it , anyone can make it quickly .
And you can make it even more quickly if you want to brown your onions and grind your curry paste ingredients ahead of time and freeze them in individual portions .
All you need are some basic items in your pantry : a handful of Indian spices ( cumin , coriander , cloves , fennel , fenugreek seeds , cardamom pods , chile flakes and turmeric ) , onions , garlic and ginger , one lemon or lime , coconut milk and the optional frozen grated unsweetened coconut that you can find in most well - stocked Indian markets these days .
To these ingredients , you add chicken , and any of a plethora of vegetables , fruits , herbs and greens to make a unique curry that will taste delicious every time , even if you never make it exactly the same way twice .
The key to making this curry is to relax , and let loose .
Add what you like , leave out what you do n’t .
You do n’t have to follow my spicing instructions exactly , but the masala I use makes a very nice , mild coconut milk curry that pleases everyone and offends no one .
And once again , you can speed the process up considerably by preparing ahead of time .
Brown your onions in batches for a single curry , and put them in ziplock bags and stick them in the freezer .
Then , grind up your ginger , garlic , spices and frozen grated unsweetened coconut ( if you use it–it is optional , but I love it ) in single batches and put the resultant spice paste into little ziplock bags and put them in the freezer .
Then , when you are on your way out of the door for work , pull your chicken , your onions and masala paste out of the freezer to thaw in the fridge while you are away , and voila !
When you come back , you have all the fixings for instant curry .
At that point all you need is a fourteen ounce can of coconut milk and some vegetables , herbs or fruits if you want .
If you have a rice cooker , you can set it to make basmati rice and have it ready when you get home , too .
To put it all together , just put a bit of canola or coconut oil in a pan , and add the onions .
Heat everything on medium high and when it is hot , add the chicken and cook , stirring until half of the pink has turned brown and white .
Add the masala paste and keep cooking and stirring until the spices smell deliciously toasty and divine and the chicken shows almost no pink at all .
Then , add the coconut milk , and stir well to combine everything , turn the heat down to low and simmer .
At this point add any vegetables or fruits you like –I will give you a list of ideas at the end of the recipe–and cook until the vegetables are done .
If you want to add greens , add them near the end , or in the case of baby spinach , at the very end .
If you want to use herbs , stir them in at nearly the end of cooking –unless you choose to use curry leaves , in which case , they go into the pan with the masala paste , and get cooked directly in the hot oil so their flavor and fragrance permeates the dish completely .
And then it is done .
If you take the shortcuts , this recipe can be done in about fifteen minutes , start to finish , depending on what fruits or vegetables you choose to add to the curry .
If you cook it all from scratch , it can be ready in about forty - five minutes , which coincidentally is how long it takes my rice cooker to make me up a batch of basmati , so it is all just perfect .
It ’s like fast food , only homemade , tasty and good for you .
Oh , one more thing –the frozen unsweetened shredded coconut .
It is n’t necessary , but it makes the curry oh so much richer , nicer and thicker .
I use Swad brand , and I have never had trouble finding it in any of the well - stocked Indian or Asian markets around Ohio , so if I can get it , I figure most other folks can .
You can also use dried unsweetened flaked coconut for this purpose–which you can definitely find at Indian or Asian grocery stores , but if you use it , add some water to your masala paste to moisten it a bit .
You can also soak the dried coconut in water for a few minutes to rehydrate it slightly before grinding everything together .
Whatever you do , do n’t use the sweetened flaked stuff you can get in the grocery store baking aisle .
Not only will it make your curry sweet , which is the last thing you want to do , it also contains propylene glycol , which is a humectant , meaning it keeps the coconut moist by attracting water molecules from the air .
Which is all fine and good , but when heated , as it would be when it is toasted or when it is put into a hot pan to be cooked , it releases the propylene glycol in a cloud of bitter , acrid fumes which not only smell awful and are probably not good for you to be breathing , but it leaves a bitter aftertaste in the coconut .
So , just do n’t go there .
Everyday Chicken Curry
Ingredients :
21/2 ″ cube fresh ginger , peeled
5 - 7 large cloves garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds
2 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
3 whole cloves
5 green cardamom pods
Kashmiri or other mild chili flakes such as Aleppo , to taste–I use about a tablespoon of them
1/2 cup frozen shredded unsweetened coconut , lightly thawed
1 1/2 teaspoons turmeric
water as needed to make a proper masala paste
2 tablespoons canola or coconut oil
2 cups thinly sliced onions
1 teaspoon salt
2 whole boneless skinless chicken breasts –about two pounds–cut into slices !
1/2 ″ X1/2″X1/2 ″
14 ounce can coconut milk
1/4 cup water
salt to taste
juice of 1 lime or lime juice to taste
Method :
In a blender or spice grinder , grind the first 10 ingredients into a paste , using however much water you need to get the paste to become thick and smooth .
Set aside .
Heat oil over medium heat in a heavy - bottomed skillet or braising pan–cast iron , either enameled or plain , is perfect for this–and then add onions , and spread them into a single layer .
Sprinkle them with salt and cook , stirring , until the onions turn a dark golden brown color that is edging onto reddish brown .
Add the chicken to the pan , and continue cooking and stirring until half of the pink in the flesh has turned to brown and white .
Add the spice mixture and stir to combine well , and continue cooking until the spices smell wonderful and the chicken shows almost no pink at all .
Add the coconut milk and 1 /4 cup of water and simmer for about fifteen minutes , or until the chicken is done .
Add salt as needed to taste and add lime juice to balance the natural sweetness of the coconut milk with a little top note of sour .
Serve over steamed plain basmati rice .
Optional Additional Ingredients :
Vegetables and Greens :
Baby or fingerling potatoes , white red or blue , scrubbed and halved or kept whole .
You can either parboil them until they are nearly done in a separate pot of water and then add them to the curry after the coconut milk , or you could add more water to the curry and let the potatoes cook in the curry sauce , but you may have to let the sauce simmer the excess water away after everything is cooked .
Peeled and cubed sweet potatoes
Sliced summer squash
Whole tiny baby carrots
Frozen peas
Pearl onions
Blanched fresh green beans or frozen green beans
Blanched or parboiled cauliflower–purple would look neat
Mushrooms–but if you use them add them with the chicken and saute them first
Baby turnips , peeled and halved
Baby spinach–add at the very end , just before serving so it just wilts and stays a nice velvety fresh green
Kale , stemmed and cut into thin ribbons –blanch first or add in the last ten minutes of cooking
Tomatoes , canned or cherry tomatoes , fresh–add canned in the last ten minutes of cooking , add cherry tomatoes , halved , at the end of cooking
Fruits :
Mango , fresh or frozen .
Add at the end , in the last five minutes of cooking
Pineapple , canned , fresh or frozen–add in the last ten minutes of cooking Do n’t use syrup packed pineapple–it is too sweet
Pomegranate seeds–just sprinkle them over the top right before serving
Ripe Plantain , peeled and cut into 1 ″ chunks–add in the last ten minutes of cooking
Golden raisins–add right after the coconut milk
Herbs :
Fresh cilantro , added right before serving in copious amounts
Fresh mint , added just before serving in a moderate amount
Fresh or frozen fenugreek greens , added in the last ten minutes of cooking
For Vegetarians and Vegans :
You could easily make this vegetarian by using pan-fried or deep fried paneer in place of the chicken , or if you want to make it vegan , then use pan - fried or deep fried tofu instead .
You just have to remember you wo n’t need to simmer the cheese or tofu as long as you do the chicken , though the longer it simmers , the more flavor it will pick up from the sauce .
Leftovers of this curry freeze very nicely , and like all curries , it benefits by being made a day ahead , or if not , the leftovers will taste amazing the next day .

BERLIN , Germany ( CNN ) -- A German court Monday refused to intervene in the case of Bishop Richard Williamson , who is facing prosecution for denying the Holocaust -- a crime in Germany .
Bishop Richard Williamson , shown in the recent Swedish TV interview , has been removed from his seminary post in Argentina .
Williamson asked the court to order Swedish Public Television to restrict broadcast of an interview in which he doubts the existence of Nazi gas chambers and a systematic Nazi plan to annihilate European Jewry .
Williamson sought the help of the court because Holocaust denial is punishable in Germany only if it is publicized there .
The court refused the request , it announced Monday .
His lawyers argued that giving an interview to a Swedish television station did not constitute denying the Holocaust in Germany -- although he was physically in the country when he made the remarks .
Williamson hit the headlines last month when he and three other ultra-conservative bishops were welcomed back into the Roman Catholic Church , more than 20 years after Pope John Paul II excommunicated them on a theological question unrelated to the Holocaust .
The state court of Nuremberg - Fuerth ruled that the bishop would have had to notify Swedish reporters of any restrictions before the interview .
According to the court , Williamson also wanted the interview removed from the network 's Web site .
The court said it is clear that the Swedish network is available on satellite in many countries and that he knew they had a Web site which can be seen around the world .
A German district attorney announced February 4 that he had launched a criminal investigation against Williamson on January 23 .
Regensburg District Attorney Guenther Ruckdaeschel said authorities are investigating whether his remarks can be considered " inciting racial hatred . "
Denying the Holocaust in Germany is punishable by up to five years in prison .
" I believe that the historical evidence is strongly against -- is hugely against -- six million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler , " Williamson said in the interview , which also appeared on various Web sites after broadcast .
" I believe there were no gas chambers . "
Williamson and three other bishops who belong to the Society of Saint Pius X were excommunicated in 1988 .
The society was founded by Archbishop Marcel Lefebrve , who rebelled against the Vatican 's modernizing reforms in the 1960s , and who consecrated the men in unsanctioned ceremonies .
The rehabilitation of Williamson sparked harsh condemnation from Israel , American Jewish leaders and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , among others .
The Vatican has pointed to several statements by Pope Benedict XVI in the past few years condemning the destruction of European Jewry , including his visits to concentration camps .
He has also said he did not know of Williamson 's views on the Holocaust when he lifted the excommunication .
The Vatican has said Williamson will not be allowed to perform priestly functions until he recants his Holocaust denial .
He has apologized for " distress " his remarks caused the pope , but he has not retracted them .
On Sunday , Merkel phoned Pope Benedict about the issue , though neither side seemed to have shifted its position over Williamson .
In addition , Williamson was removed over the weekend as head of a seminary in Argentina .
The views of Bishop Williamson , who has led the seminary in La Reja since 2003 , do not reflect those of The Society of St. Pius X , said Christian Bouchacourt , head of its Latin American chapter .
Bouchacourt said , in effect , Williamson had no business discussing the Holocaust issue .
" It 's obvious that a Catholic bishop cannot talk with the ecclesiastical authority but to things related to faith and morality , " Bouchacourt said in a written statement .

Flat World Knowledge Offers Open Source - Style College Textbooks
by Ostatic Staff - Mar. 25 , 2009
Part of the high cost of attending a college or university is due to the exorbitant fees for textbooks .
It 's an $ 8 billion dollar market and schools often pass on the high cost of textbook purchases to their students .
Once a school selects course books , it 's up to professors to mold their curriculum accordingly , rather than offer reading material that suits their teaching style and course content .
In an effort to make curriculum content more accessible to both students and teachers , New York - based startup Flat World Knowledge is going after the textbook industry by offering expertly - written books that educational institutions are free to modify to meet their needs .
Flat World 's current " open source " book catalog is sparse since many of the books are still being written and edited , but thanks to recent venture capital funding , Flat World now has $ 8 million in series a funding in its coffers to finance the production of more books .
The company also plans to unveil a textbook customization feature later this year that will let educators revise books according to the specific needs of their curriculum .
Flat World initially offered only business course textbooks while they tested the waters , but have since expanded their categories to include Accounting , Management , General Business , and general courses .
In a prepared statement , company co-founder and chief marketing officer , Eric Frank , said that branching out into general education courses will have the biggest impact on community colleges .
" Not only are general education courses the bread and butter of community colleges , community college students are feeling the greatest pinch from the high cost of traditional textbooks .
With 40 percent of students sitting in a general education course at any given time , we know that expanding our offering will help a greater population of students . "
Customizable textbooks is an idea that can't help but catch fire .
The cost of college courses are nearly prohibitive for many families , even without the added cost of textbooks so , of course , free is good .
I 'm also intrigued that Flat World gives college professors the freedom to teach subjects the way they feel is best , not the way a faceless committee of textbook authors decided it should be taught .
Regan Caruthers , director of communications and business development for the California State University system , told CNN recently , " The Web gives us a rare opportunity to rethink the delivery mechanism for textbooks .
If someone does this right , they 'll make it better for everybody concerned : the professors , the students and the publishers . "

A woman has been hospitalized with life - threatening injuries after a pet chimpanzee attacked her at a friend 's home in Stamford , Connecticut , police said .
Travis is shown in 2003 , when he escaped and " wreaked havoc " on the streets of Stamford , Connecticut .
Charla Nash , 55 , had just arrived at her friend Sandra Herold 's house when the chimp , named Travis , jumped on her and began biting and mauling her , causing serious injuries to her face , neck and hands , according to Stamford Police Capt .
Rich Conklin , who said the attack was unprovoked .
Herold had called Nash to her house to help get 14 - year - old Travis back inside after he used a key to escape .
While her friend was being attacked , Herold tried to pull the primate off her , but was unsuccessful .
She then called 911 before stabbing the chimp with butcher knife and hitting him with a shovel .
Neither fazed Travis , who police said was like a child to Herold .
Stamford police later shot the chimp multiple times after he attacked an officer inside a police cruiser , Conklin said .
Travis returned to the house , where police later found him dead .
Conklin estimated that Travis weighed close to 200 pounds .
The police captain also said this is n't the first interaction his officers have had with Travis ; the chimp escaped in 2003 and " wreaked havoc " on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours .

Do n't Miss WFSB : Chimp had Lyme disease , owner says
In 2005 , a different chimp escaped from California 's Animal Haven Ranch and chewed off a man 's nose and genitals .
During an interview after that attack , wildlife expert Jeff Corwin told CNN 's Anderson Cooper that chimpanzees are " absolutely powerful . "
Watch Corwin explain why chimps do n't make good pets »
" It 's often said that an adult chimpanzee weighing in at 150 pounds is three to seven times stronger than a human being , " Corwin said .
" The thing about chimpanzees is , we sort of look at them through our rose - colored cultural glasses of the cute little chimp in the ' Tarzan ' movie .
Those are very young chimps .
Chimps grow up , they become very powerful .
They are very complex in their behavior .
They have a whole range of emotions , including violence and anger . "

Each time I post a setup guide for configuring a Django server there are questions about how I came upon the Nginx and Apache multi-server approach as opposed to the myriad of alternatives .
There are two parts to this question :
Why a multi-server approach instead of a single - server approach ?
Why Nginx , Apache and mod_wsgi , specifically , instead of some combination of Nginx , mod_python , fcgi , Lighttpd , etc ?
This article will take a stab at explaining my reasoning for the first question : why use a multi-server setup to serve Django projects ?
The Components
There are a number of competing components used in server setup , and for this discussion which component specifically used is not especially interesting .
To be more specific
When I refer to Nginx , it could actually be any lightweight http server .
That could mean Lighttpd or even a stripped down Apache instance .
When I refer to Apache and mod_wsgi , that could be Apache and mod_python , or even Nginx running FCGI .
It 's any server which is serving Django projects .
Postgres is my relational database of choice , but you could substitute it with MySQL or SQLite .
Hell , you could even be using CouchDB for the extent of this discussion .
For caching I mention memcached , which does n't have many direct competitors , but to the extent that they exist , they could be used interchangeably .
The Single - Server Approach
The simplest approach to serving a Django project is to configure one server to serve both dynamic ( Django rendered pages ) and static content ( images , CSS , JavaScript , etc ) .
The biggest advantage of this single - server approach is in its simplicity .
Especially Apache -- but other systems as well -- is very quick and painless to setup for a configuration like above ( I find Nginx and fcgi a bit less straight forward , but certainly doable as well ) .
Another advantage is that you only need to run one server at a time , and servers can hog memory and cpu , especially on low powered solutions like a small VPS .
That said , the single - server approach is a bit unwieldy when it comes to scaling your site for higher loads .
As with other approaches , you can begin scaling the single - server setup vertically by purchasing a more powerful VPS or server , but trouble starts to sneak in when it is no longer cost - effective to increase capacity by upgrading your machine .
Upon reaching that situation , your first move will typically be to move your database to a second machine , which is easily accomplished .
However , when you need to add more capacity for serving dynamic or static content , the setup is a bit inflexible .
Your first and only option is to add additional machines behind a load - balancer .
Although in reality you 'd likely have Postgres on a separate machine .
In review , the single - server setup may be the most efficient option for low resource environments , is relatively simple to configure1 , but must serve static and dynamic content with the same configuration , and thus may open itself up for inefficiencies as demands grow ( we 'll discuss this more below ) .
The Multi-Server Approach
Anyone who has read a tutorial describing mod_python usage has probably read the term fat threads , which is the word du jour for describing Apache worker threads when mod_python is enabled .
This is because each mod_python worker thread needs a Python interpreter associated with it , causing each worker thread to consume approximately 20 megs of ram .
There are good reasons for that , and mod_python is extremely fast at serving dynamic requests , so the cost is certainly justifiable .
However , why have a heavy thread serve a static file when a much lighter one is sufficient ?
Further , how do we prevent our relatively low quantity of heavy threads from being monopolized by slow connections ( and as a result able to serve fewer concurrent users ) ?
The standard answer to that question is to have a lightweight server that is the first point of content for users , serves static media , and proxies requests for dynamic media to heavier threads on a second server .
Essentially the argument being made be the multi-server setup is that specialization leads to efficiency .
By allowing one server to focus only on serving dynamic media we can tweak its settings to maximize performance for that task .
By allowing a second server to focus on serving static media , we can optimize it as well .
Beyond the specialization leads to optimization argument , the multi-server approach has another benefit over the single - server approach : ease of efficient scaling .
Because we have separated the concerns from one another , it makes it very easy to scale efficiently by adding capacity exactly where it is needed .
With only minimal configuration file changes you could switch the simple one machine model to a many machine model .
This is especially simple if the narrowest point in your pipe is serving dynamic content .
Admittedly this system does ask Nginx to perform as both a proxy and the static media server , and if serving static media requires more throughput than one machine can provide , you 'll need to move to the server pool approach ( which finalizes the separation of concerns ) .
To a certain extent it 's much easier to scale vertically ( purchase a larger VPS or server ) than to scale horizontally , and that should always be the first choice .
However , should you reach a point where scaling vertically ceases to be cost - effective , the multi-server approach provides a tremendous amount of flexibility and allows higher gains per server due to specialization .
In the end , there is n't a right - wrong choice between using the single - server or the multi-server approach .
While the multi-server approach will eventually out - perform the single - server approach , with limited resources may underperform it .
That said , my experience with the multi- server approach has been very positive , even with very limited resources ( 256 megabytes of RAM on a VPS ) , so -- if you 're willing to do some extra configuration -- I 'd personally recommend going with multi-server from the start .

まあディスクが故障しなかっただけ幸いだと思おう...
OS の入れ直しは生活習慣を見直し悪習を捨てる機会でもある . 私の Windows 生活で最大の悪習は cygwin だ. ホスト OS への敬意を欠く cygwin には以前から後ろめたさを感じていたが , 惰性でずるずると使い続けていた .
今回のトラブルは良き市民たれという神(シアトル在住)の思し召しかもしれない.
啓示に耳を傾け , しばらく cygwin なしでがんばってみたい .
PowerShell
cygwin を捨てるということはシェルを乗り換えるということだ. いま Windows 民の間でホットなシェルは PowerShell らしい. まわりの Windows ファンは誰もが絶賛している .
私もこれを使ってみよう .
幸い , 私は良き Windows 市民でないのと同程度に良き UNIX 市民でもなかった .
シェルやコンソールの設定はまったくカスタマイズしていないし , 書き溜めたシェルスクリプトもない. 主な懸念は何かにつけて使っていた

この本はシェルというよりプログラミング言語の入門書として書かれている.

動詞や名詞をキーにコマンドを検索するなど , この規約を前提とした支援機能もある.
クックブックによれば , PowerShell は 50 未満の動詞によってシステムの 80 % の管理を可能にする のが目標なんだとか .

実際に数えてみよう .
とりあえずそこそこの規模があり , かつ動詞を数えやすそうな Java を相手にしてみる .
Sun Java の標準ライブラリは rt.jar というランタイムにまとめられている. こいつの中身を数えよう .
メソッド呼び出しの列 挙
まず各クラスのバイトコードを読んで , INVOKEVIRTUAL
などメソッド呼び出し命令から呼び出されるメソッド名を列挙する.
メソッド定義でなく呼び出しを数えるのは利用頻度を知りたいから.
... get_id write_repository
Id updateIndirectionTable start_block marshal write_value end_block writeEndTag getORBData useRepId getClass getCodebase writeValueTag getORBData useRep
Id get_id write_repository
Id updateIndirectionTable write_value writeEndTag start_block position ...
動詞の切り出しとフィルタ
次にこのメソッド名から動詞を切り出す .
Java のメソッド名はふつう動詞が先頭にくる .
だから先頭が動詞の camelCase を仮定し , /^[ a - z ]+/ みたいな 正規表現で先頭語を切り出すことができるだろう. たとえば ' writeValueTag ' なら ' write ' が切り出される .
切り出した単語は WordNet の動詞目録 ( 一万語 ) と 照らしあわせ , 動詞が否かを判定する .
( Stemmer での正規化くらいはやっておいた .
ほとんどみな原形だから大差はなかったけど. )
そのほか getXxx ( ) や isXxx ( ) , setXxx ( ) は JavaBeans プロパティへのアセクセスとみなし , 動詞には数えない. 同様に equals ( ) と toString ( ) , hashCode ( ) も ほとんど演算子みたいなものなのでカウントからは外しておく.
こんな風にいらないものを除けたうえで , 最後に残った動詞毎に出現頻度を数えた.
rt.jar の動詞
rt.jar には約 56 万箇所のメソッド呼び出しがあり , うち動詞に該当するのは 23 万箇所. その中でおよそ 800 種類 の動詞が使われていた .
トップ 20 はこんなかんじ :
単語 頻度 append 48374 add 11626 put 10867 decode 10319 write 7422 get 6746 access 6497 create 6419 read 6098 value 4416 size 3729 remove 3373 fill 3098 check 2975 draw 2807 do 2403 char 2363 print 2170 close 1983 paint 1950
get は getXxx ( ) でなく get ( ) に由来するもの .
value はきっと動詞の意味では使ってないけれど , " 大切にする " という動詞でもあるためカウントされている. size や char も同様 .
いちいち弾くと大変なので放ってある. あとはまあ , そんなものかという感じだと思う. append が突出しているのは文字列連結だろうか .
完全なリストは gist した .
さて , PowerShell の標準動詞 65 語はどれだけ JDK のメソッド動詞を網羅しているだろう .
集計してみると , 頻度で重み付けをした網羅率は 23 % だった. 800 語からランダムに 50 語選ぶとせいぜい 50/800 = 6 % だから , それよりは良い .
けれど目標の 8 割は遠そうだ .
JDK の語彙は PowerShell のように統制されていないから , 似たようで違う語もばんばん使われている .
そこで PowerShell 動詞の類義語も含めた 186 語を使い集計しなおすと , 重みつき網羅率は 60 % まで上がった .
これもランダムの値 ( 22 % ) よりはマシだけれど , いまいちぱっとしない .
Zipf の法則
そもそもの疑問 : Windows の管理ならともかく , JDK のような巨大ライブラリの 8 割をたった 50 個の動詞でカバーできるのだろうか .
答え : できる .
JDK のメソッド呼び出し動詞リストを足し合せていくと , 全 800 語の中から頻度順に 53 語あれば 80 % の呼び出しをカバーできる .
107 語あれば 90 % に届く .
上手くいくのは , 多くの言語がもつある性質のおかげだ .
Wikipedia によると , < サイズが k 番目に大きい要素の全体に占める割合が 1 / k に比例する > ような分布を " Zipf 分布 " という .
適当な文書中の単語の登場頻度が Zipf 分布をとる経験則はよく知られている .
私はむかし 新ネットワーク思考 を読んで知った .
JDK 動詞の頻度も , ( 厳密な Zipf 分布かはともかく ) ある種の指数分布に従っている :
こうした分布ではわずかなトップ項目が大多数を占める性質をもつため , 50 語が 80 % を占めても不思議はない .
網羅率の累積度数グラフはこんなかんじになる:
Java の語彙
PoweShell の動詞がいまいち低い網羅率だったのは , 想定している語彙の母集合が異なるからだろう .
つまりプログラミング言語という小さな分野でも , 対象によって語彙の集合や分布にはばらつきがあるようだ.
ただ , それだと私の密かな野望 ( " Java プログラマのための英語入門 " や " 速読 Java 単語 " を出版してゲットリッチ ) が 危機に晒されてしまう .
困る. 多様性が善とはいえ , Java の中くらいは Newspeak であってほしい .
実際のところはどうなのか , PowerShell 云々以前に Java プログラム間の語彙のばらつきを調べておきたい .
JDK を基準に他のコードベースもあたってみることにしよう .
といっても私はそんなに Java のライブラリを知らないのでした ... 古株メジャーどころを中心にいきます. まず ant ( ant.jar ) :
動詞数 : 215 語
総頻度 : 12137 回
八割で : 22 語
JDK 網羅 率( 50 語 ) : 83 %
JDK 網羅 率( 100 語 ) : 91 %
JDK 網羅率は , 先に示した JDK 動詞のトッ プ N 語が Ant の動詞をカバーする割合を呼び出し頻度で重みづけをして求めたもの .
JDK 自体での網羅率が 50 語と 100 語 それぞれで 8 割と 9 割だったことを考えると , 上の結果は悪くない .
むしろ JDK よりちょっといい .
相対的に語彙が乏しいのだろう .
トップ20は以下のとおり :
append 4456 add 977 log 717 create 535 size 389 close 351 access 334 write 215 read 195 get 178 class 159 put 159 exist 145 print 133 index 126 replace 120 start 103 check 99 remove 98 equal 92
log , index , start あたり に
Ant っぽさを感じなくもない .
つぎは servlet container の Tomcat . ( catalina*.jar , jasper*.jar ) :
動詞数 : 362 語
総頻度 : 39324 回
八割で : 43 語
JDK 網羅 率( 50 語 ) : 69 %
JDK 網羅 率( 100 語 ) : 78 %
Ant より少し大きい .
そしてがくっと網羅率が落ちた . ゲットリッチが遠のく...
トップ 20 :
append 10954 add 1882 put 1339 generate 1257 print 1010 write 761 get 694 debug 651 find 623 remove 601 short 552 create 532 close 530 handle 518 consume 502 parse 476 value 465 push 455 fill 410 char 410
parse generate , write あたりに JSP の気配 .
O/R Mapper の Hibernate ( hibernate3.jar ) はどうか :
動詞数 : 288 語
総頻度 : 23624 回
八割で : 34 語
JDK 網羅 率( 50 語 ) : 70 %
JDK 網羅 率( 100 語 ) : 84 %
語彙数は Ant と Tomcat の中間くらい .
JDK 網羅率も Ant と Tomcat の間. 規模と網羅率は相関するのかな ?
トップ 20 :
append 6492 add 1995 register 1444 put 1036 get 749 class 622 create 608 size 486 read 450 match 414 debug 357 trace 306 attribute 278 access 270 close 242 load 239 visit 227 write 212 remove 210 parse 207
visit が 220 回というあたりにくわばら感をおぼえます .
一説によれば 一千万行を越えたという Eclipse ( plugins /*. jar ) に挑戦 .
網羅率と規模に相関があるならでかいコードは絶望的なはず:
動詞数 : 836 語
総頻度 : 366722 回
八割で : 58 語
JDK 網羅 率( 50 語 ) : 69 %
JDK 網羅 率( 100 語 ) : 80 %
良くはないけれど , 規模を考えると下げ止まった感もある . トップ 20 :
append 45202 add 35877 create 20058 access 18282 get 11286 size 10215 put 10051 remove 9480 value 6575 update 5734 log 5148 find 4904 write 4793 check 4685 print 4426 close 4204 handle 4088 dispose 3909 bind 3604 contain 3541
SWT の仕業で dispose がランクイン .
bind はなんだろう .
こんどは小さい方に倒してみた . DI Container の Seasar2 ( s2- framework.jar ) :
動詞数 : 153 語
総頻度 : 5571 回
八割で : 30 語
JDK 網羅 率( 50 語 ) : 70 %
JDK 網羅 率( 100 語 ) : 85 %
あらら. Hibenate より網羅率が低い .
規模だけの問題でもなさそう .
トップ 20 :
append 1129 add 397 class 373 get 280 create 270 put 211 assert 197 register 174 size 134 close 96 write 87 wrap 84 convert 80 remove 77 execute 76 access 66 contain 63 set 61 read 61 clear 60
類似プロジェク ト
規模のインパクトはありそうだが , それだけでもない様子がわかった .
それなら今度は似たジャンル同士を比べてみよう.
いくつかの HTTP サーバについて網羅率を求める .
相関を見るために , JDK 網羅率だけでなく Tomcat 網羅率も計算してみた .
jetty : ( 183 語 )
JDK 網羅率 ( 50 語 ) : 76 %
Tomcat 網羅率 ( 50 語) :74 %
grizzly ( 196 語)
JDK 網羅率 ( 50 語 ) : 72 %
Tomcat 網羅率 ( 50 語 ) : 68 %
opengse ( 308 語 ) :
JDK 網羅率 ( 50 語 ) : 80 %
Tomcat 網羅率 ( 50 語 ) : 79 %
あらら. おしなべて Tomcat 網羅率の方が低い .
小手先の類似より大数の法則の効き目が大きいというかことなあ.
こんなしょぼい工夫だけだと , 今より汎用的かつ網羅率の高い動詞集合を求めるのは難しそうだ.
とはいえ巨大な Eclipse 相手でも既に 100 語で 80 % は網羅できている .
Java のコード相手なら JDK のトップ 100 語は悪くない .
妥協のラインには届いた .
" Java プログラマのための英語入門 " のオビは < Java ( tm ) の巨大なクラスを徹底分析!
この 100 語を覚えれば , どんなソースコードも八割はすんなり頭にはいる!>
なんてかんじに煽ればよかろう.
定義の頻度分 布
著しい皮算用に一通り盛り上ったところで現実に帰る .
我が身を振り返ると , 私が動詞に悩むのはメソッドを呼び出す時よりそれを定義するときだ.
もともと PowerShell 標準動詞の網羅率を試す目的があったから , これまでの集計ではメソッド呼び出しの回数で重みづけをしてきた.
けれど下心に引きずられて道が逸れていた今となっては
呼び出し回数より定義の回数を数えた方が意味ある指標にならないか.
それに " Java プログラマのための英語入門 : API 徹底活用編 " よりは , " 間違いだらけのメソッド名 " の方が売れ筋のにおいがするでしょ .
そもそもこの二つの分布はどれくらい違うのだろう.
ふたたび JDK の rt.jar で数えてみたところ , メソッド定義は 58444 回あり , 動詞は 830 種類. 動詞の数は呼び出し時と大差ない . けれど分布はけっこう違う .
グラフじゃ単語が見えないですね...トップ 20 :
create 3544 ( 8 -> 1 ) access 2877 ( 7 -> 2 ) add 2544 ( 2 -> 3 ) write 2452 ( 5 -> 4 ) read 2087 ( 9 -> 5 ) paint 1883 ( 20 -> 6 ) remove 1634 ( 12 -> 7 ) run 1278 ( 101 -> 8 ) update 1113 ( 26 -> 9 ) decode 1094 ( 04 -> 10 ) put 927 ( 03 -> 11 ) check 883 ( 14 -> 12 ) insert 877 ( 46 -> 13 ) parse 873 ( 22 -> 14 ) start 843 ( 21 -> 15 ) end 735 ( 34 -> 16 ) get 707 ( 06 -> 17 ) visit 670 ( 48 -> 18 ) print 635 ( 18 -> 19 ) handle 612 ( 32 -> 20 )
ためしに( 呼び出し頻度を使った ) JDK 網羅率を計算すると 50 語で 61 % , 100 語で 74 % しかない .
頻繁に定義されるメソッドの動詞と頻繁に呼び出されるメソッドの動詞は必ずしも一致しないようだ.
各語の右には順位の変動を示した .
順位の変動が大きな動詞もあれば , あまり動かない動詞もある. 違いは何だろう .
呼び出し回数と定義回数で順位が違うものを順に並べてみる:
定義回数の方が多い動詞トップ10 :
run 1.19 mouse 0.3 action 0.23 support 0.15 accept 0.14 extract 0.11 finalize 0.08 slice 0.07 focus 0.06 instantiate 0.05 operate 0.05
呼び出し回数の方が多い動詞トップ 10 :
append - 59.78 put - 12.34 decode - 11.53 add - 11.41 get - 7.33 write - 6.28 value - 5.13 read - 5.07 access - 4.62 size - 4.33 create - 3.72
右の数字は正規化した重みの差を表している.
呼び出し回数が多いのはわかりやすい. よく使われる( 具象 ) クラスのメソッド , たとえば StringBuider#append ( ) や各種コレクション の size ( ) , get ( ) , put ( ) だろうとあたりがつく .
定義回数が多いのも想像はできる. Runnable#run ( ) , なんとか Listener の actionPerformed ( ) , Visitor 類の accept ( ) , GC から呼ばれる finalize ( ) ( 使うなと言ってるくせに ... ) , など , よく使われるコールバックの定義に違いない .
簡潔な文法を好む言語だと , 前者は組込み演算子の類に短絡され , 後者は無名関数やコードブロックの一味にまとめられている.
Java にしたってコールバックメソッドはインターフェイスで定義された名前をつければ済む .
簡潔ではないにしろ動詞を捻りだす苦労は少ない.
とはいえ上に示した定義頻度グラフのカーブでは , 概形が指数分布なのに一番左寄りの高頻度部は対数軸表示でも直線にならず急騰している.
これを見るとコールバックの定義は無名関数など言語で支援しがいのあるものに思えてくる.
いずれにせよ頻繁に定義するものの多くは動詞云々以前に名前を付けずに済むのが一番ラクで , 実際そうなっている . それ以外の , 定義する頻度が多く利用頻度も多いものは , 利用頻度順に選り分けた語彙を参考にすればいい.
つまり " 速読 Java 単語 100 " はいけそうだけれど , " 間違いだらけのメソッド名 " は企画倒れってことだなあ . 残念...

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama was at best an “ ignoramus ” for saying the socialist leader exported terrorism and obstructed progress in Latin America .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez speaks at Miraflores palace in Caracas March 21 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Miraflores palace / Handout
“ He goes and accuses me of exporting terrorism : the least I can say is that he ’s a poor ignoramus ; he should read and study a little to understand reality , ” said Chavez , who heads a group of left - wing Latin American leaders opposed to the U.S. influence in the region .
Chavez said Obama ’s comments had made him change his mind about sending a new ambassador to Washington , after he withdrew the previous envoy in a dispute last year with the Bush administration in which he also expelled the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela .
“ When I saw Obama saying what he said , I put the decision back in the drawer ; let ’s wait and see , ” Chavez said on his weekly television show , adding he had wanted to send a new ambassador to improve relations with the United States after the departure of George W. Bush as president .
In a January interview with Spanish - language U.S. network Univision , Obama said Chavez had hindered progress in Latin America , accusing him of exporting terrorist activities and supporting Colombian guerrillas .
“ My , what ignorance ; the real obstacle to development in Latin America has been the empire that you today preside over , ” said Chavez , who is a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy .
In the 20th century the United States supported several armed movements and coups in Latin America .
Chavez says Washington had a hand in a short - lived putsch against him in 2002 , which was initially welcomed by U.S. officials .
Chavez and Obama will both attend the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago next month .
It is not known whether they will meet .
Most of OPEC nation Venezuela ’s export income comes from oil it sells to the United States , but Chavez has built stronger ties with countries like China in an attempt to reduce dependence on his northern neighbor .
Chavez expelled its U.S. ambassador in September in a dispute over U.S. activities in his ally Bolivia , which also expelled its U.S. ambassador .
Ecuador ’s left - wing President Rafael Correa this year kicked out a mid-ranking U.S. diplomat .
Issue # 55 • January / February , 1999
If you are going to store food , make sure that the food you store is adequate for the need you and your family anticipate .
This may not be as easy as to achieve as many people think , because the facts are that most people make serious errors when storing food errors that will come back to haunt them when the food they ’ve stored is the only thing that stands between them and their empty , dissatisfied , bellies .
There are seven common mistakes people make when storing food .
They are :
1. Variety
Most people do n’t have enough variety in their storage .
95 % of the people I ’ve worked with have only stored four basic items : wheat , milk , honey , and salt .
Statistics show most of us wo n’t survive on such a diet for several reasons .
a )
Many people are allergic to wheat and may not be aware of it until they are eating it meal after meal .
b)
Wheat is too harsh for young children .
They can tolerate it in small amounts but not as their main staple .
c)
We get tired of eating the same foods over and over and many times prefer to not eat , then to sample that particular food again .
This is called appetite fatigue .
Young children and older people are particularly susceptible to it .
Store less wheat than is generally suggested and put the difference into a variety of other grains , particularly ones your family likes to eat .
Also store a variety of beans , as this will add color , texture , and flavor .
Variety is the key to a successful storage program .
It is essential that you store flavorings such as tomato , bouillon , cheese , and onion .
Also , include a good supply of the spices you like to cook with .
These flavorings and spices allow you to do many creative things with your grains and beans .
Without them you are severely limited .
One of the best suggestions I can give you is buy a good food storage cookbook , go through it , and see what your family would really eat .
Notice the ingredients as you do it .
This will help you more than anything else to know what items to store .
2. Extended staples
Never put all your eggs in one basket .
Store dehydrated and / or freeze dried foods as well as home canned and “ store bought ” canned goods .
Make sure you add cooking oil , shortening , baking powder , soda , yeast , and powdered eggs .
You ca n’t cook even the most basic recipes without these items .
3. Vitamins
Vitamins are important , especially if you have children , since children do not store body reserves of nutrients as adults do .
A good quality multi-vitamin and vitamin C are the most vital .
Others might be added as your budget permits .
4. Quick and easy and “ psychological foods ”
Quick and easy foods help you through times when you are psychologically or physically unable to prepare your basic storage items .
“ No cook ” foods such as freeze - dried are wonderful since they require little preparation , MREs ( Meal Ready to Eat ) , such as many preparedness outlets carry , canned goods , etc. are also very good .
“ Psychological foods ” are the goodies Jello , pudding , candy , etc. you should add to your storage .
These may sound frivolous , but through the years I ’ve talked with many people who have lived entirely on their storage for extended periods of time .
Nearly all of them say these were the most helpful items in their storage to “ normalize ” their situations and make it more bearable .
These are especially important if you have children .
5. Balance
Time and time again I ’ve seen families buy all of their wheat , then buy all of another item and so on .
Do n’t do that .
It ’s important to keep well - balanced as you build your storage .
Buy several items , rather than a large quantity of one item .
If something happens and you have to live on your present storage , you ’ll fare much better having a one month supply of a variety of items than a year ’s supply of two or three items .
6. Containers
Always store your bulk foods in food storage containers .
I have seen literally tons and tons of food thrown away because they were left in sacks , where they became highly susceptible to moisture , insects , and rodents .
If you are using plastic buckets make sure they are lined with a food grade plastic liner available from companies that carry packaging supplies .
Never use trash can liners as these are treated with pesticides .
Do n’t stack them too high .
In an earthquake they may topple , the lids pop open , or they may crack .
A better container is the # 10 tin can which most preparedness companies use when they package their foods .
7 . Use your storage
In all the years I ’ve worked with preparedness one of the biggest problems I ’ve seen is people storing food and not knowing what to do with it .
It ’s vital that you and your family become familiar with the things you are storing .
You need to know how to prepare these foods .
This is not something you want to have to learn under stress .
Your family needs to be used to eating these foods .
A stressful period is not a good time to totally change your diet .
Get a good food storage cookbook and learn to use these foods !
It ’s better to find out the mistakes you ’ll make now while there ’s still time to make corrections .
It ’s easy to take basic food storage and add the essentials that make it tasty , and it needs to be done .
As I did the research for my cookbook , Cooking with Home Storage , I wanted to include recipes that gave help to families no matter what they had stored .
As I put the material together it was fascinating to discover what the pioneers ate compared to the types of things we store .
If you have stored only the basics , there ’s very little you can do with it .
By adding even just a few things , it greatly increases your options , and the prospect of your family surviving on it .
As I studied how the pioneers lived and ate , my whole feeling for food storage changed .
I realized our storage is what most of the world has always lived on .
If it ’s put together the right way we are returning to good basic food with a few goodies thrown in .

Seven promises kept so far , according to ' Obameter ' Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday January 23 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) - As President Barack Obama settles into the White House , the Obameter is watching .
The Obameter is what the St. Petersburg Times calls its online tracker of whether Obama fulfills his campaign promises .
The Florida newspaper has compiled a list of some 500 promises the Democrat made during the presidential campaign and is tracking their progress on the Obameter at politifact.com / truth - o- meter / promises .
Three days after being sworn into office , the website lists seven Obama promises as " Kept " -- among them pledges to release presidential records , appoint at least one Republican to the cabinet and ban gifts from lobbyists .
One campaign promise is listed as " Stalled , " while 14 are " In the Works " and " No Action " has been taken on 488 others .
Among those " In the Works " is a plan to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center and get his daughters a puppy .
The Obameter is a follow - up to the newspaper 's popular " Truth - O - Meter , " which rates the veracity of claims by politicians .
Making alliances with Afghan tribes is a tricky process , say analysts President Obama has suggested there could be talks with moderate elements of the Taleban in Afghanistan as part of a process of reconciliation .
Mr Obama told the New York Times that US forces in Iraq had persuaded some Islamic radicals alienated by the tactics of al - Qaeda to co-operate .
He said there might be similar opportunities in Afghanistan , although the situation there was more complex .
Asked if the US was winning in Afghanistan , Mr Obama replied : " No . " A month into his presidency , Mr Obama authorised the deployment of up to 17,000 extra US troops to Afghanistan .
You have a less governed region , a history of fierce independence among tribes
President Obama
Obama 's new Afghan strategy More than seven years after US - led forces ousted the Taleban regime in Afghanistan shortly after the 11 September 2001 attacks in America , the militants have regrouped and are waging an intensifying insurgency .
At an event on Sunday in Kabul to mark International Women 's Day , Afghan President Hamid Karzai said it was " good news " that Mr Obama had backed talks with moderate elements of the Taleban .
" This is the Afghan government 's long stand , " he said .
" We wanted this and we support and stand with them to bring peace and stability to this land . "
Correspondents say the notion of reconciliation with the fundamentalist Islamic movement appears to be gathering momentum as a way of reining in the escalating violence in Afghanistan .
Mr Obama and his advisors are reviewing the US strategy on Afghanistan , and have looked at what has worked in Iraq .
" There may be some comparable opportunities in Afghanistan and in the Pakistani region , " he told the New York Times on board Air Force One .
After discussing US success in reaching out to its enemies in Iraq , Mr Obama added : " The situation in Afghanistan is , if anything , more complex .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" You have a less governed region , a history of fierce independence among tribes .
" Those tribes are multiple and sometimes operate at cross purposes , and so figuring all that out is going to be much more of a challenge .
" I think we still have to think about how do we deal with that kind of scenario , " he added .
Some foreign diplomats have also long advocated moves to reach out to the Taleban or at least moderate elements within the group , in search of a political settlement .
This weekend a former British special forces commander said the UK's effort in Afghanistan was " worthless " .
" We hold tiny areas of ground in Helmand and we are kidding ourselves if we think our influence goes beyond 500 metres of our security bases , " ex-SAS commander Maj Sebastian Morley told a newspaper .
' Irreconcilables ' Correspondents say coalition forces face three types of insurgent in Afghanistan : fighters with links to al - Qaeda ( deemed to be irreconcilable to the Kabul government )
nationalists , whose primary aim is to expel foreign forces
Afghans who joined the insurgency for personal reasons , such as abuse at the hands of the authorities Security analysts believe the last two types of fighter could eventually be reconciled to the government .

The Ivory Coast , known officially as the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire ,
provides 43 per cent of the world ’s supply of cocoa , the main ingredient of chocolate .
Few of the billions of the consumers of chocolate realize that the cocoa trade has a vital role in the armed and political conflict that ’s ravaged Côte d’Ivoire for the last six years ( or , for that matter , that an estimated 284,000 children are working on Cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast and other African states )
Last week , Al Jazeera ’s People & Power aired a 22 - minute investigate report on the issue , called “ Hot Chocolate . ”
A reference to hot diamonds , also known as blood diamonds , the report shows that in 2002 , “ a troop mutiny became a full - scale civil war and the country divided into a rebel - held north and a government - controlled south , with UN peacekeepers patrolling a buffer zone [ in ] between . ”
“ Although full scale fighting in the country was halted in 2004 and a peace deal signed in 2007 officially marked the end of the conflict that divided the country , there is an uneasy truce . ”
Today , former rebel soldiers “ … are still in control of the northern half of the country and the cocoa trade [ is ] still earning huge sums of money for those in power , lasting and nation - wide peace seems very unlikely . ”
“ A considerable percentage of this money being used to fund the armed conflict , purposefully keeping the country in an uneasy state . ”
If you do n’t already realize it , this means the dollar ten you shell out to buy your favorite chocolate bar — and the bags you gather for Valentines day , Easter , Halloween and Christmas – may very well be helping the militant arms of Côte d’Ivoire buy their machine guns .
Not to mention the fact that , that same chocolate may very well have been brought to you in part by the calloused , aching hands of children .

" I argue very well .
Ask any of my remaining friends .
I can win an argument on any topic , against any opponent .
People know this , and steer clear of me at parties .
Often , as a sign of their great respect , they do n't even invite me . "
-- Dave Barry
The science of winning arguments is called Rhetoric , and it is one of the Dark Arts .
Its study is forbidden to rationalists , and its tomes and treatises are kept under lock and key in a particularly dark corner of the Miskatonic University library .
More than this it is not lawful to speak .
But I do want to talk about a very closely related skill : not losing arguments .
Rationalists probably find themselves in more arguments than the average person .
And if we 're doing it right , the truth is hopefully on our side and the argument is ours to lose .
And far too often , we do lose arguments , even when we 're right .
Sometimes it 's because of biases or inferential distances or other things that can't be helped .
But all too often it 's because we 're shooting ourselves in the foot .
How does one avoid shooting one 's self in the foot ?
In rationalist language , the technique is called Leaving a Social Line of Retreat .
In normal language , it 's called being nice .
First , what does it mean to win or lose an argument ?
There is an unspoken belief in some quarters that the point of an argument is to gain social status by utterly demolishing your opponent 's position , thus proving yourself the better thinker .
That can be fun sometimes , and if it 's really all you want , go for it .
But the most important reason to argue with someone is to change his mind .
If you want a world without fundamentalist religion , you 're never going to get there just by making cutting and incisive critiques of fundamentalism that all your friends agree sound really smart .
You 've got to deconvert some actual fundamentalists .
In the absence of changing someone 's mind , you can at least get them to see your point of view .
Getting fundamentalists to understand the real reasons people find atheism attractive is a nice consolation prize .
I make the anecdotal observation that a lot of smart people are very good at winning arguments in the first sense , and very bad at winning arguments in the second sense .
Does that correspond to your experience ?
Back in 2008 , Eliezer described how to Leave a Line of Retreat .
If you believe morality is impossible without God , you have a strong disincentive to become an atheist .
Even after you 've realized which way the evidence points , you 'll activate every possible defense mechanism for your religious beliefs .
If all the defense mechanisms fail , you 'll take God on utter faith or just believe in belief , rather than surrender to the unbearable position of an immoral universe .
The correct procedure for dealing with such a person , Eliezer suggests , is n't to show them yet another reason why God does n't exist .
They 'll just reject it along with all the others .
The correct procedure is to convince them , on a gut level , that morality is possible even in a godless universe .
When disbelief in God is no longer so terrifying , people wo n't fight it quite so hard and may even deconvert themselves .
But there 's another line of retreat to worry about , one I experienced firsthand in a very strange way .
I had a dream once where God came down to Earth ; I can't remember exactly why .
In the borderlands between waking and sleep , I remember thinking : I feel like a total moron .
Here I am , someone who goes to atheist groups and posts on atheist blogs and has told all his friends they should be atheists and so on , and now it turns out God exists .
All of my religious friends whom I won all those arguments against are going to be secretly looking at me , trying as hard as they can to be nice and understanding , but secretly laughing about how I got my comeuppance .
I can never show my face in public again .
Would n't you feel the same ?
And then I woke up , and shook it off .
I am an aspiring rationalist : if God existed , I would desire to believe that God existed .
But I realized at that point the importance of the social line of retreat .
The psychological resistance I felt to admitting God 's existence , even after having seen Him descend to Earth , was immense .
And , I realized , it was exactly the amount of resistance that every vocally religious person must experience towards God 's non-existence .
There 's not much we can do about this sort of high - grade long - term resistance .
Either a person has enough of the rationalist virtues to overcome it , or he does n't .
But there is a less ingrained , more immediate form of social resistance generated with every heated discussion .
Let 's say you approach a theist ( let 's call him Theo ) and say " How can you , a grown man , still believe in something stupid like talking snakes and magic sky kings ?
Do n't you know you people are responsible for the Crusades and the Thirty Years ' War and the Spanish Inquisition ?
You should be ashamed of yourself ! "
This suggests the following dichotomy in Theo 's mind : EITHER God exists , OR I am an idiot who believes in stupid childish things and am in some way partly responsible for millions of deaths and I should have lower status and this arrogant person who 's just accosted me and whom I already hate should have higher status at my expense .
Unless
Theo has attained a level of rationality far beyond any of us , guess which side of that dichotomy he 's going to choose ?
In fact , guess which side of that dichotomy he's now going to support with renewed vigor , even if he was only a lukewarm theist before ?
His social line of retreat has been completely closed off , and it 's your fault .
Here the two definitions of " winning an argument " I suggested before come into conflict .
If your goal is to absolutely demolish the other person 's position , to make him feel awful and worthless - then you are also very unlikely to change his mind or win his understanding .
And because our culture of debates and mock trials and real trials and flaming people on Usenet encourages the first type of " winning an argument " , there 's precious little genuine mind - changing going on .
Really adjusting to the second type of argument , where you try to convince people , takes a lot more than just not insulting people outright1 .
You 've got to completely rethink your entire strategy .
For example , anyone used to the Standard Debates may already have a cached pattern of how they work .
Activate the whole Standard Debate concept , and you activate a whole bunch of related thoughts like Atheists As The Enemy , Defending The Faith , and even in some cases ( I 've seen it happen ) persecution of Christians by atheists in Communist Russia .
To such a person , ceding an inch of ground in a Standard Debate may well be equivalent to saying all the Christians martyred by the Communists died in vain , or something similarly dreadful .
So try to show you 're not just starting Standard Debate # 4457 .
I remember once , during the middle of a discussion with a Christian , when I admitted I really did n't like Christopher Hitchens .
Richard Dawkins , brilliant .
Daniel Dennett , brilliant .
But Christopher
Hitchens always struck me as too black - and - white and just plain irritating .
This one little revelation completely changed the entire tone of the conversation .
I was no longer Angry Nonbeliever # 116 .
I was no longer the living incarnation of All Things Atheist .
I was just a person who happened to have a whole bunch of atheist ideas , along with a couple of ideas that were n't typical of atheists .
I got the same sort of response by admitting I loved religious music .
All of a sudden my friend was falling over himself to mention some scientific theory he found especially elegant in order to reciprocate2 .
I did n't end up deconverting him on the spot , but think he left with a much better appreciation of my position .
All of these techniques fall dangerously close to the Dark Arts , so let me be clear : I 'm not suggesting you misrepresent yourself just to win arguments .
I do n't think misrepresenting yourself would even work ; evolutionary psychology tells us humans are notoriously bad liars .
Do n't fake an appreciation for the other person 's point of view , actually develop an appreciation for the other person 's point of view .
Realize that your points probably seem as absurd to others as their points seem to you .
Understand that many false beliefs do n't come from simple lying or stupidity , but from complex mixtures of truth and falsehood filtered by complex cognitive biases .
Do n't stop believing that you are right and they are wrong , unless the evidence points that way .
But leave it at them being wrong , not them being wrong and stupid and evil .
I think most people intuitively understand this .
But considering how many smart people I see shooting their own foot off when they 're trying to convince someone3 , some of them clearly need a reminder .
1 : An excellent collection of the deeper and most subtle forms of this practice of this sort can be found in Dale Carnegie 's How to Win Friends and Influence People , one of the only self - help books I 've read that was truly useful and not a regurgitation of cliches and applause lights .
Carnegie 's thesis is basically that being nice is the most powerful of the Dark Arts , and that a master of the Art of Niceness can use it to take over the world .
It works better than you 'd think .
2 : The following technique is definitely one of the Dark Arts , but I mention it because it reveals a lot about the way we think : when engaged in a really heated , angry debate , one where the insults are flying , suddenly stop and admit the other person is one hundred percent right and you 're sorry for not realizing it earlier .
Do it properly , and the other person will be flabbergasted , and feel deeply guilty at all the names and bad feelings they piled on top of you .
Not only will you ruin their whole day , but for the rest of time , this person will secretly feel indebted to you , and you will be able to play with their mind in all sorts of little ways .
3 : Libertarians , you have a particular problem with this .
If I wanted to know why I'm a Stalin - worshipper who has betrayed the Founding Fathers for personal gain and is controlled by his base emotions and wants to dominate others by force to hide his own worthlessness et cetera , I 'd ask Ann Coulter .
You 're better than that .
Come on .
And then you wonder why people never vote for you .

Though the stock market may have lifted off on news of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s purchase plan for toxic assets , do n’t be fooled by Wall Street ’s optimism .
The plan is even worse than the one floated by Geithner ’s predecessor , Henry Paulson , last fall .
At least Paulson wanted the government simply to buy the banking industry ’s junk outright — and spend less doing so .
Under Treasury ’s complicated Public - Private Partnership Investment Program , which was unveiled on Monday morning , Geithner wants to strike a deal with private investors who would n’t touch these assets without serious incentives .
The program will essentially give investors between $ 500 billion and $ 1 trillion dollars — at this point , what difference does half a trill make ?— of spending money to go shopping for the bad assets that banks are dying to get off their books .
And the kicker ?
The White House says the private sector is doing us a favor .
In the rosiest scenario , the assets will have some value one day .
In that case , the government will have entered the hedge and private equity fund prime brokerage business .
That is , the business of lending money to private funds backed by small amounts of collateral that the funds themselves post .
In this instance that collateral would consist of — you guessed it — toxic assets .
Remember , it was all the leverage , or borrowing , in the system that created the current mess .
Surely , someone in Washington must question how more leverage , on the back of the same toxic assets , makes sense .
At any rate , if this strategy pays off , private investors would profit more than the government , or taxpayers , because they risked less capital to buy the assets in the first place .
But here ’s another possibility :
The assets have little or no value , because they have no incoming cash or no buyers — otherwise known as the situation we ’re presently in .
To this day , we do n’t even have any knowledge of what exactly these assets are .
The government wo n’t tell us because the banks wo n’t tell the government .
And if the assets zero out , the private investors will largely be covered .
The taxpayers , of course , wo n’t .
That plan is based on the assumption that private funds want to bother with any of this .
One thing ’s certain , though :
The sweeter the deal the government makes to entice investors to buy assets they ’d otherwise have no interest in , the worse it is for taxpayers .
That ’s the brand of capitalism that was at work before this crisis , and it seems to have survived the economic collapse intact .
Geithner told the Wall Street Journal last week , “ Our judgment is that the best way to get through this is if we can work with the markets …
We do n’t want the government to assume all the risk .
We want the private sector to work with us . ”
The private sector helped create and spread a toxic stew of derivatives .
Yet Geithner ’s strategy to “ fix ” the financial system is to ask its riskiest , most opaque players — the companies that shirked the most in taxes and were led by the execs who made the most money during the build - up years — to buy the system ’s junky assets in order “ to cleanse it . ”
And this will come after $ 350 billion of capital injections and trillions of dollars of Federal Reserve loans have n’t fixed the problem .
On top of this , Geithner does n’t think investors who participate in his program should be subject to any restrictions .
No executive pay caps , no nothing .
Moreover , the toxic assets to be brokered under this plan will be selected by the players that have not been able to unload them so far .
It ’s like going to a used car dealership and saying to the car salesman , “ I ’ve got $ 100,000 to buy whatever you have to sell me , ” and expecting him to provide you with his most valuable inventory .
Of course , bank stocks rallied on this cheery news .
The Dow perked up like a heroin addict about to get a fix .
Why would n’t banks welcome the chance to participate in a government - sponsored program to clean their polluted balance sheets , where their old clients , the same ones who would n’t be caught dead purchasing these toxic assets , could be paid for participating ?
This is how Christina Romer , chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , described the plan on Sunday night : “ What we ’re talking about now are private firms that are kind of doing us a favor , right ?
Coming into this market to help us buy these toxic assets off banks ’ balance sheets . ”
She added , “ They are firms that are being the good guys here — coming into a market that has n’t existed to try and help us get toxic assets off banks ’ balance sheets . ”
Which good guys ?
The financial firms that had their profits taxed at 25 percent rather than at 35 percent , like the rest of us , and made oodles of money in 2006 and 2007 before their bad bets greased the way to an economic collapse ?
Or the ones that bet housing - related securities would fail , in a self - fulfilling manner ?
I ’ve never been a fan of any toxic asset purchase plan ( nor of the capital injection through stock purchase plans ) .
Randomly buying a bunch of heavily layered , heavily leveraged securities and expecting them to be profitable some day has never made sense to me , especially when nothing is being done to bolster the underlying collateral .
The White House and Treasury Department are throwing money at the banking and finance industry , while simultaneously doing little about the loans and borrowers at the bottom of the crisis — not to mention the very risky and overleveraged structure of the banking system itself .
The administration is caught up in crafting big plans to solve the problems of big banks .
Instead , it should be dissecting the system into transparent , quantifiable , and understandable parts — and then dealing with those elements that can and should be assisted .
Geithner ought to jettison the too - big - to - fail nonsense and keep it simple : Break up the banks into their commercial and speculative parts , and separate the assets along similar lines .
Let the speculative parts die , and tend to the rest .
As it stands , the present solution — propping up the entire system in a complex , highly leveraged manner that depends on the kindness of the culprits that caused this mess — is a colossally expensive exercise in bipartisan stupidity .
Sperm Donor Testimonial
I 've had a great experience being a sperm donor .
The staff at the bank is super - friendly and the facility is nice .
The benefits are also great : free movie tickets during the application process , full physicals twice a year , free genetic testing and screening , and more .
Most importantly for me , though , is the idea of helping couples have children who have tried to conceive on their own and were unable to do so .
I am planning on having a family one day and it is really important for people to be able to realize this dream .

Some of Australia ’s most popular white sand beaches were declared a disaster zone today after an 11,000 gallon fuel oil spill from the cargo ship Pacific Adventurer .
The oil blackened miles of pristine beaches and has led to the detainment of the ship by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority .
[ social_buttons ]
“ This could … be the worst environmental disaster we have faced . ” – Anna Bligh , Queensland Premier
Bligh declared 37 miles of white sand beaches a disaster zone , and authorized closing of the beaches to public access .
Bulldozers have already begun scraping up the blackened sand from the affected beaches .
The national parks at Bribie islands and Moreton north of Brisbane were the hardest hit by the spill , and northeastern Queensland state government is threatening Swire Shipping , Ltd ( UK ) with a multimillion dollar lawsuit .
The owners may be fined up to $ 1.3 million USD and could be also liable for up to $ 160 million USD in additional penalties for the environmental damage .
The ship ’s owners , Swire , stated that containers on deck slipped and ripped a hole in a fuel tank , spilling at least 11,000 gallons into the sea .
31 containers holding 694 tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer fell from the deck , and have not been found .
The ship was traveling from Newcastle to Indonesia when it hit the remains of Cyclone Hamish .
A recent inspection of the hull by divers is leading to an estimate of “ significantly more ” than 11,000 gallons spilled .
Officials accused Swire of initially misleading the government about the extent of the spill , telling the government it was much smaller , which lead officials to predict little environmental damage .
The company said they regret “ the extent of the environmental pollution caused by spills of heavy fuel oil from the ship and the company is offering assistance with the clean up . ”
So far , wildlife victims have been limited to birds coated in oil , but local authorities claim that as long as the oil slick remains , the damage could get much worse .
The ship has been brought to port and detained until satisfactory explanation of the event has been given .
“ We have detained the ship .
It ’s not going anywhere until we release it . ” – Graham Peache , Maritime Safety Authority
The Great Barrier Reef is to the north of the spill , and is not considered threatened by the oil slick .

A large laser mounted to a passenger jet is undergoing tests in the US
The Pentagon may soon have a new anti-missile weapon – a high - powered laser fired from the nose of a large jet plane to destroy missiles soon after they leave the ground .
The latest video footage from the project reveals the results from a round of testing that ended in December 2008 ( see our story on the tests ) .
A prototype mounted in a plane on the ground fired infrared laser beams at a target in 1 second bursts .
The system has left the ground too , in trials 16 months ago , that proved the weapon could track a simulated missile well enough to reliably deploy the powerful beam if required .
The project involves defence companies Boeing , Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grunman , as well as US forces engineers , and the first airborne firing of the main laser is scheduled for August 2009 .
However , the project ’s future funding is not assured beyond that point .
The new Obama administration is yet to decide whether to continue developing the weapon beyond 2009 .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday told North Korea to stop being provocative and return to nuclear talks , warning ties could not improve with Washington if it continued insulting South Korea .

Clinton , calling the isolated state a “ tyranny , ” repeated the new U.S. administration ’s offer of diplomatic relations , massive aid and a peace treaty if Pyongyang gives up efforts to build an atomic arsenal , which poses one of the biggest risks to security in North Asia and its giant economies .
“ The most immediate issue is to continue the disablement of their nuclear facilities and to get a complete and verifiable agreement as to the end of their nuclear program , ” she told a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan .
Talks between the two Koreas , China , Japan , Russia and the United States on the North ’s nuclear ambitions have all but ground to a halt , most recently stuck on Pyongyang ’s refusal to allow nuclear material to be taken abroad for tests .
Clinton made clear the North also needed to tone down its increasingly furious rhetoric , which this week alone has included a threat of war with its wealthy neighbor South Korea and an accusation the United States plans a nuclear strike against it .
North Korea is also thought to be preparing the launch of a missile with the potential to reach U.S. territory .
“ North Korea is not going to get a different relationship with the United States while insulting and refusing dialogue with ( South Korea ) , ” Clinton said in Seoul , the third stop of her Asia tour .
She called the saber - rattling “ provocative ” and “ unhelpful , ” praising the South Korean government for its restraint .
North Korea , seen facing another serious food shortage , has turned on the conservative government in the South which has ended years of free - flowing aid over the nuclear impasse .
“ ( South ) Korea ’s achievement of democracy and prosperity stands in stark contrast to the tyranny and poverty across the border to the North , ” Clinton said .
North Korea bristled at being described as “ an outpost of tyranny ” by the Bush administration , and one analyst said Clinton ’s comments could trigger more anger from Pyongyang which may have hoped for a softer line from the new U.S. government .
“ ( This ) is likely to lead it to a new round of harsher rhetoric or to a possible military provocation against South Korea , ” said Moon Hong - sik , a research fellow at the South ’s Institute for National Security Strategy .

POSSIBLE POWER STRUGGLE
On Thursday , Clinton warned of a possible power struggle in the communist state , and the possibility of a crisis over who may succeed leader Kim Jong - il , 67 , who is widely believed to have suffered a stroke last August .
“ I do n’t think that it ’s a forbidden subject to talk about succession in the hermit kingdom , ” she told reporters on Friday .
“ You deal with Kim Jong - il now and for as long as he is the man who is calling the shots . ”
Asked if Kim was still calling the shots , she said : “ I have no idea ... we have to assume he is because that ’s who we deal with . ”
While she was in Seoul , North Korea said a senior general and close Kim aide , O Kuk - ryol , had been promoted to a top post in the National Defence Commission , the main seat of power .
It is one of a number of recent changes in the military hierarchy and comes amid widespread speculation that Kim may be making preparations for his succession .
He is thought to have largely recovered from his illness , but is said to have other chronic health problems .
Speculation has focused on one of his sons or his brother - in - law being groomed to take over Asia ’s only communist dynasty .
On Friday , Clinton said Washington was dealing with the government in power and asked it to fulfill its nuclear agreement .
“ The Obama administration will be willing to normalize bilateral relations , replace the peninsula ’s longstanding armistice agreement with a peace treaty and assist in meeting the energy and other economic and humanitarian needs of the Korean people , ” she said later at a women ’s university .
Clinton also announced her choice of Stephen Bosworth , a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea , to be special representative for North Korea and the nuclear talks .
She met also South Korean and U.S. military leaders , whose troops face the North ’s 1.2 - million - strong army -- most of it positioned near the heavily fortified border that has divided the peninsula for about 60 years .
There are about 28,000 U.S. troops to support the South ’s 670,000 soldiers .
Clinton later flies to China , the nearest North Korea has to a powerful ally .
I ’ve mentioned their book the “ Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics ” a couple times already ; today I ’d like to recommend that you read a wonderful short paper by Gerald Jay Sussman and Jack Wisdom , called “ The Role of Programming in the Formulation of Ideas , ” which helps explain why understanding physics and the other mathematical sciences can sometimes be so difficult .
The basic point is that our notation is often an absolute mess , caused by the fact that we use equations like we use natural language , in a highly ambiguous way :
“ It is necessary to present the science in the language of mathematics .
Unfortunately , when we teach science we use the language of mathematics in the same way that we use our natural language .
We depend upon a vast amount of shared knowledge and culture , and we only sketch an idea using mathematical idioms . ”
The solution proposed is to develop notation that can be understood by computers , which do not tolerate ambiguity :
“ One way to become aware of the precision required to unambiguously communicate a mathematical idea is to program it for a computer .
Rather than using canned programs purely as an aid to visualization or numerical computation , we use computer programming in a functional style to encourage clear thinking .
Programming forces one to be precise and formal , without being excessively rigorous .
The computer does not tolerate vague descriptions or incomplete constructions .
Thus the act of programming makes one keenly aware of one ’s errors of reasoning or unsupported conclusions . ”
Sussman and Wisdom then focus on one highly illuminating example , the Lagrange equations .
These equations can be derived from the fundamental principle of least action .
This principle tells you that if you have a classical system that begins in a configuration C 1 at time t 1 and arrives at a configuration C 2 at time t 2 , the path it traces out between t 1 and t 2 will be the one that is consistent with the initial and final configurations and minimizes the integral over time of the Lagrangian for the system , where the Lagrangian is given by the kinetic energy minus the potential energy .
Physics textbooks tell us that if we apply the calculus of variations to the integral of the Lagrangian ( called the “ action ” ) we can derive that the true path satisfies the Lagrange equations , which are traditionally written as :
Here L is the Lagrangian , t is the time , annd qi are the coordinates of the system .
These equations ( and many others like them ) have confused and bewildered generations of physics students .
What is the problem ?
Well , there are all sorts of fundamental problems in interpreting these equations , detailed in Sussman and Wisdom ’s paper .
As they point out , basic assumptions like whether a coordinate and its derivative are independent variables are not consistent within the same equation .
And should n’t this equation refer to the path somewhere , since the Lagrange equations are only correct for the true path ?
I ’ll let you read Sussman and Wisdom ’s full laundry list of problems yourself .
But let ’s turn to the psychological effects of using such equations :
“ Though such statements ( and derivations that depend upon them ) seem very strange to students , they are told that if they think about them harder they will understand .
So the student must either come to the conclusion that he / she is dumb and just accepts it , or that the derivation is correct , with some appropriate internal rationalization .
Students often learn to carry out these manipulations without really understanding what they are doing . ”
Is this true ?
I believe it certainly is ( my wife agrees : she gave up on mathematics , even though she always received excellent grades , because she never felt she truly understood ) .
The students who learn to successfully rationalize such ambiguous equations , and forget about the equations that they ca n’t understand at all , are the ones who might go on to be successful physicists .
Here ’s an example , from the review of Sussman and Wisdom ’s book by Piet Hut , a very well - regarded physicist who is now a professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies :
“… I went through the library in search of books on the variational principle in classical mechanics .
I found several heavy tomes , borrowed them all , and started on the one that looked most attractive .
Alas , it did n’t take long for me to realize that there was quite a bit of hand - waving involved .
There was no clear definition of the procedure used for computing path integrals , let alone for the operations of differentiating them in various ways , by using partial derivatives and / or using an ordinary derivative along a particular path .
And when and why the end points of the various paths had to be considered fixed or open to variation also was unclear , contributing to the overall confusion .
Working through the canned exercises was not very difficult , and from an instrumental point of view , my book was quite clear , as long as the reader would stick to simple examples .
But the ambiguity of the presentation frustrated me , and I started scanning through other , even more detailed books .
Alas , nowhere did I find the clarity that I desired , and after a few months I simply gave up .
Like generations of students before me , I reluctantly accepted the dictum that ‘ you should not try to understand quantum mechanics , since that will lead you astray for doing physics ’ , and going even further , I also gave up trying to really understand classical mechanics !
Psychological defense mechanisms turned my bitter sense of disappointment into a dull sense of disenchantment . ”
Sussman and Wisdom do show how the ambiguous conventional notation can be replaced with unambiguous notation that can even be used to program a computer .
Because it ’s new , it will feel alien at first ; the Lagrange equations look like this :
It ’s worth learning Sussman and Wisdom ’s notation for the clarity it ultimately provides .
It ’s even more important to learn to always strive for clear understanding .
One final point : although mathematicians do often use notation that is superior to physicists ’ , they should n’t feel too smug ; Sussman and Wisdom had similar things to say about differential geometry in this paper .

Drawing was a terribly important part of science until the mid-19th century .
Without photography , scientists , particularly in the life sciences , had to document what they saw with painstaking illustrations .
The clarity and " realness " of photographs eventually relegated scientific drawing to a hobby , but it did n’t happen overnight .
Photographers working at the microscopic scale had to devise new emulsion chemistries and types of equipment to capture clear images of tiny things .
Leading the charge was Auguste - Adolphe Bertsch , who worked to overcome any challenge that scientists threw at him .
Unfortunately , he died during leftist social unrest in France in 1871 .
As a result , his pioneering work languished in the archives of the French photography society , Société française de photographie , until Corey Keller dug them up for her new exhibit about early scientific photography , Brought to Light Photography and the Invisible , at San Francisco ’s Museum of Modern Art .
" Photographers would deposit their pictures with this organization sort of as a way of staking their claim to achievements , " Keller told Wired.com .
" So these pictures went there directly from the man who made them and have been there ever since . "
In this five - part series , we ’re walking through the Brought to Light
exhibit with
Keller , who spent five years scouring dusty archives , primarily in Europe , to dig up dozens of haunting photographs from the period .
Many of the images have never been seen , except by their creators .
This installment brings you the story of pioneering microphotographers like Bertsch and their struggle to bring technological advancement to traditional scientific practices .
Even as they solved technical challenges , the photographers faced social resistance .
The idea of representing a specific living thing instead of a generalized abstraction of an organism forced scientists to let go of long - held notions about their discipline .
" Prior to the 19th century , the scientific illustrations tend to represent a type , an ideal .
So if you were going to do a picture of a flower , for example , the illustrator would look at 20 flowers and then take the common features and make an ideal flower , " said Keller .
" So , if that particular one happens to have a defective petal or something peculiar to it , you never really know :
Does that photograph substitute then for that type of flower in general , or does it only represent that one specimen ? "
While it may have posed a challenge for scientists of the 19th century , it ’s the unique nature of each photograph taken during this early period that wows us , even now .

i Phone users and app developers got a sneak preview at what the future holds for them on Tuesday , when Apple showcased its upcoming iPhone 3.0 software .
The next major version of the iPhone operating system , slated for a summer release , promises a number of changes aimed at end -users and software makers alike .
For iPhone users , that number is more than 100 — the amount of new features Apple promises in iPhone 3.0 .
Topping the list is the ability for users to copy and paste information — including text , blocks of HTML , and photos — in the iPhone ’s built - in apps .
Users will also be able to copy and paste between applications .
Third - party developers will have the ability to add copy - and - paste functionality to their apps as well .
i Phone 3.0 will also bring Multimedia Messaging Service ( MMS ) support for sending and receiving photos , contact information , audio files , and locations ; a Voice Memos app to record , edit , and share audio files ; Spotlight search capabilities ; CalDAV and .ics calendar support ; the ability to sync notes via iTunes ; stereo A2DP Bluetooth support ; auto - fill ; anti-phishing technology ; and extended parental controls .
Get more details on Apple ’s announced iPhone 3.0 improvements
While the full iPhone 3.0 release wo n’t be available for a few months , developers can get their hands on a beta version now .
With iPhone 3.0 , developers will now be able to build push notification into their apps , to alert users of changes in closed apps — a new instant message , for example .
Apple had first promised to come out with a push - notification service at its 2008 Worldwide Developers Conference but delayed the launch .
On Tuesday , Apple executives cited developers ’ overwhelming initial interest in the App Store as the reason for the delay .
In addition to offering push notifications , the iPhone 3.0 software also lets developers create apps that provide turn - by - turn GPS driving directions ( as long as they provide their own maps ) ; embed Google Maps in their apps ; sell subscriptions as well as add - ons through their apps ; and much more .
Get more details on iPhone 3.0 changes aimed at iPhone app developers
The iPhone has become a lucrative platform for Apple .
On Tuesday , Apple vice president of iPod and iPhone product marketing Greg Joswiak told reporters that the company had sold 17 million iPhones since the June 2007 launch of the original iPhone .
The phone is now available in 80 countries , with 77 of those countries also enjoying access to the App Store .
After installing GHC 6.10.1 , you probably want to get cabal - install installed as quickly as possible , so you can grab all that Haskell library goodness from Hackage with the minimum of fuss .
Once the Haskell Platform is available , this will be much easier , but until then we have to bootstrap cabal - install using just Cabal .
After a release I find myself doing this on multiple machines , so today I made a little script to automate it , and I thought I ’d share it .
Obviously it ’s just a quick hack , only works with GHC 6.10.1 , has no error - checking etc. , but it does work on both Windows and Unix .
Enjoy !
Update : Duncan Coutts pointed out to me that there ’s a Windows cabal .exe binary available .
#!/bin/sh set -e for i in $ TMPDIR / tmp c:/ temp ; do if test -d $ i ; then dir=$i break fi dir=$ HOME done cd $ dir wget http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/zlib/0.5.0.0/zlib-0.5.0.0.tar.gz tar xzf zlib-0.5.0.0.tar.gz cd zlib-0.5.0.0 ghc -- make Setup ./ Setup configure -- user ./ Setup build ./ Setup register -- inplace -- user cd $ dir wget http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/HTTP/3001.1.4/HTTP-3001.1.4.tar.gz tar xzf HTTP - 3001.1.4.tar.gz cd HTTP - 3001.1.4 ghc -- make Setup ./ Setup configure -- user ./ Setup build ./ Setup register -- inplace -- user cd $ dir wget http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/cabal-install/0.6.0/cabal-install-0.6.0.tar.gz tar xzf cabal - install-0.6.0.tar.gz cd cabal - install - 0.6.0 ghc -- make Setup ./ Setup configure -- user ./ Setup build #

Never seen features like this on a Satellite photo before - they appear on the Infra Red image as well :
Very Strange - I can only assume their some sort of " distrail " ( the negative image of a " contrail " - heat from a jet plane 's exhaust cuts a narrow swathe out of a layer of cloud ) , but I always assumed these were local phenomena - never knew they were visible from space !
Any insights anyone ?

interesting examing the IR shot having read this Quote :
The infra red satellite image measures the temperature or radiance of
the ground and clouds .
Light shades represent low temperatures and
dark shades high temperatures .
The Earth is scanned every 30 minutes
by the MSG geostationary satellite which is located over the
Equator at 0 degrees W. Images are available here at 0000 , 0600 , 1200
and 1800 .

So those light shaded scratches are lower in temperature than the surrounding cloud ... Hmm
If the airplanes track caused the moisture to condense and fall as rain , that would lower the temperature , right ?
Curious to look at the .

It must be close to weather radar frequency .

Something like that anyway .
It would be interesting to get the location of the radar and it's frequency , and see if it corresponds with a bradband scheme in Waterford .
OOps forgot the picture .
I 'd say what is happening here is that the weather radar is ground based , in Foynes or Shannon if the crosshairs I drew in are correct .
Audi might know where it is .
Then down in Waterford they have a community wifi broadband scheme or something which is pumping out 2.4GHz , so every time the radar head comes around it sees in band energy and thinks its a reflection - i.e rain .
Something like that anyway .

Quote : Weather radar was installed at Shannon in May 1996 .
It is arguably the most important radar in Ireland as it is the first to detect weather from the south - west .
It can show rainfall to a range of 240 Km and wind to a range of 100 Km .
A high frequency pulse ( freq. 5.6 GHz ) is transmitted at a typical rate of 570 pulses per second ( normally referred to as the PRF or pulse repetition frequency ) .

So right location but wrong frequency .
Hmmm .
Maybe the broadband jobby in Waterford is not 2.4GHz ?
Where would we get info on that ?

Irish Broadband Press
Quote : Irish Broadband will be using BreezeACCESS VL to expand an existing Alvarion - based network operating in 5.7GHz , while they will use their recently awarded 3.5 GHz licenses to deploy the BreezeMAX 3500 .
BreezeMAX will enable Irish Broadband and their subscribers to enjoy the benefits of WiMAX technology that include high service quality with Non - Line - of - Sight ( NLOS ) functionality plus long - term cost effectiveness .
Irish Broadband is a competitive local exchange carrier ( CLEC ) that currently serves business and residential customers in Dublin , Cork and Derry in Northern Ireland .
The BreezeMAX network will extend coverage to the cities of Dundalk , Drogheda , Galway , Limerick , and Waterford .
Launched in May 2003 , Irish Broadbands wireless broadband network was built originally in the 2.4GHz spectrum using Alvarions BreezeACCESS 
II equipment .
Leveraging the success of that network , in October 2003 , Irish Broadband began expanding into the unlicensed 5.7GHz spectrum using Alvarions new OFDM system , BreezeACCESS VL .
The 5.7GHz network was rolled out alongside the 2.4GHz network with 5.7GHz base stations also being used to backhaul 2.4GHz base stations for increased range .
I 'd say it 's Limerick .
Wexford is too far away .

We have seen many posts on the anti virus and people always give their opinion about there choice of the best anti virus .
Though I have not seen anyone talking about method to check the effectiveness of your anti virus .
The best way to check the effectiveness is by getting some file from some infected PC into your system but the question is are you willing to take that risk ?
of course I will never take that risk .
Here is the simple code ( TEST string ) copy and paste it on a notepad file and save it .
If your anti virus detect it as a virus or threat that will confirm you about the effectiveness of the anti virus .
X5O !P%@AP [ 4PZX54 ( P^ ) 7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$ H+H*
This is how my antivirus detected the notepad file as virus .
Antivirus test
This is one of the best way to check the effectiveness of your anti virus as you do n’t have to risk the security of your system .
This is EICAR TEST string .
Do let us know how effective your anti virus is ?
In case if it fails I recommend get any of these anti virus from Top 10 Anti-virus of 2008 .

The picture painted of Capt . Chesley B. Sullenberger III has been one of steely calm in the moments before he guided US Airways Flight 1549 into the Hudson River , but inside , he was terrified , he said in his first in - depth interview since the Jan. 15 crash landing .
“ I ca n’t believe this is happening , ” Captain Sullenberger thought , he told Katie Couric on Sunday night ’s broadcast of “ 60 Minutes ” on CBS .
“ This does n’t happen to me . ”
Asked to explain , he said , “ I had this expectation that my career would be one in which I did n’t crash an airplane . ”
He said he knew the plane was in trouble when he heard birds hit the engines .
“ Loud thumps .
It felt like the airplane being pelted by heavy rain or hail , ” he said .
“ Losing thrust on both engines , at a low speed , at a low altitude , over one of the most densely populated areas on the planet .
Yes , I knew it was a very challenging situation . ”
He quickly ruled out turning back to La Guardia Airport or trying to make it to an airport in New Jersey , and turned instead toward the Hudson .
He said he was concentrating so intensely that he did not say a prayer : “ I would imagine somebody in back was taking care of that for me while I was flying the airplane . ”

The SDK update is also due for release this spring , and is free of charge to all owners of L4D on the PC .
" Since Half - Life launched in 1998 , Valve has made continuous efforts to expand the offering of its products beyond what 's included on the day of launch , " said Gabe Newell , co-founder and president of Valve .
" With Half - Life and Counter - Strike , and more recently Team Fortress 2 , we 've learned that we 're no longer making stand - alone games but creating entertainment services .
With Left 4
Dead we 're extending that tradition by creating additional gameplay and releasing our internal tools to aspiring developers so they may also create and distribute new Left 4 Dead experiences . "
OK , you can run around shouting now .
CAN it be that only a couple of years ago , Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group , wildly successful in private equity , treated hundreds of guests at his lavish birthday celebration to performances by Rod Stewart and Patti LaBelle ?
Can it be that as recently as 2006 , financial firms accounted for almost one - third of all the corporate profits in the United States ?
Or that money was so free - flowing that a single bat mitzvah party could be estimated to cost $ 10 million ?
That era is gone with the wind .
Now we face a severe recession , frightening jumps in unemployment , a breathtaking collapse of equity and real estate prices .
Now we face a major discontinuity with what has gone before  a real , grinding , 3 a.m. fear , replete with nightmares of bread lines .
Not to belabor the obvious , but much of that fear comes from the crushing downward movement of mortgage - backed bonds and derivative securities linked to them .
These losses transformed local housing declines into a global crisis and , along with the breathtaking fall in stock prices , have remained the primary engines of disaster .
Remember that bailout money that is supposed to be helping stabilize and stimulate the economy and — by extension — help the rest of us in terms of personal finance ?
Well , something has certainly stabilized : Executive compensation .
Unfortunately , Congress has n’t done enough to limit executive compensation under the bailout money that the Treasury department has been meting out .
On top of that , a great deal of the money is going to promote “ liquidity ” and hopefully get things moving that way .
It ’s trickle down mentality at its finest :
Give a bunch of money to the big guys ( despite their horrible , greedy and economically devastating decisions ) , and hopefully some of it will trickle down to everyone else and stimulate the economy .
Here ’s an idea : Stimulate individuals
Consider this :
The money is going to be spent .
No matter what , politicians are convinced that the only way to fix this mess is to throw lots and lots of money at the problem .
( I disagree , but that is neither here nor there for this particular post . )
But perhaps they should reconsider where all this money is being thrown to .
What if it was given to individuals ?
What if the government took the rest of the $ 350 billion from the $ 700 billion bailout and gave it to the people ?
They could give $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 tax free to households making less than $ 250,000 and remain under that $ 350 billion mark .
They ’re going to give that money to people who made bad decisions anyway , it might as well be regular folks who made bad decisions .
Besides , if there was a massive stimulus package for individuals , many of us who made good decisions would be rewarded .
Congress could even stipulate that $ 10,000 of the money has to be spend on consumer goods .
Now there ’s something that would stimulate the economy .
And do it quickly .
And just imagine how many people would go out and buy a new car .
Auto industry gets help to !
Plus , such a large chunk of money would help individual personal finances as well :
Debt reduction .
Increased investment ( would help the stock market ) .
) .
Make substantial payments on mortgages ( reduce foreclosures ) .
If our politicians are bound and determined ( and they are ! ) to spend hundreds of billions of dollars , maybe they should abandon trickle down in favor of trickle up .
So the general theme of my talks for the last year has been about the extraordinary damage that infrastructure attacks are capable of .
I do believe it ’s possible to bolster endpoint security — to achieve end - to - end trust — but it will take more than what we ’re doing right now .
It will take , somewhat to my surprise , DNSSEC .
It will also take treating infrastructure itself with more care , and more security due diligence , than we do today .
Forget patching infrastructure .
When my DNS bug hit , a remarkable number of sites suddenly found themselves simply identifying the DNS servers they were dependent on .
We can do better .
We need better operational awareness of our infrastructure .
And we need infrastructure , over time , to become a lot safer and easier to update .
That means automatic update is n’t just for desktops anymore , that firmware patches need to have a much higher likelihood of not bricking the hardware , and possibly , that we need fewer builds with more testing for the new production environment , that is increasingly under attack .
The reality is the bad guys are out there , and they ’re learning .
Just as attackers moved from servers to clients , some are moving from compromising a single client to compromising every client behind vulnerable infrastructure .
Psyb0t , a worm that has been bouncing around since January , was recently found by DroneBL and reported on by Ryan Naraine .
It targets home routers , and early estimates are that it has hit over 100 K of them .
Home routers are a wonderful , enabling technology for users , and even for security , they carried us through 2001 - 2004 ’s years of widespread server side vulnerabilities .
So we should n’t be too down on them .
But they do have vulnerabilities , and they are getting exposed .
This , of course , is something quite a few people have been talking about .
CSRF — Cross Site Request Forgery — attacks have affected everyone from Linksys to Motorola to Siemens to Cisco .
More problematically , the DNS Rebinding attacks discussed by myself , David Byrne , Dan Boneh / Adam Barth / Collin Jackson , and others in 2007 still affect home routers .
And I ’m not talking about Java and Flash sockets , like at this year ’s CanSecWest talk .
I ’m talking about simply running rebinding against the browser itself , to make a remote website and a local router appear to be the same name , thus able to script against one another .
This should sound familiar , because this is what I discussed at RSA last year .
Yep , that still works , in all browsers .
It has to .
Moral of the video , please do n’t have a default password on your home router — and , maybe , home routers can someday only allow default passwords to work 10 minutes after power cycling .
Why ca n’t this be fixed in the browser ?
Now that ’s a fascinating question , which we ’ll discuss in another blog post .
Human pollution is turning the seas into acid so quickly that the coming decades will recreate conditions not seen on Earth since the time of the dinosaurs , scientists will warn today .
The rapid acidification is caused by the massive amounts of carbon dioxide belched from chimneys and exhausts that dissolve in the ocean .
The chemical change is placing " unprecedented " pressure on marine life such as shellfish and lobsters and could cause widespread extinctions , the experts say .
The study , by scientists at Bristol University , will be presented at a special three - day summit of climate scientists in Copenhagen , which opens today .
The conference is intended to update the science of global warming and to shock politicians into taking action on carbon emissions .
The Bristol scientists cannot talk about their unpublished results until they are announced later today .
But a summary of the findings seen by the Guardian predicts " dangerous " levels of ocean acidification and severe consequences for organisms called marine calcifiers , which form chalky shells .
It says : " We find the future rate of surface ocean acidification and environmental pressure on marine calcifiers very likely unprecedented in the past 65 million years . "
The scientists add that the situation in the deep sea is of even " greater concern " .
The scientists compared the current acidification rate with a giant prehistoric release of greenhouse gas , which geologists know caused widespread extinction of deep water species .
The summary reads : " Because the rates of acidification between past and future are comparable , and [ because ] there was widespread extinction of benthic organisms [ lowest living ] , one must conclude that a similar level of extinction is more likely than not in the future . "
Concern about ocean acidification from carbon pollution has grown in recent years , but the issue receives much less attention than global warming — also caused by human carbon emissions .
The Bristol study is one of the first to predict the consequences of acid waters by looking at past events .
It says future deep sea acidification must be limited to 0.2 pH units to avoid the worst effects .
The pH of surface waters , where the CO 2 is absorbed from the atmosphere , has fallen by about 0.1 units since the industrial revolution , though it will take longer for the acid to reach deeper water .
Ocean acidification is one of the key topics at the Copenhagen summit , with a series of presentations scheduled to examine the impacts .
Ken Caldeira , an expert on ocean acidification at the Carnegie Institution in California , will tell the conference that the next few decades could produce " profound " changes in the oceans .
He will say : " The choice to continue emitting carbon dioxide means that we will be an agent of biological change of a force and magnitude exceeded only by the causes of the great mass extinction events .
If we do not cut carbon dioxide emissions deeply and soon , the consequences of ocean acidification will stand out against the broad reaches of geologic time .
Those consequences will remain embedded in the geologic record as testimony from a civilisation that had the wisdom to develop high technology , but did not develop the wisdom to use it wisely . "
Other experts will report that acidification is already affecting marine life in the Arctic and Antarctic .
They will also discuss a bizarre finding that acid waters carry sound more efficiently , so the ocean will be a much noisier place in future .
The conference comes ahead of a year of high - level political discussions on climate change , which culminate in international negotiations in Copenhagen in December , where officials will try to hammer out a successor to the Kyoto protocol .
Katherine Richardson , a marine biologist at the University of Copenhagen , who organised this week 's event , has described it as " a deliberate attempt to influence policy " .
She said many scientists were concerned that politicians have not grasped the seriousness of the situation , despite increasingly gloomy predictions .
This week 's meeting will publish an update to the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
A number of studies published since the IPCC report was prepared show that carbon emissions are rising faster than expected and that existing greenhouse gas targets may not be enough to prevent catastrophic temperature rise .
It will also assess whether projected sea level rises have been underestimated , and if there is still a realistic chance that average global temperature rise can be limited to 2C .

Jose Mourinho has sought to spice up Internazionale 's Champions League return leg against Manchester United on Wednesday by saying he could take over as manager at Old Trafford when Sir Alex Ferguson retires .
Mourinho 's team head to Old Trafford this week looking to progress to the quarter - finals following a goalless first leg at San Siro a fortnight ago .
The Portuguese secured a memorable victory at Old Trafford at the same stage of the competition five years ago with Porto , but Inter will be underdogs this week .
The former Chelsea manager claimed he could be Ferguson 's successor , but he also believes the race for the Premier League title would be tighter if he was still managing in England .
" If you want me to rule out ever being Manchester United manager I can 't , " he told the News of the World .
" Special clubs need special managers so in theory it could work , but nobody knows what the future is in football .
" The England national team wanted me as coach and that is the biggest job in England , so I am sure when Sir Alex retires they will look at the best managers in the world and I certainly fall into the category . "
United currently lead the Premier League by seven points from Mourinho 's former club Chelsea and Liverpool and also have a game in hand to further strengthen their position , but Mourinho believes things would be different if he had not been sacked by Chelsea in September 2007 .
" Yes , Manchester United are the best team in England but you have to ask how good has the Premier League been since I left ?
" Manchester United have won it with ease since I have gone because no manager has put a team together that can rival them .
But my teams always rival Manchester United and Sir Alex knows that .
" They are a great team but if I was at a top club in England I think the title race might have been a lot closer this year . "
Mourinho also had some disparaging words for the teams trailing in United 's wake .
" Chelsea have had no stability , Arsenal are nowhere and Liverpool threatened but I do n't think anybody really thought they were ever going to win it , " he said .
" I would not allow a team of mine to be so far behind .
It is embarrassing in March .
" Manchester United have a great squad but are their players really that much better than Chelsea 's or Liverpool's ?
I do n't think so .
So something else must be the problem and somebody has to take responsibility for that .
" I beat Manchester United with Chelsea and Porto .
Now I am ready to beat them with Inter . "
Bridging MRI , JRuby & Rubinius with FFI
Developing bindings for native extensions in any programming language is often a test of patience more than anything else , and even worse , the resulting interface is often platform specific and requires duplicate effort .
Which is exactly what Foreign Function Interface ( FFI ) seeks to address : FFI is an interface that allows code written in one language to call code written in another language in a standard format .
Bridging MRI , JRuby and Rubinius
As a more practical example , consider an extremely popular Ruby extension : Hpricot .
Written in C it works beautifully well with the MRI implementation of Ruby , but can not be used by anyone in JRuby or Rubinius land .
( Unless the author builds a custom version of the gem for each platform , which is what happened with Hpricot ) .
Instead , thanks to the efforts of Evan Phoenix ( Rubinius ) and Wayne Meissner ( JRuby ) , we now have a full blown , VM - independent FFI library .
Let ’s walk through an example .
Exposing native libraries to Ruby
Based on libffi , the FFI gem ( gem install ffi ) is available for Ruby 1.8.6/7 , and comes pre-packaged with both JRuby and Rubinius .
The interface is consistent across all platforms , which means write once and it works everywhere !
Let ’s create a custom native extension :
// Simple FFI example between C & Ruby # include < math.h > double power ( double base , double power ) { return pow ( base , power ) ; } double square_root ( double x ) { return sqrt ( x ) ; } // custom factorial function which we 'll call from Ruby long ffi_factorial ( int max ) { int i = max , result = 1 ; while ( i >= 2 ) { result *= i -- ; } return result ; } //
Compiling shared library : // gcc - shared - Wl , - soname, libsimplemath -o libsimplemath.so simple_math.c -lm
Here we ’ve defined three simple math functions which we want to make use of in our Ruby application and compiled a shared library ( . so ) file .
Now , to get access to these functions we simply have to specify the method signatures using FFI ’s DSL :
require ' ffi ' class FFIMath extend FFI :: Library # load our custom C library and attach # FFI functions to our Ruby runtime ffi_lib " libsimplemath.so " functions = [ # method # parameters # return [ : power , [ : double , : double ] , : double ] , [ :square_root , [ : double ] , : double ] , [ :ffi_factorial , [ :int ] , : long ] ] functions .
each do | func | begin attach_function ( * func ) rescue Object => e puts " Could not attach #{ func } , #{ e . message } " end end end puts FFIMath .
power ( 3 , 5 ) # => 243.0 puts FFIMath .
square_root ( 81 ) # => 9.0 puts FFIMath .
ffi_factorial ( 10 ) # => 3628800
FFI Benchmarks & Benefits
The immediate benefit of using the FFI gem is the simple DSL interface compared to other alternatives ( SWIG , RubyInline , etc. ) and the fact that the resulting code is automatically compatible with JRuby , Rubinius and MRI .
At the moment , performance is still highly variable from platform to platform , but it ’s a work in progress and bound to improve .
FFI projects are slowly popping up on GitHub and you should consider it for your next native extension as well !
Editor 's note : Paul Begala , a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor , was a political consultant for Bill Clinton 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House .
Paul Begala says Cheney is hypocritical when he says he fears massive government expansion under Obama .
( CNN ) -- Dick Cheney has finally found the limits of government power .
In his interview with CNN's John King -- his first television interview since leaving the vice presidency -- Cheney revealed a view of federal power that is incoherent and hypocritical .
According to recently released legal memos from the Bush - Cheney administration , the former vice president believes that the federal government can ignore the First Amendment and suppress free speech and freedom of the press as part of its " war on terror . "
An October 23 , 2001 , memo from Justice Department lawyers John C. Yoo and Robert J. Delahunty said , " First Amendment speech and press rights may also be subordinated to the overriding need to wage war successfully . "
Former Vice President Cheney also believes , according to these same memos , that the federal government can send troops to burst into the homes of American citizens without a search warrant , despite the Fourth Amendment 's protection against such unreasonable searches .
He believes that the federal government has the right to arrest an American citizen on American soil and hold him in prison without charges .
He believes that the federal government can listen in on your phone conversations without a court order .
Cheney believes that the federal government can ignore the Geneva Conventions , binding treaties largely written by the United States , signed by the president and ratified by the Senate .
He believes that the federal government can commit torture , despite laws and treaties making torture a crime .
As the Washington Post reported , " Starting in January , 2002 , Cheney turned his attention to the practical business of crushing a captive 's will to resist .
The vice president 's office played a central role in shattering limits on coercion of prisoners in U.S. custody , commissioning and defending legal opinions that the Bush administration has since portrayed as the initiatives , months later , of lower - ranking officials . "
The newspaper said , " Cheney and his allies ... did not originate every idea to rewrite or reinterpret the law , but fresh accounts from participants show that they translated muscular theories , from Yoo and others , into the operational language of government . "
In fact , Yoo has said the federal government has the power to grab your young son and crush his private parts if the president thinks that will help the " war on terror . "
Think I 'm kidding ?
Here 's the verbatim exchange from a debate between Yoo and Notre Dame professor Doug Cassel :
Cassel :
If the president deems that he's got to torture somebody , including by crushing the testicles of the person 's child , there is no law that can stop him ?
Yoo : No treaty ...
Cassel : Also no law by Congress -- that is what you wrote in the August 2002 memo ...
Yoo : I think it depends on why the president thinks he needs to do that .
Wow .
That is a sick , twisted , sadistic world view .
It is also a breathtakingly expansive view of federal power over citizens .
Indeed , the position of Cheney and his allies seems to be that the federal government has limitless power over people .
If the government can censor the free press , restrict free speech , listen in on your private conversations , burst into your home , take you away , hold you in prison without charges and torture you , it raises an interesting question :
What on Earth does Dick Cheney think the federal government can't do ?
Thanks to John King , we now know : Cheney believes that the government cannot help with health care , improve education or wean America off Middle East oil .
I 'm not kidding .
Cheney , whose authoritarian impulses run deep , is suddenly worried that the federal government might become too powerful under President Obama .
" I worry a lot , " he told King , " that they 're using the current set of economic difficulties to try to justify a massive expansion in the government , and much more authority for the government over the private sector .
I do n't think that 's good .
I do n't think that 's going to solve the problem . "
Set aside the , umm , irony of a guy who is alive , thank God , because of government - provided health care opposing health care for taxpaying Americans .
And set aside the hypocrisy of the Bush - Cheney Medicare prescription drug entitlement , the greatest expansion of the federal role in health care since President Lyndon B. Johnson .
Focus instead on Cheney 's alarmist rhetoric : " a massive expansion in the government " , " much more authority for the government . "
Cheney is comfortable with a government that has the authority to torture , imprison , censor and kill .
Just not a government that has the capacity and compassion to write a health insurance policy or take on Big Oil .
I write this only hours after King 's interview with Cheney , and yet I believe it will live in history .
Right there , in his own words , Cheney gives historians a candid explication of his world view : that government may claim dictatorial powers when he and his ilk are in charge , but when we the people call on our government to act to address recession , illness and ignorance ( made worse by Cheney 's policies ) well , then we 've reached Cheney 's boundaries of the government 's power .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala .
All About Dick Cheney • Torture • Health Care Policy
Jess Bravin reports on the Supreme Court .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg returned to the bench today , keeping her promise to be back on the job for the first oral arguments since she underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer earlier this month .
After Ginsburg took her customary seat between Justices David Souter and Samuel Alito , the court got back to business without a word on its only female member ’s ordeal .
A dispute between the federal government and the Navajo Nation over coal mining royalties on the Indian tribe ’s land was first up , and Ginsburg , her voice slightly scratchy , had lost none of her edge .
When Carter Phillips , the Washington lawyer representing the Navajo , seemed to backtrack from a position the tribe had taken earlier in the litigation , Ginsburg cut to the chase .
“ You ’re really saying you were wrong , ” she chided .
According to the court , the tumor discovered in a January checkup turned out to be benign .
But during the procedure surgeons found another , even smaller tumor that was cancerous and removed it .
The disease , the court said , had not spread , and specialists say that the early detection and top-rate care Ginsburg received may make her one of the minority who live years after a pancreatic cancer diagnosis .
At a November event at Columbia Law School , where Ginsburg received a law degree in 1959 and later joined the faculty , the justice said her “ hope and expectation ” was to at least equal the tenure of another justice who joined the court at age 60 , Louis Brandeis .
Ginsburg , who turns 76 on March 15 , would stay on the court until 2016 to match Brandeis , who stepped down at age 83 .
At a Republican event in Kentucky , however , Sen. Jim Bunning suggested Ginsburg ’s seat would soon be in play because she has “ bad cancer .
The kind that you do n’t get better from , ” the Louisville Courier - Journal reported .
“ Even though she was operated on , usually , nine months is the longest that anybody would live after ( being diagnosed ) with pancreatic cancer , ” he said , the paper reported .
The court on Monday agreed to hear six new cases , including a challenge to the federal government ’s effort to maintain a cross on a public nature preserve by transferring the land ’s ownership to a private group .
Most Japanese girls giggle .
The little maid on the fourth floor of the Miyako Hotel , in Kyoto , was no exception .
Hilarity , and attempts to suppress it , pinked her cheeks ( unlike the Chinese , the Japanese complexion more often than not has considerable color ) , shook her plump peony - and - pansy - kimonoed figure .
There seemed to be no particular reason for this merriment ; the Japanese giggle operates without apparent motivation .
I ’d merely asked to be directed toward a certain room .
“ You come see Marron ? ” she gasped , showing , like so many of her fellow - countrymen , an array of gold teeth .
Then , with the tiny , pigeon - toed skating steps that the wearing of a kimono necessitates , she led me through a labyrinth of corridors , promising , “ I knock you Marron . ”
The “ l ” sound does not exist in Japanese , and by “ Marron ” the maid meant Marlon — Marlon Brando , the American actor , who was at that time in Kyoto doing location work for the Warner Brothers - William Goetz motion - picture version of James Michener ’s novel “ Sayonara . ”
Photograph from Warner Bros. / Getty
My guide tapped at Brando ’s door , shrieked “ Marron ! , ” and fled away along the corridor , her kimono sleeves fluttering like the wings of a parakeet .
The door was opened by another doll - delicate Miyako maid , who at once succumbed to her own fit of quaint hysteria .
From an inner room , Brando called , “ What is it , honey ? ”
But the girl , her eyes squeezed shut with mirth and her fat little hands jammed into her mouth , like a bawling baby ’s , was incapable of reply .
“ Hey , honey , what is it ? ” Brando again inquired , and appeared in the doorway .
“ Oh , hi , ” he said when he saw me .
“ It ’s seven , huh ? ”
We ’d made a seven - o’ clock date for dinner ; I was nearly twenty minutes late .
“ Well , take off your shoes and come on in .
I ’m just finishing up here .
And , hey , honey , ” he told the maid , “ bring us some ice . ”
Then , looking after the girl as she scurried off , he cocked his hands on his hips and , grinning , declared , “ They kill me .
They really kill me .
The kids , too .
Do n’t you think they ’re wonderful , do n’t you love them — Japanese kids ? ”
The Miyako , where about half of the “ Sayonara ” company was staying , is the most prominent of the so - called Western - style hotels in Kyoto ; the majority of its rooms are furnished with sturdy , if commonplace and cumbersome , European chairs and tables , beds and couches .
But , for the convenience of Japanese guests who prefer their own mode of décor while desiring the prestige of staying at the Miyako , or of those foreign travellers who yearn after authentic atmosphere yet are disinclined to endure the unheated rigors of a real Japanese inn , the Miyako maintains some suites decorated in the traditional manner , and it was in one of these that Brando had chosen to settle himself .
His quarters consisted of two rooms , a bath , and a glassed - in sun porch .
Without the overlying and underlying clutter of Brando ’s personal belongings , the rooms would have been textbook illustrations of the Japanese penchant for an ostentatious barrenness .
The floors were covered with tawny tatami matting , with a discreet scattering of raw - silk pillows ; a scroll depicting swimming golden carp hung in an alcove , and beneath it , on a stand , sat a vase filled with tall lilies and red leaves , arranged just so .
The larger of the two rooms — the inner one — which the occupant was using as a sort of business office where he also dined and slept , contained a long , low lacquer table and a sleeping pallet .
In these rooms , the divergent concepts of Japanese and Western decoration — the one seeking to impress by a lack of display , an absence of possession - exhibiting , the other intent on precisely the reverse — could both be observed , for Brando seemed unwilling to make use of the apartment ’s storage space , concealed behind sliding paper doors .
All that he owned seemed to be out in the open .
Shirts , ready for the laundry ; socks , too ; shoes and sweaters and jackets and hats and ties , flung around like the costume of a dismantled scarecrow .
And cameras , a typewriter , a tape recorder , an electric heater that performed with stifling competence .
Here , there , pieces of partly nibbled fruit ; a box of the famous Japanese strawberries , each berry the size of an egg .
And books , a deep - thought cascade , among which one saw Colin Wilson ’s “ The Outsider ” and various works on Buddhist prayer , Zen meditation , Yogi breathing , and Hindu mysticism , but no fiction , for Brando reads none .
He has never , he professes , opened a novel since April 3 , 1924 , the day he was born , in Omaha , Nebraska .
But while he may not care to read fiction , he does desire to write it , and the long lacquer table was loaded with overfilled ashtrays and piled pages of his most recent creative effort , which happens to be a film script entitled “ A Burst of Vermilion . ”
In fact , Brando had evidently been working on his story at the moment of my arrival .
As I entered the room , a subdued - looking , youngish man , whom I shall call Murray , and who had previously been pointed out to me as “ the fellow that ’s helping Marlon with his writing , ” was squatted on the matting fumbling through the manuscript of “ A Burst of Vermilion . ”
Weighing some pages on his hand , he said , “ Tell ya , Mar , s’pose I go over this down in my room , and maybe we ’ll get together again — say , around ten - thirty ? ”
Brando scowled , as though unsympathetic to the idea of resuming their endeavors later in the evening .
Having been slightly ill , as I learned later , he had spent the day in his room , and now seemed restive .
“ What ’s this ? ” he asked , pointing to a couple of oblong packages among the literary remains on the lacquer table .
Murray shrugged .
The maid had delivered them ; that was all he knew .
“ People are always sending Mar presents , ” he told me .
“ Lots of times we do n’t know who sent them .
True , Mar ? ”
“ Yeah , ” said Brando , beginning to rip open the gifts , which , like most Japanese packages — even mundane purchases from very ordinary shops — were beautifully wrapped .
One contained candy , the other white rice cakes , which proved cement - hard , though they looked like puffs of cloud .
There was no card in either package to identify the donor .
“ Every time you turn around , some Japanese is giving you a present .
They ’re crazy about giving presents , ” Brando observed .
Athletically crunching a rice cake , he passed the boxes to Murray and me .
Murray shook his head ; he was intent on obtaining Brando ’s promise to meet with him again at ten - thirty .
“ Give me a ring around then , ” Brando said , finally .
“ We ’ll see what ’s happening . ”
Murray , as I knew , was only one member of what some of the “ Sayonara ” company referred to as “ Brando ’s gang . ”
Aside from the literary assistant , the gang consisted of Marlon Brando , Sr. , who acts as his son ’s business manager ; a pretty , dark - haired secretary , Miss Levin ; and Brando ’s private makeup man .
The travel expenses of this entourage , and all its living expenses while on location , were allowed for in the actor ’s contract with Warner Brothers .
Legend to the contrary , film studios are not usually so lenient financially .
A Warner man to whom I talked later explained the tolerance shown Brando by saying , “ Ordinarily we would n’t put up with it .
All the demands he makes .
Except — well this picture just had to have a big star .
Your star — that ’s the only thing the really counts at the box office . ”
Among the company were some who felt that the social protection supplied by Brando ’s inner circle was preventing them from “ getting to know the guy ” as well as they would have liked .
Brando had been in Japan for more than a month , and during that time he had shown himself on the set as a slouchingly dignified , amiable - seeming young man who was always ready to coöperate with , and even encourage , his co-workers — the actors particularly — yet by and large was not socially available , preferring , during the tedious lulls between scenes , to sit alone reading philosophy or scribbling in a schoolboy notebook .
After the day ’s work , instead of accepting his colleagues ’ invitations to join a group for drinks , a plate of raw fish in a restaurant , and a prowl through the old geisha quarter of Kyoto , instead of contributing to the one - big - family , houseparty bonhomie that picture - making on location theoretically generates , he usually returned to his hotel and stayed there .
Since the most fervent of movie - star fans are the people who themselves work in the film industry , Brando was a subject of immense interest within the ranks of the “ Sayonara ” group , and the more so because his attitude of friendly remoteness produced , in the face of such curiosity , such wistful frustrations .
Even the film ’s director , Joshua Logan , was impelled to say , after working with Brando for two weeks , “ Marlon ’s the most exciting person I ’ve met since Garbo .
A genius .
But I do n’t know what he ’s like .
I do n’t know anything about him . ”
The maid had reëntered the star ’s room , and Murray , on his way out , almost tripped over the train of her kimono .
She put down a bowl of ice and , with a glow , a giggle , an elation that made her little feet , hooflike in their split - toed white socks , lift and lower like a prancing pony ’s , announced , “ Appapie !
Tonight on menu appapie . ”
Brando groaned .
“ Apple pie .
That ’s all I need . ”
He stretched out on the floor and unbuckled his belt , which dug too deeply into the swell of his stomach .
“ I ’m supposed to be on a diet .
But the only things I want to eat are apple pie and stuff like that . ”
Six weeks earlier , in California , Logan had told him he must trim off ten pounds for his role in “ Sayonara , ” and before arriving in Kyoto he had managed to get rid of seven .
Since reaching Japan , however , abetted not only by American - type apple pie but by the Japanese cuisine , with its delicious emphasis on the sweetened , the starchy , the fried , he ’d regained , then doubled this poundage .
Now , loosening his belt still more and thoughtfully massaging his midriff , he scanned the menu , which offered , in English , a wide choice of Western - style dishes , and , after reminding himself “ I ’ve got to lose weight , ” ordered soup , beefsteak with French - fried potatoes , three supplementary vegetables , a side dish of spaghetti , rolls and butter , a bottle of sake , salad , and cheese and crackers .

“ And appapie , Marron ? ”
He sighed .
“ With ice cream , honey . ”
Though Brando is not a teetotaller , his appetite is more frugal when it comes to alcohol .
While we were awaiting the dinner , which was to be served to us in the room , he supplied me with a large vodka on the rocks and poured himself the merest courtesy sip .
Resuming his position on the floor , he lolled his head against a pillow , drooped his eyelids , then shut them .
It was as though he ’d dozed off into a disturbing dream ; his eyelids twitched , and when he spoke , his voice — an unemotional voice , in a way cultivated and genteel , yet surprisingly adolescent , a voice with a probing , asking , boyish quality — seemed to come from sleepy distances .
“ The last eight , nine years of my life have been a mess , ” he said .
“ Maybe the last two have been a little better .
Less rolling in the trough of the wave .
Have you ever been analyzed ?
I was afraid of it at first .
Afraid it might destroy the impulses that made me creative , an artist .
A sensitive person receives fifty impressions where somebody else may only get seven .
Sensitive people are so vulnerable ; they ’re so easily brutalized and hurt just because they are sensitive .
The more sensitive you are , the more certain you are to be brutalized , develop scabs .
Never evolve .
Never allow yourself to feel anything , because you always feel too much .
Analysis helps .
It helped me .
But still , the last eight , nine years I ’ve been pretty mixed up , a mess pretty much .
. . . ”
The voice went on , as though speaking to hear itself , an effect Brando ’s speech often has , for , like many persons who are intensely self - absorbed , he is something of a monologuist — a fact that he recognizes and for which he offers his own explanation .
“ People around me never say anything , ” he says .
“ They just seem to want to hear what I have to say .
That ’s why I do all the talking . ”
Watching him now , with his eyes closed , his unlined face white under an overhead light , I felt as if the moment of my initial encounter with him were being recreated .
The year of that meeting was 1947 ; it was a winter afternoon in New York , when I had occasion to attend a rehearsal of Tennessee Williams ’
“ A Streetcar Named Desire , ” in which Brando was to play the role of Stanley Kowalski .
It was this role that first brought him general recognition , although among the New York theatre ’s cognoscenti he had already attracted attention , through his student work with the drama coach Stella Adler and a few Broadway appearances — one in a play by Maxwell Anderson , “ Truckline Café , ” and another as Marchbanks opposite Katharine Cornell ’s Candida — in which he showed an ability that had been much praised and discussed .
Elia Kazan , the director of “ A Streetcar Named Desire , ” said at that time , and has recently repeated , “ Marlon is just the best actor in the world . ”
But ten years ago , on the remembered afternoon , he was still relatively unknown ; at least , I had n’t a clue to who he might be when , arriving too early at the “ Streetcar ” rehearsal , I found the auditorium deserted and a brawny young man stretched out atop a table on the stage under the gloomy glare of work lights , solidly asleep .
Because he was wearing a white T - shirt and denim trousers , because of his squat gymnasium physique — the weight - lifter ’s arms , the Charles Atlas chest ( though an opened “ Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud ” was resting on it ) — I took him for a stagehand .
Or did until I looked closely at his face .
It was as if a stranger ’s head had been attached to the brawny body , as in certain counterfeit photographs .
For this face was so very untough , superimposing , as it did , an almost angelic refinement and gentleness upon hard - jawed good looks : taut skin , a broad , high forehead , wide apart eyes , an aquiline nose , full lips with a relaxed , sensual expression .
Not the least suggestion of Williams ’ unpoetic Kowalski .
It was therefore rather an experience to observe , later that afternoon , with what chameleon ease Brando acquired the character ’s cruel and gaudy colors , how superbly , like a guileful salamander , he slithered into the part , how his own persona evaporated — just as , in this Kyoto hotel room ten years afterward , my 1947 memory of Brando receded , disappeared into his 1957 self .
And the present Brando , the one lounging there on the tatami and lazily puffing filtered cigarettes as he talked and talked , was , of course , a different person — bound to be .
His body was thicker ; his forehead was higher , for his hair was thinner ; he was richer ( from the producers of “ Sayonara ” he could expect a salary of three hundred thousand dollars , plus a percentage of the picture ’s earnings ) ; and he ’d become , as one journalist put it , “ the Valentino of the bop generation ” — turned into such a world celebrity that when he went out in public here in Japan , he deemed it wise to hide his face not only by wearing dark glasses but by donning a surgeon ’s gauze mask as well .
( The latter bit of disguise is not so outré in Japan as it may sound , since numerous Asians wear such masks , on the theory that they prevent the spreading of germs . )
Those were some of the alterations a decade had made .
There were others .
His eyes had changed .
Although their caffè - espresso color was the same , the shyness , any traces of real vulnerability that they had formerly held , had left them ; now he looked at people with assurance , and with what can only be called a pitying expression , as though he dwelt in spheres of enlightenment where they , to his regret , did not .
( The reactions of the people subjected to this gaze of constant commiseration range from that of a young actress who avowed that “ Marlon is really a very spiritual person , wise and very sincere ; you can see it in his eyes ” to that of a Brando acquaintance who said , “ The way he looks at you , like he was so damn sorry for you — does n’t it make you want to cut your throat ? ” )
Nevertheless , the subtly tender character of his face had been preserved .
Or almost .
For in the years between he ’d had an accident that gave his face a more conventionally masculine aspect .
It was just that his nose had been broken .
And , maneuvering a word in edgewise , I asked , “ How did you break your nose ?
”
“. . . by which I do n’t mean that I ’m always unhappy .
I remember one April I was in Sicily .
A hot day , and flowers everywhere .
I like flowers , the ones that smell .
Gardenias .
Anyway , it was April and I was in Sicily , and I went off by myself .
Lay down in this field of flowers .
Went to sleep .
That made me happy .
I was happy then .
What ?
You say something ? ”
“ I was wondering how you broke your nose . ”
He rubbed his nose and grinned , as though remembering an experience as happy as the Sicilian nap .
“ That was a long time ago .
I did it boxing .
It was when I was in ‘ Streetcar . ’
We , some of the guys backstage and me — we used to go down to the boiler room in the theatre and horse around , mix it up .
One night , I was mixing it up with this guy and — crack !
So I put on my coat and walked around to the nearest hospital — it was off Broadway somewhere .
My nose was really busted .
They had to give me an anesthetic to set it , and put me to bed .
Not that I was sorry .
‘ Streetcar ’ had been running about a year and I was sick of it .
But my nose healed pretty quick , and I guess I would ’ve been back in the show practically right away if I had n’t done what I did to Irene Selznick . ”
His grin broadened as he mentioned Mrs. Selznick , who had been the producer of the Williams play .
“ There is one shrewd lady , Irene Selznick .
When she wants something , she wants it .
And she wanted me back in the play .
But when I heard she was coming to the hospital , I went to work with bandages and iodine and mercurochrome , and — Christ !— when she walked in the door , I looked like my head had been cut off .
At the least .
And sounded as though I were dying .
‘ Oh , Marlon , ’ she said , ‘ you poor , poor boy ! ’
And I said , ‘ Do n’t you worry about anything , Irene .
I ’ll be back in the show tonight !’
And she said , ‘ Do n’t you dare !
We can manage without you for — for — well , a few days more . ’
‘ No , no , ’ I said .
‘ I ’m O.K . I want to work .
Tell them I ’ll be back tonight . ’
So she said , ‘ You ’re in no condition , you poor darling .
I forbid you to come to the theatre . ’
So I stayed in the hospital and had myself a ball . ” ( Mrs. Selznick , recalling the incident recently , said , “ They did n’t set his nose properly at all .
Suddenly his face was quite different .
Kind of tough .
For months afterward , I kept telling him , ‘ But they ’ve ruined your face .
You must have your nose broken again and reset . ’
Luckily for him , he did n’t listen to me .
Because I honestly think that broken nose made his fortune as far as the movies go .
It gave him sex appeal .
He was too beautiful before . ” )
Brando made his first trip to the Coast in 1949 , when he went out there to play the leading role in “ The Men , ” a picture dealing with paraplegic war veterans .
He was accused , at the time , of uncouth social conduct , and criticized for his black - leather - jacket taste in attire , his choice of motorcycles instead of Jaguars , and his preference for obscure secretaries rather than movie starlets ; moreover , Hollywood columnists studded their copy with hostile comments concerning his attitude toward the film business , which he himself summed up soon after he entered it by saying , “ The only reason I ’m here is that I do n’t yet have the moral courage to turn down the money . ”
In interviews , he repeatedly stated that becoming “ simply a movie actor ” was the thing furthest from his thoughts .
“ I may do a picture now and then , ” he said on one occasion , “ but mostly I intend to work on the stage . ”
However , he followed “ The Men , ” which was more of a succès d’estime than a commercial triumph , by recreating Kowalski in the screen treatment of “ A Streetcar Named Desire , ” and this role , as it had done on Broadway , established him as a star .
( Defined practically , a movie star is any performer who can account for a box - office profit regardless of the quality of the enterprise in which he appears ; the breed is so scarce that there are fewer than ten actors today who qualify for the title .
Brando is one of them ; as a box - office draw , male division , he is perhaps outranked only by William Holden . )
In the course of the last five years , he has played a Mexican revolutionary ( “ Viva Zapata ! ” ) , Mark Antony ( “ Julius Caesar ” ) , and a motorcycle - mad juvenile delinquent ( “ The Wild One ” ) ; earned an Academy Award in the role of a dockyard thug ( “ On the Waterfront ” ) ; impersonated Napoleon ( “ Désirée ” ) ; sung and danced his way through the part of an adult delinquent ( “ Guys and Dolls ” ) ; and taken the part of the Okinawan interpreter in “ The Teahouse of the August Moon , ” which , like “ Sayonara , ” his tenth picture , was partly shot on location in Japan .
But he has never , except for a brief period in summer stock , returned to the stage .
“ Why should I ? ” he asked with apathy when I remarked on this .
“ The movies have a greater potential .
They can be a factor for good .
For moral development .
At least some can — the kind of movies I want to do . ”
He paused , seemed to listen , as though his statement had been tape - recorded and he were now playing it back .
Possibly the sound of it dissatisfied him ; at any rate , his jaw started working , as if he were biting down on an unpleasant mouthful .
He looked off into space suddenly and demanded , “ What ’s so hot about New York ?
What ’s so hot about working for Cheryl Crawford and Robert Whitehead ? ”
Miss Crawford and Whitehead are two of New York ’s most prominent theatrical producers , neither of whom has had occasion to employ Brando .
“ Anyway , what would I be in ? ” he continued .
“ There are n’t any parts for me . ”
Stack them , and the playscripts offered him in any given season by hopeful Broadway managements might very well rise to a height exceeding the actor ’s own .
Tennessee Williams wanted him for the male lead in each of his last five plays , and the most recent of these , “ Orpheus Descending , ” which was pending production at the time of our talk , had been written expressly as a co-starring vehicle for Brando and the Italian actress Anna Magnani .
“ I can explain very easily why I did n’t do ‘ Orpheus , ’ ” Brando said .
“ there are beautiful things in it , some of Tennessee ’s best writing , and the Magnani part is great ; she stands for something , you can understand her — and she would wipe me off the stage .
The character I was supposed to play , this boy , this Val , he never takes a stand .
I did n’t really know what he was for or against .
Well , you ca n’t act a vacuum .
And I told Tennessee .
So he kept trying .
He rewrote it for me , maybe a couple of times .
But — ” He shrugged .
“ Well , I had no intention of walking out on any stage with Magnani .
Not in that part .
They ’d have had to mop me up . ”
Brando mused a moment , and added , “ I think — in fact , I ’m sure — Tennessee has made a fixed association between me and Kowalski .
I mean , we ’re friends and he knows that as a person I am just the opposite of Kowalski , who was everything I ’m against — totally insensitive , crude , cruel .
But still Tennessee ’s image of me is confused with the fact that I played that part .
So I do n’t know if he could write for me in a different color range .
The only reason I did ‘ Guys and Dolls ’ was to work in a lighter color — yellow .
Before that , the brightest color I ’d played was red .
From red down .
Brown .
Gray .
Black . ”
He crumpled an empty cigarette package and bounced it in his hand like a ball .
“ There are n’t any parts for me on the stage .
Nobody writes them .
Go on .
Tell me a part I could do . ”
In the absence of vehicles by worthy contemporaries , might he not favor the work of older hands ?
Several responsible persons who appeared with him in the film had admired his reading of Mark Antony in “ Julius Caesar , ” and thought him equipped , provided the will was there , to essay many of the Mount Everest roles in stage literature — even , possibly , Oedipus .
Brando received reminders of this praise blankly — or , rather , he seemed to be indulging his not - listening habit .
But , sensing silence again , he dissolved it : “ Of course , movies date so quickly .
I saw ‘ Streetcar ’ the other day and it was already an old - fashioned picture .
Still , movies do have the greatest potential .
You can say important things to a lot of people .
About discrimination and hatred and prejudice .
I want to make pictures that explore the themes current in the world today .
In terms of entertainment .
That ’s why I ’ve started my own independent production company . ”
He reached out affectionately to finger “ A Burst of Vermilion , ” which will be the first script filmed by Pennebaker Productions — the independent company he has formed .
And did “ A Burst of Vermilion ” satisfy him as a basis for the kind of lofty aims he proposed ?
INDIANAPOLIS , Jan. 21 ( UPI ) --
An error in a routine maintenance procedure caused the deaths of 15 bonnet - head sharks at the Indianapolis Zoo's Oceans exhibit , an official says .
Deputy Zoo Director Paul Grayson says the sharks died when a cleaning system released too much ozone into their tank Monday , damaging the sharks ' gills , the Indianapolis Star reports .

Grayson said the Zoo uses ozone to help remove unwanted things from the tank water .
" It 's great for the health of the fish when you control it , " he said .
" When it gets high , it can do some serious damage to tissue . "
The newspaper says the accident occurred after zoo workers cut power to the tank 's sophisticated life - support devices to make a repair .
They failed to reopen a valve that regulates ozone after turning the power back on .
Two Emperor Snappers that shared the tank with the sharks suffered no ill effects from the accident .
A NASA investigation team is trying to determine why a protective nose cone failed to detach during the launching of a climate satellite on Tuesday morning , dooming the $ 278 million mission and leaving scientists without a much - anticipated advance in the tracking of global carbon dioxide emissions .
The Orbiting Carbon Observatory lifted off on schedule at 1:55 a.m. Pacific time from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California aboard a four - stage Taurus XL rocket .
But about three minutes later , seven seconds after the ignition of the third stage , the payload fairing  a nose cone that protects the satellite as it rises through the atmosphere  failed to separate as commanded .
“ It ’s a huge disappointment to the entire team that ’s worked very hard over years and years and really did their best to see it through , ” Charles P. Dovale , the launching manager , said at a news conference .
“ The reason not everyone is able to do this is it ’s hard .
And even when you do the best you can , you can still fail .
It ’s a tough business . ”
Data received during the launching indicated that the spacecraft ’s computer had sent commands to set off small explosive charges to split the nose cone in two , like opening a clamshell .
The third and fourth stages burned properly , but because of the added weight of the nose cone , the rocket did not accelerate as much as necessary .

Palestinian driver shot after injuring two officers and hitting empty bus in attack in Jerusalem
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
A Palestinian bulldozer driver rammed a police car in Jerusalem , injuring two police officers , and then hit a bus before he was shot , officials said today .
Israeli police said they regarded the incident as a terrorist attack .
The driver of the bulldozer was shot several times and taken by ambulance to hospital with severe injuries .
There were conflicting reports about whether he had been killed .
The two policemen suffered slight injuries .
Uzi Mahatabi , 32 , a taxi driver who witnessed the incident said : " When I saw the bulldozer throw the squad car up and down in the air with an officer inside , I realised it was a terror attack . "
Mahatabi said he got out of his cab , and fired two or three bullets , hitting the attacker in the stomach after police had already shot the man .
The incident appears similar to at least two other attacks in Jerusalem last year in which bulldozers were used against cars and buses .
The police car was badly damaged when the bulldozer reportedly pushed it down a busy main road in the city and then flipped it over at least once .
The large private coach , which was not carrying passengers at the time , had some of its windows smashed .
The incident happened on the Menachem Begin highway , one of the main roads running through Jerusalem and close to several construction sites .
Hamas described the attack as a " natural response " to the demolition of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem and to the recent offensive in the Gaza Strip .
" The operation in Jerusalem was a natural response to aggression against our people , " Mushir al - Masri , a senior Hamas official , said .
" The Zionist enemy should realise that they alone bear the responsibility for displacing our people in Jerusalem and for the killings in Gaza and the West Bank . " .
Last year saw a series of high - profile attacks in Jerusalem .
In March , a gunman walked into a Jewish religious seminary and shot eight students dead .
In July , a construction worker drove a bulldozer down a main street in the city , killing three people and injuring 44 others .
Later that month , another man drove a bulldozer down a busy street , ramming cars and injuring 16 people .
All three Palestinians were shot dead at the scene of the attacks .
In September , a Palestinian driver crashed his car into a group of Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem , injuring 17 people in what Israeli police also described as a terror attack .
The driver was immediately shot dead by an army officer .
Gary McKinnon could face up to 70 years in a US prison British computer hacker Gary McKinnon has lost the latest round of his battle against extradition to the US .
The Crown Prosecution Service refused to bring charges against him in the UK .
Mr McKinnon , 42 , from Wood Green , north London , faces up to 70 years in prison if found guilty in the US of breaking into military computers .
His lawyers appealed for him to be prosecuted in the UK on lesser charges , but the CPS said the best place for the case to be heard was the US .
Glasgow - born Mr McKinnon has always admitted hacking into the computer systems in 2001 - 2 - which the US government says caused damage costing $ 800,000 ( £ 550,000 ) .
In total , he hacked into 97 government computers belonging to organisations including the US Navy and Nasa .
Mr McKinnon has always said he had no malicious intent but was looking for classified documents on UFOs which he believed the US authorities had suppressed .
He has signed a statement accepting that his hacking constituted an offence under the UK's Computer Misuse Act 1990 .
Gary is a gentle man with Aspergers - not a dangerous terrorist
Janis Sharp , Gary McKinnon 's mother
The CPS said it found enough evidence to bring charges against the hacker under the act for obtaining " unauthorised access with intent " .
But Alison Saunders , head of the CPS organised crime division , said : " The evidence we have does not come near to reflecting the criminality that is alleged by the American authorities . "
She added : " These were not random experiments in computer hacking , but a deliberate effort to breach US defence systems at a critical time which caused well - documented damage .
" They may have been conducted from Mr McKinnon 's home computer - and in that sense there is a UK link - but the target and the damage were transatlantic .
" The bulk of the evidence is located in the United States , the activity was directed against the military infrastructure of the United States , the investigation commenced in the United States and was ongoing , and there are a large number of witnesses , most of whom are located in the United States . "
' Years of agony ' Mr McKinnon 's mother , Janis Sharp , said she was " heartbroken by the lack of compassion " shown towards her son .
" Gary is a gentle man with Aspergers - not a dangerous terrorist .
" His obsessions led him to search US computer systems .
Wrong , yes , but extraditing him to a high - security prison knowing he wo n't survive - surely no - one can honestly believe that punishment fits the crime ?
" We 've suffered an agonising seven years which has ruined the lives and health of my family . "
Mr McKinnon , who was arrested by British police in 2002 , has already appealed unsuccessfully to the House of Lords and the European Court of Human Rights to avoid extradition .
His battle now rests on a judicial review of the government 's decision to extradite him .
Last August , Mr McKinnon was diagnosed as having Asperger 's Syndrome and his lawyers said he was at risk of suicide if extradited .

JERUSALEM , Feb. 20 ( UPI ) -- Israeli President Shimon Peres has tapped Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu to form the country 's next government , the president 's office said Friday .
Peres met separately with Netanyahu and Kadima Chairwoman Tzipi Livni , urging both to form a broad national unity government , The Jerusalem Post reported .

Netanyahu , who was prime minister in the 1990s , said he understands the need for a unity government , reportedly telling Peres , " Immediately after you task me with forming the coalition , I will invite Kadima for negotiations . "
Livni was critical of the arrangement , saying , " Whoever is willing to forsake all his values in order to sit in the coalition is unworthy to sit in that spot .
There is a coalition here based on a lack of political vision , a coalition that will not allow me to exercise the way of Kadima . "
Sixty - five members of the 120 - seat Knesset , all from right - wing and religious factions , recommended to Peres that he appoint Netanyahu to form the coalition , Ynetnews.com reported .
Livni had the support of her party while left - wing and Arab parties declined to offer a recommendation .
On Thursday , Livni told Haaretz she would n't join a government headed by Netanyahu and included Shas , Habayit Hayehudi and National Union parties but would be willing to consider a Likud - Kadima - Yisrael Beiteinu coalition .
Israeli elections were conducted about 10 days ago .
( CNN ) --
The search will continue until at least Friday night for 16 people missing since Thursday morning when a helicopter carrying them to an offshore oil platform ditched in the Atlantic Ocean off Newfoundland , Canadian officials said .
A helicopter made an emergency crash landing off Newfoundland en route to Hibernia oil field on Thursday .
One survivor , identified as Robert Decker , was found and taken to a hospital , but efforts to find more survivors had proven fruitless , said Maj .
Denis McGuire of the Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax , Nova Scotia .
The body of one person , who has not been identified publicly , also was pulled from the water .
There were 18 people aboard the helicopter when it went down , about 30 nautical miles from St. John's .
" All we 've got is the debris field , " McGuire said .
" There are no indications of any [ more ] survivors , but the search will continue . "
The water is 400 feet deep at the site where the helicopter hit the water , he said .
Helicopters and ships were scouring the debris field Thursday evening , and search - and - rescue technicians were planning to use night - vision goggles and flares overnight .
The debris filled a six - mile area , said Jeri Grychowski of the Rescue Coordination Centre in Halifax .
Officials became aware that the helicopter was having problems shortly after 9:10 a.m. , when the pilot declared a mayday , McGuire said .
" They declared their mayday and then they hit the water or landed in the water approximately eight minutes later , " he said .
About 25 minutes later , a helicopter arrived and discovered the survivor , the body , the overturned helicopter and two empty life rafts , he said .
Those aboard should have have been wearing survival suits that would have kept them dry and were equipped with lights and personal locator beacons , but the suits have not helped searchers .
" We have not received any signals whatsoever , " McGuire said .
The suits theoretically would allow wearers to survive 24 hours in the freezing waters -- or until about 9 a.m. Friday -- but the search effort was to continue well beyond that .
" We will continue to search until there 's absolutely no chance that any survivors will be located , " he said .
" Until last light [ Friday ] . "
At that time , based on water temperature and the size of the search area , officials will decide whether to continue the effort , he said .
Early in the day , high winds and seas hampered the search , but by late afternoon , the weather had improved , though seas were still about 13 to 16 feet ( 4 to 5 meters ) and winds were at about 40 knots ( 46 mph ) .
The survivor was taken to the Health Sciences Center in St. John 's , Newfoundland .
The helicopter had been heading to the Hibernia offshore oil platform when it went down in what Grychowski called a controlled emergency crash landing .
The pilot reported some technical malfunctions before the crash and radioed that he was turning the chopper around , said Rick Burt of Cougar Helicopters -- the operator of the S - 92 Sikorsky copter .

A spokeswoman for Mr. Geithner , Stephanie Cutter , had no comment .
In an interview on Monday Mr. Axelrod did not deny that there were differences of opinion as the policy was being crafted or that he had taken a harder line on issues such as executive pay restrictions , as other participants to the discussions recalled .
But he said he was ultimately satisfied with the final product put forward by Mr. Geithner .
“ We had a great and productive discussion and as a result we came up with a good set of guidelines and rules , ” he said .
“ I did n’t come away disappointed in any way . ”
The White House is hoping that its rescue plan will be perceived as a more coherent rescue effort than the Bush administration ’s , and one whose breadth and scope are so vast that it begins to restore financial confidence in the battered markets and entices private investors to come off the sidelines .
The plan is calibrated to work on multiple fronts , with promises to invest billions of dollars in scores of ailing banks and creation of a new institution to relieve bank balance sheets of their most troubled assets .
It will also renew a legislative proposal giving bankruptcy judges greater authority to modify mortgages on more favorable terms to borrowers and over the objections of banks .
Officials say that new rules encouraging transparency and limiting lobbying are intended to begin to restore political confidence in a program that has faced withering criticism in Congress , an effort that they view as essential because they expect to return to Congress for more money later this year .
But as intended largely by Mr. Geithner , the plan stops short of intruding too significantly into bankers ’ affairs even as they come onto the public dole .
The $ 500,000 pay cap for executives at companies receiving assistance , for instance , applies only to very senior executives .
Some officials argued for caps that applied to every employee at institutions that received taxpayer money .
Mac market share has been a hot topic ever since Apple staggered into ( and subsequently crawled out of ) the gutter in the mid-90s .
It has been a slow but steady climb to the point where , as of late , Apple has set quarter after quarter of records when it comes to both Mac and iPod sales .
But , as even the casual Apple - watcher knows , there are many different metrics for measuring Mac market share these days , and they often do n't match up .
Browser stats , sales figures , notebooks versus desktops — it can all get a little muddy after a while .
Here , we try to analyze these different statistics to get a bigger picture of what 's really going on with the long - time underdog of the PC world .
Browser statistics
Some of the most commonly touted market share stats are browser statistics , specifically from Net Applications .
This is because Net Applications releases its data on a monthly basis ( unlike many research firms , which track different aspects of market share ) , so it 's easy for those who are interested to follow every granular change as each month passes .
Most recently , Net Applications released its January 2009 market share data , which showed Mac OS X holding 9.93 percent of the overall market ( iPhone OS grabbed 0.48 percent , more than half the share of all of " Linux " combined , apparently ) .
Data source : Net Applications
Why they 're not entirely accurate :
The discrepancy in Linux numbers makes it easier to explain why Net Applications ' data is n't necessarily a precise picture of the market .
The company tracks OS and browser use among " member sites " that use Net Applications ' tracking services , which the company says encompasses data from some 160 million users per month .
This means that the only OS and browser numbers being tracked are those from users who specifically visit those member sites , which include the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , Forbes , and InformationWeek .
If specific demographics of users — like , say , Linux users — do n't tend to read those types of sites , they are going to be underrepresented , and similarly , other demographics may be overrepresented .
Why they 're good :
That being said , browser metrics such as these are n't worthless .
Even though they may be an inaccurate way to make comparisons between operating systems , they provide a good picture when it comes to trends within a specific OS .
For example , Net Applications tracked the Mac OS at 7.3 percent at the end of 2007 and 9.63 percent at the end of 2008 , showing more than a 2.6 percentage point jump in only a year for the Mac .
In this sense , it does n't matter if Mac users tend to visit the Wall Street Journal 's website more than Linux users .
The trend is clearly showing that Mac users , with all their unique browsing habits , are growing steadily .
Retail / vendor shipments
Retail shipments from various PC makers are probably the second most common market share statistics that you 'll encounter online .
These tend to come out on a quarterly basis .
Recently , market research firm Gartner reported that Apple had grabbed roughly 8 percent of the market for the fourth calendar quarter of 2008 , which was down from 9.5 percent in the previous quarter .
The trend looks disturbing , and it could be if it keeps up in the long run .
But , as usual , there 's an explanation that makes the numbers not quite as scary as they seem .
( Preliminary sales estimates for the first calendar quarter of 2009 show a slight decrease in retail shipments compared to last quarter .
Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster says that this trend shows that Apple is being impacted a bit by the current recession , but that the company is otherwise weathering it well by not slowing down too much . )
Data source : Gartner ; IDC
Why they 're not entirely accurate :
There are two hidden caveats to numbers provided by firms like Gartner and IDC .
For one , they focus on US shipments only , meaning that global shipments are not taken into account whatsoever in the above chart ( as opposed to Net Applications ' browser trends , which obviously include all traffic to the member sites no matter where the traffic is from ) .
Data source : IDC
Second , these numbers only focus on machines that are shipped directly to customers and to vendors / retail stores that sell to customers , including big box retailers like Best Buy , mom and pop shops down the street , and everything in between .
While Best Buy may have placed a huge order for the latest iMac and inflated the numbers a bit , it does n't necessarily mean that every one of those machines is ending up in a loving home .
This applies to both Macs and other PCs , so the fact that Acer and its sexy netbooks seem to have passed Apple last quarter in retail shipments may not actually mean that more people are buying PC netbooks , but rather that more retailers are trying to sell them to customers .
It 's a small but important difference .
On top of that , different firms track shipments to different retailers .
IDC and Gartner often offer similar — but not exactly the same — numbers , and this is why .
Neither of them are totally comprehensive .
Why they 're good : Generally speaking , retailers do their best to make sure they do n't have too much leftover stock .
After all , it 's not in their better interests to have lots of old computers sitting in the back by the time new models come out .
In this sense , it 's somewhat safe to assume that most retail shipments are ending up in customers ' hands .
What 's it all mean ?
" Over the last several years [ Apple ] has captured a lot of mindshare , and now it 's directly translating into market share , " Michael Gartenberg , formerly Research Director at Jupiter Research and now VP of Strategy and Analysis at Interpret , LLC , explained to Ars .
He said that both browser numbers and sales figures are important to consider , but for different reasons .
" Browser share numbers show what people are doing with these machines and how they 're using them , " Gartenberg said .
" You often find that , if you look at other usage numbers , Apple 's customers are more sophisticated in using their computers in digital media than Windows users .
That goes directly to Apple 's marketing message :
Apple takes the time to market to users that their stuff can be used with pictures and video , which Microsoft has ignored until fairly recently .
When you look at browsing statistics , you tend to see a bit of disproportional share of the market , but it 's indicative of how Apple users are using their products . "
Because of this , sales figures trump browser stats at the end of the day , Gartenberg noted , though no one should be upset that Apple managed to move down a spot last quarter thanks to Acer 's soaring netbook sales .
" Looking at Apple 's numbers , it was actually Apple 's best quarter , which is pretty telling , especially in a recession , " he said .
" The fact that we saw Acer eclipsing Apple means that people [ are ] buying netbooks probably as a second or third PC and they 're looking for the most rock bottom price they can get . "
For many other consumers , however , Apple continues to do well as a primary computer .
" For folks who are looking for the full PC experience , the no compromise device , Apple continues to do really well and grow in share . "
Apple is most certainly on top of its game , but the challenge will be to stay on top .
" Apple ca n't afford to take a moment to rest and breathe , " Gartenberg said .
" If Apple were to stop innovating , if the products became ' me too ' products — which is what happened in the mid 90s — it would mean bad things . "
But Apple does n't do that anymore .
Instead , it chooses to ignore the mounds of advice heaped upon it by the industry , analysts , and the general public and innovates on its own schedule with its own ideas , which has worked out quite well for the company in recent years .
" The company is executing well in an economic downturn , " Gartenberg said .
" All it has to do is keep up the momentum and it will continue to succeed . "

I did n’t bother to see the first Fantastic Four movie on its release , and I actively avoided Rise of the Silver Surfer .
Until last week .
Stuck in a hotel in Houston , I flipped through the stations and found a naked silver man flying through the clouds .
I watched with morbid fascination , taking in the last half of the film .
“ How did this get made ? ” I asked myself .
It was so kiddie - fied , so tonally inconsistent and so cheesy ( in a bad way ) .
I thought to myself , they need to shake the etch - a - sketch world of this movie and start from scratch .
Seems that ’s just what they are doing .
IESB is reporting that Fox is rebooting the Fantastic Four franchise .
This means a new cast , a new storyline , and , most importantly , a new tone .
While the first movies did make some money , they did n’t connect with fans and ran their course after a pathetic two films .
Now ,
Fox finally wants to cash in on the geeks of the world by making a FF movie that is “ less bubblegum . ”
This is very good news .
Now it ’s time to start speculating on directors , actors , and which direction they are taking this ( my guess is an Iron Man clone ) .
Flame on !
WASHINGTON , March 4 ( Reuters ) - U.S. oil and natural gas producing companies should not receive federal subsidies in the form of tax breaks because their businesses contribute to global warming , U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congress on Wednesday .
It was one of the sharpest attacks yet on the oil and gas industry by a top Obama administration official , reinforcing the White House stance that new U.S. energy policy will focus on promoting renewable energy sources like wind and solar power and rely less on traditional fossil fuels like oil as America tackles climate change .
“ We do n’t believe it makes sense to significantly subsidize the production and use of sources of energy ( like oil and gas ) that are dramatically going to add to our climate change ( problem ) .
We do n’t think that ’s good economic policy and we think changing those incentives is good for the country , ” Geithner told the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing on the White House ’s proposed budget for the 2010 spending year .
The Obama administration ’s budget would levy an excise tax on oil and natural gas produced in the Gulf of Mexico , raising $ 5.3 billion in revenue from 2011 to 2019 .
This new 13 percent tax on all oil and gas production in the Gulf would only affect those companies enjoying a loophole that allows them to avoid paying royalties on the energy supplies they drill .
Companies already paying royalties would get a tax credit .
Obama ’s budget would also place a $ 4 per acre annual fee on energy leases in the Gulf that are designated as nonproducing .
The budget proposal projects the fee would generate $ 1.2 billion from 2010 to 2019 .
Senator John Cornyn of Texas criticized the tax increases , saying they would hurt independent energy companies that provide a large share of U.S. oil and gas supplies .
“ My view is that higher taxes on small and independent producers here in America will make us more dependent on imported oil and gas while we transition to cleaner energy alternatives , a goal we all share , ” said Cornyn .
“ And it will also hurt job retention and job creation in the energy sector , which provides an awful lot of jobs in this country . ”
Geithner said the additional taxes “ can be absorbed ” by the oil and gas companies , given the billions of dollars they have earned from high energy prices .
“ The impact of these subsidies are very small relative to revenues produced by U.S. oil and gas producers , ” he said .

In this post , I ’d like to illustrate how we can use Camlp5 to build a source - to - source translator using concrete syntax .
Recall ( from Jones et al. ) that a translator involves three things : a source language , a target language , and an implementation language .
Our example will use a domain - specific language as its source language , Ocaml as its target language , and Ocaml with the Camlp5 extensions as its implementation language .
We ’d like to specifically highlight how Camlp5 allows us to use parts of the concrete syntax of the source and target languages .
Using Camlp5
Note that Camlp5 syntax has some differences with Ocaml syntax .
These are documented in the Camlp5 manual , and I ’m still unfamiliar enough with the two grammars that I ca n’t necessarily identify which is which .
It should suffice to say that my examples will be in the implementation language , Camlp5 .
I ’d encourage the reader to play along using the Camlp5 read - eval - print loop ( REPL ) , which is run on top of the Ocaml REPL as follows :
$ ocaml - I +camlp5 camlp5r.cma
More seasoned Camlp5 users might note that I fibbed a little about there being only two grammars .
Camlp5 has an additional syntax that is accessed by substituting “ camlp5o.cma ” for “ camlp5r.cma ” .
I ’ll defer to the Camlp5 user manual for further explaination of these two front - ends .
All my examples will use the “ restricted ” syntax implemented in “ camlp5r.cma ” .
Implementing the Source Language
We begin implementing our translator by settling on a domain - specific language for our source language .
Who does n’t love infix - notation integer calculators ?
Not just the Camlp5 user manual , I assure you ( see the info files for Bison , for example ) .
Why should we break tradition , and overlook this classic example ?
We can define a quick abstract syntax for calculator expressions as follows :
type expr = [
Op of string and expr and expr |
Int of int | Var of string ] ;
This data type forms an intermediate target language for the parser .
Camlp5 has lots of parsing goodies , but the parts I like the best are the inline syntax definitions and the extensible parsers .
Before we can uses these features , we ’ll need to tell Camlp5 to extend its own front - end .
We accomplish this using the “ #load ” directive .
Following that , we can define a grammar and entry point :
#load " pa_extend.cmo " ; value gram = Grammar.gcreate ( Plexer.gmake ( ) ) ; value exp = Grammar .
Entry.create gram " expression " ; EXTEND exp : [ " SUM " [ x = exp ; " + " ; y = exp ->
Op " + " x y | x = exp ; " - " ; y = exp ->
Op " - " x y ] | " PROD " [ x = exp ; " * " ; y = exp ->
Op " * " x y | x = exp ; " / " ; y = exp -> Op " / " x y ] | " ATOM " [ x = INT ->
Int ( int_of_string x ) | x = LIDENT -> Var x | " ( " ; x = exp ; " ) " -> x ] ] ; END ;
Here we have defined an extensible parser with the sole non-terminal , exp .
We have stratified the productions for exp into three levels : SUM for addition and subtraction , PROD for multiplication and division , and ATOM for constants , variables , and explicit grouping .
The order these production are defined in is important .
The ordering establishes precedence without having to declare intermediate non-terminals ( like “ term ” or “ factor ” ) .
The actual string labels for each grouping are optional , but I use them here for future experimentation with extending our little language .
Individual productions are organized similar to patterns , with a left - hand side and right - hand side , separated by an arrow , “ -> ” .
The left - hand side is a matching and binding pattern , with non-terminals appearing as labels , and binding forms using an identifier and equal sign .
Note that we can interleave lexical information as strings in the pattern .
When the left - hand side matches , the system evaluates the right - hand side expression in an environment extended with symbols bound during matching .
Camlp5 expands the contents of the EXTEND section into a set of statements that side effect the exp entry .
We can witness this by running Camlp5 as a pre-processor , asking it to print the expansion in a simplified Camlp5 syntax ( assuming we have the above example code defined in a file , “ CalcBase.ml ” ) :
$ camlp5r pr_r.cmo CalcBase.ml
Once we have a grammar , we can construct a parser :
value parse s = Grammar .
Entry.parse exp ( Stream.of_string s ) ;
… and now that we have a parser , we can parse :
# parse " 2 + 3 * foo " ; - : expr = Op " + " ( Int 2 ) ( Op " * " ( Int 3 ) ( Var " foo " ) ) # parse " 42 / 3 - bar " ; - : expr = Op " - " ( Op " / " ( Int 42 ) ( Int 3 ) ) ( Var " bar " ) # parse " ( 9 + 2 ) ^2 " ; - : expr = Op " + " ( Int 9 ) ( Int 2 )
The last example given above has a syntax error ( using the caret operator , “ ^ ” ) .
Our function parses as much of the input string as it can , and returns the last legitimate result .
We can force an exception by doing something like passing it the empty string , or an empty pair of parenthesis .
In order to force the whole string to be in the concrete syntax , we would have to add some sort of delimiter or cue to the grammar .
Section 20.9 of the Camlp5 user manual gives an example of adding an end - of - string token to the lexer and using this to ensure the whole string is in the formal language .
I ’ve purposely omitted a lot of details for the sake of brevity , particularly details on lexical analysis and extensible scanners .
For more information on writing extensible parsers , I refer readers to Section 8 of the Camlp5 user manual .
Implementing an Evaluator
Implementing an evaluator for our domain - specific language is straightforward ( for people who ’ve already seen this done a thousand times , at least ) .
All we need to do is build a function that walks and evaluates the abstract syntax data structure , along with some minimal infrastructure :
value lookup = fun id -> if id = " thingy " then 1000 else 0 ; exception EvalFailure of string ; value rec eval e = match e with [ Op " + " x y -> ( eval x ) + ( eval y ) | Op " - " x y -> ( eval x ) - ( eval y ) | Op " * " x y -> ( eval x ) * ( eval y ) | Op " / " x y -> ( eval x ) / ( eval y ) |
Op opstr _ _ -> raise ( EvalFailure ( " Unknown operator : ' " ^ opstr ^ " ' " ) ) | Var idstr -> lookup idstr | Int n -> n ] ;
We use a fixed look - up function for variables , which is appropriate since there is no syntax for assigning values to variables .
We also raise an exception in the event that an unrecognized operator string is present in an Op constructor .
If we are using the parse function from the previous section , we should never see an exception raised .
Nothing in our example stops someone from defining a new parser with unrecognized operators , much less constructing them “ by hand ” .
This possibility reflects a design choice that permits introducing new binary operators without changing the abstract syntax .
I intend to demonstrate using this flexibility in later experiments where we ’ll extend the source language .
We can compose the evaluator function with the parser to get an evaluator on strings in the source language :
value evalstr s = eval ( parse s ) ;
… and we have a calculator :
# value tests = [ " 2 + 3 * foo " ; " 42/3 - bar " ; " ( 9 + baz ) * ( 9 + baz ) " ] ; value tests : list string = [ " 2 + 3 * foo " ; " 42/3 - bar " ; " ( 9 + baz ) * ( 9 + baz ) " ]
# List.map evalstr tests ; - : list int = [ 2 ; 14 ; 81 ]
An Aside : Staging and Printing in the Target Language
A language as simple as the calculator language implemented above does not really require the same kind of infrastructure as a more sophisticated intermediate language .
In more complicated systems , we often have a set of transformers for the intermediate language ( optimizers being one example of this ) .
These transformers are simply functions that take an expression in the intermediate language and return an equivalent expression in the intermediate language .
In a system with numerous transformers , we find it useful to see what the input and output terms are , so we may want to define a pretty - printer for our language .
Camlp5 has a pretty - printing infrastructure available for building functions that translate from an intermediate language back to a human readable string .
I am going to ignore that infrastructure here , and instead try to use one of the pretty printers that come with Camlp5 .
One of these pretty - printers takes a Camlp5 syntax tree and translates it to a string .
In order to use the Camlp5 pretty - printer , I am going to use staging .
Staging involves “ raising the evaluation level ” of code .
We raise the evaluation level by translating abstract syntax into abstract syntax that constructs the original abstract syntax .
With a staging function , we can translate our domain - specific abstract syntax ( of type expr ) into Camlp5 abstract - syntax , and then feed that into the pretty printer .
The funny thing that makes this ( more or less ) work is that the code to construct abstract syntax is often identical to how we ’d pretty - print it anyway ( the exception to this rule of thumb occurs when we demand pretty - printing in the concrete or “ surface ” language ) .
We continue with this staging idea by using Camlp5 ’s quotation facilities .
A quote is a means of saying “ this bit of code should construct an intermediate representation of itself ” .
If we want to use quotation in Camlp5 , we need to extend the language with quotation syntax .
Here is an example of Camlp5 quotation :
#load " q_MLast.cmo " ; value demoexp = let loc = Ploc.dummy in <:expr< 3 + 4 >>;
From the REPL this should ultimately display the following :
value demoexp : MLast.expr = MLast.ExApp ( MLast.ExApp ( MLast.ExLid " + " ) ( MLast . ExInt " 3 " " " ) ) ( MLast . ExInt " 4 " " " )
Great , so what if we wanted to get a string back out from our quoted expression ?
We first need to load a pretty printer .
Loading a pretty - printer module registers the module ’s pretty - printer with Camlp5 .
We can reference this pretty printer in the Pcaml structure .
The following example builds a printing function that translates from Camlp5 expression abstract syntax to strings :
# #load " pr_r.cmo " ; # value print e = Eprinter.
apply Pcaml.pr_expr Pprintf.empty_pc e ; value print : MLast.expr -> string = < fun > # print demoexp ; - : string = " 3 + 4 "
From the very same REPL we can now define a staging function that , modulo quotation syntax , looks like an identity transformer for our abstract syntax :
value rec stage ( e : expr ) : MLast.expr = let loc = Ploc.dummy in match e with [ Op ops lt rt -> <: expr<
Op $ str:ops $ $ stage lt$ $ stage rt$ >> | Int n -> <: expr< Int $ int:string_of_int n$ >> | Var vid -> <: expr< Var $ str:vid$ >> ] ;
Again , the angle brackets mark parts of code that should not be evaluated , but rather construct Camlp5 abstract syntax .
The parts surrounded by dollar signs are anti-quotations .
These are portions of code that should be evaluated , mostly for the purpose of assisting in the construction of abstract syntax .
For example , in the case matching operators , we quote the application of the operator constructor , but then anti-quote to make a recursive call to stage .
In the recursive call , stage builds abstract syntax for the subexpressions , contained within the operation constructor .
Okay , so we can print Camlp5 abstract syntax , and we can stage calculator abstract syntax into Camlp5 abstract syntax .
Like the previous section , all that ’s left to do is composing these two functions :
value printcalc e = print ( stage e ) ;
Now we can test the printcalc function on our test strings , demonstrating the amazing capability of taking some code and printing a string that is equivalent under some evaluation and staging regime :
# value testasts = List.map parse tests ; value testasts : list expr = [ Op " + " ( Int 2 ) ( Op " * " ( Int 3 ) ( Var " foo " ) ) ; Op " - " ( Op " / " ( Int 42 ) ( Int 3 ) ) ( Var " bar " ) ; Op " * " ( Op " + " ( Int 9 ) ( Var " baz " ) ) ( Op " + " ( Int 9 ) ( Var " baz " ) ) ]
# List.iter ( fun ast -> print_endline ( printcalc ast ) ) testasts ; Op " + " ( Int 2 ) ( Op " * " ( Int 3 ) ( Var " foo " ) ) Op " - " ( Op " / " ( Int 42 ) ( Int 3 ) ) ( Var " bar " ) Op " * " ( Op " + " ( Int 9 ) ( Var " baz " ) ) ( Op " + " ( Int 9 ) ( Var " baz " ) ) - : unit = ()
Like other bits of Camlp5 , the details of defining locations ( the loc value that I keep let - binding ) are outside the scope of this discussion .
These locations are important for error reporting .
See Section 20.5 in the Camlp5 manual for an example of using locations to improve error messages .
Implementing Custom Quotation
I did n’t go into the details of quotation above , but hopefully I ’ve sparked some curiosity about it .
Quotation in Camlp5 provides a form of what I call parametric quotation .
In the case of Camlp5 , there is an identifier parameter to the quotation syntax .
We saw an example of identifier arguments to quotation in the previous section .
Specifically , the expr identifier , embedded in the quotation brackets , “ < : expr < “ , told the Camlp5 pre-processor that we were quoting a Camlp5 expression .
Please note that the expr identifier used in quotation does not reference the data type we built for the calculator abstract syntax !
The identifier argument to the quotation syntax references what is called a quotation expander in Camlp5 parlance .
A quotation expander can take two forms .
In this post , we only use one of these quotation expander constructions .
We construct a quotation expander from a pair of functions from strings to Camlp5 abstract syntax .
One function is responsible for returning Camlp5 abstract syntax for an expression , of type MLast.expr .
The other function is responsible for returning abstract syntax for a pattern , of type MLast.patt .
One detail of quotation not previously mentioned was that Camlp5 quotations can do more than just construct abstraction syntax .
Quotations can also appear as patterns , where they are used to match against abstract syntax .
Camlp5 provides a quotation expander for building patterns using concrete syntax , patt .
For example , we can do the following to build abstract syntax for pattern matching a zero constant in our calculator :
# let loc = Ploc.dummy in <: patt < Int 0 >> ; - : MLast.patt = MLast . PaApp < abstr > ( MLast .
PaUid < abstr > " Int " ) ( MLast . PaInt < abstr > " 0 " " " )
We already have a parser for our calculator , and we can define the expression expander function by composing the parser with our staging function .
To define a pattern expander requires us to define another parser that basically copies the concrete syntax for calculator expressions .
One primary difference between these two parsers , however , is that if we want our pattern matcher to bind any variables , we need to add additional support for anti-quotation .
The code below copies the calculator expression grammar , but adds an anti-quotation reduction at the atom stratum .
This example illustrates how anti-quotation is a property of the quotation expander , not the containing Camlp5 syntax .
Some location book - keeping is handled by a new non-terminal , pat_antiquot , and modulo changing the anti-quotation “ operator ” to a percent sign , the following is adapted from the example in Section 20.9 in the Camlp5 manual :
value pat = Grammar .
Entry.create gram " expression " ; EXTEND GLOBAL : pat ; pat : [ " SUMPAT " [ x = pat ; " + " ; y = pat -> <: patt< Op " + " $ x $ $ y$ >> | x = pat ; " - " ; y = pat -> <: patt< Op " - " $ x $ $ y$ >> ] | " PRODPAT " [ x = pat ; " * " ; y = pat -> <: patt< Op " * " $ x $ $ y$ >> | x = pat ; " / " ; y = pat -> <: patt< Op " / " $ x $ $ y$ >> ] | " ATOMPAT " [ x = INT -> <: patt< Int $ str:x $ >> | x = LIDENT -> <: patt< Var $ str:x $ >> | " % " ; r = pat_antiquot -> r | " ( " ; x = pat ; " ) " -> x ] ] ; pat_antiquot : [ [ i = LIDENT -> let r = let loc = Ploc.make_unlined ( 0 , String.length i ) in <: patt< $ lid :i$ >> in <: patt< $ anti:r$ >> ] ] ; END ;
Since the calculator language is a source language , we do not need to add anti-quotation to the expression expander .
If we wanted to use the calculator language as a target language , or build rewriting functions ( might include such useful things as a step - wise evaluator or constant folding optimizer ) , we would find adding anti-quotation to the calculator expression non-terminal much more helpful .
Given the new entry point for creating patterns from the calculator concrete syntax , we can now construct an expander function for both entry points and register the full expander with Camlp5 :
value expand_expr s = stage ( parse s ) ; value expand_patt s = Grammar .
Entry.parse pat ( Stream.of_string s ) ; Quotation.add " calc " ( Quotation .
ExAst ( expand_expr , expand_patt ) ) ; Quotation.default.val := " calc " ;
The last statement makes our quotation expander the default quotation expander .
We can now quote into the concrete syntax of our calculator without having to give an identifier argument :
# << 3 + xyzzy >> ; - : expr = Op " + " ( Int 3 ) ( Var " xyzzy " )
In this example and at any point following registration of the expander in the REPL , we are able to quote into our custom concrete syntax .
If we wanted to quote into our new language in a source file , we would have to define the quotation expander in a separate compilation unit and load the compiled module using the #load directive .
At present , I ’m not sure how much of a limitation separate compilation poses to the application of parametric quotation .
While Mython currently does n’t have all the nifty extensible parser infrastructure , it offers the ability to use a quotation expander as soon as it is defined .
Using Quotation in an Evaluator
Now that we have a full quotation expander for the calculator language , we can use quotation to build an evaluator that matches against concrete syntax as opposed to abstract syntax :
value rec eval2 e = match e with [ << %x + %y >> -> ( eval2 x ) + ( eval2 y ) | << %x - %y >> -> ( eval2 x ) - ( eval2 y ) | << %x * %y >> -> ( eval2 x ) * ( eval2 y ) | << %x / %y >> -> ( eval2 x ) / ( eval2 y ) | Var idstr -> lookup idstr | Int n -> n | _ -> raise ( EvalFailure ( " Unhandled abstract syntax : " ^ ( printcalc e ) ) ) ] ;
The new evaluator should work identically to our previous evaluator :
# List.map eval2 testasts ; - : list int = [ 2 ; 14 ; 81 ]
I propose that using concrete syntax simplifies matching and rewriting code , making it easier to read and maintain .
On the other hand , I worry over several counter - arguments .
If we were to count characters , there is little net savings in using the concrete syntax over the abstract syntax .
We reduce character count by no longer having to write out the constructor name , but we gain characters in the arguments to the various quotation and anti-quotation forms .
I ’m able to save a little more in the above example by making the calculator language the default expander .
Using quotation also requires the writers and maintainers keep a map from concrete to abstract syntax in their heads .
I suspect most people would find it easier to make sure a match is exhaustive by consulting the constructors listed in the algebraic data - type definition .
If we were to look at domain - specific optimizations , I think these weaknesses would not be as severe .
As far as brevity is concerned , I would expect to be matching more complicated source language expressions , with drastically reduced readability if we were to write them out using the abstract syntax .
I would also expect matches to be non-exhaustive by construction .
These domain - specific optimizations would rewrite source terms in specific cases only , ignoring input terms otherwise .
From Evaluator to Translator
Finally , we arrive at a source - to - source translator by copying the previous evaluator , and then quoting the right - hand side of our pattern matches :
exception TranslationFailure of string ; value rec tr e = let loc = Ploc.dummy in match e with [ << %x + %y >> -> <: expr< $ tr x$ + $ tr y$ >> | << %x - %y >> -> <: expr< $ tr x$ - $ tr y$ >> | << %x * %y >> -> <: expr< $ tr x$ * $ tr y$ >> | << %x / %y >> -> <: expr< $ tr x$ / $ tr y$ >> | Var idstr -> <: expr< lookup $ str:idstr $ >> | Int n -> <: expr< $ int:string_of_int n$ >> | _ -> raise ( Translation Failure ( " Unhandled abstract syntax : " ^ printcalc e ) ) ] ;
From the REPL we can test the translator , expecting to see Camlp5 code that would evaluate to the same thing as if we ran our evaluator on it :
# value tr_print e = print_endline ( print ( tr e ) ) ; value tr_print : expr -> unit = < fun > # List.iter tr_print testasts ; 2 + 3 * lookup " foo " 42 / 3 - lookup " bar " ( 9 + lookup " baz " ) * ( 9 + lookup " baz " ) - : unit = ()
Again , I worry over the complexity of additional quotation code .
Conversely , it feels very natural to be able to copy the evaluator from the previous section , and simply quote the right - hand side of the match subexpressions .
Doing this transformation automatically almost seems in our reach .
We ’d just quote the whole evaluator , then transform it by staging the right - hand expressions , anti-quoting recursive calls , and other fiddly bits ( it looks like some form of type - mapping might be required to handle some of the anti-quotation parameters ) .
Unfortunately , Camlp5 does n’t seem to be able to handle the step of quoting the evaluator :
# let loc = Ploc.dummy in <:expr< << 3 + 4 >> >> ; ^^^^^^^^^^ ^
While expanding quotation " expr " : Parse error : illegal begin of expr_eoi
Of course , I ’m rapidly wandering outside the limits of my understanding of Camlp5 , and a more thorough investigation into nested quotation might show I ’m not doing something properly .
Conclusions
This post shows how to use Camlp5 to write a source - to - source translator .
Our translator uses concrete syntax to both match expressions in the source language and construct expressions in the target language .
When we compose our translator with the Ocaml compiler , we leave the realm of interpretation and start building compilers .
I think such flexibility reflects a future where our domain - specific languages can both be very high - level , but also fast .
I think this post points towards “ metaprogramming nirvana ” .
I have demonstrated how to code using bits of multiple language by using a sophisticated language infrastructure .
We used a form of parametric quotation to easily switch into a source language we defined and back into the implementation language .
We did the same with the target language , which was given to us as part of the implementation language .
Hopefully , I ’ve set the stage for further investigations into metaprogramming nirvana while giving you something that is both concrete and digestible .
9/29/2020 - The content of Zim Olson and Zim Mathematics is easily summarized .
Systems Interpretations of knowledge , math , art , law object (s ) is easily accepted .
Indeed , this has been done throughout recognized history .
But the methodologies have been purely implied / explicit , and on a pick and choose basis .
Our current state of Scientific , Math and Law knowledge has been built with omission of information methodologies .
This accepted expression of expressions express- ability has given mankind systemic mis-information , truth vs false , and terminal events and / or series paradigms .
Recognition of systems concepts within all domains , including expression (s ) and / or non-expression (s ) of object and / or object (s ) provides " additional " math and logic for knowledge , math , art , morals , and law .
Available system (s ) concepts as the well utilized principal object and / or object (s ) 1 ; 0 ; 1+0 ; 1 or 0 ; 1 and / or 0 ; and a familiar system construct , image , and form ; Every ( A ) Any ( B ) Some ( C ) Non( D ) , gives our functional context ; behavioral f( x ) ; our non-stated - open - domain ; and our intersecting component as our earthly functional open domain .
This serves as our system (s ) interpretation for any identified object and / or object (s ) giving developable and / or reducible math + logic within all domains ; expression of expression (s ) , expression (s ) and / or non-expression (s ) .
My creative metaphor for this Zim Math paradigm is the “ Systems and / or Sub Systems as expressed , for any object and / or object ( s ) ” as giving a dominant mathematical paradigm .
All contemporary paradigms can be easily identified as falling well within this paradigm outline .
And all additional and future paradigms can be shown within this expression of expression (s ) ; expressions and / or non-expressions outlines .
This Zim Mathematics Systems Math +
Logic can serve as the Economic Engine of All Economic Engines .
And in a typical creative moment of Zim’s , I saw this as providing a dominant System (s ) weaponry with outcomes of principal / principle express- ability within principal / principle domains .
This outline serves also as a general systems ; principal , partial , and open domains measure of rationale .
Systems Math documents “ Jesus Walking on Water ” easily as Mathematics documents 2 + 2 = 4 .

Nouriel Roubini is n't quite as skeptical on Geithner 's plan as other leftist economists .
He writes :
The Geithner plan is not an alternative to nationalization : insolvent
banks should be nationalized and the Geithner plan should not apply to
them .
But solvent banks still need to have their toxic assets disposed
of ; and for this banks the Geithner plan provides a solution that - all
in all - is better than the alternative .
Those who dont like the
Geithner plan on the basis that they prefer nationalization are right -

as i agree - that the insolvent banks should be nationalized .
But they
usually dont give an explanation of how they would dispose of the toxic
assets of solvent banks .
They seem not to like the Geithner plan
because it would provide a subsidy to the investors .
But ensuring
participation of private investors in the risk and in the price
revelation is worth that subsidy .
Otherwise those who criticize the
Geithner plan as a solution to the toxic assets of solvent banks should
come up with an alternative that works and that is less costly to the
government than the Geithner plan .
While I 'm inclined to agree with Krugman 's view of the plan , Roubini has a point - Geithner 's plan does allow for nationalization down the road ( and it will surely come ) , a key point in sustainable recovery .
The problem is , the deal is another giant government subsidy to Wall
St where it puts in more than it gets out and gives away a huge amount for little in return .
The result is essentially a new system where Government guarantees Wall St never fails , as it socializes the risk , and privatizes the profit .
Like socialism , but in reverse .
Update : As of Sept 3rd , 2010 , this code or approach no longer works .
Twitter has taken themselves too seriously to disable a working protocol in lieu of complicated oAuth .
I am keeping the post intact for amusement and knowledge of xmlhttp works .
Twitter is fun .
You can stay in touch with your friends and followers , 140 characters at a time .
Out of curiosity I opened the twitter api documentation today to see if it is possible to build an excel based desktop client to post messages to twitter .
It turns out that , doing this using twitter api is relatively simple .
So I went ahead and built an excel sheet using which you can post messages to your twitter account .
Interested ?
Read on
Create a new MS Excel file and make a data entry form like this
You can insert the button using form controls .
Go to menu > view > toolbars and select “ forms ” .
Now select the button control and draw it on your sheet .
Excel will show a dailog asking which macro to run when that button is pressed .
Enter the name as “ tweet This ” or something cool .
Make sure you adjust the text color of password field same as background .
That way your colleague ( say hello to her from PHD ) cannot look over your shoulder and know your twitter password .
PS : if you are using Excel 2007 , form controls will be available in “ Developer ” tab of ribbon .
If you do n’t see developer tab , you must turn it on from “ excel options ” .
Press office button and select excel options .
I guess the option will be in “ Advanced ” area .
Create named ranges for your data
( this step is not mandatory )
We need just 3 fields of data to post a message to your twitter account .
User name , Password and Message .
Select each of the 3 cells and create named ranges for them .
Name them something meaningful like “ tusername ” , “ tpasswd ” and “ tmessage ” .
To create a name for selected cell , just press menu > insert > name > define ( press the create name button in excel 2007 )
Now , the fun part , writing macro code to post your message to twitter
The actual code is no geek stuff .
We will use XMLHTTP object to do our work .
What is xmlhttp ?
it is the same object your browser uses to dynamically receive and send data from websites .
It is the stuff behind all those cool AJAX powered sites .
First , right click on the “ tweet ” button you have created and select assign macro option .
In the window it would show your macroname ( tweet This ) .
Select it and click on edit button .
This will open VBA Editor .
Do n’t freak out . 🙂
Our code needs to do the following stuff :
Create an xmlhttp object
Use twitter API ’s post method and post the message
Get the status and display it in debug window ( just so that we would know if something went wrong )
Close the xmlhttp object
I have written the below code , but I am sure you can write your own looking at how simple it is .
Sub tweet This () Dim xml , tUsername , tPassword , tStatus , tResult Set xml = CreateObject ( " MSXML2.XMLHTTP " ) ' get the username entered by you in named range tusername tUsername = Range ( " tusername " ) ' get the password entered by you in named range tpasswd tPassword = Range ( " tpasswd " ) ' get the message entered by you in named range tmessage tStatus = Range ( " tmessage " ) xml .
Open " POST " , " http : / / " & tUsername & " : " & tPassword & " @twitter.com/statuses/update.xml?status= " & tStatus , False xml.setRequestHeader " Content - Type " , " content=text/html ; charset=iso - 8859 - 1 " xml .
Send tResult = xml.responsetext ' you can view Twitter ’s response in debug window Debug .
Print tResult Set xml = Nothing End Sub
Finally , enter your user name and password and a test message and test your code
If everything is fine , you should be able to tweet from that spreadsheet .
Here is a sample message if you do n’t know what to tweet :
Wow , http://chandoo.org/wp just posted a cool new way to make your own twitter client
You can easily extend this code to check someones status message , DM or message someone or analyze twitter stream .
For processing twitter data you can use DOM parser objects from VBA .
Download Twitter from Excel Application and Play around with the code
Go ahead and download the twitter from excel app and learn by opening the code etc .
That is all .

( CNN ) --
The Coast Guard ended its search Tuesday for two professional football players and a third man lost at sea , leaving the families to cope with unknown fates of the men and to organize a private search .
Loved ones of one of the missing boaters react Tuesday to the news the Coast Guard 's search would end .
more photos »
" There 's a lot of things we have to come to grips with -- we 've all agreed unanimously we wo n't give up hope , " said Bruce Cooper , father of Oakland Raiders linebacker Marquis Cooper .
Cooper , NFL free agent Corey Smith and former college football player William Bleakley are missing , with authorities believing a fishing boat carrying them and a fourth man overturned Saturday in the Gulf of Mexico .
The Coast Guard search was called off at sundown Tuesday , about 6:30 p.m .
The fourth man , Nick Schuyler , was found alive and sitting atop the overturned boat about 40 miles west of Egmont Key , Florida , on Monday afternoon .
Cooper 's father and his friend , Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Terry " Tank " Johnson , praised the Coast Guard for its efforts , but said they would move forward with plans to organize their own search .
" What we 're asking for is experienced aviation pilots " to volunteer for the mission , Johnson said .
" We are looking only for experienced pilots ... we do n't want another tragedy as we are searching . "
Johnson said he had spoken to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell , and that " we have the support of the entire NFL " in continuing the search .
Neither the league nor Goodell commented on the missing players Tuesday , but Cooper 's team , the Oakland Raiders , issued a statement saying the team continues to " closely monitor " the situation .
" We are aware that one of the passengers -- Nick Schuyler -- has been rescued and remain hopeful that the others ... will be located and rescued as well , " it said .
See photos of Schuyler 's rescue »
The team for which Smith most recently played , the Detroit Lions , said : " While we still have that hope , we have begun to cope with the grim reality of this sad and tragic situation . "
Earlier Tuesday , Coast Guard Capt .
Timothy Close announced the search would conclude in the evening , saying authorities were " extremely confident that if there were any [ other ] survivors on the surface of the water ... we would have found them . "
Watch the Coast Guard say it will call off the search »
Bruce Cooper said that when his family received the news that the Coast Guard search was ending , " It got very emotional . "
He said his son's wife , Rebekah , was trying to rest .
" She is likewise very emotional .
She 's got a lot of things going through her head , her 3 - year - old daughter , for one , " he said .
He also said despite his son's career as a pro football player , his first love was deep - sea fishing .
" He definitely got lost in his element , " Cooper said .
The four friends embarked on a fishing trip in a 21 - foot single - engine boat from the Seminole Boat Ramp near Clearwater Pass about 6:30 a.m. Saturday , the Coast Guard said .
Authorities launched a search for them early Sunday after friends and relatives realized the men had not returned .
Close said authorities believe the boat capsized around 5 p.m. Saturday as the men were trying to lift the boat 's anchor .
The men were " not wearing life jackets at the time the boat capsized , " he said earlier , but " immediately swam under the boat , recovered life jackets and managed to put them on . "
The weather was calm when the trip began , but it worsened late Saturday into Sunday , Close said .
He said he believed they were aware of the forecast .
Searchers scanned about 24,000 square miles of ocean in about 60 hours , Close said .
Authorities found a life jacket and a cooler about 16 miles from where Schuyler and the boat were found Monday , Close said .
Schuyler is suffering from dehydration and hypothermia , making it difficult for him to speak , said his father , Stuart Schuyler .
Watch Nick Schuyler 's father overjoyed that his son is safe »
Schuyler , who , like Bleakley , used to be a University of South Florida football player , was able to speak to Coast Guard authorities for a short time , Close said .
Watch Schuyler being moved on a stretcher »
Schuyler told rescuers that all four men clung to the boat for a time , but then became separated , Close said .
Schuyler last saw his three friends at 2 a.m. Monday , his father told CNN affiliate WTSP - TV on Monday .
Schuyler 's mother , Marcia Schuyler , told the Tampa , Florida , television station that thoughts of his family helped to keep him alive .
" He told me : ' Mom , I kept saying you 're not going to go to my funeral . '
He said that 's what kept him hanging on , " she said .
Close said he understood there were some plans for amateur searches , and he urged caution .
" We do n't want any new search - and - rescue cases resulting from good Samaritan efforts , " Close said .
He said Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission will investigate , in line with state law , and they may attempt to recover the boat sometime Wednesday .
Smith and Cooper were teammates with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for part of the 2004 season , when Cooper was a rookie , according to the NFL's Web site .
Smith , who entered the league with Tampa Bay in 2002 , went on to play for the Washington Redskins before moving to the Lions for the 2006 season .
Cooper has played for six teams in his five - season career .
Bleakley lettered from 2004 to 2006 as a tight end for USF , and Schuyler was a walk - on defensive end in 2006 but never played in a game , according to a spokesman for the university 's athletics department .

California ’s farms and vineyards could vanish by the end of the century , and its major cities could be in jeopardy , if Americans do not act to slow the advance of global warming , Secretary of Energy Steven Chu said Tuesday .
In his first interview since taking office last month , the Nobel - prize - winning physicist offered some of the starkest comments yet on how seriously President Obama ’s cabinet views the threat of climate change , along with a detailed assessment of the administration ’s plans to combat it .
Chu warned of water shortages plaguing the West and Upper Midwest and particularly dire consequences for California , his home state , the nation ’s leading agricultural producer .
In a worst case , Chu said , up to 90 % of the Sierra snowpack could disappear , all but eliminating a natural storage system for water vital to agriculture .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t think the American public has gripped in its gut what could happen , ” he said .
“ We ’re looking at a scenario where there ’s no more agriculture in California . ”
And , he added , “ I do n’t actually see how they can keep their cities going ” either .
A pair of recent studies raise similar warnings .
One , published in January in the journal Science , raised the specter of worldwide crop shortages as temperatures rise .
Another , penned by UC Berkeley researchers last year , estimated California has about $ 2.5 trillion in real estate assets -- including agriculture -- endangered by warming .
Chu is not a climate scientist .
He won his Nobel for work trapping atoms with laser light .
He taught at Stanford University and directed the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , where he reoriented researchers to pursue “ clean energy ” technologies to help reduce the use of greenhouse - gas - emitting fossil fuels in the U.S. , before Obama tapped him to head the Energy Department .
He stressed the threat of climate change in his Senate confirmation hearings and in a video clip posted on Obama ’s transition website , but not as bluntly , nor in as dire terms , as he did Tuesday .
Advertisement
In the course of a half - hour interview , Chu made clear that he sees public education as a key part of the administration ’s strategy to fight global warming -- along with billions of dollars for alternative energy research and infrastructure , a national standard for electricity from renewable sources and cap - and - trade legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
He said the threat of warming is keeping policymakers focused on alternatives to fossil fuel , even though gasoline prices have fallen over the last six months from historic highs .
But he said public awareness needs to catch up .
He compared the situation to a family buying an old house and being told by an inspector that it must pay a hefty sum to rewire it or risk an electrical fire that could burn everything down .
“ I ’m hoping that the American people will wake up , ” Chu said , and pay the cost of rewiring .
Environmentalists welcomed the comments as a sharp break from the Bush administration , which often minimized research about global warming .
Advertisement
“ To say the least , it ’s a breath of fresh air , ” said Bernadette Del Chiaro , who directs the clean air and global warming program for Environment California .
“ We ’ve been worried about the impacts of global warming for years , even decades .
He ’s absolutely right -- California stands to lose so much in our way of life . ”
Global warming skeptics were not swayed .
“ I am hopeful Secretary Chu will take note of the real - world data , new studies and the growing chorus of international scientists that question his climate claims , ” Sen. James Inhofe ( R - Okla . ) , the top Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee , said in a statement .
“ Computer model predictions of the year 2100 are simply not evidence of a looming climate catastrophe . ”

Merrill has discovered that a London - based trader who said he made $ 120 million last year actually lost $ 400 million .
Merrill describes this as " an irregularity . "
The trader described it as " a misunderstanding . "
FT : A Merrill Lynch currency trader has been suspended after racking up more than $ 400 m in undisclosed losses in recent months , raising further questions about the financial health of the investment bank bought by Bank of America last September .
Merrill is poring over the books of Alexis Stenfors , a London currency trader , who was suspended after Norwegian and Swedish currency trades went wrong , according to people familiar with the situation .
Merrill is in talks with UK regulators ...
Mr Stenfors could not be reached for comment and his lawyer ’s office directed calls to Merrill .
The New York Times said he had told the newspaper the matter was a “ misunderstanding ” and that his lawyer had said he was co-operating with the investigation .
The trading loss of $ 400 m would cut into , but not erase , the profits of Merrill ’s rates and currency operations , headed by David Gu , in London .
Mr Gu’s operations are believed to have generated several billion dollars in profits last year .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 ended at fresh 12 - year lows Tuesday as Wall Street failed to mount a rally amid ongoing worries about the financial markets and the recession .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) fell 37 points or 0.6 % , closing at the lowest point since April 18 , 1997 , when it ended at 6703.55 .
The S&P 500 ( SPX ) index lost 4.5 points or 0.6 % , ending at the lowest point since Oct. 10 , 1996 , when it ended at 694.61 .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) gave up nearly 2 points , or 0.1 % .
The tech - fueled average has held up better than the other major averages this year and remains above its close of 1,316.12 from last Nov. 20 .
Stocks tumbled Monday , with the Dow and S&P 500 falling to 12 - year lows after American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) 's huge quarterly loss exacerbated worries about the financial sector and the economy .
That selloff brought in some buyers Tuesday , but trading was choppy as investors considered the latest from Washington and weak reports on auto and home sales .
" I think people are at a loss for answers right now , " said Larry Glazer , managing director at Mayflower Advisors .
" Investors are mentally exhausted , and the market at multiyear lows has a psychological impact . "
He said it 's possible that the declines are part of a cycle the market needs to go through to get to healthier footing , but that , regardless of that , it 's very painful for investors in the near term .
" This is a risky market and investors need to ask themselves if the stocks they own are ones they want to own through an extended downturn , " said Robert Loest , portfolio manager at Integrity Funds .
" If not , they should be raising cash . "
He said that the recent declines are likely not the bottom , with equities bound to experience another leg down later in the year .
" If you have a time horizon of 3 or 4 years or more , you 're going to see good results , but this year will be grim . "
Obama :
The President said that at this point , " profit and earning ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you 've got a long - term perspective on it , " while speaking to reporters after meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
He said that he is " absolutely confident " that credit will start to flow again , businesses will start to invest and hire and that the economy will recover .
At an earlier speech at the Department of Transportation , the President acknowledged the brutal fourth quarter of last year , in which the economy shrank at its sharpest pace in almost 26 years .
He said that the first quarter does n't look like it will be any better and talked about the need for unlocking credit markets .
The Federal Reserve launched the much - awaited TALF , a lending program aimed at consumers and small businesses Tuesday .
The $ 200 billion Term Asset - backed Securities Loan Facility , or TALF program , will start making loans available on March 17 .
The government said a future expansion to $ 1 trillion could include some of the bad assets currently cluttering up bank balance sheets .
Bernanke and the budget : Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee that lawmakers need to move aggressively to get the economy out of its slump , even if it balloons the federal deficit .
He said that stabilizing the financial sector was key to a recovery .
Bernanke also defended the government 's latest bailout of troubled insurance firm AIG , which received an additional $ 30 billion Monday .
Bernanke said the government needed to step in because AIG 's global reach means there 's a " contagion " risk should it fail .
President Obama 's 2010 budget was also in focus Tuesday .
Both Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and budget chief Peter Orszag spoke to House committees to defend the proposed $ 3.6 trillion budget .

Police in Northern Ireland said today that they had arrested three men in connection with the killing of two British soldiers by militants seeking to rid the province of British influence by force .
The three arrested on Saturday ranged in ages from 21 to 41 .

The Real IRA , a splinter group of the IRA which called a ceasefire in 1997 , shot dead the two soldiers last Saturday in the deadliest act of violence in Northern Ireland in over a decade .
The attack was followed two days later by the killing of a police officer by another splinter organisation , the Continuity IRA .
Three men are being questioned over that shooting .
The attacks shattered relative calm brought by a 1998 peace deal which ended 30 years of violence between the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) , seeking a united Ireland , and groups wanting to maintain the union with Britain .
Politicians on both sides of Northern Ireland 's sectarian divide have vowed the violence will not derail the peace process , but many people in the British province fear more attacks will happen .
Hello !
Welcome to our Banh Mi community & thank you for sharing the love of Vietnamese sandwiches !
Contact & inquiries at editor ( at) battleofthebanhmi( dot ) com
Vietnamese baguette sandwiches , called Banh Mi , have attracted a loyal fan base like never before .
Like a musical band with rock star status , these sandwiches have an almost cult - like following of epicurean devotees .
The uniqueness of these sandwiches not only lies within the french influenced baguette , but it ’s also the flavor packed , savory Viet fillings that what makes the marriage of the two main ingredients a true love affair .
It starts with a Viet style french baguette ; usually made with a combination of rice and / or wheat flour , resulting in a very light , crackly crust and not overly dense bread .
The majority of Viet bakeries strive & compete to achieve a golden , crackly crust with just a touch of center , where most of the baguette is more crust than center .
A few other may be content on creating a Viet baguette that is a little more soft and chewy on the outside , and a little more “ hoagie ” like .
So there is a bread for almost everyone .

Buying a car can be a very good feeling for the buyer .
While buying a car you can either go for a brand new car or a second hand one .
Buying a new car can be a costly venture .
People who can afford it usually go for a new car .
However , buying a used car can save you some penny but it can be risky .
For example you may not have any warranty for a used car like that in a brand new car .
Thus while buying a used car you have to take into account several such factors .
This article can help you a great deal before choosing a used car for you .
Tips for buying a second hand car
You have to take into account all the factors before buying a car .
You have to decide the purpose for which you are buying the car .
You have to find out the cost factor of the buy .
This includes the overall cost incurred in buying and using a car .
You should make up your mind regarding what kind of image your car should show .
You should also choose the car depending on whether it will suit your lifestyle .
You should forecast the bigger picture regarding your future lifestyle changes and how the car will fit into your scheme of things .
When buying an used car you are left with so many options .
But this is not the case with new cars .
So you may have a difficult task of short listing the car you want .
Thus you have to ask opinions from your friends and others using the car that you intend to buy .
If you want a lower operating cost then you can buy a small car that is relatively new instead of buying a big car that is considerably old .
Maintenance of a big car can be costly .
It may consume comparatively more amount of fuel .
Even the spares of a big car may be expensive .
You can get good deals for cars that are up to two years old with people shifting to new cars with time to time .
You can opt for a older car i.e. 3 to 5 years old , if the owner had maintained it well .
You can opt for cars that have traveled around 15 thousand miles a year as they make a good buy .
Please do n’t buy heavily used cars as they may come with a lot of defects .
Rolling back Odometer readings is one of the most common frauds which is practiced by almost all used car dealers .
So do not be a victim to this fraud .
You can identify the fraud by looking for wear and tear in brakes and accelerators .
It may sometimes indicate that the fraud has been done .

Excerpts
Creeds and doctrines are ideas about truth , and not truth itself , and the aim of Zen is to sweep away all formulae , symbols and doctrinal substitutes which stand between the individual and enlightenment .
... there can be no association of awakening with ideas of attainment , of spiritual superiority , of success , of mastery , or of claims to any prerogative .
There are certain truths which have to be stood on their heads before they can be noticed at all ; in the ordinary way they are so simple that we fail to perceive them , and they have to be complicated in order to be presented for thought and discussion .
... you will find in many yoga texts that one of the first exercises in meditation is to relax the mind in such a way that all its contents gradually rise to the surface ; the texts go on to say that you will find yourself thinking all kinds of terrible things , things which you never dreamed could exist in your soul .
Civilized man with his acute self - consciousness has always been possessed with the idea that he is in some way out of harmony with life , that he is leading an artificial existence , that he is a lonely orphan divorced from nature , and most of his religion and psychology is so much chattering about this , as society women with nothing better to do will chatter about an imaginary illness .
For , as I understand it , myth is the imagery whereby we project upon the known , external world the ever - changing and ungraspable pattern of our own unconscious and inner workings .
Science did not ... dissolve the Ptolemaic - Christian cosmology by discovering it to be a mental projection upon the woid , but by discovering it to be an inadequate explanation of astronomical facts .
The cosmology was a myth and a projection , indeed ; but it was not so much this that made it false as that it did not fit the observable form of the screen .
To me , philosophy and religion have always been ways of expressing the sense that being alive is uncanny and strange ; and thus it has seemed utterly incomprehensible that there are people for whom they are of no interest .
By and large , however , this universal tradition of the eternal moment is especially associated with spiritual experience and with the arts - and always it carries the implication that there is some very special and splendid insight to be discovered in a kind of concentration upon the immediate moment .
It is as if one were to find out that the moment in which we live is a sort of keyhole through which one may pass into a world in which - on the one hand - time does not rush by , and - on the other hand - life is not merely dead and static .
It is to discover that the whole point of being alive does not lie in some future destination , some far - off ideal yet to be attained , but that in some very queer way , this particular instant in which we are living is the fulfillment of everything and leaves nothing more that is of any real importance to be desired .
From a relative standpoint , from within the framework of certain conventions and social institutions , our lives have purpose and meaning .
But there is another standpoint from which we are not going anywhere but nowhere , from which all the complex and marvelous creations of human culture are like the intricate but meaningless patterns of bubbles on the seashore .
For sanity 's sake we need to see both viewpoints .
Concentration in the sense in which I am using the word means , not staring at , but being centered in this one moment and not comparing it with any other .
It requires simply the understanding that there is no other moment than this one : there never was , and there never will be .
Our satisfactions are more than ever projected into the future .
Tomorrow assumes an ever - growing significance - to the degree that happiness eludes us in the present .
To say that something has no future is to damn it outright .
On the other hand , to have a future is the measure of value , and this future is what we pursue at ever - increasing speeds .
... no one can effectively overcome the mad greed of anxiety , until he has realized that the future is a mirage which does not contain the answer to anything .
I feel that there is a deep and quite extraordinary incompatibility between the beauty of Christianity and the beauty of nature .
Speaking personally still , I have always found it quite impossible to relate God the Father , Jesus Christ , the angels and the saints to the universe in which I actually live .
For God is conceived in the image of a throned monarch , and the rituals of the Church are patterned after the court ceremonials of the Greco - Roman emperors .
... the Chinese conceived of the power behind nature not in the image of a monarch but as the Tao , the course or flow , and found images for it in water and wind , in the air and the sky , as well as in the processes of growth .
In the Church , we are in a universe that has been made .
Outside the church , we are in a universe that has grown .
Thus the God who made the world stands outside it as the carpenter stands outside his table , whereas the Tao which grows the world is within it .
It is ... the marvelous quality of unselfconsciousness - the quality of the man who can think , act , and live without anxious side - glances at himself which spoil the directness and effectiveness of his action .
... a person who feels a conflict between a moral conviction and his natural feelings finds himself at odds , not only with his family or his community , but with the very root and ground of life .
This is the peculiarly Western sense of sin , of radical and natural uncleanness in one 's very vitals .
... wars fought in the defense of absolute moral principles are far more devastating and frightful than wars which spring from such ordinary human passions as greed .
... in any real adult initiation , the mystery so closely guarded from the profane and undisciplined is precisely that the absolute is unconventional , that it is beyond good and evil , and that , by consequence , we can not go against it or be separated from it .
Herein lies the identity of the two opposed wisdoms of the West - of the Church and of the secularists , of the theologians and the positivists .
Both have confused the conventional with the real - the one by identifying God with goodness , and the other by identifying the order of nature with the order of words , and this is one and the same mistake .
I am afraid it is the measure of our profound inner insecurity that we are so damnably tidy , that we cannot tolerate the presence of saints or lunatics , that we cannot really live with people who disagree with us about anything serious , that we conceal and avoid emotions , and make ourselves more and more into the semblance of Kipling 's monkeys , the Bandalog , crying , " We all say so , so it must be true ! "
The image I have of myself is a caricature arrived at mainly through my interaction with other people who tell me who I am in various ways , either directly or indirectly .
I play with their picture of me and they play something back to me , and we establish a shared conception of me .
A lot of the current quests for identity among younger people are a search for an acceptable image .
What role can I play ?
Who am I , in the sense of what am I going to do in life ?
You are an aperture through which the universe looks at itself , and because of the universe looking at itself through you , there is always an aspect of itself that it can not see .
It is just like a snake pursuing its tail , because the snake cannot see its head as the observer can .
We always find , as we investigate the universe , ever more minute things ; and as we make bigger and bigger telescopes the universe expands .
Why ?
Because it is running away from itself , in both directions .
Intellectualization creates a gap or lack of rapport between you and your life .
You may think about things so much that you get into the state where you are eating the menu instead of the dinner , you are valuing the money more than the wealth , and you are confusing the map with the territory .
" No one perceives anything , and no one experiences anything - there is simply seeing and experiencing . "
In a neurological sense , everything you see is yourself .
What you are aware of is a state of your nervous system , and there is no other knowledge whatsoever .
You do not have to attend to your body unless you are sick .
The government of your body happens automatically , going on day after day after day .
The better it is the less you have to think about it .
On the deepest level , a person can get in the way of his own existence by becoming too aware of himself .
... if you want to see the inside of your head all you have to do is keep your eyes open , because all that you are experiencing in the external , visual field is a state of your brain .
In the process of being brought up by parents and teachers , we are made tolerable to live with on the one hand , but on the other hand we are unavoidably damaged .
As a result , in our culture , it is increasingly popular to undergo psychoanalysis after we complete our education , to work out all the damage and traumatic shocks we experienced in the process .
The core of Zen training ... is to live spontaneously , and this is why it is so fascinating to many Western people , and especially Western intellectuals , who are overburdened with self - consciousness .
If one must try to say something about what Zen is ... I must emphasize that Zen in its essence is not a doctrine .
There is nothing you are supposed to believe in , and it is not a philosophy in our sense ; that is to say , it is not a set of ideas , an intellectual net in which one tries to catch the fish of reality .
As a matter of fact , far from being boring , the world when looked at without chatter becomes amazingly interesting .
The most ordinary sights and sounds and smells , the texture of shadows on the floor in front of you , all these things are , without being named and without saying , " That 's a shadow , that 's red , that 's brown , that 's somebody 's foot . "
When you do not name things any longer , you start seeing them .
Quotations
Chuang Tzu
The perfect man employs his mind as a mirror ; it grasps nothing ; it refuses nothing ; it receives , but does not keep .
Goethe [ " Fragment Upon Nature " ]
We are encompassed by her , enfolded by her - impossible to escape from her and impossible to come nearer to her .
The most unnatural also is nature .
Who sees her not on all sides sees her truly nowhere .
Even in resisting her laws one obeys them ; and one works with her even in desiring to work against her .
Lieh -tzu
I let my ears hear whatever they wanted to hear , I let my eyes see whatever they wanted to see , I let my feet move anywhere they wanted to go , I let my mind think of whatever it wanted to think , and it was a very strange sensation because all my bodily existence seemed to melt , and become transparent , and to have no weight .
I did n't know whether I was walking on the wind or the wind was walking on me .
Just when the election court in Minnesota had given Norm Coleman ’s legal team a break by reversing itself on a decision to strike a witness ’ testimony because Norm ’s lawyers withheld evidence from the Franken team , it turns out there ’s more evidence related to Coleman ’s lawyers ’ contact with this same witness that they still had n’t divulged until Franken ’s lawyer brought it out this morning on cross examination of the witness .
At issue : secret emails between Coleman ’s lawyers and the witness informing her that they were going to put off disclosing her name and statements to the other side .
Happily , Coleman ’s lead lawyer threw his fellow lawyers under the bus in explaining the “ mistake . ”
But how much of this was a mistake and how much of this was deliberate litigation strategy is not immediately clear .
Let ’s just say it smells a bit .
It ’s pretty clear the three - judge panel has had it with Coleman ’s lawyers .
It ’ll be interesting to see whether this latest episode exhausts any remaining benefit of the doubt they have in favor of Norm ’s team .
So this post explains why your gut feel is wrong .

They simulate a number of different kinds of recommender system and look at how these systems affect the diversity of a set of choices .
Towards the end of the paper they observe that some of their recommender systems increase the experience of diversity for every individual in the sample and yet decrease the overall diversity of the culture .
So I wrote a program that does basically what they do in their paper and tweaked it to highlight this result .
The result is what 's important here , rather than the particular algorithm used to generate this instance of it .
But I know some people will want to know how the results are generated , so I 'll give a short sketch .
If you want more than this , Fleder and Hosanagar provide details , my tweaks to their model are available as source code ( python ) if you want , and if you post in the comments we could get into a discussion .
But it 's not important , trust me .
The argument comes from a paper by Daniel M. Fleder and Kartik Hosanagar called Blockbuster Culture 's Next Rise or Fall : The Impact of Recommender Systems on Sales Diversity .

But it 's not important , trust me .
Each simulation starts with 48 customers and 48 products .
Each product is described by two attributes , with values generated according to a normal distribution .
So the products are distributed on a two - dimensional grid , with a value of about - 3 to +3 along each axis .
Each customer is assigned a taste for each attribute , so they also are scattered about in the same space .
The idea is that a customer will prefer , other things being equal , a product that is close to it in these attributes .
Here are two distributions of customers ( blue ) and products ( red ) .
You can see that most customers share a mainstream taste around the middle of the graph , but there are a few who have odd tastes off to the edges .
Likewise , most products have attributes that are mainstream , but there are a few " niche " products closer to the edge .
The set of 48 customers is divided into equal - sized communities , with members chosen at random so they may not be close in taste .
The recommender function chooses an item by looking at what customers in the same community have chosen .
It recommends the one most popular among others in the community .
In this particular simulation , a customer can choose the same item over and over again , so it simulates something like streaming radio more than a bookstore .
Each simulation starts off with a priming phase , in which each customer makes 75 choices according to a function which favours nearby products , but with some randomness so that they may on occasion choose one further away .
After 75 choices we turn on a recommender function .
Whenever a customer goes to make a choice , the recommender system identifies a product and recommends it to the customer .
The recommendation increases the chance that the customer will choose the recommended product .
Fleder and Hosanagar look at a few recommender functions .
The one I use works like this :
Here are the results for the two simulation runs I 'm going to focus on .
The results of these simulations are far from the only possible outcome , but they show why the gut feeling may fail , and I 've chosen them for that purpose .
On the other hand , the overall diversity of the culture can be measured by the Gini coefficient of the products .
A Gini coefficient of zero is complete equality ( each product is chosen an equal number of times ) and a Gini coefficient of 1 is complete inequality ( only one product is ever chosen by anyone ) .
And Internet World has a Gini of 0.79 while Offline World has a Gini of only 0.52 .
Internet World is less diverse than Offline World .
How can these seemingly contradictory results happen ?
Let 's take a look .
In the following graph , each dot is a customer , arranged in their two - attribute preference space ( just like in the graphs above ) .
But this time the area of each dot is proportional to the number of unique products they experience .
So in Run 1 ( Internet World ) you can see that the dots are , on average , bigger than the dots in Run 28 ( Offline World ) .
This shows the greater individual experience of diversity in Internet World ; for example , there is a customer with attributes of ( 1.1 , - 0.8 ) who samples no less than 38 different products , and only seven of the 48 customers stay with a single product throughout the whole simulation .
Meanwhile in Offline World the most eclectic customer samples only nine and there are no fewer than 19 customers who sample just one product .
The experience of individual customers in Internet World is of broader horizons and more selection , as recommendations pour in from far and wide , rather than from the limited experiences of their small community in Offline World .
This picture has become the standard narrative of choice in the Internet World - our cultural experiences , liberated from the parochial tastes and limited awareness of those who happen to live close to us , are broadened by exposure to the wisdom of crowds , and the result is variety , diversity , and democratization .
It is the age of the niche .
You can see that on the left , in Internet World , a few products were chosen a lot , especially the one centred on about ( - 0.2 , - 0.2 ) .
In Offline World there are many more medium - sized dots , showing that the consumption of products is more equal .
In Internet World one product has " gone viral " and gets chosen over 1500 times out of the total of 3600 , while 26 products languish in the obscurity of being sampled fewer than ten times .
In Offline World no single product is chosen more than 10 % of the time , and only 14 products are sampled fewer than ten times .
In short , niche products do better in Offline World than in Internet World .
While each customer on average experiences more unique products in Internet World , the recommender system generates a correlation among the customers .
To use a geographical analogy , in Internet World the customers see further , but they are all looking out from the same tall hilltop .
In Offline World individual customers are standing on different , lower , hilltops .
They may not see as far individually , but more of the ground is visible to someone .
In Internet World , a lot of the ground cannot be seen by anyone because they are all standing on the same big hilltop .
The end result is the Gini values mentioned before .
Here are Lorentz curves for Internet World ( blue ) and Offline World ( green ) , in which the products are lined up in order of increasing popularity along the x axis , and the cumulative choices for those products is plotted up the Y axis .

Individual diversity and cultural homogeneity coexisting in what we might call monopoly populism .
But do n't think this is just about automated recommender systems , like the ones that Amazon and Netflix use .
The recommender " system " could be anything that tends to build on its own popularity , including word of mouth .
A couple of weeks ago someone pointed me to this video of Madin , a six - year - old soccer prodigy from Algeria , and the next day my son , who moves in very different online circles to me , was watching the same one .
I know who Jim Cramer is even though we do n't get CNBC in Canada because everyone is talking about him and .
More people watched Tina Fey being Sarah Palin online than on Saturday Night Live , and Fey is now famous in countries where no one watches the TV show .
Clay Shirky writes an essay and I get five different links to it in my Google Reader feed in one morning .
Our online experiences are heavily correlated , and we end up with monopoly populism .

A " niche " , remember , is a protected and hidden recess or cranny , not just another row in a big database .
Ecological niches need protection from the surrounding harsh environment if they are to thrive .
Simply putting lots of music into a single online iTunes store is no recipe for a broad , niche - friendly culture .
Online merchants such as Amazon , iTunes and Netflix may stock more items than your local book , CD , or video store , but they are no friend to " niche culture " .
Internet sharing mechanisms such as YouTube and Google PageRank , which distil the clicks of millions of people into recommendations , may also be promoting an online monoculture .
Even word of mouth recommendations such as blogging links may exert a homogenizing pressure and lead to an online culture that is less democratic and less equitable , than offline culture .
Whenever I make these claims someone says " Well I use Netflix and it 's shown me all kinds of films I did n't know about before .
It 's broadened my experience , so that 's an increase in diversity . "
And someone else points to the latest viral home video on YouTube as evidence of niche success .
I 'm just going to show you two simulations .
Run 1 above - which I will call Internet World - treats the entire set of 48 customers as a single community .
The other ( run 28 above ) , which I will call Offline World , breaks it into 24 communities of two people each .
In Offline World I will get recommendations from the people around me and you will get recommendations from the people around you , but these recommendations are separate and isolated .
In Internet World we each get recommendations from all 48 customers .
In Internet World each customer experiences an average of 3.5 products over the course of 75 choices with an active recommender system , while in Offline World each customer experiences only 2.4 different products .
So the wider set of people providing recommendations in Internet World has led to an increase in individual diversity .
This is like saying that " Netflix shows me pictures I would never had heard about from my friends alone " , or " Amazon recommended a book I had never heard of , and I liked it " .
But wait !
Here is a graph of the products in each simulation .
This time , the area of each dot shows its popularity : how often a customer chooses it .

Insomniac Working On PS3 Exclusive
Employer 's Group has ranked Ratchet & Clank studio as Insomniac Games as the fifth best place to work in California - but truthfully , we do n't care .
The reason the press release interests us is that it mentions the company 's secretly working PS3 exclusive .
" Insomniac Games is currently developing an unannounced title , exclusively for PS3 , " was the exact quote from the release .
No other details about said game were provided in the release , as it goes on to blather about how great it is to work at Insomniac and such .
They 're taking all the employees and their significant others on all expenses paid cruise to the Bahamas to celebrate the company 's 15th anniversary , by the way .
It 's not that big of a surprise that Insomniac would make another PS3 exclusive .
In fact , I do n't think they 've made a game that was n't for a Playstation .
They 're the folks behind Spyro and Resistance .
The real question is , what are they making ?
They released Resistance 2 last November and Ratchet & Clank Future : Quest for Booty last August .
Unless you ’re in the Peace Corps right now , chances are the artist formerly known as Minipundit is having a far more productive summer than you .

March 10 , 2009 -- A blood test to detect elevated levels of the protein CA125 -- combined with ultrasound -- may prove to be an effective screening strategy for ovarian cancer in its earliest and most treatable stages , new research suggests .
Very early findings from the largest randomized ovarian cancer screening study ever conducted are promising , researchers say .
But it will be several years until it is clear if the screening method evaluated in the trial saves lives .
More than 200,000 postmenopausal women in the U.K. are participating in the study , which will end in 2014 .
" These early results show that screening is feasible , " study researcher Usha Menon , MD , of the University College London tells WebMD .
" But we do n't yet know if this screening saves lives and if so , at what cost .
The hope is that we will have these answers in 2014 . "
OTTAWA – The host of a Fox News show has apologized for bashing the contribution of Canadian troops in Afghanistan , saying his “ satirical take ” on daily news events has been misunderstood .
The late - night show , " Red Eye with Greg Gutfeld , " featured a panel that took turns bashing Canada .
One panelist said he did n't even know Canada had troops in Afghanistan and another said the only reason the military could pull its troops out of the NATO - led mission was because it relies heavily for security on the United States .
A clip of the segment , which aired last week in the early morning hours , surfaced on YouTube over the weekend and kicked off the diplomatic flap .
Dan Dugas , a spokesperson for MacKay , said earlier today that " no one is laughing and they owe Canada — and , more importantly , the families of each one of our fallen heroes — an apology for their ill - informed mistakes . "
Canadian soldiers have been fighting in Afghanistan since 2001 and have spent the last four years in the country 's most violent region .
Canada has lost 116 soldiers in Afghanistan .
The country has said it will pull out most of its 2,500 troops in Kandahar when its current combat mission expires in 2011 .
News of that impending withdrawal , and the army chief 's comments that the military would need a year 's hiatus to regroup and refurbish , served as the launching pad for members of the Fox panel to mock Canada .
The segment was posted online under the title , " How to Lose Friends and Alienate Countries . "
So far , more than 3,000 people have posted responses to the clip , which also makes fun of RCMP officers and their traditional red uniforms .

CHICAGO — Imagine you 've just been through a Guantanamo - style interrogation by a man in a prisoner - of - war camp .
You 're sitting in an isolation cell , when another of your captors bursts in the door , brandishing a photo of a man , and asking , " Did your interrogator give you anything to eat ? "
The man leaves , but later as your ordeal is ending , you 're asked to pick out your interrogator from nine faces .
Surely , his image would be burned into your memory , right ?
Wrong .
Using data from soldiers in a mock prisoner - of - war exercise within the Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape programs of the U.S. military , new research shows that 85 percent of soldiers chose the man in the photograph — who was not involved in any way — instead of the man who had actually subjected them to what the military calls a " very stressful interrogation " that could have included a variety of physically demanding tasks and some violence .
In other words , soldiers undergoing mock interrogations can be tricked by simple psychological techniques into misidentifying their interrogator .
Combined with other research carried out by Elizabeth Loftus at the University of California , Irvine , psychologists are closing in on the exact procedures for creating false memories in individuals in a wide variety of circumstances .
" It can be said that we 're on the brink of having a recipe for how we go about developing a false memory , " Loftus told a packed lecture hall here at the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences annual meeting on Saturday .
The study of misinformation and false memories have consistently shown that human beings are highly susceptible to suggestion .
Much of the work has focused on creating or changing people 's memories of the past .
Loftus gave several humorous examples of memories that her team has been able to plant in substantial portions of the people in their studies , including convincing people that they had gotten sick from eating strawberry ice cream or the Pluto character at Disneyland had licked " their ears disturbingly and uncomfortably " when they were young children .
The point of these strange - sounding experiments is to find out how reliable human memory is , particularly under assault from misinformation or leading questions .
What makes the interrogation research , led by Yale psychiatrist C. Andrew Morgan , so interesting is that the false memory of the interrogator was created mere hours after the experience .
Even with the experience fresh in mind , the soldiers proved highly susceptible to misinformation .
Loftus group has tested planting simple misinformation as well as far more complex schemes in her efforts to probe the accuracy of human eyewitness testimony .
DNA evidence and other high - tech methods had already created some doubt about how ironclad the information you receive from seeing something with your own two eyes really is .
The research calls into question the entire eyewitness - based legal system .
False memories implanted by researchers , it turns out , look basically identical to real memories .
Neuroimaging machines can't tell them apart and neither can researchers .
So now , Loftus and her team are working to find out exactly who is most susceptible to having their memories altered by misinformation .
" I believe to some extent we 're all susceptible to succumbing to false memories and having people tinker with our autobiographies , "
Loftus said , but a big brain can provide some measure of protection .
" The smarter you are , the more you resist the misinformation . "

Mega menus ( sometimes spelled “ megamenus ” ) are a type of expandable menu in which many choices are displayed in a two - dimensional dropdown layout .
They are an excellent design choice for accommodating a large number of options or for revealing lower - level site pages at a glance .
As the following screenshots show , mega menus have the following characteristics :
Big , two - dimensional panels divided into groups of navigation options
divided into of navigation options Navigation choices structured through layout , typography , and ( sometimes ) icons
through layout , typography , and ( sometimes ) icons Everything visible at once — no scrolling
— no scrolling Vertical or horizontal form factors when activated from top navigation bars ; when activated from left - hand navigation , they might appear as mega fly - outs ( not shown )
form factors when activated from top navigation bars ; when activated from left - hand navigation , they might appear as ( not shown )
Menu options revealed on hover , click , or tap
As the NovaScotia and Moleskine examples show , mega menus provide sufficient space for images and other rich content .
Images in the mega menu can help users select the right option .
Mega menus also allow designers to show multiple levels of the site ’s information architecture — in three out of the five examples above ( Dave Ramsey , Game Stop , John Lewis ) , the mega menus contain both first - level categories and second - level categories .
Mega Menus Beat Regular Dropdowns
We know from user testing that mega menus work .
Here are some arguments to support this empirical fact :
For bigger sites with many features , regular dropdown menus typically hide most of the user 's options .

Mega menus let you visually emphasize relationships among items .
This again helps users understand their choices .
While plain text can be wonderful , illustrations can indeed be worth a mouthful of words , as the Moleskine example shows .
Mega menus make it easy to use pictures and icons when appropriate .
And , even if you stick to text alone , you have richer typography at your disposal ( letting you differentiate link sizes according to their importance , for example ) .
Timing Considerations for Mega menus Displayed on Hover
If mega menus are displayed on hover , one challenge is to distinguish between two different user intentions :
The user is just moving the mouse towards a target on the screen , and the mouse trajectory intersects the link corresponding to the mega menu .
The user actually looks at the navigation categories and needs more information about them .
The second situation should trigger the mega menu , but the first should not .
To account for these two user intentions , do n't make response time for a mega menu be too fast : the mouse should remain stationary for 0.5 seconds before you display anything that 's hover - dependent , such as a mega menu or a tooltip .
Violating this guideline will make the screen flicker insufferably when users move the mouse .
Only after 0.5 seconds of resting the pointer on a navbar item can you assume that a user actually wants to see its associated dropdown .
Thus , the timing should be :
Wait 0.5 seconds .
If the pointer is still hovering over a navbar item , display its mega menu within 0.1 seconds .
Keep showing it until the pointer has been outside both the navbar item and the drop - down for 0.5 seconds .
Then , remove it in less than 0.1 seconds .
One exception to item 3 : The very best implementations can sense when a user is moving the pointer from the navbar item to a destination within the dropdown .
When the pointer is on such a path , the dropdown should remain visible .
This supplementary guideline addresses the diagonal problem , which happens when the path temporarily takes the pointer outside the active area .
The dropdown should n't disappear when the user is on the way to point to something within it .
In the above example , the user first pointed to the Sport & Leisure navbar item and now wants to select Haberdashery .
Moving the pointer between these two spots makes it cross the Baby & Child navbar item .
Many users will move so fast that the pointer will exit the active area for less than 0.5 seconds .
However , older or leisurely users might move the mouse so slowly that the dropdown would disappear while they 're still aiming for a menu item .
Very annoying .
Grouping the Options Within a Mega Menu
The main grouping guidelines are :
Chunk options into related sets , such as those you discover after doing a card - sorting study of users ' mental model of the features .
, such as those you discover after doing a card - sorting study of users ' mental model of the features .
Keep a medium level of granularity .
Do n't offer huge groups with numerous options that require extensive time to scan .
Conversely , do n't make the individual groups so small that the mega menu has an overabundance of groups that users have to spend time understanding .

Do n't offer huge groups with numerous options that require extensive time to scan .
Conversely , do n't make the individual groups so small that the mega menu has an overabundance of groups that users have to spend time understanding .
Use concise , yet descriptive labels for each group .
Remember the standard rules for writing for the web : enhance scannability by starting with the most information - carrying word and avoid made - up terms .
To keep words short and direct ; the base form of verbs ( " shop " ) is usually better than gerunds ( " shopping " ) .
Differentiate labels .
JohnLewis.com ’s Gift by Interest and Gift by Occasion , for example , do n't work well together .
for each group .
Remember the standard rules for writing for the web : enhance scannability by starting with the most information - carrying word and avoid made - up terms .
Order the groups .
You can do this using an inherent order among the features ( as for a workflow ) or according to importance , putting the most important or frequently used group in the top - left corner ( assuming a left - to - right language like English ) .
the groups .
You can do this using an inherent order among the features ( as for a workflow ) or according to importance , putting the most important or frequently used group in the top - left corner ( assuming a left - to - right language like English ) .
Show each choice only once .
Duplicating options makes users wonder whether the two occurrences are the same or different .
Also , redundancy makes the entire interface bigger and more cumbersome .
Keep Mega Menus Simple
The standard usability guideline to " keep it simple " also applies to mega menus .
Just because you can put anything into them does n't mean that you should .
Simplicity applies to interaction semantics at least as much as it applies to the presentation layer .
Fewer options mean less to scan , less to understand , and less to get wrong .
In particular , avoid GUI widgets and other interface elements that involve more advanced interaction than a simple click .
Mega menus are a fleeting screen presence and should n't replace dialog boxes , which are the natural home for more complex interactions and can support them better .
Among other benefits , dialog boxes have a standard dismissal method ( the OK / Cancel buttons ) , stay on the screen until they 're dismissed , and can be moved around if users need to see something that the box obscures .
Similarly — but worse still — is hiding the search box within a mega menu .
This is bad for two reasons :
The search box should be continuously visible on the page rather than displayed only when users activate the mega menu .
Having GUI widgets ( a text field and a command button ) makes the mega menu a heavyweight interaction area instead of a simple navigation menu .
Accessibility
Because dynamic screen elements always have the potential to cause accessibility problems , it 's important to code them with screen readers and other assistive technology in mind .
Even if coded correctly , mega menus can cause problems for low - vision users who use screen magnifiers to enlarge tiny portions of the screen .
( The same issue impacts smartphone and tablet users . )
With a small screen or a screen magnifier , only a small portion of the mega menu might be visible .
For example , in the JohnLewis.com screenshot above , the screen magnifier will show the first groups but not the Gift Food & Alcohol topic or those right of this groups .
The missing drop shadow , which appears on the full menu's right edge , is too subtle a signal to help most users , particularly those with poor vision .
Users may assume that the visible content is all the content that is available , and , thus , the site could lose orders if it had many low - vision customers ( a common situation for sites targeting older users ) .
Having a strong visual signal for menu borders is one way to alleviate this problem .
In addition , tiny options inside mega menus cause selection errors on touchscreens , and overly finicky show / hide behaviors hurt people with motor skills impairment .
There are two main approaches to improving the accessibility of mega menus :
Simple : Do n't bother making the dropdown itself accessible .
Instead , make each top - level menu choice clickable , leading to a regular Web page where you present all dropdown options in plain , fully accessible HTML .
: Do n't bother making the dropdown itself accessible .
Instead , make each top - level menu choice clickable , where you present all dropdown options in plain , fully accessible HTML .
Advanced :
Edit the site from the backend using a jQuery plugin that will make the mega menu screen reader accessible .
This will also require structural changes to the HTML and CSS .
If you 're a rich company and / or especially concerned with accessibility , you should implement both the simple and advanced features .
Most sites , however , will probably have to make do with the simple approach .
Conclusion
Mega menus may improve the navigability of your site .
( Of course , it 's always best to test . )
By helping users find more , they 'll help you sell more ( or meet other business goals , such as attracting donations or disseminating helpful information for nonprofit or government sites ) .

Sure , they 're just video games , but anyone who has played the hugely popular Guitar Hero or Rock Band has probably channeled a little bit of Led Zeppelin , Guns N ' Roses , or Aerosmith in their performance .
But can someone truly rock out by hitting a bunch of colorful buttons on a plastic guitar controller ?
Zivix LLC is betting some players will want to upgrade to the real thing .
The Minneapolis - based start - up is developing an electric guitar with fingertip sensors that allow users to wirelessly play and control the game .
The company hopes players will want to feel and look the part .
But the Headliner digital guitar is not meant to be just another tricked - out controller .
By holding and feeling out a real guitar , players may want to actually learn how to play the instrument and write music , said Zivix president and founder Dan Sullivan .
" There is a certain group that aspires to go beyond the game , " said Sullivan , who started Zivix in 2006 .
" They had a taste of what it 's like to be a real guitar player because that 's the illusion .
Why not take the next step and being able to play ? "
Zivix is also developing software called JamSession that it could package with Headliner .
The software allows multiple users to mix prerecorded song loops from different instruments and genres .
But some venture capitalists wonder if Zivix is making too big of a leap .
Users may love to play Guitar Hero , but will they pay $ 249.99 for the Headliner guitar when they can get a beefed - up PlayStation 2 guitar controller for $ 39.99 ?
That depends on whether a video game player really does want to be a musician instead of pretending to be one .
( First - time players might spend $ 500 for a quality electric guitar . )
" The question that comes to mind is ... why would anyone want to buy this ? " said Peter Birkeland , chief financial officer of Rain Source Capital , a St. Paul - based network of angel investors .
" Guitar Hero and Rock Band is not about playing music .
It 's about playing a game . "

Inventor Nikola Tesla invented the radio , experimented with wireless electricity , and designed a death ray .
In science fiction , his work goes even further .
We list Tesla 's greatest fictional inventions and the facts behind the fiction .

Long - Range Wireless Energy Transfer : Tesla explored the wireless transmission of energy through his work with radio and microwaves and his creation of the Tesla coil and the magnifying transmitter .
But he sought to create a system where energy could be broadcast across vast distances .
To that end , he constructed Wardenclyffe Tower in Shoreham , Long Island , which was to function as a wireless telecommunications facility and broadcast electrical power .
But JP Morgan , who financed the construction of the tower , eventually pulled Tesla 's funding .
Unable to find additional backers , Tesla was forced to abandon construction of the tower , and never fulfilled his dreams of creating a worldwide wireless electrical energy system .

The Witches of Chiswick by Robert Rankin :
In an alternate timeline , Tesla teams up with mathematician Charles Babbage and create a highly advanced version of the 19th Century .
Tesla 's perfection of wireless energy transfer combined with Babbage 's computer programming enable the pair to create autonomous robots , airships , and space - bound rocketships .

The Prestige by Christopher Priest : Tesla invents a device resembling the magnifying transmitter , but it succeeds in transmitting not just energy , but matter .
The problem is that , while the machine transports matter to another location , it leaves the original matter behind , creating duplicates of objects , animals , and even human beings , with their memories intact .

Humanoid Robots :
In 1898 , Tesla demonstrated his radio - controlled boat , which he was able to control remotely .
He presented it as the first of a future race of robots , which would be able to perform labor safely and effectively , and many credit the event as being the birth of robotics .

Death Ray :
In the 1930s , Tesla claimed to have invented a particle beam weapon , or , as some called it , a " peace ray . "
The device was , in theory , capable of generating an intense , targeted beam of energy and sending it across great distances to demolish warplanes , foreign armies , or anything else you 'd rather did n't exist .
Tesla shopped the plans around to various national militaries , but never found anyone to finance its construction .
It is n't known if Tesla ever developed a working prototype , and the plans for his death ray were never found after his death .

The United States Government has long kept secret Tesla 's most dangerous invention : a doomsday device that could disrupt all communication systems on Earth .
And it has been sitting for decades in the Australian desert .
Improved Airships : Tesla envisioned applying his theories on wireless energy transfer to improve transportation .
He claimed that electrically - powered airships would transport passengers from New York to London in three hours , traveling eight miles above the ground .
He also imagined that airships might draw their power from the very atmosphere , never needing to stop for refueling .
Unmanned airships might even be used to transport passengers to a preselected destination or for a remote aerial strike .

What ’s going on ?
This is how the researchers think the “ triple tracks ” are produced
Twenty years to the day that two electrochemists ignited controversy by announcing signs of cold fusion at an infamous press conference in Utah ( watch a video of the 1989 event ) , a separate team has made a similar claim in the same US state .
But this time , the evidence is being taken more seriously .
Back in 1989 , Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons at the University of Utah announced the tantalising prospect of abundant , almost - free energy , but their claims of fusion reactions in a tabletop experiment were dismissed by nuclear physicists , not least because such reactions normally occur inside stars .
The small quantity of extra energy they found was widely considered a fluke or the result of experimental error .
Now Pamela Mosier - Boss and colleagues at Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command ( SPAWAR ) in San Diego , California , are claiming to have made a “ significant ” discovery – clear evidence of the products of cold fusion .
On 23 March , the team presented its work at the American Chemical Society ’s spring conference in Salt Lake City , Utah , a few months after the study was published in a peer - reviewed journal ( Naturwissenschaft , DOI : 10.1007/s00114-008-0449 -x ) .

Plastic fantastic
Using a similar experimental setup to Fleischmann and Pons , the researchers found the “ tracks ” left behind by high - energy neutrons , which , they suggest , emerge from the fusion of a deuterium and tritium atom .
The team used a low - tech particle detector : a plastic called CR - 39 that is otherwise used for spectacle lenses .
When CR - 39 is bombarded with subatomic charged particles , a small pit forms in the material with each impact .
The researchers placed a sample of CR - 39 in contact with a gold or nickel cathode in an electrochemical cell filled with a mixture of palladium chloride , lithium chloride and deuterium oxide ( D 2 O ) , so - called “ heavy water ” .
When a current was passed through the cell , palladium and deuterium became deposited on the cathode .
Triple tracks
After two to three weeks , the team found a small number of “ triple tracks ” in the plastic – three 8 - micrometre - wide pits radiating from a point ( see diagram , top right ) .
The team says such a pattern occurs when a high - energy neutron strikes a carbon atom inside the plastic and shatters it into three charged alpha particles that rip through the plastic leaving tracks .
No such tracks were seen if the experiment was repeated using normal rather than heavy water .
Johan Frenje at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , an expert at interpreting CR - 39 tracks produced in conventional high - temperature fusion reactions , says the team ’s interpretation of what produced the tracks is valid .
“ I must say that the data and their analysis seem to suggest that energetic neutrons have been produced , ” he says , although he would like to see the results confirmed quantitatively .
More controversial is the team ’s suggestion for the process that produced the neutrons .
High - energy neutrons are unlikely to be produced by a normal chemical reaction , says Mosier - Boss .
So , it ’s possible , she says , they are created during the fusion of deuterium and tritium atoms tightly packed in palladium framework at the cathode .
The tritium also being a product of the fusion of two deuterium atoms .
Some researchers in the cold fusion field agree .
“ In my view [ it ’s ] a cold fusion effect , ” says Peter Hagelstein , also at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Alternative theory
Others , though , are not convinced .
Steven Krivit , editor of the New Energy Times , has been following the cold fusion debate for many years and also spoke at the ACS conference .
“ Their hypothesis as to a fusion mechanism I think is on thin ice … you get into physics fantasies rather quickly and this is an unfortunate distraction from their excellent empirical work , ” he told New Scientist .
Krivit thinks cold fusion remains science fiction .
Like many in the field , he prefers to categorise the work as evidence of “ low energy nuclear reactions ” , and says it can be explained without relying on nuclear fusion .
In 2006 , Allan Widom at Northeastern University in Boston and Lewis Larsen of Lattice Energy , LLC , suggested that the key to the process was oscillating surface plasmons – waves of energy rippling through electrons on the surface of the electrode .
They said that the rough surface of the palladium on the electrode focuses the energy into small pits , where it can be transferred to a single electron .
The high - energy electron can then shoot into the nucleus of a nearby deuterium atom and combine with a proton to release a neutron and a neutrino ( European Physical Journal C , DOI : 10.1140/epjc/s2006-02479-8 ) .
“ Electrons and protons do n’t have trouble attracting , ” Widom told New Scientist , and he says the explanation conforms to the Standard Model of particle physics .
He speculates that this theory could explain instances of exploding laptop batteries , and could be harnessed as an energy source – something Larsen ’s company hopes to commercialise .

[ looks like the Post is having fun with a competitor , esp after the Woodward stuff ]
Washington Post - December 17 , 2005
At the Times , a Scoop Deferred By Paul Farhi Washington Post Staff Writer
The New York Times ’ revelation yesterday that President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to conduct domestic eavesdropping raised eyebrows in political and media circles , for both its stunning disclosures and the circumstances of its publication .
In an unusual note , the Times said in its story that it held off publishing the 3,600 - word article for a year after the newspaper ’s representatives met with White House officials .
It said the White House had asked the paper not to publish the story at all , “ arguing that it could jeopardize continuing investigations and alert would - be terrorists that they might be under scrutiny . ”
The Times said it agreed to remove information that administration officials said could be “ useful ” to terrorists and delayed publication for a year “ to conduct additional reporting . ”
The paper offered no explanation to its readers about what had changed in the past year to warrant publication .
It also did not disclose that the information is included in a forthcoming book , “ State of War : The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration , ” written by James Risen , the lead reporter on yesterday ’s story .
The book will be published in mid-January , according to its publisher , Simon & Schuster .
The decision to withhold the article caused some friction within the Times ’ Washington bureau , according to people close to the paper .
Some reporters and editors in New York and in the bureau , including Risen and co-writer Eric Lichtblau , had pushed for earlier publication , according to these people .
One described the story ’s path to publication as difficult , with much discussion about whether it could have been published earlier .
In a statement yesterday , Times Executive Editor Bill Keller did not mention the book .
He wrote that when the Times became aware that the NSA was conducting domestic wiretaps without warrants , “ the Administration argued strongly that writing about this eavesdropping program would give terrorists clues about the vulnerability of their communications and would deprive the government of an effective tool for the protection of the country ’s security . ”
“ Officials also assured senior editors of the Times that a variety of legal checks had been imposed that satisfied everyone involved that the program raised no legal questions , ” Keller continued .
“ As we have done before in rare instances when faced with a convincing national security argument , we agreed not to publish at that time . ”
In the ensuing months , Keller wrote , two things changed the paper ’s thinking .
The paper developed a fuller picture of misgivings about the program by some in the government .
And the paper satisfied itself through more reporting that it could write the story without exposing “ any intelligence - gathering methods or capabilities that are not already on the public record . ”
Tom Rosenstiel , executive director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism , said it was conceivable the Times waited to publish its NSA story as the Senate took up renewal of the Patriot Act .
“ It ’s not unheard of to wait for a news peg , ” he said .
“ It ’s not unusual to discover the existence of something and not know the context of it until later . ”
Yesterday ’s article was a dramatic scoop for a newspaper whose national security coverage has been marked by some turmoil in recent years .
The Times admitted last year that much of its reporting on Iraq ’s weapons programs before the war was flawed .
The principal author of those stories , Judith Miller , later spent 85 days in jail to protect the identity of an administration source in the CIA leak case .
More recently , the Times has been scooped by the Los Angeles Times on a story that the U.S. military has been secretly paying to run favorable stories in the Iraqi media , and by The Washington Post on the revelation last month of a secret network of CIA prisons for terrorism suspects in foreign countries .
The Times announced last week that it was replacing its deputy bureau chief in Washington , which outsiders read as a sign of the paper ’s dissatisfaction with its Washington coverage .
The Post was in contact with senior administration officials before publication last month of its story on the CIA prisons .
But officials did not seek to stop publication of the article , only to remove information that could jeopardize national security , said Leonard Downie Jr. , The Post ’s executive editor .
The story said the officials argued that the disclosure might disrupt counterterrorism efforts in those countries and could make them targets of terrorist retaliation .
The Post honored one request by not publishing the Eastern European countries that permitted the prisons .
