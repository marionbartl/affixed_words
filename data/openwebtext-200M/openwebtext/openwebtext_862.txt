This one has been making the rounds today .
We see why .
It is most awesome / unfair depending on your perspective or zip code .
See , alleged parking hog Omar found the above note tucked under his windshield in Noe Valley .
It reads , ahem :
You are selfishly consuming 2 parking spaces .
How Berkeley .
Think next time .
Do n't be so self centered .
Space , as you should know by now , is hard to come by .
May the fleas of a thousand camels invade your armpits .
First , it looks like San Francisco just found their new Poet Laureate .
( Show yourself , anonymous scribe ! )
Second , poor Berkeley .
While , yes , it 's true that people under the assumption that they 're working for the greater good of humankind prefer treat people like crap on a one - on - one basis - and Berkeley has this mentality in spades , as does SF - is our East Bay sister really that bad when it comes to driving / parking ?
We just assumed the entire Bay Area did n't know who to drive .
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Skepticblog call to arms for an all out assault on the media is receiving renewed impetus .
My last post encouraged some good ideas .
If you have n’t read it and are as fed up as I am , please read it and take heart .
Our situation is nowhere near hopeless .
There are ways to get involved that can make a difference .
One at a time , in whatever ways we can , we will eventually reach a saturation point when the tide will turn .
The world wants change and new directions .
Let ’s give it to them and face the fact that we ca n’t sit around crying in our beer waiting for the very media that brings us yet another episode of “ Dancing with the Stars ” to wake up and smell “ The Skeptologists . ”
My experience this week was one more reminder of how being in league with magic of any sort can be a hard double - edged sword to swallow .
As a teacher of a adult magic class with a dozen intelligent students , I ’m constantly amazed with how easy it is to slip seamlessly from trusted teacher where I am “ telling it like it is ; ” explaining the modus operandi or techniques of how to use misdirection , verbal deception and all the other methods of the magician and then quickly morph into a complete charlatan by stretching the truth to its utmost limits .
It ’s left entirely to me to decide when and if that switch takes place .
As a magician I ’m actually paid to lie .
As a teacher ?
Well , … I ’m paid to tell the truth .
Or in the case of a magic class , what truth or secrets I may choose to divulge and in what time and place .
This leaves an awful lot of elbowroom to take full advantage of unwary first time students whose malleable minds have n’t yet been awakened to the reality that everything I do in that environment is likely to be an illusion of some sort .
To new students , there ’s no clear dividing line between these two roles .
Once again life becomes complicated when I tread this sometimes schizophrenic path .
Which way shall I go ?
Do I really want to give away all of whatever mystery I may have ?
Fortunately , when I spoke with Randi on the Chupacabra Cruise about this conundrum , he understood my plight and my reluctance to give up a persona that took so many years to cobble together .
All magic is an ego trip .
What mighty and awesome power I wield !
Not really .
I ca n’t imagine what it must be like to be a politician or a televangelist …
The job of teaching magic and the revealing of magical secrets gets even more problematic when , after performing some seeming miracle , I burst the bubble of belief and reveal the sometimes disturbingly banal secret .
Most of the time I ’m met with a chorus of desperate remorse that usually characterizes the moment of enlightenment that happens between enchantment and the realization that what has been experienced is some simple down to earth trick of optics , psychology or clever artifice .
No wonder science gets such a bad rap .
I ’ve grown used to hearing the moaning mantra of , “ … ohhhhhhhh , … that ’s all it is ?
Once in a while I ’m charmed by the reflective lilt of a classic “ ….ah ha ! ”
Or even just a semi-religiously drawn out “ … ahhhhhhhhhhhhh ” for my trouble .
All of these verbal reactions act as an instant eraser to the wonderment I have just moments before staged .
It has come to the point where I ’m now forced to take time out to make sure beginning magic students are reminded from the very start that after five weeks in my class , the world as they see it now may never be seen the same way again .
This has become imperative after one student told me confidentually at the end of one class session that I had , “ … ruined all magic for him . ”
Initially I felt rather bad for the poor fellow , but then it dawned on me that this was n’t really meant as an insult but instead a backhanded compliment .
I had indeed imparted a profound effect not just on this person ’s perception of the entertainment value of a simple card trick but had transformed his entire way of seeing the world .
When you understand the basic concepts of conjuring , it opens up whole new horizons .
The truth is not always pretty or what we may want to hear .
But there it is , warts and all .
When people sign up for a magic class , they pay their ticket and they are warned they will be taking their chances by buying into a new way of thinking and possibly seeing for the first time in their lives that things are seldom what they think they are .
For some this world view can involve a jarring re-evaluation of core beliefs .
Magic is much more than a mere bag of tricks for me .
It has become a way of life and it often becomes a new way of life for many of my students .
Sure , they may pick up a few clever tricks here and there , but if I have been effective in my teaching , they are released back into the world as changed individuals who no longer settle for what ’s presented to them on the surface in other more mundane areas of day to day existence such as shopping for a used car , falling for consumer bait and switch cons or not being able to focus clearly on what the right hand is doing when someone is waving a left hand full of random shiny things at them .
This is analogous to what the skeptical movement should also be about if we really believe in what we are doing .
We are not just providing an entertaining diversion like a once a week television sitcom , we should be teaching people to look at what the other hand is doing .
So NBC , CBS and ABC , … are you looking at it ?
What ?
Too subversive for ya ?
If you are n’t interested , you have dropped the ball .
If you are not a part of the solution , you are once again a part of the problem .
In the real world that exists outside the walls of the magic class or skeptical environment , we are bombarded with hidden hands pulling strings , operating complex schemes and generally running a gigantic illusion show , the only difference is that the stars of that three - ring - circus are not in top hats or pulling bunnies out of them , they are wearing Armani suits and carrying briefcases .
Lately these briefcases have been observed carrying away trainloads of cash .
It ’s doubtful in a country where a large percentage of the population believes that we owe our human existence to a talking snake in a tree that these citizens might also know exactly how many zeros are in a trillion dollars .
Hey , I had to look it up myself just to make sure – there ’s 12 of ‘ em .
It ’s no magic secret .
The info ’s out there .
Unfortunately , that kind of number think or its profundity seems way beyond Joe the Plumber .
Is n’t it just about as incomprehensible ( or unimportant ) as how The East Indian Rope Trick is done for most people ?
Are we willing to erase some of that wonderment in the face of the mess we are all in ?
We are wading through deep doo doo when “ America ’s Next Top Model ” and “ 90210 ” is the best we can do in primetime .
Fortunately in the confines of a magic class students are forced to accept the facts .
They learn that there is illusion and disillusion .
What is happening is just a trick .
As Hitchcock used to remind his daughter when she was a child , “ … It ’s just a movie . ”
There ’s a safety in finding out a simple solution to something that seems initially so baffling .
Usually any sensation of disappointment in learning the secret behind any supposed miracle passes rapidly with the next miracle that comes along .
We ca n’t wait for the next miracle in real life .
We are running on empty .
Klaatu is n’t coming folks .
Then there are those students who hold out some inward hope that I ’m really just pretending to be a trickster .
I have seen expressions of disbelief on some students faces as if they are thinking along the lines of what can happen in the more rarefied atmosphere of the seance room .
They seem to say , “ Well , … most of that was a lot of tricks , … but that one thing he did had to be real . ”
So it goes with the real world .
In these circumstances where what is presented is so inexpicable or more importantly ; the viewer ’s need to believe is so strong , we can uncover an even deeper level of human nature that may be the hardest hurdle of all to clear .
As in the case of Carlos Alvarez and his masquerade as an all knowing psychic who offered “ crystals from Atlantis ” to his gullible audiences in Australia :
“ Even after it was all revealed on the Australian Sixty Minutes TV show , a week after the Opera House appearance , many continued to believe in “ Carlos ” and his uninspired messages .
( Randi personal correspondence )
“ For Alvarez , the creation of the character “ Carlos ” was a performance / experiment to see how far he could take his creation , but his purpose was not to make people look foolish .
He hoped to liberate them from a false belief .
However , the result of the performance seemed to demonstrate how easy it is to create a cult from scratch and how , even when the truth is revealed to them , some still refuse to accept it . ”
Impossible you say ?
Perhaps .
In these cases where we face minds so far lost they may seem irretrievable , the up - side is that if we take the time and effort to do the best we can to at the very least make them aware of an alternative solution , maybe that ’s all we can expect to accomplish .
Maybe that seed of a thought will take root and the next time they think they see a UFO , they might remember it could be something else .
Then again , some people are just plain nut cases .
Institutions are full of them .
We face a daunting challenge .
Taking our cause to the masses has got to be far more exciting than fourteen seasons of “ Bonanza ” does n’t it ?
Tell me that just one solid season of “ The Skeptologists ” would n’t be worth a dozen episodes of watching Hoss Cartright tie up his horse on the Ponderosa porch ?
So get up off your couch , go to your cell phone or computer and tell them like Howard Beale in “ Network : ”
“ I ’m mad as hell , and I ’m not going to take it any anymore ! ”
What else is going on in your life ?
The times are on our side right now .
It may not last long and this time the stakes are higher than ever before .
Now is the time to act .
In lieu of getting “ The Skeptologists ” deal picked up by someone willing to break the sick media pattern we have been lulled into , consistently remind the public of the “ other hand ” strategy as often and in as many situations as you can possibly manage .
Eventually the chickens will come home to roost .
P.S. Thanks Naomi for the great pictures !

Scientists have detected flecks of undetonated explosives in four samples of dust from the World Trade Center catastrophe .
A paper just published in the peer - reviewed Open Chemical Physics Journal describes the findings of nine scientists after 18 months of work .
The paper is titled “ Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe ” .
The primary authors are Niels Harrit , professor of chemistry at the University of Copenhagen , and Jeffrey Farrer , professor of Physics at Brigham Young University ( BYU ) , Provo , Utah .
The research was initiated when Dr. Steven Jones , then also at BYU , observed small red / grey chips in the magnetic fraction of dust he was analyzing from the WTC disaster .
The scientists studied four independently collected samples of dust .
One sample was collected by a Manhattan resident about ten minutes after the collapse of the second WTC tower , two samples were collected the next day , and a fourth was collected about a week later .
The properties of these chips were analyzed using optical microscopy , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , X - ray energy dispersive spectroscopy ( XEDS ) , and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) .
After careful study of the material the scientists concluded that the red component of the bi-layer chips is a high - tech explosive nano - material known as super - thermite .
The material is composed of ultra - fine grains of iron oxide intimately mixed with nano - sized aluminum metal in a matrix of silicon and organic compounds .
While these chips are very small ( typically less than a millimeter ) tests show that the material is highly energetic and can be ignited to produce a micro-explosive effect .
The observed properties and composition of the thermitic material appears to match the published descriptions of nano - thermite fabricated at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and elsewhere .
These high - tech explosives were relatively new at the time of the disaster , with some of the first published descriptions appearing in the literature in the late 1990s .
The scientists begin the paper with an explanation of their motivation for pursuing the research .
“ The destruction of three skyscrapers ( WTC 1 , 2 and 7 ) on September 11 , 2001 was an immensely tragic catastrophe that not only impacted thousands of people and families directly , due to injury and loss of life , but also provided the motivation for numerous expensive and radical changes in domestic and foreign policy .
For these and other reasons , knowing what really happened that fateful day is of grave importance . ”
While several government agencies , including NIST ( National Institute of Standards and Technology ) produced reports on the collapse of the three World Trade Center buildings , they pointedly did not analyze the debris for the presence of explosives .
This omission is at odds with the requirement of the national standard for fire investigation ( NFPA 921 ) , which calls for testing related to thermite and other pyrotechnics .
It is also at odds with the video evidence of explosions , and the testimony of fire department personnel , more than 100 of whom officially reported hearing or seeing explosions .
NIST also failed to explain the source of large quantities of molten metal in the WTC rubble , or the abundant amounts of iron microspheres in the dust .
NIST spokesperson Michael Neuman was challenged by Hartford Advocate reporter Jennifer Abel on this glaring omission in the WTC report …
ABEL : … what about that letter where NIST said it did n’t look for evidence of explosives ?
NEUMAN : Right , because there was no evidence of that .
ABEL : But how can you know there ’s no evidence if you do n’t look for it first ?
NEUMAN : If you ’re looking for something that is n’t there , you ’re wasting your time … .
And NIST cannot claim that it is unfamiliar with the nano - thermitic materials .
Several of the lead 9/11 investigators at NIST collaborated with Lawrence Livermore National Lab , in the late 90s , to test and characterize sol - gel preparations of high - power thermitic materials .
Arden Bement , the former deputy secretary of defense who was appointed director of NIST by President Bush immediately after 9/11 , was a metallurgist and expert on fuels and materials and former director of DARPA ’s office of materials science and a former executive at TRW .
He would be expected to be familiar with nano - thermite since DoD and DARPA are lead agencies in its development and TRW supplies NASA with advanced propellants including nano - gelled thermite .
[ In an interesting side note : Bement was also a director of Battelle Corporation which was most likely the source of the weaponized anthrax spores used in the anthrax attacks of 2001 . ]
Some of the same individuals and organizations contracted by DoD and DARPA to develop nano - thermitic materials were selected by the Bush administration to investigate the collapse of the towers and Building 7 .
What the Scientists Found
The red / grey chips were found to be present in all samples of fine WTC dust analyzed to date .
While the grey layer is the subject of ongoing investigation , the current paper focuses on the red layer .
Very high magnification electron microscopy of the layer reveals a sponge - like structure composed of very small particles of several types .
By using XEDS , researchers were able to map the elemental composition of the material .
Iron oxide particles , shown as white in the image above , are fairly uniform in size and shape and about 100 nanometers long while the metallic aluminum appears as plate - like structures about 50 nanometers thick and up to a micron ( 1000 nanometers ) in length .
Other elements such as silicon and carbon were also detected in the red layer .
This is significant because the presence of carbon in the material would supply the hot gas reaction products needed to turn the thermitic material from an incendiary into a low explosive .
The authors avoided describing the material as “ explosive ” because the flakes studied are too small to assess the bulk properties of the material .
To test the power of this thermitic material , small samples were heated in a Differential Scanning Calorimeter , a very sensitive device for detecting the heat generated by a chemical reaction .
The samples ignited at about 430ºC and generated as much or more heat than an equal mass of high explosive such as TNT .
They also produced , as a reaction product , tiny metallic iron microspheres , just like the iron microspheres found in abundance in all samples of WTC dust as previously reported by USGS , FEMA and NIST .
Conclusions
“ The chips are clearly a nano - engineered material with two types of extremely small particles , each highly consistent in shape and size , held in close stable proximity by a durable matrix which is laminated to a hard homogeneous material .
The student of energetic materials will appreciate that this description matches exactly that of a super - thermite in which the reactant particles are suspended in a sol - gel matrix applied to a substrate . ” ( Jim Hoffman , 2009 )
Sol - gels of nano - thermites are described in the literature as being very stable and safe to handle in liquid form .
They can be applied to surfaces by spray or even paintbrush .
It is entirely possible that the explosives were applied to the building disguised as a paint or as a spray - on fireproofing .
Researcher Kevin Ryan has previously published a paper ( Journal of 9/11 Studies ) noting the extreme coincidence that the floors in the towers where structural failure was initiated exactly correspond to the floors where fireproofing had recently been “ upgraded ” in 1999 and 2000 .
( See diagram )
Researchers have estimated , based on the weight of red / grey chips found in the four samples tested , that these chips make up as much as 0.1 % of the mass of the fine dust produced on 9/11 .
While it is difficult to estimate the total mass of fine dust produced that day , the dust did cover Manhattan from river to river and for several miles in all directions .
The dust mass was certainly at least several thousand tons ( estimates range as high as 30,000 tons ) which would mean several tons of the red / grey material is involved .
How did several tons of unexploded super - thermite end up in the dust of the World Trade Center disaster ?

Cocaine is as cheap as ever , according to a new analysis of government data by a Washington , D.C. think tank .
The findings appear to contradict claims by U.S. law enforcement officials that the drug has become more expensive .
" [ Over ] the last two years there 's been a sustained increase on the price of cocaine , " said Drug Enforcement Administration operations chief Tom Harrigan in a recent interview with ABC News .
Harrigan credited efforts by the United States , Mexico and local U.S. governments .
But the retail price for cocaine in 2007 , the most recent year studied , was less than half what it was in 1984 , when Jay McInerney 's novel of a coke - addled Manhattanite , " Bright Lights , Big City , " was first published , according to the report by the policy group Washington Office on Latin America , which cited a newly - released analysis by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy .
The cocaine market portrayed by the report contrasts with boasts made by the Drug Enforcement Administration last year that cocaine prices were soaring in part due government counterdrug efforts , experts say .
" It 's roughly in line with the trend we see with most other illegal drugs , and undermines the government 's claim they 're making it more difficult to purchase " such substances , said journalist Ryan Grim , whose book on American drug policy , " This is Your Country on Drugs : The Secret History of Getting High in America , " publishes in June .
The DEA did not respond with comment for this story .
Cocaine prices do spike from time to time , said John Walsh , the drug policy expert with the D.C. - based Washington Office on Latin America who authored the study .
But he noted the long - term trend shows prices steadily declining .
Cocaine Market Remains Constant
The market for cocaine in the United States appears to have remained constant over the years , and the product 's purity has slightly improved , Walsh said .
His group advocates " harm reduction " strategies , including boosting treatment of drug abusers , to curb the nation 's drug problem .
Walsh credits competition among cocaine suppliers and more sophisticated trafficking techniques for keeping prices low and quality up .
" It 's become efficient , " Walsh said of the cocaine industry .
" Over time the market has become entrenched and mature . "
One possible example of the sophisticated techniques that keep prices low : ABC News reported last week how Mexican cartels were smuggling cocaine by the truckload into the U.S.
" They do operate with a business - like efficiency , " one DEA official told ABC News of the smugglers .
Walsh noted that although the ONDCP report was released earlier this year by the Obama White House , the document shows it was completed last July under the Bush administration .

Rights groups appeal to Americas for support in Bush torture probes Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday March 20 , 2009
Print This Email This Update at bottom : OAS panel receptive to rights groups
Without sufficient domestic political support in their calls for criminal investigations into the Bush administration , rights groups are taking their message to a much bigger audience - all 35 member states of the Americas - who they hope will pressure President Obama and Congress into action .
A subcommittee of the Organization of American States called the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights will hold a hearing on Friday on calls for accountability for torture and other human rights abuses committed by the U.S. government .
The hearing is part of a series of meetings that OAS will hold in Washington , DC over the next two - weeks
In a conference call with reporters Friday morning , the American Civil Liberties Union , The Center for Constitutional Rights and Human Rights USA , groups that will be testifying at the hearing , made the case for the need for criminal prosecutions specifically .
Colleen Costello , an anti-terrorism attorney for Human Rights USA , said there is a legal obligation that the United States owes under international and domestic law to investigate and prosecute those that approved interrogation tactics of enemy combatants such as water boarding and prolonged stress standing , which the International Red Cross concluded constitute torture and inhumane or degrading treatment .
Investigations are needed at the highest levels , Costello said , because both former President George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have gone on the record as approving water boarding .
 Recently in January , former President Bush admitted that he authorized the use of water boarding on Khalid Sheikh Muhammad and Dick Cheney admitted that he approved water boarding for three detainees ,  Costello said .
Michael Ratner , president of the Center for Constitutional Rights and a human rights attorney , said one of the main obstacles that needs to be overcome , if there are to be any criminal investigations , is a lack of political will .
Statements by President Obama that he wants to look forward and not backward are disingenuous ,  Ratner said .
 Accountability for torture is looking forward ,  he said , adding that it will ensure that it is less likely to happen again in the U.S .
Another chief obstacle to criminal prosecutions is the 2006 Military Commissions Act , says Ratner .
Major issues with the Military Commissions
Are that it prohibits aliens who were one time classified as enemy combatants from suing civilly for damages for anything that happened to them while they were detained ,  he said .
Ratner says the act essentially immunized  those officials in the government who authorized the questionable interrogation tactics .
 It is a big weight around the neck of people ,  Ratner said , adding it is very clearly a legal obstacle that will need to be repealed by Congress if criminal prosecutions are to ever go forward .
Jamil Dakwar , director of the American Civil Liberties Union Human Rights Program , said his organization also wants to see investigations into Bush practices , that while not rising to the level of criminal under U.S. law , are still ethically questionable such as ethnic and racial profiling , warrantless wiretapping , the spying on of domestic anti-war groups and the holding of enemy combatants without charges .
Any recommendations offered by OAS on requests for criminal prosecutions are not legally binding to the U.S. government .
 We are hopeful that with the statements the Obama administration has made , that they want to be more engaged with the international community that they will be much more respectful of the recommendations that the commission makes ,  Costello said .
Rights groups are asking OAS to issue specific recommendations to the U.S. on criminal investigations , the reforming of certain laws that would preclude any kind of criminal prosecutions or other legal accountability measures from going forward and the putting in place of measures that would allow detainees to pursue reparations ( including financial ) for their alleged abuse at the hands of the government .
Obstacles in Military Commissions
Act outlined Members of the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States appeared to be receptive to the message of rights groups on the need for criminal prosecutions at Fridays hearing .
 I think what the United States will do about its recent past will be a very strong message , not only for the Americas , but I think for all of the world ,  said IACHR member Paulo Sergio Pinheiro .
 I think its very meaningful , this hearing , not only because of what we have heard from the petitions , but also from the new kind of commitment from the government of the United States to deal with these disastrous practices . 
Lewis Amselem , U.S. deputy permanent representative to OAS , did not address the calls for criminal prosecution made at the hearing by rights groups but highlighted steps taken by President Obama to correct past wrongs of the Bush administration , such as ordering the closure of Guantanamo Bay and requiring that all interrogation tactics be in compliance with the Army Field Manuel .
 Were here primarily today to listen to the presentations and your comments ,  Amselem told the IACHR panel , adding that he would be sharing the afternoons proceedings with various relative authorities for their review . 
When asked by the panel , Amselem also promised he would provide them with the Obama administration 's official position on Sen.
Patrick Leahy 's proposed fact - finding Truth Commission .
In his testimony to the panel , Ratner talked at length of the five legal challenges to criminal prosecutions posed by the Military Commissions Act , which he called the self - immunity act . 
Ratner said under the act , no person may invoke the Geneva Conventions as a source of rights , enemy combatants are denied the right of habeas corpus and non-citizens are not allowed to bring reparations cases forward , even if they were tortured .
That provision was made retroactive to 2001 .
The Military Commissions
Act also narrows the scope of criminal liability , retroactively to 1997 , to take away many criminal violations that would normally fall under Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions , Ratner said .
Finally the act makes an affirmative defense of legal advice provided by the now widely discarded and discredited Office of Legal Counsel memos .
While noting that he was glad to see President Obama order the closure of Guantanamo , Ratner noted that it was done with an executive order and was something that could be reversed by a later president .
 What Obama did can be undone by the next president in the next crisis ,  he said , adding that criminal prosecutions are the only true deterrent the U.S. has in making sure that torture never happens again .

Pigasus Awards for 2008 Announced
Every year , on the appropriate date of April 1 , the James Randi Educational Foundation ( JREF ) gives out the Pigasus Awards , a dubious honor to people or organizations that have done their best in the past year to snuff out science and promote irrationality .
The award is named after the beloved mascot of the JREF because , after all , when paranormal powers are proven , pigs will fly .
The five categories of the Pigasus Award are :
1 . To the Scientist who said or did the silliest thing relating to occult , supernatural , or paranormal subjects in the preceding twelve months .
2 . To the Funding Organization that supports the most useless study related to the occult , supernatural , or paranormal during the year .
3 . To the Media outlet that reported as fact the most outrageous occult , supernatural , or paranormal claim .
4 . To the Performer who fooled the greatest number of people with the least effort in that twelve - month period .
5 . For the most persistent refusal to face reality .
This year 's ( dis ) honorees are :
1 ) Dr. Colin Ross , who claims he can shoot electromagnetic radiation from his eyes ;
2 ) The Producers of the movie " Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed " ;
3 ) Late night cable TV stations ;
4 ) Jenny McCarthy ; who has written books and appeared on countless TV shows promoting measles ; and
5 ) Kevin Trudeau ; who sold quack books even after the government fined him for it .
Details of these prestigious fakers are below .
They receive no actual trophy , no prize money , no plaque ; just the publicity they generally seek , though perhaps not in the way they want it .
1 ) Dr. Colin Ross is a psychiatrist in Texas .
He is a lettered man , having published many articles in peer - reviewed journals , and you might think he would be the last person to earn a Pigasus ... until you look a bit deeper .
Dr. Ross claims that he can send electromagnetic beams out of his eyes .
Now , to be fair , this was long thought to be how vision worked ... in the Middle Ages .
However , we now understand that light emitted or reflected by external objects enters the eye , and that 's how we see .
But Dr. Ross claims to have reversed this process , and not only can he send EM beams from his eyes , but he has rigged up a system to detect it .
He applied for our famous Million Dollar Challenge with this idea , and when we sent it to our team of experts , they objected , saying it was the movements of Dr. Ross 's eyes that triggered his system .
He has since put his application on hold while he works on this , still claiming , of course , that there is " definitely a beam " emerging from his eyes .
[ It has come to our attention after posting this originally that Dr. Ross has re-activated his application .
- Ed. ]
Oh , and did we mention he 's writing a book on this as well ?
Or maybe you already guessed that -- but even if you did , you do n't win the million .

2 ) The Producers of " Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed " : Logan Craft , Walter Ruloff , and John Sullivan .
" Expelled " was a movie destined for this award .
Its premise was to show that Intelligent Design -- a rebranding of young Earth creationism in an attempt to circumvent multiple court decisions not to teach religion in public schools -- is a viable alternative to evolution , and that ID is being actively censored in academia .
Hosted by Ben Stein , the movie was an atrocious web of distortions , ridiculous accusations , bad logic , and out - and - out falsehoods .
They interviewed several notable academicians , including Richard Dawkins , PZ Myers , and Genie Scott under false pretenses so that they could get quotations used out of context , and then spun it all into a movie so truly awful that The Onion 's famed AV Club said it was " odious " and one of the worst movies of 2008 .
Roger Ebert penned a tour - de - force debunking of the movie for his Chicago Sun - Times column as well , a must - read evisceration that slam dunks " Expelled " into the dust bin of Hollywood .
So , to the producers of " Expelled " goes the Pigasus , and a little free advice : next time , invest in a project that has a more grounded basis in reality .
Perhaps unicorns , fairies , or Atlantis .

3 ) If you watch TV late at night , you 're no stranger to woowoo infomercials , which pitch everything from psychic hotlines to pills which will increase , um , various parts of your body ( also , see # 5 below ) .
This has been true for years , but recently things took an odd turn .
You may be familiar with Enzyte , the " male enhancement " " supplement " , shilled by Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals , which used the irritating " Smiling Bob " commercials .
In September 2008 , the company 's CEO and founder , Steve Warshak , and his mother , Harriet Warsjhak , were found guilty of conspiracy to commit all kinds of fraud .
They were thrown in jail , had to forfeit half a billion dollars in assets , and went bankrupt .
Case closed , right ?
Wrong .
The Smiling Bob Enzyte commercials are still running .
If you watch Comedy Central , for example , they shows these ads nearly every commercial break .
Maybe they should win an award for talking to the dead .
So , for years of promulgating pseudoscientific piffle , the Pigasus goes to the TV cable industry .

4 ) Jenny McCarthy is well known as a model and actor , but in recent days she 's getting far more publicity for her stance that vaccines cause autism .
She has a son who may be autistic , and of course we are sympathetic to her plight .
But that can only go so far when Ms. McCarthy appears on endless chat shows , is interviewed in magazine articles , and even writes books encouraging people not to vaccinate their children .
Numerous , well - done studies have shown conclusively that there is no causal link between vaccines and the onset of autistic spectrum disorders ( ASD ) - the claim that they are connected is spurious , based on anecdotes and the fact that vaccines are given to children around the same time that ASD symptoms begin to appear .
The antivaccination movement has been directly linked with outbreaks of various vaccine - preventable diseases such as measles , and there have been numerous illnesses and even deaths associated with these outbreaks .
The facts are in , and have been for quite some time : vaccines are an overwhelming modern medical success story , having eradicated such scourges as smallpox , and hugely lowering rates of other diseases such as measles , mumps , rubella , polio , influenza , and diptheria .
The evidence is also overwhelmingly against any link between vaccines and autism as well .
Yet all that evidence has been overturned in the public 's mind with ease and alacrity by Ms. McCarthy , so she wins the Pigasus award for her contribution to the country 's ill - health .
NOTE : At The Amaz!ng Meeting 7 in Las Vegas on July 9 , we will be sponsoring a vaccination clinic to help the children in the area get the shots they need to stay healthy .
Las Vegas has some of the lowest vaccination rates in the US , and this clinic is critically needed .

5 ) If you watch late - night cable TV , you could hardly have missed our final Pigasus awardee , Kevin Trudeau .
He hit the airwaves in the 1990s shilling his book " Natural Cures ' They ' Don't Want You to Know About " , where he claimed eating coral calcium cured cancer .
Alliteration aside , in 1998 a court ordered him to stop making this false claim , and in 2003 the Federal Trade Commission charged that he knowingly violated the 1998 order .
So he 's been nailed twice for lying in his ads and has had to pay hefty fees and fines due to them ... which is why it 's even more astonishing that in 2008 he was charged once again for false claims , this time about his book " The Weight Loss Cure ‘ They ’ Do n’t Want You to Know About " .
And it would be cruel of us to mention the two years he spent in federal prison for credit card fraud as well , so we 'll leave that be .
In his informercials , Trudeau claims the diet in his book is easy to do , and " ultimately allows readers to eat whatever they want . "
It turns out this is not really quite true , and instead the book advocates severe dieting , taking non-FDA approved drugs , and maintaining the diet for life .
Because of this small breach of reality , and also his past violations , the FTC fined him a whopping $ 37 million !
While we applaud the FTC and are glad of the huge sum , we do n't think that will replace the lives of the people who read his book and believed the snake oil he knew he was selling .
Caveat emptor always applies , certainly , but in this case that does n't extend to out - and - out fraud .
So Kevin Trudeau is the recipient of the Pigasus for purposely and with contempt storming right through several FTC court - ordered fines and convictions .
Perhaps his next book will be " Felonious Actions ' I ' Do n't Want You to Know About . "

Nightmares and night terrors are usually associated with the dreams causing the feelings of extreme anxiety , distress or terror , making the sleeper wake up in fear and unable to go back to sleep again for a long period of time .
Stresses and conflicts , psychological pressure and anxiety , illnesses and side - effects of taking certain medicines , excessive violence in modern mass media and other various conditions are among the most common reasons of experiencing nightmares and restless dreams .
Unfortunately , a lot of young children and teenagers also suffer from nightmares that frequently brings to many traumatic and harmful effects , such as developing psychological and mental disorders , increased heart rate , excessive sweating , problems with memory , extreme sensitivity and permanent confusion , problems in personal and social development , and so on .
That is why it is extremely important to learn how to reduce negative effects of nightmares , and herbal remedies can be very helpful for all children and adults who need to improve the quality of sleep .
In traditional Oriental medicine night terrors and nightmares were strictly linked to heart imbalances .
Tired of the problems and stresses , our heart experiences a sort of overheat , which can rise up to our head and disturb our mind causing nightmares and bad dreams .
Natural remedies for prevention and management of nightmares and night terrors include various herbal tinctures , solutions and pills , as well as essential oils aiding to create a feeling of calm , comfort and relaxation , as well as promote long term sleep .
It is possible to use sedative properties of Chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ) , Valerian root ( Valeriana Officinalis ) , Lemon Balm ( Melissa Officinalis ) , Passion Flower ( Passiflora Incarnata ) and St. John ’s Wort ( Hypericum Perforatum ) to relieve nervous restlessness , improve sleep and get rid of irritability , restlessness and nightmares .
Siberian Ginseng can not only be useful for fatigue and stress related problems , but also can normalize your immune system , fix your hormonal imbalances and have excellent rejuvenating effects .
Besides , using essential oils for aromatherapy can help achieve perfect relaxing and calming effects .
Finally , it is important to create a good environment for restful and long term night ’s sleep .
Hi !
My name is Carla and I am a 5th year medical student at HYMS .
I am interested in alternative medicine and I have done months researching the topic of herbal medicine .
Besides , I like interviewing people and learning more about their experiences with one or another type of herbal treatments .
I am willing to contribute to this site with my knowledge , and I would be happy to help you out to the best of my ability with any specific questions or problems related to alternative medicine .
As I mentioned before , after writing a python script to read in Kada ’s data files on the rifle club shooters ’ scores and calculate new ladders , the next step is output that ’s a bit fancier than the straight ASCII text dump :
Novice Air Ladder - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 Joe D'Plumber 45 91.833 94 2 Joe D'Plumber 36 87.500 91 3 Joe D'Plumber 18 87.167 92 4 Joe D'Plumber 16 85.833 91 5 Joe D'Plumber 26 85.167 92 6 Joe D'Plumber 31 81.167 87 Tito D'Builder 2 76.000 76 * 7 Joe D'Plumber 7 74.000 82 Tito D'Builder 2 69.000 75 * Tito D'Builder 2 67.000 68 * Tito D'Builder 2 66.000 70 * Tito D'Builder 1 64.000 64 * 8 Joe D'Plumber 10 63.167 78 Tito D'Builder 1 62.000 62 * 9 Joe D'Plumber 4 61.750 76 Tito D'Builder 2 61.500 72 * Tito D'Builder 1 60.000 60 * Tito D'Builder 2 55.500 71 * Tito D'Builder 2 55.000 58 * 10 Joe D'Plumber 3 53.667 62 Tito D'Builder 1 52.000 52 * Tito D'Builder 1 50.000 50 * Tito D'Builder 1 49.000 49 *
This does the basic job that the original system did ( actually , it does a bit more – the asterisks mark out those shooters who have n’t yet shot enough cards to get on the ladder , but they ’re still listed as an incentive for them to shoot more cards – the current system does n’t do this ) .
It ’s not really doing all that can be done , however , and it ’s certainly not all that fancy - looking .
Especially in a scripting language , where the whole point is to do fancy stuff quickly through toolkits .
So , what I wanted was PDF output ( because these are printed off and posted up in the club ) , graphics like logos and so on , but also some graphs and charts with some meaningful data .
One of the graphs I wanted to include was one of Edward Tufte ’s many good ideas , sparklines .
Small graphs which summarise the state of play of a variable in an easy to read , inline format ( meaning that it ’s in the flow of the text itself as if english had suddenly become a pictographic language for a moment .
They seemed perfect to show a high - level view of how the shooters were doing over the course of the year .
Also , it would be nice to display the various breakdowns and analysis of membership ( by gender , experience , college year , etc ) in a graphical form – there ’s nothing wrong with the raw data , but it ’s almost always easier and faster to take in analysis that has a graphical expression .
So pie charts and such would be an improvement .
Right , so I need a PDF generation library and a graphing library , and after some casting about and looking up different options , I settled on ReportLab to generate the PDF because it could do both high and low level generation ( more on that in a moment ) and because it has some well - written documentation .
For the graphs and charts , MatPlotLib seemed to have the best combination of documentation and features ( though there are others with wide followings ) .
I ’ll write a bit more about MatPlotLib in a future post and just focus on ReportLab for now .
PDF generation turns out to be conceptually very easy with ReportLab , both at high and low levels .
At low level , the page is a canvas and you simply draw lines and place text on it using the pdfgen section of the library .
I ’d guess it would be very useful for small jobs , or for fine detail ; but for this project pdfgen ’s a bit too fine - grained .
Reportlab ’s high level document creation model platypus ( Page Layout and Typography Using Scripts ) is more like it – it ’s based on the TeX model of creating documents ( ie. specify the content , let the software do the layout properly for you ) .
In this case , I want two documents , one for the actual ladders and one for the analysis and breakdowns of membership numbers .
Platypus requires that you create an actual document object ( in this case I use their base template , but custom templates are possible too ) , and each document will require you to create and populate a list of elements within that document , as well as any layout information , before generating the document itself .
So to start with , two lists , two document objects , and setting of some basic layout stuff :
def prepareReport ( ) : LadderDocElements=[ ] ReportDocElements= [ ] ladderDoc = platypus.BaseDocTemplate(' ladders.pdf ' ) ladderDoc.leftMargin = 0.5* inch ladderDoc.rightMargin = 0.5* inch ladderDoc.topMargin = 0.5*inch ladderDoc.bottomMargin = 0.5*inch ladderDoc.width = ladderDoc.pagesize[0 ] - ladderDoc.leftMargin - ladderDoc.rightMargin ladderDoc.height = ladderDoc.pagesize[ 1 ] - ladderDoc.topMargin - ladderDoc.bottomMargin reportDoc = platypus.BaseDocTemplate('report.pdf ' ) reportDoc.leftMargin = 0.5* inch reportDoc.rightMargin = 0.5* inch reportDoc.topMargin = 0.5*inch reportDoc.bottomMargin = 0.5*inch reportDoc.width = reportDoc.pagesize[0 ] - reportDoc.leftMargin - reportDoc.rightMargin reportDoc.height = reportDoc.pagesize [ 1 ] - reportDoc.topMargin - reportDoc.bottomMargin
Nice and simple .
Two lists of elements , one for each document ( LadderDocElement and ReportDocElement ) ; two actual Document objects ; and some basic margin setup .
There is some additional setup to arrange the layout of frames on the page that the elements will plug into , and it looks a little complex because I ’ve got two different layouts ( one and two column ) , but to be honest the lack of readability is more down to formatting issues than code complexity :
interFrameMargin = 0.5 * inch frameWidth = ladderDoc.width/2 - interFrameMargin/2 frameHeight = ladderDoc.height - inch*0.6 framePadding = 0 * inch frames = [ ] leftMargin = ladderDoc.leftMargin titlebar = platypus .
Frame ( leftMargin , ladderDoc.height , ladderDoc.width , 0.75*inch , leftPadding=0 , rightPadding=0 , topPadding=0 , bottom Padding=0 , showBoundary=1 ) frames.append( titlebar ) column = platypus .
Frame( leftMargin , ladderDoc.bottomMargin , frameWidth , frameHeight ) frames.append( column ) leftMargin = ladderDoc.leftMargin + frameWidth + interFrameMargin column = platypus .
Frame( leftMargin , ladderDoc.bottomMargin , frameWidth , frameHeight ) frames.append( column ) soloframe = platypus .
Frame( ladderDoc.leftMargin , ladderDoc.bottomMargin , ladderDoc.width , ladderDoc.height )
So we have frames and soloframe , the former a two - column layout with a titlebar , the latter a single frame taking up the whole of the page between the margins .
Later on in the file ( which is now in dire need of refactoring for readability ’s sake , which is the next thing on the project to - do list ) , those frame layouts are fed into the document objects and the document generated .
There ’s also a helper function or two defined within prepareReport ( ) to manage simple tasks like header text and preformatted chunks , these are mainly left over from swiped demo code , but they do show rather well how text gets added into the document .
def header ( Elements , txt , style=HeaderStyle , klass=platypus .
Paragraph , sep=0.3 ) : s = platypus .
Spacer( 0.2*inch , sep*inch ) Elements.append(s ) style.alignment=1 style.fontName='Helvetica-Bold ' style.fontSize=18 para = klass ( txt , style ) Elements.append ( para ) def pre( txt ) : s = platypus .
Spacer( 0.1*inch , 0.1 * inch ) p = Preformatted ( txt , PreStyle ) precomps = [ s , p ] result = KeepTogether ( precomps ) return result
That ’s pretty much boilerplate sort of stuff , not hugely complicated .
A handy point is the showBoundary option , which shows the outlines of frames ( handy for initial design work ) .
ladderDoc.showBoundary = True
Once all that boilerplate and intial layout work is done , it ’s just a matter of adding elements to the various documents , which consists mainly of repeated chunks of code like this :
header ( LadderDocElements , ' Air Rifle Ladders ' , sep=0 ) header ( LadderDocElements , str(datetime.date.today ( ) ) , sep=0 ) LadderDocElements.append(platypus.FrameBreak( ) ) header ( LadderDocElements , ' Overall ' ) LadderDocElements.append(pdfLadder( OAL , 'air ' ) ) LadderDocElements.append(platypus.FrameBreak ( ) )
In this case I ’ve wrapped up the actual ladder generation a bit for clarity , but I ’ll get to that in a second .
Once all the elements are appended to the list , you add the frame layouts and tell the document to build itself ( as mentioned above ) and that ’s it – the library goes off , builds the PDF and saves it to the file you specified at the start .
ladderDoc.addPageTemplates([platypus.PageTemplate( id=' TwoColumn ' , frames=frames ) , platypus.PageTemplate( id=' Normal ' , frames=soloframe ) ] ) ladderDoc.build( LadderDocElements )
It ’s not that much work generating the actual ladder either ; platypus has high - level table routines as well , and it ’s just a case of supplying a list of data elements to them and then choosing what style each column / row set is rendered in .
def pdfLadder ( ladder , discipline ) : data = ladderData ( ladder , discipline ) t = platypus .
Table ( data ) ts =platypus.TableStyle ([( ' FONT ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( - 1 , - 1 ) , ' Helvetica ' , 8 ) ] ) ts.add( ' ALIGN ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( - 1 , - 1 ) , ' CENTRE ' ) ts.add( ' ALIGN ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , - 1 ) , ' RIGHT ' ) ts.add( ' ALIGN ' , ( 5 , 0 ) , ( 5 , - 1 ) , ' LEFT ' ) ts.add( ' TEXTCOLOR ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( - 1 , - 1 ) , colors.black ) ts.add( ' FONT ' , ( 1 , 0 ) , ( 1 , - 1 ) , ' Helvetica - Bold ' , 8 ) ts.add ( ' FONT ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( - 1 , 0 ) , ' Helvetica - Bold ' , 9 ) ts.add( ' LINEBELOW ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( - 1 , 0 ) , 0.5 , colors.black ) ts.add( ' LEFTPADDING ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( - 1 , - 1 ) , 2 ) ts.add( ' RIGHTPADDING ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( - 1 , - 1 ) , 2 ) ts.add( ' TOPPADDING ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( - 1 , - 1 ) , 0.25 ) ts.add( ' BOTTOMPADNG ' , ( 0 , 0 ) , ( - 1 , - 1 ) , 0.25 ) ts.add( ' TOPPADDING ' , ( 0 , 1 ) , ( - 1 , 1 ) , 3 ) ts.add( ' BOTTOMPADDING ' , ( 0 , 1 ) , ( - 1 , 1 ) , 2 ) i = 0 for d in data : if d[ 1 ] == None : ts.add ( ' FONT ' , ( 0 , i ) , ( - 1 , i ) , ' Helvetica - Oblique ' , 8 ) ts.add ( ' TEXTCOLOR ' , ( 0 , i ) , ( - 1 , i ) , colors.gray ) i = i + 1 t.setStyle(ts ) return t
Again , the actual data formatting is wrapped up for clarity , but it is n’t very complex :
def ladderData ( ladder , discipline ) : data = [ ] keys = ladder.keys ( ) keys.sort ( ) keys.reverse( ) i = 0 j = 0 row = [ ' Name ' , ' Rank ' , ' Cards ' , ' Running
Average ' , ' Overall
Average ' , ' Range ' , None ] data.append ( row ) for key in keys : row = [ ] shooter = members [ ladder [key ] ] if discipline == ' air ' : scores = shooter.scores_air else : scores = shooter.scores_target row.append(shooter.name ) if len( scores ) >= 3 : i = i + 1 row.append(i ) else : row.append ( None ) row.append(len( scores ) ) row.append ( '% 5.3f ' % key ) if discipline == ' air ' : row.append ('% 5.3f ' % shooter . oldKADAannual('air ' ) ) else : row.append ('% 5.3f ' % shooter . oldKADAannual(' target ' ) ) row.
append (' %d -> %d' % ( min( scores ) , max ( scores ) ) ) if len( scores ) > 2 : plotLadderSparkline( ladder[key ] , ladder , discipline ) file = ' '.join ( [ ' tmp / ' , discipline , str(ladder[key ] ) , '.png ' ] ) image = platypus .
Image ( file ) row.append ( image ) else : row.append ( None ) data.append ( row ) return data
At the end there is the first instance of graphing .
Rather than trying to hook MatPlotLib into ReportLab tightly , the easier option is to simply generate individual png image files for each sparkline ( and the same method is used for all the other graphics as well ) and to save them all in a temporary directory which can be either deleted or re-used after the pdf is generated .
It ’s not too hard to think of advantages to this – you could upload the images to the club webserver and have both PDF and webpage formats for reports and ladders and so on .
As I said , I ’ll go into this in more detail in a later post .
I ’m not really overly happy with the code as yet though .
It ’s rambling in places , downright ugly in others , and I really want to do a job refactoring it before putting it up anywhere .
This whole series of blog posts is n’t really supposed to be saying “ look at this incredible python coding ” , it ’s meant to be saying “ look how fast you can do actual , useful work ” – in this case the actual need comes from a sports club to be sure , but it ’s an actual need nonetheless .
And that you can take python with no prior experience and put something like this together inside of about 20 hours of playing with it for the first time , that ’s a rather excellent recommendation really .
I ’m definitely going to be keeping python in the toolbox for future projects – in fact I ’m already playing with using PyQT for the Range Officer Report part of my RCMS project .
More on that later as well , but I ’m already finding it ’s a nifty little tool for doing GUIs quickly .
Whether or not it ’ll be fast enough on the new toy to be usable remains to be seen , of course .
Our intrepid Microsoft insider has just informed us that there is rumbling that good old Bill may be coming out of semi-retirement to take over Microsoft , à la Steve Jobs .
Apparently Bill has been feeling that his old pal , Ballmer , screwed things up royally with Windows Vista and Microsoft needs an inspirational leader like himself to helm it through the current economic crisis .
According to the sketchy details , Ballmer will remain Microsoft 's CEO , but Gates will directly take over the Windows 7 programme and correct " fundamental problems " with its marketing and new features like Windows Anytime Upgrade and the Windows 7 Upgrade Program .

Japanilaiset ristikot laboratory : teaching mathematics in Finland with Japanese puzzles
New to this website ?
If you enjoy playing brain games online , do n't forget to check our huge selection of free puzzles .
Schools in Finland have a national part of the curriculum which covers most of the studies all students must have in order to graduate high school .
Yet , there are also optional studies In Finland .
We have nationally agreed for what we call " special advanced studies " in all the common subjects and schools are allowed to develop their own special courses for that matter .
Thus , for two years in a row I have had the wonderful opportunity to include a course about Japanese puzzles to my teaching schedule at Turun iltalukio , night gymnasium for adults in Turku , Finland .
I have always thought that Japanese puzzles are the best possible option when trying to learn logical thinking and Ms. Vihervaara , the principal of Turun iltalukio , knows about my hobby solving them .
She is very eager to develop our school and gave permission to try if this course would attract students .
Since I am a mathematics teacher and all the courses should fit under some suitable school subject , I chose the course to be an advanced course in mathematics , the shorter syllabus .
A few minor preparations
Enthusiasm has nothing to do with age
My students are adults aged 18 to any age .
Therefore my teaching differed very much from the experiments of teachers with young children .
Most of mine had already tried Sudoku ’s and could solve them .
Some solved just easier puzzles , some wanted more advanced ones and some of them were already a bit bored of Sudoku’s .
What a suitable group to get them introduced to other puzzles , especially the picture logic ones .
The beginning of a Color Pic - a - Pix solution on the wide screen
When last year 's course took place the popular Finnish publishing company Sanoma Magazines had published a puzzle magazine called Älymix .
This magazine was containing various types of Conceptis puzzles including Sudoku , Pic - a - Pix , Link - a - Pix , Fill - a - Pix , Hitori , Battleships and Maze - a - Pix and was perfect to be used as part of my teaching material .
Some other puzzles included in the course were free weekly ones from Conceptis ' website which I printed for the students .
Solution of a Mega colored Pic - a - Pix from the weekly puzzles presented to the class
This year was different .
The Älymix magazine had not been published in a long time , but mainly - now Conceptis has a new fabulous website and a new set of Flash games to play the puzzles on .
As a result , this year 's class was held in the computer classroom instead of my own that only has one computer and data projector set .
Because of this a few minor preparations had to be made first beginning with Firefox being installed on the computers .
After so many bad experiences I 've had with IE crashing down I knew I can not afford myself this to happen during the short time we had for the class .
Also Adobe Flash was needed .
Lastly , all participants had registered their own personal accounts on conceptispuzzles.com .
As many of the weekly picture puzzles were usually solved in my personal Conceptis account I did not want the students to see it so I started a new account as well and everyone could watch me solving the puzzles from scratch .
Dreaming about the puzzles
We started from the most familiar logic puzzle , Sudoku .
Knowing quite a few people who tend to solve Sudoku based on intuition or by " trial and error " I demonstrated the students a few possible techniques they can use while solving but kept it short .
Next step was the coloured Pic - a - Pix .
I had not had the possibility to teach them so far because we simply do n’t have a colour printer to use in day - to - day teaching .
Now , however , with the new Flash puzzle games on the site the puzzles were a great success .
Some of the students confessed that other obligations had suffered because of the puzzling .
One student had even been dreaming about the puzzles !
Above 4 : Students solving a Color Pic - a - Pix on their computers at different paces , all are very concentrated
Another great success was Link - a - Pix .
The idea was very easy to explain and very soon the students were ready to start playing .
Even slower puzzlers could get a good start and got quickly motivated .
With Link - a- Pix mistakes are easily recovered and also the check puzzle feature is a good tool for a beginner .
So , the course took about 5 weeks and most of the weeks the Link - a - Pix enthusiasts had solved all the Link - a - Pixs of that week .
Slitherlink tutorial animation shown on our 2.5 Meter wide screen .
We went through all of it - step by step .
Fill - a- Pix , Battleships and Hashi were also included in this year 's course because their Interactive game versions had already become available .
Maze - a- Pix and even Dot - a - Pix were also introduced but as they do n't have any Interactive games – only in a brief .
Some of the students were curious about Slitherlink puzzles - which were not playable online at that time – and I wanted to add " deeper mathematics levels " of the puzzle solving aspects .
I explained Slitherlink rules and basic techniques and printed a few of the recently released Calcudokus to the dish .
One of the students gave a huge pile of solved puzzles , much more than I actually asked for .
Some thrilled students were actually coloring additional puzzles of types that were not required such this Color Dot - a - Pix .
After similar teaching course we usually have a five - hour exam but I did not want to use that way to test my students in this case .
I know that even I would probably fail if I was given several puzzles and said that I have 5 hours , solve as many as possible .
Therefore , I printed a set of all the puzzles and the students were allowed to solve them at home during the course .
They could also change the puzzles from the set with the weekly puzzles they had solved .
All the students returned the puzzles to me and guess what .
Some of them had included many more puzzles than I originally gave them .
Shown above are a few of the completed student tasks I received .
They were also part of the exam replacement .
Have never seen anything like this !
Leena Helttula and a Color Pic - a - Pix .
Photographed by a student named Li Li .
In addition , I asked the students to fill in a survey with a few questions about the course .
According to the survey results all students had liked the puzzles .
One mentioned it was " hard at first " and another wanted " something more " , not specifying what exactly .
All students , however , thought Japanese puzzles are a nice way to relax providing a suitable puzzle was selected according to the mood .
Link - a- Pix received most votes and was clearly the most favourite puzzle .
Then came Pic - a - Pix that was number 2 , followed by Hashi , Soduku , CalcuDoku , Slitherlink and Fill - a - Pix .
Some students had several favourites .
The less - liked puzzles were Kakuro , Fill - a - Pix , and Dot - a - Pix .
Many did not want to specify any puzzle as not - liked .
People were also very satisfied with the entire idea of Conceptis puzzles and hoped for many more fun and beautiful puzzles .
One of the comments had particularly caught my attention .
Here it is translate from Finnish to English word by word : " Please sell these to all magazines and include the instructions because all the people I have shown these have never seen anything like this ! "
By now , the school principal had already asked for this course to be continued next year .
I was obviously very pleased to do comply so planning has already started .
First time is always the worst time when you are not sure how things should be organized but now , after the two consecutive successful experiences I am totally confident about it .
Knowing the amazing intellectual pleasure picture - logic puzzles are able to give and have always given me I really want this pleasure to be shared with more students in other countries as well .

When the Starr County sheriff was led away in handcuffs for accepting bribes from a bail bondsman back in 1998 , the county pinned his star on his chief deputy , Reymundo “ Rey ” Guerra .
It was n’t long before Guerra was restoring the shine to the badge .
Unlike his predecessor , Guerra was affable and approachable , a beefy man with a gray - flecked mustache who rarely carried a gun .
He and his wife were regulars at the peach - brick Catholic church in tiny Rio Grande City .
When the city needed a favor , the mayor said , “ I could always just pick up the phone and call Rey . ”
The county judge , a close friend , said , “ You could n’t ask for a better person . ”
Guerra coasted to two election victories and was unopposed for a third in November .
A souvenir from the campaign remains on a billboard on the edge of town : “ Starr County has a sheriff .
Re-elect Reymundo ‘ Rey ’ Guerra . ”
But , somewhere along the way , something went wrong .
Some here lay the blame on the frailty of human nature ; it could happen anywhere , they say .
Others , though , blame the county itself : a smugglers ’
Shangri - La with deep cross - border ties and tight - lipped residents .

As the billboard says , Starr County has a sheriff .
But he ’s no longer Rey Guerra .
::
Starr County shares 78 rugged miles of the U.S. border with Mexico , wedged between one nation ’s ravenous demand for drugs and another ’s bountiful supply .
The illegal drug trade blows across here like the hot winds that rattle the mesquite thickets , carrying shipments of cocaine , marijuana and other drugs to points north .
A recent crackdown on drug trafficking in Mexico has kicked up that wind , and U.S. authorities report drug seizures are up significantly across South Texas .
Starr County has more in common with its neighbors to the south than to the north .
The population , at 80,000 and growing , is 97.5 % Latino , and Spanish is the first language for most residents .

But unlike in Mexico , and bucking the worldwide trend , local businesses in Starr County are booming .
Unemployment is half what it was a decade ago , sales tax revenue is up , and the median income is rising .
New stores , restaurants and theaters have been opened , and a new high school is under construction .
Illicit gains from the drug trade seem to play at least some role in that renaissance .
“ Certainly , the underground economy exists and affects our stores , ” said Ruben Villarreal , the energetic mayor of Rio Grande City , the county seat .
“ But how much ?
No one can gauge it . ”
Since the Rio Grande became an international border in 1848 , contraband has poured across the water , into and through Starr County .
Whether the product was tequila , cattle or dope , smuggling was part of the local landscape , like cowboy hats and giant belt buckles .

“ People come and spend money over here , and if they have a bagful of 20s , we do n’t ask where they got it , ” said Alonzo Alvarez , a retired high school teacher who had Guerra in his history class back in the 1970s .
“ That ’s not our job .
This kind of thing has been around here for years . ”
Ralph G. Diaz , special agent in charge of the FBI office in San Antonio , has worked this area off and on for three decades .
“ It ’s almost cultural , ” he said .
“ Throughout their entire lives , folks have watched this kind of activity pass through their communities , basically unimpeded .
They come to accept it . ”
The enormous amounts of money involved have been a particular temptation for at least a few who wear uniforms here and elsewhere along the 2,000 - mile border .
The drug traffickers “ feel they can buy law enforcement , ” said Tim Johnson , the U.S. attorney for southern Texas .
“ And sometimes they can . ”

Sheriff Guerra ’s troubles appear to stem from his friendship with Jose Carlos Hinojosa , who lived across the border in Miguel Aleman and , at 31 , is much younger than the 52 - year - old sheriff .
It ’s not clear how they met , but the FBI has identified Hinojosa as a member of Los Zetas , the paramilitary enforcement arm of the Gulf cartel , which is one of Mexico ’s most violent drug - trafficking organizations and which controls drug transshipment corridors in the Rio Grande Valley .
Three years ago , one of Guerra ’s deputies received an unusual request from the sheriff .
Guerra asked the deputy to give Hinojosa , whom he introduced as an investigator for Mexican law enforcement , the name of an informant who had tipped off authorities to a drug stash house , according to the FBI .
Suspicious , the deputy quietly reported the incident to federal authorities , who folded it into an ongoing investigation of the Gulf cartel .
A year later , the FBI began monitoring both Hinojosa ’s and the sheriff ’s cellphones .
In October , the U.S. attorney ’s office issued a 19 - count indictment that accuses Hinojosa , Guerra and two dozen others of conspiring to smuggle thousands of pounds of marijuana and cocaine through Starr County .
Among those charged were a postal worker , a construction foreman and a local businessman who was a member of the county hospital ’s board of trustees and of the county tax assessment board .
Guerra was accused of removing obstacles to the drug - smuggling operation in exchange for thousands of dollars , in $ 5,000 cash payments , as well as gifts of rib - eye steak and shrimp .
In one case , the indictment alleges , Guerra helped produce fake lease documents for a house where the cartel was keeping marijuana and cocaine with a street value of about $ 800,000 .

In telephone conversations taped by the authorities , a voice identified as that of Guerra referred to Hinojosa ’s associates as sobrinos , or nephews , and they called him tio , uncle , according to the FBI .
He warned Hinojosa that there were “ birds on the wire ” -- that their phones might be tapped .
Toni Trevino , an assistant U.S. attorney in Texas , said Guerra ’s help for Hinojosa , “ who is not a run - of - the - mill drug trafficker , ” had endangered the sheriff ’s fellow law enforcement officers and “ put the interests of his sobrinos above the interests of those who depend on him in this community . ”
She told a judge at a bond hearing that Guerra used his position to help the Gulf cartel “ operate almost unfettered in the Starr County area . ”
Guerra ’s attorney , Philip H. Hilder , a former federal prosecutor and onetime area coordinator of the federal Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force , contends that the sheriff believed Hinojosa was working for “ legitimate Mexican law enforcement . ”
He argues that his client was a victim of bad blood between local and federal authorities .

“ Let ’s just say there is a lot of mistrust , and I think that a certain amount of friction may have led to Mr. Guerra being targeted in this case , ” Hilder said .
A trial date has been set for May .
If convicted of conspiracy to possess marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute and two related charges , Guerra could be sentenced to a maximum of life in prison and a $ 4 - million fine .
Guerra has been free on $ 100,000 bond since Christmas Eve .
He is confined to his ranch home on a lovingly landscaped estate of cactus , mesquite and palm trees at the bend of a gravel road in Rio Grande City .
A grand archway at the entrance bears his family name , in tall capital letters , and a large Texas star made of pebbles is embedded in the concrete driveway .
Guerra ’s movements are monitored by an electronic ankle bracelet , and visitors and telephone calls are not allowed .
The arrest of prominent citizens accused of being involved in the drug trade does n’t really shock folks in Starr County that much anymore ; it ’s part of living on the border .
Though “ the good people far , far outweigh the bad people , ” as the mayor put it , it is not unusual for a federal indictment to include a member of the Chamber of Commerce or a person connected to the county ’s elite .

Mario Mascorro , another defendant in the Guerra case , was a member of the county hospital board , his name set in gold - colored letters on a plaque next to the front door .
Mascorro was also involved in a business deal with the county administrator , among others , to purchase FM radio frequencies .
Still , the news of Guerra ’s arrest was unsettling for the people of Rio Grande City , a community of 17,000 on its namesake river .
Civic leaders tried to square the charges with the man they knew -- a lifelong resident , the husband of a librarian and lay leader at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church .
“ I find it very hard to believe that some of these charges placed against him are true , ” said Judge Eloy Vera , the county administrator .
Guerra “ did n’t live the life of Riley here , ever , ” said Alvarez , the retired teacher , who remains close to Guerra .
“ He was a local kid with a high school education who made good .
My personal opinion is that he ’s an honest person , and they do n’t have a case against him . ”

Guerra went to services every Sunday at Immaculate Conception , nestled in a leafy area next to the county courthouse .
The pastor , Amador Garza , ministers to a flock of 5,000 families and oversees the church elementary school .
( Among those indicted with Guerra were the fathers of five pupils at the school , he said . )
“ It takes a lot not to despair , ” Father Garza said the other day with a sigh .
“ I have not forsaken him .
He is still my friend and parishioner .
I still see his wife every day at Mass .
But personally , and professionally as well , I think the full weight of the law should come down on him if he did this . ”
Like Guerra , Garza grew up on the border .
Over the last decade in Starr County , he has railed against the drug trade -- and accused city , county and school officials of looking the other way .
Garza addressed an open message to drug traffickers from the pulpit recently .
“ I hope you are living comfortably with your families because you are destroying the very fabric of other families , ” he said .
Later , in private , he added : “ We ’ve already lost the border to the Gulf cartel . ”

In fact , the priest often complained to Guerra that local officials were either willfully ignorant or in the pocket of the cartels .
“ We had some differences of opinion about that , and I was very direct with him , ” Garza said .
“ He always heard me out . ”
The Starr County sheriff and his 39 deputies work out of a windowless rectangular bunker on the highest point of land in Rio Grande City .
Seven Chevy Tahoe SUVs , purchased as part of a federal grant , were parked on the street outside recently , waiting to be stenciled with the sheriff ’s insignia .
Another new gift from Washington , a mobile “ sky box ” with high - tech equipment to monitor the border , was on display at the Starr County Fair , near a dusty ring where judges handed out ribbons to children parading their goats .
Sgt. Ismael Sandoval , head of special operations for the sheriff ’s office , pondered the legacy of his former boss .
“ What kind of sheriff was he ? ” the sergeant said .
“ We do n’t want to hurt the man because as far as we know he has n’t done anything . ”
He paused .
Advertisement
“ All I can tell you is he was a real good sheriff . ”
Guerra ’s predecessor , Sheriff Eugenio “ Gene ” Falcon Jr. , served just under two years in prison for taking bribes to refer inmates to a bail bondsman who was an FBI informant .
Falcon now is an administrative assistant to Judge Vera .
“ I was raked over the coals pretty good for that , ” Vera said .
“ But we all deserve a second chance . ”
Guerra resigned immediately after his arrest .
His name remained on the November ballot , unopposed , and he officially stepped down a second time after the election .

Now Rene Fuentes , Guerra ’s chief deputy , wears the silver star on his starched white shirt .

Jason Braatz has been in the city 's floral business for six years — enough time to know that it pays to keep Yelpers happy .
And Panthea J. is not happy .
" Sadly , it was not the dramatic floral marvel that I had envisioned , " she sighed about a bouquet from Braatz ' Rossi & Rovetti Flowers in her review at Yelp.com , " but a small and slightly wilted version that would n't have compensated for cutting [ the recipient ] off in traffic . "
She gave the florist just two stars out of five .
Ouch .
Panthea J. is one of thousands of ordinary people who 've rated eateries and theaters , dentists and dive bars , on the popular consumer Web site that relies on user - generated reviews .
While a couple of years back no one would have given a hoot what Panthea J. thought about her bouquet , now hundreds type in " florist " on Yelp each day to read the recommendations of consumers like her .
Though he has a solid 4.5 - star rating overall , Braatz claims a positive review at the top of his page brings in 100 orders .
He suspects a negative one scares off about the same .
Knowing this , Braatz decided he had to make nice with Panthea J. He dashed off several e-mail equivalents of thanking Her Highness for the public flogging : " I appreciate your sincerity and the time you had spent in writing it , " he wrote .
" Thank you so much once again !
If there 's anything else we can do , consider it done ! "
It was n't the only time Braatz had tried to buy Yelpers ' goodwill .
His early offers of a free bouquet and $ 100 for removing their reviews smelled funny to some Yelpers ( " Money or flowers can not at this time make up for not receiving my Valentines bouquet , " one sniped in an e-mail response ) .
So Braatz launched a customer service shock - and - awe campaign , hoping to goad the grumblers into updating their reviews to five stars without explicitly asking .
He filled their requests one by one : Madagascar jasmine delivered the same day ?
No problem .
The 20 - centimeter stem roses for the same price as the ones half their length ?
Done .
The clients later deleted or toned down their bad reviews .
Panthea J. , however , turned out to be a more difficult case .
Months after Braatz e-mailed her promising to do anything to make her happy , a message from her popped into his inbox :
She said she wanted to take advantage of Braatz ' earlier offer .
" Yes , if you send me a free arrangement , I would be happy to provide feedback and , though unsolicited , would be happy to revise my review accordingly , " she wrote .
Braatz sent three free arrangements , hoping she would follow through .
But the two - star review stayed put .
Braatz kept trying to please her .
Panthea had more than 200 friends on the site and was a member of its Elite Squad — clearly a woman of influence in the Yelp kingdom .
If he kept sending bouquets , she might update her review .
On the other hand , if she was displeased , she could write something far worse .
Delivery receipts show that Braatz sent at least four more bouquets to Panthea 's address , unaware that she had since moved and apparently never got any of them .
He claims they were all sent in response to further e-mailed requests ; she says he 's fabricating the e-mails to discredit her bad review .
While she acknowledges she " dropped the ball " on updating her write - up of Rossi & Rovetti , she insists she never requested a thing after the initial bouquet .
Whatever the case , $ 1,000 worth of flowers later , Braatz was unable to get a more favorable review from Panthea .
He figures it 's just the cost of doing business these days .
Overall , he reckons , Yelp has been a boon to the shop tucked in the Bank of America building on California Street .
He credits
Yelp with helping quintuple his annual gross income to more than $ 1 million since he bought the company in 2003 .
He says Tom Hanks ' personal assistant found him via Yelp and had him fill a Porsche with more than 1,200 roses as a gift to a niece .
" It 's become one of our most powerful advertising tools , " Braatz says .
But that does n't make having to placate Yelpers less annoying : " The power for them to put a bad remark on can crush us .
So we have to do 10 steps above everything .
... We literally overdo customer service . "
Interestingly , Rossi & Rovetti symbolizes the city 's old power elite .
Braatz has learned that the business , founded by the family of Angelo Joseph Rossi , who went on to be strike - busting San Francisco mayor from 1931 to 1944 , likely had ties to organized crime and delivered its roses in alcohol during Prohibition .
If your flowers arrived wilted back then , you probably kept it to yourself .
But at the turn of the 21st century , the Internet has made it possible for members of a new power class to say how business is run in town .
They call themselves Yelpers , and they can have a major impact on a store or restaurant 's bottom line .
Businesses ' only choice is to please them — or not .
The worldwide headquarters of Yelp spreads out on the third , seventh , and eighth floors above Rochester Big & Tall at the corner of Mission and Third streets .
Inside , amid shuffleboard and Ping - Pong tables and a pen for the CEO 's dozing dog , young tech nerds with headphones and zip - up hipster jackets — not a tie in the place — silently type code and manage complaints for a site that attracted just shy of 20 million unique visitors last month .
For reference , that 's not even a third of those of Web 2.0 giant YouTube , yet Yelp 's steady uptick in visitors is likely making the older review site , Southern California–based CitySearch — whose visitors plateaued in the 30 million range last year — a tad nervous .
Jeremy Stoppelman , Yelp 's photogenic 31 - year - old chief executive , founded the site in 2004 with fellow University of Illinois engineering school alum Russel Simmons , after the two met while working at PayPal .
Stoppelman was inspired to start
Yelp while looking for a doctor .
With venture capital from their PayPal boss , the two launched a site where users could ask friends for referrals to businesses , but discovered that users preferred to write unsolicited reviews — for free .
Norway 's public broadcaster NRK receives 94 percent of its revenue from a license fee paid by TV - owning households in the country , and it 's charged not with making money , but with getting its content in front of as many people as possible .
To do that , NRK has just launched its own BitTorrent tracker to distribute its TV shows — DRM - free , of course .
NRK takes its distribution mission so seriously that it 's even providing subtitle files so that non-Norwegians can translate the shows easily .
Given what the Norwegians have been up to recently , this is n't surprising .
NRK started distributing shows via BitTorrent in early 2008 and said that the experiment was a great success .
( Canada 's CBC did a similar but smaller - scale BitTorrent trial . )
Being a small broadcaster in a small country is a bit like being a new indie band rehearsing in a garage ; just getting your work in front of people is a major challenge , since you 're competing with everything being pumped out by the big industry players .
Between January and March 2008 , the first NRK show available ( legally ) via BitTorrent had been downloaded 90,000 times , exceeding expectations .
NRK wants to test new distribution models , but simply putting one 's material out on P2P networks does n't provide good data .
Running an official NRK tracker will provide better statistics about how the BitTorrent downloads are used .
First up on the new site : a " very popular television series about people living in remote places in Norway . "
If you 're pining for the fjords , . torrent links can be found on NRK 's announcement page .
Getting " open "
Norway has been all about " openness " in all its forms recently .
Two weeks ago , the country 's education minister said there was " no future in fighting " P2P file - sharing , comparing the technology ( even when used to infringe copyright ) to the radio or the VCR , which created huge new opportunities for artists .
Norway has also gone after Apple over its iTunes DRM , threatening to bring a legal case against the company if it did n't make its products usable on other devices ( the complaint was dropped when Apple announced that the full iTunes store would drop DRM — on music , anyway ) .
ISPs in the country even adopted a voluntary set of network neutrality principles in February after the plan was pushed by the Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority .
But free and open content is n't quite as simple as it sounds .
In an interview last year , NRK 's Eirik Solheim said clearing rights for free worldwide Internet distribution was a huge problem , especially for archival material .
Music rights need to be cleared ; so do contracts involving the actors and any third - party sponsors .
The shows that NRK has so far released on BitTorrent were developed with these issues in mind ; the first one , for instance , required a special contract with the show 's host and the composition and recording of all music used in the production .
The licensing issue became especially public back in January when NRK put up podcasts containing the complete library of Beatles songs , then had to pull the whole production after it became clear that NRK did not have the proper rights to distribute the music .
Bold experiments
Though the new effort remains experimental , it 's a bolder sort of experiment than most broadcasters are making , even publicly - funded ones .
That may be because so much less money is at stake .
Compared to another license - funded broadcaster like the BBC , NRK 's content does n't generate tremendous DVD sales numbers on both sides of the Atlantic , nor is much of it repackaged for channels like BBC America .
Though the BBC has mooted various ambitious plans to put archival content online , its current iPlayer system only allows viewers to stream programming from the previous week , and only to UK residents .
NRK 's scale therefore gives it more room for experimentation with worldwide distribution , fansubs , BitTorrent trackers , and the use of DRM - free content .
Judging from NRK 's own comments thus far , it does n't appear that the broadcaster has yet run into significant domestic opposition from those who pay the license fee , though this is an obvious potential problem .
How many pensioners with an old TV set will be thrilled about paying the license when young people in Norway — and around the world — simply go online and download the shows for free ?
As TV migrates onto the Internet and can be delivered to any screen , NRK 's experiment in distribution may gradually morph into an experiment into changing license fee models in the digital age .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) deserves credit , figuratively speaking , for cleverly manipulating the financial troubles of emerging and low - income nations to procure a fresh infusion of capital for itself .
But its tactics at this month 's G - 20 summit in London -- where President Barack Obama signed off on tripling the IMF 's lending resources -- should not hoodwink anyone , least of all American taxpayers who pay the largest share of IMF expenses .
Lost in the lofty talk about putting the IMF in the center of world economic recovery is the fact that the organization has been quietly attempting to ensure its own survival by seeking permission to engage in gold sales .
While IMF officials insinuate the receipts would be used to help poor countries , the real goal is to set up a permanent endowment fund for the IMF .
The U.S. should not replenish the coffers of a multilateral bureaucracy that quite literally lost its reason for being on Aug. 15 , 1971 -- the day President Richard Nixon " closed the gold window " and brought an end to the Bretton Woods agreement , which allowed countries to convert their dollar holdings , via the IMF , into gold at a fixed price .
Instead , Congress should call for the IMF 's dismantlement and restitution of its assets .
The most solid asset owned by the IMF , purely as a legacy of its original incarnation , is gold .
The IMF holds 3,217 metric tons ( 103.4 million ounces ) of gold , which makes it the world 's third largest official holder .
Actually , it 's a misnomer to say the IMF " owns " the gold since the bullion belongs , according to the IMF articles of agreement adopted at Bretton Woods in 1944 , to its member nations .
Nevertheless , the IMF is now seeking to sell a considerable chunk of those gold holdings -- some 12.9 million ounces -- which it insists are exempt from restitution to members in the event of IMF liquidation .
Its reason ?
Between December 1999 and April 2000 , to fund its Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative , the IMF arranged to sell gold which it held on its books at a price of roughly $ 50 to two member countries , Brazil and Mexico , at the market price of $ 355 .
It put the profits of close to $ 4 billion in a special HIPC account ; simultaneously , the IMF accepted back the gold sold to Brazil and Mexico in settlement of their financial obligations of that amount .
If there 's any downside to the $ 25 Bacon Watch , it 's that users may unintentionally gnaw at their own arm .

The Bacon Watch is actually a pretty typical timepiece save for its trademark bacon strips strap constructed of durable vinyl that promise to fit " most " adult wrists ( the product is intended for bacon addicts , after all , so that 's probably a reasonable disclaimer ) .
I 'm also quite keen on that little bacon mascot adorning the watch 's face .
But now that I have all of you bacon lovers in one spot , what 's your favorite brand and method of preparation ?
I go for Dreymiller & Kray 's applewood smoked variety — probably the best bacon I 've ever had , at home or abroad , with a subtle sweetness to balance the crunchy - salty goodness that is perfectly cured and crisped pork fat .
And I bake it at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes ( starting with the oven off ) because it 's easier and cleaner than stoving it .

Layoffs , tight credit and other fallout from the troubled economy have battered Southern California ’s office market , leading to vacancy rates as high as 30 % in some areas .
The pain is expected to continue for months , if not years , with vacancies rising even as the economy shows modest signs of recovery , according to industry observers tracking activity in the first quarter .
“ We have a rough road ahead of us , ” said Joe Vargas , senior managing director of real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield .
“ It ’s going to be a very challenging market for the remainder of the year . ”
Desperate landlords in the Inland Empire have begun offering such perks as a year of free rent to attract tenants .
In West Los Angeles , owners are steeply discounting the monthly cost of an office -- cutting rates that , ironically , grew so high during the boom years that many companies were forced to move out and find cheaper digs .

Vacancy in Los Angeles County reached 14.3 % in the first quarter , up from 11.2 % a year earlier , according to a report released last week by Cushman & Wakefield .
In Orange County , where demand has been dwindling for more than a year , vacancy ticked up to nearly 18 % from 15 % .
Among the hardest - hit markets are the Inland Empire , Irvine and north Los Angeles County , all of which have been wracked by the losses of tenants in the troubled industries of mortgage and finance .
Vacancies in all three areas have surpassed 20 % , a sign of a very weak market .
In Ontario and the area around Los Angeles International Airport , vacancy tops 30 % .
The Westside of L.A. County , the largest office market in the Southland , remains among the most expensive for renters in the U.S. but is experiencing convulsions .
The first quarter of 2009 saw the largest jump in empty space since the first quarter of 2001 , when the burst of the dot - com bubble was in full swing , according to brokerage Grubb & Ellis Co .
Job losses , closures and moves out of the area caused a rapid emptying of offices on the Westside , and as a result many tenants are trying to sublease their unused space to others , brokers said .
This has caused downward pressure on rents .

The area was among the hardest - hit in the region because its tenant base of technology and entertainment companies has been significantly affected by the recession .
At the same time , the small - to mid-size white - collar companies that form the bedrock of the Westside ’s office market are pulling back , sensitive because of their size to costs such as rent .
“ Rents come out of their pockets , ” said broker Hunt Barnett of Madison Partners , who represents such firms in negotiations with landlords .
In the face of uncertainty brought on by the recession , owners of small companies want to keep their options open , Barnett said -- and landlords do too .
As a result , the few deals that are being made are frequently for short - term leases -- at rates well off recent peaks .
Westside rents reached $ 4 to $ 6 per square foot per month around 2007 but have fallen to about $ 2.25 to $ 5 , Barnett said .
Advertisement
Many Westside landlords are not offering free rent or other incentives , Barnett said , because they prefer to cut rent on short - term deals and gamble they will be able to raise rates again in a year or two , when the economy recovers .
“ It ’s about whether you can weather the next two or three years , ” said landlord Bert Dezzutti of Brookfield Properties .
Downtown Los Angeles , the region ’s second - largest office market , has been more stable in recent years and remains that way , observers say .
“ Downtown did n’t run up rents like the Westside , Burbank and Pasadena did , ” said John McAniff , managing director of real estate brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle .

The central business district has been transformed since the dark days of high vacancy in the early 1990s and the decade that followed , he said , as institutions such as banks and energy companies left the market and were gradually replaced by large service firms in such fields as law , engineering and architecture .
With no large office buildings completed since 1992 , there ’s not much extra room , McAniff said .
“ We have seen a floor here and a floor there , but not three and four blocks available for long term . ”
It ’s been a different story in the Inland Empire , where overall vacancy rates top 25 % .
Some landlords there are offering tenants as much as a year of free rent if they will sign a lease , Cushman & Wakefield ’s Vargas said .
Landlords will also grant generous allowances that tenants can use to fund improvements to their offices or even allow a new tenant to assume an old tenant ’s lease , a rarity in the real estate business .
Along with the area around John Wayne Airport in Orange County , the Inland Empire saw some speculative office construction in recent years .
With hundreds of thousands of square feet of new office space and a dwindling tenant base as businesses contract or shut down , buildings are standing empty and there is little movement in the market .
Construction is grinding to a halt in most of the region .
Advertisement
The few office buildings that do get built these days usually have tenants already signed .
In Cerritos , for example , Transpacific Development Co. is completing a five - story office building that will be mostly occupied next month by law firm Atkinson , Andelson , Loya , Ruud & Romo , said Tom Irish , president of Transpacific .
“ We had been looking for a tenant for a while that would be the anchor for the new building , ” Irish said .
“ We would n’t start without one . ”

Poland 's Krystian Zimerman , widely regarded as one of the finest pianists in the world , created a furor Sunday night in his debut at Walt Disney Concert Hall when he announced this would be his last performance in America because of the nation 's military policies overseas .
Before playing the final work on his recital , Karol Szymanowski ’s " Variations on a Polish Folk Theme , " Zimerman sat silently at the piano for a moment , almost began to play , but then turned to the audience .
In a quiet but angry voice that did not project well , he indicated that he could no longer play in a country whose military wants to control the whole world .
“ Get your hands off of my country , ” he said .
He also made reference to the U.S. military detention camp in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
About 30 or 40 people in the audience walked out , some shouting obscenities .
“ Yes , ” he answered , “ some people when they hear the word military start marching . ”
Others remained but booed or yelled for him to shut up and play the piano .
But many more cheered .
Zimerman responded by saying that America has far finer things to export than the military , and he thanked those who support democracy .
For the first half of the recital , Zimerman had played a Bach Partita and Beethoven ’s last piano sonata , Opus 111 , with firm determination .
After intermission he made a last minute substitution , exchanging late Brahms works for a 1953 sonata by Polish composer Grazyna Bacewicz .
The Szymanowski variations , which closed the program , was played with an astonishing ferocity that brought nothing but tumultuous cheers .
There was no encore .
The pianist was not available after the concert for further comment .
Zimerman has had problems in the United States in recent years .
He travels with his own Steinway piano , which he has altered himself .
But shortly after 9/11 , the instrument was confiscated at JFK Airport when he landed in New York to give a recital at Carnegie Hall .
Thinking the glue smelled funny , the TSA decided to take no chances and destroyed the instrument .
Since then he has shipped his pianos in parts , which he reassembles by hand after he lands .
He also drives the truck himself when he carries his instrument from city to city over land , as he did after playing a recital in Berkeley on Friday .

" I Want Planes To Be Safe As Possible , But This Is Going Too Far "
Utah freshman Congressman Jason Chaffetz says his first - ever bill will be to block the Transportation Security Administration from replacing old - school airport metal detectors with full - body imaging scanners .
" I want the planes to be as safe as possible , but this is just going too far , " he says .
" The name of safety is overtaking personal privacy and I think that 's wrong . "
The Salt Lake Tribune reports the bill , which Chaffetz hopes to introduce in the next week or two , would force TSA to keep the current option for passengers to be frisked by a screener , if they prefer not to have the full - body scan .
The Salt Lake City International Airport ( SLC ) is one of TSA 's test locations , and the agency reports the new scanners are being well received .
As for the idea that the machines invade privacy , local TSA spokesman Dwayne Baird said little , citing an upcoming meeting with Chaffetz to discuss his concerns , but added , " We do n't look at it as an intrusion per se . "
As for TSA claims that the machines do not reveal private anatomical details , Chaffetz says agents have told him they can tell how much change is in a passenger 's pockets .
" If you have that kind of specificity , you can see everything . "
In statements to local media , Chaffetz has also called the images displayed by the machines " TSA porn . "
Chaffetz also expressed concern for the effect of screening the images on screeners .
" I do n't think we should be subjecting TSA employees to sitting around looking at naked bodies all day , " he said .
" There 's got to be a point where you say , ' We 've gone too far . ' "
The BBC's Religious Affairs correspondent Robert Pigott reflects on the latest news from the world of religion and beliefs .
This week - the supposed link between the Virgin Mary and EU number plates , and one man 's fight for a Hindu cremation .
TIGHTENING THE BIBLE BELT Christian influence on everyday life is one thing , but in the Dutch Bible belt it also matters what kind of Christianity it is .
Some Dutch Protestants think car registration plates are too similar to the Virgin Mary 's halo A group of traditionalist Protestants has objected to the use of the European Union emblem on car registration plates in the Netherlands , on the grounds that the circle of 12 golden stars on a blue background symbolises the Roman Catholic veneration of Mary , the mother of Jesus .
The National Foundation for the Preservation of the Political Reformed Principles is concerned that the symbol is too close to the 12 - star halo surrounding Mary 's head in Roman Catholic art .
According to the Vatican newspaper l'Osservatore Romano , the designer of the emblem , Arsene Heitz , said he got the idea from 19th Century reports of apparitions of the Virgin Mary in Paris .
Other politicians say that the symbol dates back to Greek mythology , long before Christianity .
The foundation works to promote Calvinist principles within the Netherlands ' oldest party , the Political Reformed Party , which draws much of its support from Christians living in the country 's Bible belt .
The " Bijbelgordel " runs from the south west to the north east across the central portion of the Netherlands and contains communities in which the Reformed Christian Church plays a central role , one hostile to the liberal attitudes of mainstream Dutch society towards such issues as euthanasia , abortion and homosexuality .
The belt is a relic of the conquest by Catholic Spain of Flanders and North Brabant , when Protestants were told to leave or convert to Catholicism .
Many moved just across the border , and their successors helped found conservative churches such as the Reformed Congregations , known locally as the " black stockings churches " .
Among the belt 's towns and villages is Staphorst , where Christian parties including the Political Reformed Party dominate the local council .
Christian observance has been sufficiently strict for swearing to be banned and cash machines not to dispense money on Sundays .
There have also been warnings about potential outbreaks of measles in the Bible belt , because of parents ' suspicions about state vaccination programmes .
But the Dutch government seems unwilling to compromise in the question of regulations applying to number - plates .
Undaunted , the foundation 's chairman , Op 't Hof , is selling stickers bearing the country 's lion symbol for motorists to place on top of the EU emblem .
So far this act of defiance has prompted no official response .
THE FIERY HINDU WAY OF DEATH
When Baba Ghai set fire to the body of Rajpal Mehat in a secluded meadow near Newcastle upon Tyne , he believed he was liberating Mr Mehat 's soul .
Mr Ghai says that as a Hindu he believes the consecrated fire of an open - air funeral pyre is necessary to free the soul and achieve what he describes as a " sacramental rebirth , like the mythical phoenix " .
Open - air cremations are common in the Indian sub - continent But Newcastle City Council has refused to grant permission for open - air cremations - on the grounds they are banned under the 1902 Cremation Act .
So on Tuesday the High Court is due to begin its own hearing to decide what Mr Ghai believes could be his eternal fate .
Mr Ghai argues that when he lit Mr Mehat 's funeral pyre in July 2006 , the law was in effect tested and a precedent set .
Mr Mehat was an illegal immigrant from India who had drowned , aged 31 , in a London canal .
The police investigated the burning of his body , and decided that although the law had been broken nothing would be gained by prosecuting Mr Ghai .
The High Court judge - Mr Justice Collins - who granted permission for a full hearing , said that earlier rulings might mean " the burning of dead bodies in the open air is not necessarily unlawful " .
There is another precedent .
In 1934 the government gave permission for the Nepalese ambassador 's wife to be burnt in the open air in Woking in Surrey .
The Anglo - Asian Friendship Society - founded by Mr Ghai - commissioned an environmental study from a private company , which reported no significant risk to public health from the pyres .
There are more than half a million Hindus living in the UK , and it seems likely many would choose this 4,000 - year - old ceremony for their departure .
Some British Hindus send the bodies of their relatives to India to ensure they are burnt in line with traditional practice .
A strict interpretation demands the ashes are left to cool naturally for a period of three days .
Ideally , they would then be scattered in the sacred River Ganges .
A number of British rivers - including the Soar , the Thames and the Wye - have been " anointed with water from the Ganges " , to make them credible substitutes for the holy river .
Funeral parties frequently travel up the River Soar in Leicestershire , for example , to scatter the ashes of dead relatives .
But it is no substitute for a proper cremation as far as Mr Ghai is concerned .
He is in fragile health , and even after a lifetime in which he says he has attempted to come to terms with mortality , he has described himself as " increasingly consumed with dread " at the prospect of being cremated in the local council crematorium .
Mr Ghai is pinning his hopes on the High Court in the first instance , but if it rules against open - air pyres , he is ready to pursue his case in Europe .
PATRIARCH - AND FATHER TO TWO THOUSAND BABIES As Western Church leaders lament their loss of influence , the Catholicos - Patriarch of All Georgia , Ilia II , is claiming to have an almost magical effect on his country 's people .
With Georgia 's sluggish birth - rate worrying the somewhat beleaguered nation , the Catholicos - Patriarch offered to become godfather to every third child born to a family .
Wrapping himself in the flag : does the Patriarch now embody the Georgian national spirit ?
Patriarch Ilia has been credited by the government 's Civil Registry Agency with playing an important role in a " dramatic " increase - almost 20 % - in the birth rate last year .
The agency has pointed out the leader of the Georgian Orthodox Church has presided over enough mass baptisms to have become godfather to more than 2,000 children .
It is true that the birth - rate among Georgia 's 4.6 million people was already rising because of economic growth , but there are signs that Patriarch Ilia 's intervention was significant .
A number of recent events indicate a growing influence for the Church .
When the police clashed with anti-government protesters in 2007 , Patriarch Ilia intervened and managed to defuse the crisis .
After the war with Russia he was the only Georgian to meet President Dmitry Medvedev for direct talks .
And when saints were included in a television programme , the Church 's objections led to a rapid change in the programme 's format .
The Church - one of the world 's oldest - seems to be regarded increasingly as the custodian of the national spirit .
It is exempt from paying taxes , and has recently seen its state funding almost tripled .
Its television station is also subsidised .
All of this has prompted debate about the Church 's growing power and whether the lines between Church and state have become blurred .
It is a far cry from the Church of England 's battle against what it claims are attempts to banish Christianity in the UK to a strictly private realm .

The journalist on the bus next to me is snoring like it 's going out of fashion .
It 's 7 am and I have been cleared by the first security screening and am now sitting on a bus waiting to be shuttled to the next electronic frisk and probe .
The bus is n't moving , apparently because the road to the conference is blocked by ... well , we 're not sure .
But the journalists from all over the world crammed on to the bus are becoming restive .
Welcome to the G20 , the conference that Gordon Brown tells us will set the world back on the road to economic recovery .
For most of us stuck on the bus , the road to anywhere would be nice .
I suppose the authorities figure that the only deadline that matters is 1530 this afternoon , when the prime minister will announce to 2,500 hacks like me that the planet has been saved .
There is , of course , a faint risk that if it takes that long to get us there , the polite Dutch , Italian and Spanish journalists dressed in their best smart - casual that surround me will have morphed into rabid , smash - capitalism protesters .
We long for escape from this detention camp in a wasteland on north east London .
If they let us out , we promise to suspend common sense and try to believe that there really is drama in the last closing hours of talks between the leaders of the 20 economies identified as the world 's most pivotal .
Thank goodness for le president , M Sarkozy .
His tantrum yesterday , his near - threat that he would stomp out if the excesses of Anglo - American financial capitalism are n't definitively tamed , created the almost convincing impression that the stuff which really matters in today 's communique has n't been stitched up and choreographed in the preceding days by diligent officials .
As a minister said to me yesterday , if money had changed hands between Downing Street and the Elysees , M Sarkozy could n't have done a better job for G Brown of casting him as the peacemaking global statesman .
However , for the avoidance of doubt , I am not trying to downplay the significance of today 's global concordat on boosting the resources of the IMF to rescue ailing economies , on the principles of reforming the banking system , and on standing ready to stimulate national economies should that be necessary ( this latter a damper squib than Mr Obama and Mr Brown would have liked , but they 'll never admit it ) .
That said , and as you by now may have gathered , I am feeling a little bit grumpy to be stranded on a bus seemingly on the road to nowhere .
Update 08:37 : After a wrong turn , by the government - hired bus driver , we 're in .
But in what ?
We 're nowhere near where the leaders will be passionately debating the precise words to employ when declaring that - in the light of evidence that secretive , tax - avoiding financial firms may not all have been a force for good - that they do n't like tax havens .
Where we are is Planet Media .
I 've been a hack for more than 25 years and I 've never seen anything like it .
Picture to yourself the biggest indoor stadium you 've ever seen .
And then think of it filled with desk after desk after desk of newspaper reporters in front of laptops and phone points .
Then visualise a couple of hundred yards of cameras directed at TV reporters and presenters .
Finally summon up the image of hundreds of little booths filled with TV editing kit and makeshift radio studios .
This is a heaving , gabbling mass of scribblers and pundits .
Are you feeling queasy ?
I would n't be at all surprised .
It 's the London summit .
I think we 're still on Earth , but actually I can't be sure .
So far my only contribution to the future of the world 's economy has been to tip my tea over a tray of free croissants in the refreshment area .
Sorry , fellow hacks .
However the torrent of steaming hot brew missed my TV shirt .
Disaster averted .

Update 09:26 : I 've just interviewed Lord Mandelson for the News Channel .
The message of the business secretary is that the prime minister is being " greedy " - greedy for massive additional resources for the IMF for bailing out beleaguered economies ; greedy for hundreds of billions of commitments to finance drooping world trade ; greedy for a substantial injection of funds into poorer developing nations .

Fingers point towards US on economic crisis as Chinese , Russian leaders speak Nick Cargo
Published : Wednesday January 28 , 2009
Print This Email This Prime Minister Vladimir Putin of Russia and Premier Wen Jiabao of China had strong words for certain entities over the state of the global financial system at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland on Wednesday .
Recent financial conditions are attributed by Wen , in his statement , to " inappropriate macroeconomic policies of some economies and their unsustainable model of development characterized by prolonged low savings and high consumption ; excessive expansion of financial institutions in blind pursuit of profit ; lack of self - discipline among financial institutions and rating agencies and the ensuing distortion of risk information and asset pricing ; and the failure of financial supervision and regulation to keep up with financial innovations . "
" In other words , " he continued , " we must strike a balance between savings and consumption , between financial innovation and regulation , and between the financial sector and real economy .
" The current crisis has inflicted a rather big impact on China 's economy .
We are facing severe challenges , including notably shrinking external demand , overcapacity in some sectors , difficult business conditions for enterprises , rising unemployment in urban areas and greater downward pressure on economic growth . "
Putin called out the United States directly in his speech , calling the current economic state a " perfect storm . "
" I just want to remind you that , just a year ago , American delegates speaking from this rostrum emphasised the US economy 's fundamental stability and its cloudless prospects , " he said .
" Today , investment banks , the pride of Wall Street , have virtually ceased to exist .
In just 12 months , they have posted losses exceeding the profits they made in the last 25 years .
This example alone reflects the real situation better than any criticism . "
" Excessive dependence on a single reserve currency is dangerous for the global economy , " Putin said , calling for multiple reserve currencies in addition to the dollar .
" The time for enlightenment has come , " he went on .
" We must calmly , and without gloating , assess the root causes of this situation and try to peek into the future . "
The failure to " duly heed tremendous risks " and " substandard regulation " are among the causes Putin cited , along with " colossal " disproportions between " the scale of financial operations and the fundamental value of assets . "
" The entire economic growth system , where one regional centre prints money without respite and consumes material wealth , while another regional centre manufactures inexpensive goods and saves money printed by other governments , has suffered a major setback , " Putin added .
" A considerable share of the world 's population still cannot afford comfortable housing , education and quality health care .
Even a global recovery posted in the last few years has failed to radically change this situation . "
Officer faces rebuke in handling of Texan Officer faces rebuke in handling of RB Moats
Texans player was trying to make it to dying mother - in- law
Recommended Video :
A Dallas policeman who refused to allow Texans running back Ryan Moats and his family to reach the bedside of a dying family member was placed on administrative leave Thursday and chastised by the city ’s police chief for lack of compassion , discretion and common sense .
Police Chief David Kunkle said administrative charges will be levied against officer Robert Powell , who detained Moats and family members at Baylor Regional Medical Center in Plano after they raced through suburban Dallas in the early morning hours of March 18 , twice rolling through red lights , in an effort to share the final moments of Moats ’ mother - in - law .
Jonetta Collinsworth , 45 , the mother of Moats ’ wife , Tamishia , died as Moats and his father - in - law stood by the players ’ car while Powell threatened to jail the men and said , “ I can screw you over . ”
“ I am embarrassed and disappointed by ( Powell ’s ) behavior , ” Kunkle said .
“ His behavior , in my opinion , did not exhibit the common sense , the discretion , the compassion that we expect our officers to exhibit .
“… At the point the officer was told that they were responding to a dying family member , that should have been his concern . ”
Moats , in an interview with a Dallas radio station , said the officer ’s intransigence robbed him and his father - in - law of irreplaceable moments in a time of grief that morphed , after the officer pulled a weapon on Moats and his wife , into moments of confusion and terror .
Dallas police officer Robert Powell is seen in this undated photo provided by the Dallas Police Department via The Dallas Morning News .
Powell was placed on paid leave pending an internal investigation .

“ All I know is what he did was wrong , ” Moats told Dallas station KRLD - FM .
“ He stole a moment from me that I can never get back . ”
Moats said in the radio interview that he and his family left his home in Frisco for the hospital after being told that Jonetta Collinsworth , who suffered from breast cancer , was near death .
He said he drove with the emergency lights flashing on his SUV and twice drove through red lights as he approached the hospital , but only after receiving hand signals from motorists that it was safe for him to proceed .
Video shot by the police car ’s dashboard camera indicated that Powell pursued Moats for about a minute , with lights flashing and most of that time with his siren blaring , before the player stopped his SUV outside the hospital ’s emergency entrance .
Moats and his wife told The Dallas Morning News that Powell pointed his gun at each of them as they got out of the vehicle .
A Dallas police supervisor told the newspaper it is not uncommon for officers to display a weapon during a traffic stop if they feel threatened .
Moats said Tamishia Moats and her aunt ran into the hospital as the officer turned his attention to him and to his father - in - law , who also was in the SUV .
The police video recording includes several terse exchanges between Powell and Moats , even after the player repeatedly told the officer that he was rushing to the side of a dying relative .
“ You really want to go through this right now ? ” Moats said .
“ My mother - in - law is dying , right now . ”
A nurse and hospital security guards also confirmed the player ’s story to Powell .
“ Shut your mouth , ” Powell said at one point .
“ You can cooperate and settle down , or I can just take you to jail for running a red light . ”
Powell detailed the player and his father - in - law for about 13 minutes , according to the police tape , and as Moats signed a ticket for running a red light , said , “ Attitude ’s everything .
All you had to is stop , tell me what is going on .
More than likely , I would have let you go . ”
Kunkle said Moats exhibited “ extraordinary restraint in dealing with the behavior of our officer .
At no time did Mr. Moats identify himself as an NFL football player or expect any kind of special consideration . ”
A Dallas police spokesman said the traffic citation has been dismissed .
During the KRLD - FM interview Thursday , Moats said , “ I could n’t say anything that would make him ( Powell ) calm down .
He said a lot of stuff to me .
…
He really , you could say , stuck it to me , I guess . ”
Kunkle said Powell , who was placed on paid leave and assigned to dispatch duty , told a supervisor he was doing his job and “ believed he had not acted inappropriately . ”
Asked by talk show hosts Kevin Scott and Greg Hill if he thought the case had racial overtones , Moats , 26 , replied , “ I ca n’t be the judge of that . ”
Moats is African - American , and Powell , 25 , is white .
“ I would hope that people would think of it as a human being and not a race thing , ” he said .
“ This should anger any race , because that could be your mother .
That could be somebody else ’s mother dying in a hospital .
That is something that you can not get back .
It ’s gone , you know .
That time is gone . ”
Moats , who played for Bishop Lynch High School in Dallas and for Louisiana Tech , has been in the NFL for three seasons and has been with the Texans since 2008 .
DeMaurice Smith , executive director of the NFL Players Association , said the NFLPA is ready to offer assistance to both the Moatses and Dallas police .
“ I expressed my condolences to Ryan ’s family and I am very sorry for their loss , " Smith said .
" I have also spoken with the Dallas Police Dept about their continued investigation of this matter and appreciated their swift reaction with respect to this incident .
" We stand by to offer any assistance asked of us and Mr. Moats ’ family . "
“ Our thoughts and prayers go out to Ryan and his family , ” Texans spokesman Tony Wyllie said .
“ They ’re dealing with a terrible loss in the family as well as an emotional situation . ”

IN GREEK legend , the hydra was a many - headed monster .
If a head was severed , it grew back .
Indeed , in some versions of the story , two new heads sprouted .
Some scientists wonder whether cold fusion is a similar beast .
On March 23rd , 20 years to the day since Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons announced that they had accomplished nuclear fusion at room temperature in apparatus built on a laboratory bench ( they had n't ) , experimental results purporting to demonstrate such cold fusion were presented to a meeting of the American Chemical Society in Salt Lake City , Utah .
Cold fusion is so called to distinguish it from the sort that goes on in stars and hydrogen bombs .
That needs a temperature of several million degrees .
If cold fusion worked , it could provide an inexhaustible supply of clean energy .
But it has been cold - shouldered by most scientists .
Funding has dried up .
What research there is , is conducted outside mainstream laboratories .
In fact , its advocates have renamed their endeavours “ low - energy nuclear reactions ” because cold fusion has received such a drubbing .
That is because most scientists think it impossible .
Fusion involves colliding small atomic nuclei together to form larger ones , and thus releasing energy .
Because nuclei are positively charged , they are mightily difficult to push together .
That is why high temperatures ( and also high pressures ) are thought by most physicists to be essential to the process .
Exactly how two hydrogen nuclei could fuse at room temperature has not been elaborated .
But proponents of cold fusion think it is possible .
Rearing another head
To try to persuade their fellow researchers of the reality of cold fusion , Pamela Boss and her colleagues decided to search for evidence of the presence of high - energy neutrons , which should be produced when two nuclei fuse .
Dr Boss works for the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Centre in San Diego , California , an organisation that develops communication systems for the American navy .
The experiment that she thinks results in cold fusion uses an electrochemical technique in which two electrodes are plunged into an electrolyte made from a recipe that includes heavy water .
Heavy water gets its name because it contains deuterium , a form of hydrogen that has a neutron in its nucleus as well as the usual proton and thus weighs twice as much as the ordinary sort .
Deuterium is easier to fuse than simple hydrogen , and so is favoured in these sorts of experiments .
Dr Boss and her colleagues reported that one of the electrodes in their experiment got hot , an effect they attribute to fusion .
Most researchers in the field , though , do not accept that heat is sufficient evidence of fusion ( if only because it was the basis of the Pons / Fleischmann claim ) .
So to strengthen her case , Dr Boss placed a special plastic called CR - 39 next to the hot electrode .
If fusion was taking place , then neutrons flying through the plastic would cause protons within the material to recoil , leaving telltale tracks .
Studying CR - 39 under a microscope and counting the number of tracks is a standard way to assess how many neutrons bowled past .
Dr Boss and her colleagues reckon they have seen enough tracks to provide evidence for the emergence of high - energy neutrons from their experiment .
They published the results earlier this year in Naturwissenschaften .
Dr Boss told the meeting , “ taking all the data together , we have compelling evidence that nuclear reactions are stimulated by electrochemical processes . ”
Certainly there would appear to be something strange going on .
But even if Dr Boss 's results really are evidence of high - energy neutrons , many physicists will continue to deny that cold fusion could be real .
That is because there is no theoretical explanation for electrochemical cold fusion within the existing laws of physics .
A more plausible approach could come from bubble fusion .
This technique , which was first reported in 2002 by Rusi Taleyarkhan of Purdue University , is not strictly cold fusion since it uses imploding bubbles to generate the high temperatures and pressures which conventional physics requires as a condition for fusion .
But you can do bubble - fusion experiments on a table top using apparatus that costs thousands of dollars rather than billions , so they are conducted in the same spirit as Dr Boss 's work .
Unfortunately bubble fusion is also mired in controversy .
Dr Taleyarkhan described to the meeting a theoretical paper that would appear to confirm that fusion is indeed possible within such imploding bubbles .
Some of his colleagues , though , disagreed with his original findings .
After a very public spat , Dr Taleyarkhan sued two of them , claiming that they had made defamatory remarks about him .
Earlier this month , he reached a settlement with one of them , the details of which are confidential .
However the university launched a series of its own investigations that eventually found Dr Taleyarkhan guilty of scientific misconduct .
Purdue stripped Dr Taleyarkhan of his professorship last year , although he remains on the staff .
The hydra was eventually slain by Heracles ( or Hercules , as he was known to the Romans ) .
He did it by cauterising the monster 's severed necks to prevent regrowth before removing its final head with his bare hands because no weapon could do it .
While many physicists would like to perform a similar trick on cold fusion , two decades on , the creature is proving surprisingly resilient .
Static Typing for a Faulty Lambda Calculus .
David Walker .
Lester Mackey .
Jay Ligatti , George A. Reis , and David I. August .
A transient hardware fault occurs when an energetic particle strikes a transistor , causing it to change state .
These faults do not cause permanent damage , but may result in incorrect program execution by altering signal transfers or stored values .
While the likelihood that such transient faults will cause any significant damage may seem remote , over the last several years transient faults have caused costly failures in high - end machines at America Online , eBay , and the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center , among others .
Because susceptibility to transient faults is proportional to the size and density of transistors , the problem of transient faults will become increasingly important in the coming decades .
This paper defines the first formal , type - theoretic framework for studying reliable computation in the presence of transient faults .
More specifically , it defines lambda - zap , a lambda calculus that exhibits intermittent data faults .
In order to detect and recover from these faults , lambda - zap programs replicate intermediate computations and use majority voting , thereby modeling software - based fault tolerance techniques studied extensively , but informally .
To ensure that programs maintain the proper invariants and use lambda - zap primitives correctly , the paper defines a type system for the language .
This type system guarantees that well - typed programs can tolerate any single data fault .
To demonstrate that lambda - zap can serve as an idealized typed intermediate language , we define a type - preserving translation from a standard simply - typed lambda calculus into lambda - zap .
Evo Morales , the Bolivian leader , ate a coca leaf in front of delegates at the UN summit on drugs yesterday , to underline his demand that the raw ingredient of cocaine should be allowed for medicinal and other uses .
President Morales , a former peasant coca farmer , brandished the leaf during an impassioned speech , saying : " This is coca leaf , this is not cocaine , this is part and parcel of a culture . "
He told ministers that the ban on coca was a " major historical mistake " .
He added : " It has no harmful impact , no harmful impact at all in its natural state .
It causes no mental disturbances , it does not make people run mad , as some would have us believe , and it does not cause addiction . "

Coca is commonly used in Bolivia and Peru to stave off hunger and altitude sickness , as well as being used in cooking .
Mr Morales , who also said that he was dedicated to tackling the trade in illicit drugs , including cocaine , said that he hoped US President Barack Obama would support his campaign .
" The new US President has similarities to me , " he said .
" Before , nobody believed that an Indian could be president and nobody thought that a black man could be president of the United States . "
Website sensation Twitter is losing more than half of new users each month
Those who Twitter are usually quitters according to a company that measures internet traffic .
The social networking site became a sensation overnight after it was praised by celebrities including Oprah Winfrey and Stephen Fry .
Audience figures shot up to seven million unique visitors this February compared to 475,000 the same month a year ago .
Star support : Oprah Winfrey is seen twittering with Evan Williams , CEO of Twitter
But research company Nielsen Online revealed that 60 per cent of users stop using the free website just a month after joining it .
' There simply are n't enough new users to make up for defecting ones after a certain point , ' Nielsen 's David Martin said .
In contrast the more established Facebook and MySpace manage to keep 70 per cent of their fans .
Twitter was created three years ago and lets people post 140 - character messages or ' tweets ' that can be viewed by friends who have agreed to ' follow ' them online .
They can be sent to the site using a computer or mobile .

Users can also follow celebrity Twitterers such as Ashton Kutcher and Jonathan Ross , who regularly post their musings and photographs on the site .
The site has also played a part in several breaking news stories .
Dramatic scenes from a US Airways emergency landing on the Hudson River were uploaded to Twitter by user Janis Krums who was aboard a ferry used to rescue the stranded passengers .
His caption read : ' There 's a plane in the Hudson .

Crazy .'
During the Mumbai terror attacks citizen journalists tweeted about events as they unfolded on the ground using their mobiles .
But unless more users continue with the service after they join , Twitters days could be numbered .
' Twitter has enjoyed a nice ride over the last few months , ' Mr Martin said .
' But it will not be able to sustain its meteoric rise without establishing a higher level of user loyalty . '

Skehan , 81 , was sentenced Tuesday to 14 months in prison and seven years probation after pleading guilty in January to a charge of grand theft of over $ 100,000 .
Guinan , 66 , was sentenced Wednesday to four years in prison after taking the case to trial and being found guilty of a lesser charge of theft under $ 100,000 .
Judge Jeffrey Colbath imposed the prison term on Skehan despite requests from prosecutors , defense lawyers and the Diocese of Palm Beach for probation only , the Palm Beach Post reported .
“ The court finds the defendant is not merely sorry because he got caught , but is truly shameful , embarrassed and remorseful , ” the newspaper quoted Colbath as saying .
“ The crime of the defendant was pure greed unmasked .
There was not a shred of moral necessity to excuse the defendant ’s crime , ” he added .
Judge Krista Marx said Guinan must be punished for “ unmitigated greed and unmitigated gall , ” Fort Lauderdale ’s Sun Sentinel newspaper reported .
“ No matter how many good works you have performed in your many years as a priest , your legacy will always be one of thievery and deceit , ” she said .
When the priests were charged in September 2006 , police said they had channeled money from collection plates into secret slush funds , using some of it for church projects and part for vacations , property and gambling trips to Las Vegas and the Bahamas .
Investigators said Skehan , a priest for more than 50 years , invested heavily in rare coins , owned a cottage and a pub in Ireland , a $ 455,000 penthouse condominium in Singer Island , Florida , and another apartment in Delray Beach .
Forensic accountants hired by the diocese found that $ 8.7 million had been misappropriated from the St. Vincent Ferrer Church during the tenures of Skehan and his successor , Guinan .
Recently we found out that , according to Google 's search , 303,000 people out there were " extremely terrified of Chinese people " .
We got deeper into Humanity 's brain , and got a list of hilarious and scary findings :

April 27 , 2009 --
The FDA and the CDC are advising people not to eat raw alfalfa sprouts after at least 31 people were sickened by Salmonella Saintpaul infection .
Those cases have occurred in six states : Michigan , Minnesota , Pennsylvania , South Dakota , Utah , and West Virginia .
Most of the patients reported eating raw alfalfa sprouts .
Cases began in March and are still being reported .
According to the FDA , an investigation shows that the problem may be linked to contamination of seeds for alfalfa sprouts .
The FDA and the CDC note that suspect lots of seeds may be sold around the country and may account for a large proportion of the alfalfa seeds being used by sprout growers , and cases of illness are spread across multiple states .
The warning does n't apply to any other type of sprouts , just raw alfalfa sprouts .
But the FDA and the CDC always recommend that people at high risk for complications , such as the elderly , young children , and people with compromised immune systems , not eat raw sprouts because of the risk of contamination with salmonella or other bacteria .
Salmonella can cause fever , diarrhea ( which may be bloody ) , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain .
Severe cases are more common in the elderly , young children , and people with compromised immune systems .
Bale has signed up to star in three Terminator movies Film star Christian Bale has called a US radio station to apologise for a tirade which was leaked onto the internet , calling it " inexcusable " .
The actor spoke to Los Angeles - based station KROQ , and admitted that " I acted like a punk " .
He added : " I was out of order beyond belief .
I make no excuses for it . "
Bale , 35 , launched into his three - minute rant on the set of his new film Terminator Salvation when a crew member walked into his eye - line during a take .
He was heard screaming threats and swearing at Shane Hurlbut , who was in charge of the film 's photography .
' Resolved completely ' Speaking to presenters Kevin Ryder and Gene " Bean " Baxter , an embarrassed Bale admitted he had taken things too far .
He said : " The thing that disturbs me so much is that I 've heard a lot of people saying that I seem to think that I 'm better than anybody else .
" Nothing could be further from the truth .
I am a very lucky and that is why I put so much into what I do , and why I care so much about it and why sometimes my enthusiasm just goes awry . "
Bale plays freedom fighter John Connor in Terminator : Salvation
In the new movie , Bale plays the main character John Connor who is battling to save humans in the future being wiped out by robots .
Bale insisted the scene that was interrupted was key to the story and he was " trying to convey " the madness his character had inherited from his mother , Sarah Connor , from 1991's hit movie Terminator 2 : Judgement Day .
He said : " I completely mixed up fact and fiction , I 'm half John Connor , I 'm half Christian there . "
Bale dismissed his threats of getting Hurlbut fired as " hot air " and told the station that they had reconciled since the showdown .
He said : " I 've not only talked with him , we have resolved this completely .
" That very day we kept working for a number of hours .
And we worked together for at least a month after that .
There is no problem whatsoever .
" I 've seen a rough cut of the movie and he has done a wonderful job .
It looks fantastic , " added the star .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Investors in GameStop Corp. may have panicked earlier this month on the news that Amazon.com was entering into the used video - game space , but a new study suggests that the slumping economy may help make room for plenty of competitors in the market .
On March 5 , Amazon AMZN , - 0.91 % announced a new service through which customers could trade in used video games through its site , in exchange for store credit .
The news immediately caused a sharp sell - off on shares of GameStop GME , +2.57 % , a Grapevine , Texas - based retail chain that specializes in video - game sales and derives nearly half of its gross profit from the sale of used games .
GameStop saw its stock drop more than 20 % in the two days following the announcement .
See full story .
However , according to a report Tuesday from Electronic Entertainment Design and Research , a market research firm that focuses on the video - game market , GameStop is unlikely to see much of its core business threatened by the far larger online retail giant .
" Based upon our research , we believe Amazon 's used program will be both successful and profitable , " the report read .
" We also believe that most of Amazon 's new business will come from the expansion of the used video game software market rather than from stealing market share from competitors like GameStop , Game Rush , EBay , or Game Crazy . "
Read more about the EEDAR study .
Amazon does not break out specifics of its video - game business .
Sales of media products -- which include books , games DVDs and music -- totaled nearly $ 11.1 billion last year , more than half of the company 's total revenue base .
GameStop said it expects revenue for the year ended Jan. 30 to total about $ 8.8 billion , based on preliminary data announced last month .
Full results are scheduled for March 26 .
According to the EEDAR report , GameStop is likely to retain its advantage in the used market with core gamers , who often use the company 's stores to trade in older titles to get credit on new releases when they come out .
As Amazon will be unable to match that sort of " instant gratification , " its own service is more likely to appeal to people seeking credit for other types of merchandise .
Amazon may also do well with customers who need to turn in games because they are tight on cash during the economic slump , the report said .
" We believe there are considerable quantities of consumers -- especially in today 's economy -- who are low on funds , but are too embarrassed to do in - person trade - ins , " the study read .
Other analysts are confident that GameStop can maintain its business against competition from Amazon and others .
" We note that Amazon [ and eBay ] have sold pre-owned video games for years through its third - party marketplace , " wrote Colin Sebastian of Lazard Capital Markets in a March 5 note .
" Importantly , we believe GameStop still offers a unique in - store value proposition for core gamers , and believe that its pre-owned business should continue to thrive . "
The slowing economy also fuels retailers looking to expand their profit margins .
Gross margins on the sale of used games often tops 50 % compared to just 20 % for new titles , the study said .
Toy retailer Toys R '
Us has also announce plans to enter the used - game market .
The expansion of the used market is not welcome news to video - game publishers such as Electronic Arts ERTS , Activision Blizzard ATVI , - 1.42 % , THQ Inc. THQI and Take - Two Interactive TTWO , - 1.86 % .
But the EEDAR study notes that until video games can move to an all - digital distribution channel , publishers will be forced to maintain good relationships with retail companies .
" The unfortunate truth for video game publishers and developers is that retailers are in the driver 's seat , " the report read .
" With retailer 's commanding control of the video game retail environment , there is little that publishers or developers can do to curtail the sale of used video games in the short - term . "
Do n't touch that dial , folks , because the future of the internet has arrived !
Hulu has been streaming full - length movies for years now , and in an effort to compete , YouTube has begun posting full - length movies as well .

SIX classic Werner Herzog movies .
( For those of you who do n't know , Herzog is one of the most fascinating and polarizing directors alive , currently best known for the documentaries Grizzly Man and Encounters at the End of the World , which was nominated for ( but did n't win ) an Oscar this year .
He 's also famous for taking a bullet during an interview , but refusing to stop the taping . )
Back in the 70s , though , Herzog was just about the craziest thing behind a camera , and his enigmatic , powerful films continue to win converts today .
So without further ado -- clear your schedules -- here are six full - length Werner Herzog classics .
Even Dwarves Started Small
The inmates have taken over an institution in a bleak and savage world in which everyone 's a dwarf .
Never one to take the easy path , Werner Herzog followed the success of his first feature with a film that shocked , disturbed and enraged critics and audiences around the world , yet whose influence can still be seen today in the works of filmmakers such as David Lynch and Harmony Korine .
Featuring a cast composed entirely of little people , Even Dwarfs Started Small is a brutal , uncompromising allegory about the consequences of imprisonment and rebellion .
Fitzcarraldo
Also known as : the movie where Werner Herzog forced his crew to drag a 320 - ton steamship over a mountain ( without special effects ) , a feat he was so proud of that he dubbed himself " conquistador of the useless . "
All in order to dramatize the true story of a rubber baron in jungles of 19th century Peru , whose great dream is to bring together Enrico Caruso and Sarah Bernhardt for one great celebration of Grand Opera .
With the aid of a tribe of Indians bewitched by records featuring the voice of the greatest singer of all time , Fitzcarraldo fights fever , mosquitoes and suffocating heat to achieve the impossible .
Aguirre The Wrath Of God
In the mid-16th century , after annihilating the Incan empire Gonzalo Pizarro ( Allejandro Repulles ) leads his army of conquistadors over the Andes into the heart of the most savage environment on Earth in search of the fabled City of Gold , El Dorado .
As the soldiers battle starvation , Indians , the forces of nature , and each other , Don Lope de Aguirre ( Klaus Kinski ) , The Wrath Of God , is consumed with visions of conquering all of South America and revolts , leading his own army down a treacherous river on a doomed quest into oblivion .
Featuring a seething , controlled performance from Kinski , this masterpiece from director Werner Herzog is an unforgettable portrait of madness and power .
Little Dieter Needs to Fly
This original documentary delves into the true story behind the recent theatrical hit Rescue Dawn .
As a young boy , Dieter Dengler watched as Allied planes destroyed his village .
From that instant , he knew that he wanted to fly .
So at 18 , he moved to America , enlisted in the Navy , and was promptly shipped off to Vietnam .
During one of his first missions , however , Dengler was shot down over Laos and taken prisoner .
Despite torture he , escaped , and after a harrowing journey through the jungle on foot , returned home .
Today , even comfort and success cannot dispel the demons of his past .
In this remarkable , award - winning documentary , director Werner Herzog returns to the jungle with Dengler , to tell an incredible tale of courage and survival against impossible odds .
Woyzeck
In Werner Herzog 's brilliant adaptation of George Buchner 's Woyzeck , Klaus Kinski delivers a wild and stunning performance in a role only he could play .
Franz Woyzeck ( Kinski ) is a hapless , hopeless soldier , alone and powerless in society , assaulted from all sides by forces he cannot control .
Abused and tortured , both physically and psychologically by commanding officers , doctors , and his unfaithful wife Marie ( Eva Mattes , Best Supporting Actress at Cannes ) , Woyzeck struggles to hold on to his humanity and his fragile sanity .
In the film 's shattering climax , he is finally driven over the brink into madness and murder .
( Note : Tom Waits and August Wilson also adapted the Woyzeck story , into an opera that you can still occasionally catch touring .
Waits ' album Blood Money is comprised of the songs he wrote for the opera . )
The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser
( Also known as Every Man for Himself and God Against All . )
In 1828 , as if out of nowhere , a young man appeared in Nuremberg 's town square .
He had no history , spoke only a few words , and could not stand upright .
Having been locked in a basement for 17 years , Kaspar Hauser was more beast than man .
Who was he , and where did he come from ?
Despite attempts by townsfolk to understand and civilize him , Kaspar became little more than a sideshow attraction .
And though the mystery of his origins remained unanswered , perhaps the biggest question of all was , why did someone want him dead ?
Based on a true story , Werner Herzog 's poignant , often funny , and unforgettable tale of " the enigma of the century " -- punctuated by a brilliant performance by Bruno S. -- will haunt viewers .
( I could write a post all its own about Bruno S. , the enigmatic and mentally disabled non-actor who Herzog plucked from the streets of Berlin in in the 1970s to star in two of his greatest masterworks , Kaspar Hauser and Strozcek .
He has n't acted since . )
To the Editor :
Re “ Drug Cartel Violence Spills Over From Mexico , Alarming U.S. ” ( “ War Without Borders ” series , front page , March 23 ) :
The drug violence spilling over into the United States is fueled by the profits illegal drugs produce .
Mexican drug cartels send us the drugs some Americans want to buy .
We send them cash and weapons .
When drug suppliers compete for American market share or try to collect bad debts , violence is the inevitable result .
All too often , Americans uninvolved in the drug trade are victims .
The war on drugs has failed .
The solution is obvious .
We must find a path to legalization , as we did when we ended Prohibition .
Legalization does not mean that we approve of drug use or that drugs now illegal are safe to use .
But the violence caused because drugs are illegal and the expense of law enforcement and incarceration outweigh the cost of managing drug use as a public health problem .
We do that now for smoking and alcohol .
Why should these other drugs be treated differently , especially when the current strategy is so obviously failing ?
Mr. Obama is unlikely to push for specific commitments from other countries on stimulus spending to bolster their own economies , White House officials acknowledged Saturday in a teleconference call , despite the fact that administration officials would like to see European countries , in particular , increase their spending to try to prompt a global economic recovery .
“ Nobody is asking any country to come to London to commit to do more right now , ” said Michael Froman , deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs .
Instead , world leaders at the meeting will try to “ do whatever is necessary to restore global growth , ” Mr. Froman said .
The challenges stem in part from lingering unhappiness around the world at the way the Bush administration used American power .
But they have been made more intense by the sense in many capitals that the United States is no longer in any position to dictate to other nations what types of economic policies to pursue  or to impose its will more generally as it intensifies the war in Afghanistan and extracts itself from Iraq .
“ There is a direct challenge under way to the paradigms that America has been trying to sell to the rest of the world , ” said Eswar S. Prasad , a former China division chief at the International Monetary Fund .
The American banking collapse , which precipitated the global meltdown , has led to a fundamental rethinking of the American way as a model for the rest of the world .
Yet even as his presence stirs opposition to particular American policies , Mr. Obama is being welcomed by many Europeans as an embodiment of American ideals .
In Prague , where Mr. Obama will stop later in the week , local officials are installing a hot line for residents to find out about street closings .
In Strasbourg , France , site of a NATO meeting , protesters are planning an “ international resistance camp ” with antiwar actions designed to press Mr. Obama to get American troops out of Afghanistan .
In Istanbul , his last stop , workers are polishing up the Hagia Sophia basilica - cum - mosque - cum - museum for the expected visit .
New research shows that for millions of years carbon dioxide has been stored safely and naturally in underground water in gas fields saturated with the greenhouse gas .
The findings – published in Nature April 1 – bring carbon capture and storage a step closer .
Politicians are committed to cutting levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to slow climate change .
Carbon capture and storage is one approach to cut levels of the gas until cleaner energy sources are developed .
But the risks around the long - term storage of millions of cubic metres of carbon dioxide in depleted gas and oil fields has met with some concern , not least because of the possibility of some of the gas escaping and being released back to the atmosphere .
Until now , researchers could n't be sure how the gas would be securely trapped underground .
Naturally - occurring carbon dioxide can be trapped in two ways .
The gas can dissolve in underground water – like bottled sparkling water .
It can also react with minerals in rock to form new carbonate minerals , essentially locking away the carbon dioxide underground .
Previous research in this area used computer models to simulate the injection of carbon dioxide into underground reservoirs in gas or oil fields to work out where the gas is likely to be stored .
Some models predict that the carbon dioxide would react with rock minerals to form new carbonate minerals , while others suggest that the gas dissolves into the water .
Real studies to support either of these predictions have , until now , been missing .
To find out exactly how the carbon dioxide is stored in natural gas fields , an international team of researchers - led by the University of Manchester - uniquely combined two specialised techniques .
They measured the ratios of the stable isotopes of carbon dioxide and noble gases like helium and neon in nine gas fields in North America , China and Europe .
These gas fields were naturally filled with carbon dioxide thousands or millions of years ago .
They found that underground water is the major carbon dioxide sink in these gas fields and has been for millions of years .
Dr Stuart Gilfillan , the lead researcher who completed the project at the University of Edinburgh said : " We 've turned the old technique of using computer models on its head and looked at natural carbon dioxide gas fields which have trapped carbon dioxide for a very long time . "
" By combining two techniques , we 've been able to identify exactly where the carbon dioxide is being stored for the first time .
We already know that oil and gas have been stored safely in oil and gas fields over millions of years .
Our study clearly shows that the carbon dioxide has been stored naturally and safely in underground water in these fields . "
Professor Chris Ballentine of the University of Manchester , the project director , said : " The universities of Manchester and Toronto are international leaders in different aspects of gas tracing .
By combining our expertise we have been able to invent a new way of looking at carbon dioxide fields .
This new approach will also be essential for monitoring and tracing where carbon dioxide captured from coal - fired power stations goes when we inject it underground – this is critical for future safety verification . "
Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar of the University of Toronto and co-author of the study hopes the new data can be fed into future computer models to make modelling underground carbon capture and storage more accurate .
The work was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .
apologists , compromises and small gods
The fellows at the John Templeton Foundation have a new idea of reconciling science and religion : mealy - mouth , vague apologetics .
As long as there ’s been tension between new scientific discoveries and religious dogmas , there has been an endless supply of pundits and commentators trying to bridge the gap .
Their language is usually measured to an extreme , but sometimes they ’ll veer off to quote their personal beliefs like so :
while some naturalistic philosophers have developed ethical systems without God , many other naturalists acknowledge this does n’t work and that such ethical systems are entirely arbitrary .
This quote comes from BioLogos , a project of the covertly theistic John Templeton Foundation ran by a small group of scientists who just happen to be Christian apologists .
And what they seem to be trying to tell us in a small treatise on the nature of good and evil is that if there was no God , then what we consider right or wrong and moral or immoral would vary by culture , custom and sect .
Why am I not swayed by this argument ?
Well , if the writers who thought of this premise spent more than five minutes in anthropology class , they would know that it ’s exactly what happens out there in the real world .
Different cultures and religious groups have their own rules , traditions and ideas of ethics .
Yes , everyone says we should be respectful , honest and fair to each other but the devil here is in the details .
What constitutes this respect and honesty for a particular culture ?
In one country , a man shaking hands with a woman he just met is considered respectful and in good taste .
In another , the woman ’s husband or father would demand the man ’s head on a stick for his act of disrespect .
If our ethical and moral rules are so universal because of God ’s hand in society , how would we reconcile that two societies with religious beliefs have such different standards ?
The modern apologetics movement and the groups who want to force science to reconcile with any religious belief that has enough political pull remind me of Terry Prachett ’s novel Small Gods .
The story ’s premise is that a seemingly mighty and powerful god worshipped by countless people comes down to check on the vast empire built in his name but finds out that he ’s actually become a small god , a relatively powerless spirit that has to seek favor with other deities to make anything happen .
And yet , there are temples built in his name and he ’s feared as a mighty destroyer of infidels and the one true god of the land .
How did that happen ?
Well , somewhere along the way , people became more afraid of his supposed wrath and put their faith in the scriptures written in his name and the temples built by the clergy of his religion .
The belief was in the system , in securing your afterlife , in preparing your soul for life after death , in converting the unbelievers , in replacing any and all doubt or question with an absolute answer .
Today ’s apologists are trying to convert the heathens by deluding popular science with ham - handed statements on how a god could ’ve done all that behind some sort of cosmic curtain .
A number of groups insist on a shotgun marriage between science and religion to get friends in high places without rattling any nerves .
Their real goal and their real concern lies in appeasing vast institutions and be seen as heroes in the “ culture war ” by both sides , especially the religious one since it dominates the demographic landscape .
The vacuous arguments and lengthy speeches about how we should “ reconcile our differences ” come and go depending on how well they ’re received .
Old ones will be revised and new ones will be invented to achieve a political goal and the invocation of God has become a placeholder for a particular worldview and a permission to use a big question mark as an answer to life ’s tough questions .

It did n’t take Rush Limbaugh long to respond to President Obama ’s mocking of Fox News and people waving teabags .
On his radio show Limbaugh called this a bitter clinger moment for Obama who does n’t like the tea bag protesters .
He is also said that Obama is n’t the president of all the people .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Limbaugh said , “ Now this is not wise .
This is a man who is supposedly has great political instincts , correct ?
Barack Obama , this is a bitter clinger moment here .
He is looking at you people who went to the tea parties , and he does n’t like you at all , waving tea bags around , let me just remind them I happy to have a serious conversation about how we are gonna .
You know , he is not president of all the people .
I mean this guy .
He ’s cold and he is partisan . ”

It is ironic that Rush Limbaugh would criticize anyone for being cold and partisan .
Notice how Rush always works in the talking point .
Obama is cold and partisan .
Obama does n’t have great political instincts .
He even tries to connect the tea baggers to Obama ’s bitter and clinging remark before the PA primary last year .
Oh how soon they forget , John McCain and Sarah Palin tried to raise the bitter remark all through Pennsylvania in the general election , only to be routed in the state on Election Day .
Rush and the Republicans do n’t get it .
Character attacks do not work on Obama .
The president does n’t dislike the tea party protesters .
He thought the whole thing was a staged absurdity , which is why he joked about it .
The Democrats will gladly give the Republicans all of the tea baggers they want , because it wo n’t make a bit of difference in the next presidential election .
Sorry Rush , but by winning the election last year , Barack Obama became the president of all the people .
I disagreed with George W. Bush on almost everything , but he still was the president .
As long as you are an American citizen , the elected president represents all of the people .
For Rush to insist otherwise is un-American .

Here ’s the video .
Big thank you to Amanda Warr at BestofTexas who did all the heavy lifting on this .
Owing to the limits of video — and my own ham - fisted interview style on video — here ’s some extended remarks we both agreed on for before you watch the video that gives a little more context .
— — — — — — —— —— ——
The question that started this all was what makes Dallas safer when it comes to guns .
Is it people disarming themselves ?
Is it people arming themselves ?
We both had our preconceived notions about the answer when we started .
And our preconceived notions about the people who would show up – whatever their motivations .
Instead we met the councilman behind the buyback who told us “ You have to own guns . ”
We met people like Don Pogue and Curtis Jackson , who were just getting rid of old junk they had while keeping their good firearms at home .
We met gun lovers like Bryan Wendt , looking to make buyback attendees a better offer , but who on seeing the condition of most of what was turned in , said , “ Most of this stuff should be destroyed .
You ca n’t have people relying on these old pieces . ”
( He encouraged them to buy better arms . )
And we had a gun poseur who could n’t tell a piece of history from a piece of shit .
Here ’s the video and our extended concluding remarks , which were n’t clear as we ’d like in the first version of this .
( We ’ll have a higher res version up later . )
The fact is , one more gun turned in is n’t going to make the city of Dallas better .
Sure , it could be stolen and used in a crime .
Just as likely it could be used in defense .
And one more gun kept is n’t going to make Dallas any better , either .
It may be used to protect someone .
It may also be used by a kid because some dolt did n’t know how to properly store it .
Then we met Sonya Whitaker .
She told us how she was turning in an old rusty revolver her granddad gave her that was useless .
Her South Oak Cliff house had been burglarized twice , and she did n’t want some criminal getting it .
She also told us the police were n’t doing enough in South Oak Cliff to combat crime , and maybe turning in this old useless lump of iron might show good faith .
Sonya mused that if perhaps she showed that good faith , then perhaps her city would show faith in her community and patrol a little more often .
She complained about how the city told her neighbors they should hire off - duty cops for security – which sounds an awful lot like a mob scam more than a city service .
Sonya is a second generation Oak Cliffer .
She went to college and works at a Dallas hospital .
She made sure her son is going to college .
She has no intention of moving out of Oak Cliff no matter how well she does .
She ’s taking a stand .
She ’s putting pressure on the police to do something .
She ’s involved in her community .
Would she be safer if she owned a better gun and knew how to use it ?
Maybe .
But since she could n’t and probably would n’t bring it to where she works and she ’s been burglarized twice — maybe not .
Sonya ’s staying and fighting to make her little piece better .
She ’s staying where middle class people are needed most , trying to turn her neighborhood around .
And she ’s starting at home , with her son .
You know who is going to make Dallas better and safer ?
Not politicians , not police , not gun owners , and not anti-gun wieners .
It ’s people like Sonya .

( CNN ) -- Sudan ordered a number of international aid agencies to leave the country Wednesday after an arrest warrant was issued for the country 's president , a United Nations source in the capital city of Khartoum said .
Sudan 's President Omar Hassan al - Bashir waves to supporters in Khartoum on Wednesday .
The International Criminal Court issued the warrant earlier Wednesday for President Omar Hassan al - Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity .
It accuses him of complicity in a brutal campaign of violence against the people of Darfur , in the west of the country .
Sudan told as many as 10 humanitarian groups to leave Darfur , and seized the agencies ' assets , U.N. deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe said .
The aid groups include Oxfam , Solidarities and Mercy Corps , she said .
The exact number of groups involved was not given and some groups were not identified , both to protect their people on the ground in Sudan and because they are hoping to reverse the decision .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon is " concerned " about the reported expulsions , a spokeswoman said .
" He notes that this represents a serious setback to lifesaving operations in Darfur , and urges the government of Sudan to act urgently to restore these NGOs to their full operational status , " spokeswoman Michelle Montas said .
Sudanese government officials " have insisted on accompanying some ( international non-governmental organization ) staff members into their offices and taking lists of assets and staff , " Montas said .
She called the aid agencies who had been kicked out " the main providers of life - saving humanitarian services , such , as water , food , health , and sanitation .
Their departure will have an immediate and serious impact on the humanitarian and security situation in North Sudan , ( and ) especially in Darfur . "
Sudan 's ambassador to the U.N. declined to confirm any details on the subject .
But Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad said : " We will deal very firmly with any organization that is violating the hospitality and the laws of the country . "
The Dutch section of Medicins Sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) said in a statement it was " outraged " by the move , which leaves more than 200,000 of its patients without essential medical care .
Other sections of MSF continue to operate in Darfur , it said .
Oxfam , which is based in England , urged Sudan to reverse its decree .
" If Oxfam 's registration is revoked , it will affect more than 600,000 Sudanese people whom we provide with vital humanitarian and development aid , including clean water and sanitation on a daily basis , " Penny Lawrence , Oxfam 's International Director , said in a statement .
The agency 's statement added that " 400,000 of them are affected by the ongoing conflict in Darfur -- where people continue to flee from violence and the humanitarian needs remain enormous .
It will also affect another 200,000 poor people in the east of the country and Khartoum state . "
The agency has 450 staff in the country , 90 percent of whom are Sudanese , it said .
It emphasized in the statement that it has " absolutely no links to the ICC .
Oxfam does not have an opinion on the Court 's activities , and our sole focus is meeting humanitarian and development needs in Sudan . "
The International Rescue Committee , which has worked in Sudan for nearly 30 years , said that it had been ordered to close its programs as well .
" We are extremely distressed by the forced closure of our aid operations , " said George Rupp , the group 's president and CEO .
" It appears the international aid effort in the region is being shut down and that raises grave concerns about the welfare of millions of Sudanese people who rely on humanitarian aid for survival . "
The ICC order to arrest al - Bashir is the first warrant ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world 's only permanent war crimes tribunal , based at The Hague in the Netherlands .

Gaza � Ma�an � Sixteen out of the 28 killed in Israeli airstrikes since New Year�s
Eve were children ; nine were from the same family , nine of the adults killed were women .
The percentage of Israeli casualties that are children in 2009 is 57 % .
On Friday the bodies of the Rayan family children were buried , and Palestinian medical sources confirmed the deaths of three more Palestinians under 17 .
Seven Palestinians have been killed since midnight Thursday bringing the death toll to 428 and the injured to 2,220 on day seven of the Israeli operation .

But a study by Professor Massey and two colleagues , published in September , estimated that the previous tax increase cost New Jersey only 50 to 350 existing “ half - millionaire ” households  a relatively small number against the total of 44,000 such households in the state .
While those departures cost the state about $ 38 million a year in revenue , the study estimates , the higher taxes levied on those who stayed have brought in an average of $ 895 million a year .
Also in 2004 , California voters approved a 1 percent income tax surcharge on personal income over $ 1 million , and Silicon Valley and Beverly Hills appear to remain well populated with the wealthy .
From 2004 to 2007 , according to a study by the California Budget Project , a left - leaning research organization , the number of millionaire taxpayers rose by close to 50 percent , well outpacing the 8.6 percent growth in the total number of those paying personal income tax .
“ It is one of the oft - cited urban legends in California politics  that the rich are leaving California because of higher taxes , ” said Jean M. Ross , the project ’s executive director .
Between 2003 and 2005 , after the Sept. 11 attacks , New York State imposed a temporary surcharge on incomes of more than $ 100,000 , as did New York City .
While the city did lose residents at all income levels in 2005 , according to a 2007 study of population data published by the city comptroller , William C. Thompson Jr. , households with incomes of $ 250,000 and higher were the least likely to leave .
Some who study the issue theorize that other factors affecting people ’s decisions about moving  schools , jobs , even the weather  make it unlikely that a relatively small tax increase would drive those decisions .
In states like New York and California , hubs of culture and specific industries , people may also stay out of a desire to live and work near others like themselves .
“ People move to maximize their utility , ” Professor Massey said .
“ The $ 64,000 question is , what is their utility ?
There are taxes and income , but there are issues about jobs , local amenities in the state , family . ”
Some research suggests that very wealthy retirees will move when their home states raise income taxes or preserve estate taxes , though in small numbers .
And studies counting the number of wealthy taxpayers who stick around may not , of course , capture those who choose not to move to a state because of higher taxes .

Yes , we at Geeks are Sexy have discovered the cure for cancer !
And for this , we ask for nothing more in return than your eternal gratitude .
Ok , ok , so there are two small problems in the first sentence of this post .
First of all , we ’re a blog , not a well funded group of scientists ( well actually I ’m a scientist , but that ’s another matter ) .
Second , and more importantly , the hypothetical “ cure for cancer ” that is often tossed about in conversation is a misleading concept .
Let ’s explore this second point a little further .
The other day I read a great webcomic about the day to day life of a cancer researcher and I realized that a huge number of people still have no idea what cancer is or how we might combat it .
To the general public , cancer is a dark cloud that affects the old and those exposed to cancer - causing chemicals .
It is seen as a disease that afflicts humans without warning or consideration for the human condition .
This view , while not necessarily wrong , has lead to the concept of a single “ cure for cancer , ” much like that found in I Am Legend ( it causes the zombies , if you ’ve forgotten ) .
Unlike other afflictions , cancer is not the result of a foreign invader or an injury .
Instead , it is the failure of the body ’s natural growth controls .
Most body cells will grow and replicate , but only up to a certain point .
With each replication ( in a process called mitosis , depicted on the right ) , their genomes grow shorter until they reach a point where replication can no longer occur .
There are instances where the DNA can be extended repeatedly and the cell can essentially be “ immortalized . ”
Unfortunately , immortality in the world of cell biology is known as cancer .
Beyond just the “ first steps ” of cancer , the actual disease experienced by millions every year surfaces after a cancerous cell has multiplied and begun to essentially form a new organ , a tumor .
The tumor will redirect blood and nutrients toward itself and eventually colonize new areas of the body ( a stage called metastasis ) .
So what can we do to “ cure ” cancer ?
Well essentially cancer forming cells occur naturally in the body of every human over the course of his or her lifetime .
Normally these cells either recognize the error and “ commit suicide ” ( apoptosis ) or the immune system notices them and neutralizes them .
It is only in the rare instance of a mutation that allows a cell to replicate endlessly AND evade the immune system that cancer can develop .
Those seeking to treat the disease can either target cells that are rapidly dividing ( this is the strategy behind chemotherapy ) or remove tumors once they become large enough to target surgically .
Something that the aforementioned webcomic discusses is the plight of the molecular biologists researching cancer .
There is not just one type of cancer , but instead there are many ( The National Cancer Institute ’s general list of cancers will give you some idea , but the number is in the hundreds ) .
Every normal body cell can become cancerous and each of those cells has a different interaction with the body .
Some cancers have already been cured while others remain a challenge to obtain funding for .
Personally , as a young biologist , I ’ve thought about taking my new career toward cancer research , and believe me , it ’s fairly daunting .
Cancer ’s very definition as a complex regulatory disease means there will be no simple solutions and few big breakthroughs .
Progress has been made , but only through many years of painstaking experimentation , both in and out of the lab .
I hope those of you not in the biological sciences have gotten a little better understanding of cancer than you had when you began reading this article .
If we get good feedback we hope to make “ Science is Sexy ” a regular feature on GaS that will inform , entertain , and even occasionally editorialize in regards to a broad array of science topics .
I am a PhD student in Microbiology ( starting next semester ) , so topics in the life sciences will probably be more common , but hopefully we can branch out into other fields as well .
Please , please , please leave your thoughts about this article and ideas for future articles in the comments section below !

Have an unruly co-worker that you ’ve always wanted to smack with a frying pan ?
Looking for something fun to break the ice and start a conversation ?
If so , iSpank is for you .
Whether at school , in the office or on the dance floor , there ’s always a need for discipline – and iSpank puts the power in your hands .
Use it as a prank or just to get a quick laugh .
Choose from an array of spanking toys such as a paddle , a whip , a bottle – yes , even a chicken .
Each toy makes its own funny noise sure to turn heads and grab attention .
To spank , simply swing the iPhone ( or iPod Touch ) towards your target and flick your wrist .
Be sure to hold on – you may be laughing too hard to keep a good grip .
The Deluxe version includes the awesomely fun Spank - o - meter which measures the strength of your swing strongman style .
Compare your swing with your friends .
Who spanks the hardest ?
It ’s loads of fun !
I was at a show on Friday and after playing catch up with some fellow pervs , I mentioned that I ’d just found out about this app and wondered aloud if anyone had in iPhone so we could test it .
Within minutes a woman behind me was cracking a virtual whip over my head and we passed it around , giggling like fucking maniacs at the little screenshots and envious that , as a member of the iLess unwashed hoi polloi , we could n’t irritate friends and co-workers with this crazy fucking app .
But you can .
I ’ll upgrade to an iPhone when they make an “ Aftercare App ” that brings me virtual chocolate and tells me what a good girl I am , and how beautiful is my agony .
WAILUKU , Hawaii ( AP ) —
Free tickets to see Aerosmith in Hawaii ?
Dream on , unless you happen to be one of 8,300 people left in the cold when the band canceled a sold - out concert in 2007 .
Aerosmith has agreed to perform on Maui to settle a class - action lawsuit filed by fans who alleged the band pulled out of the show in favor of a larger concert in Chicago and a more lucrative private performance for Toyota dealers on Oahu .
The suit claimed the cancellation cost Maui ticket buyers between $ 500,000 and $ 3 million in travel costs , handling fees and other expenses .
" Everyone who bought a ticket to the original concert will receive a free ticket , and all out - of - pocket expenses will be reimbursed regardless of the amount , " said Brandee Faria , an attorney representing the would - be concertgoers .
The date for the new Maui concert has not been set , but Faria said it will likely be in September or October , after Aerosmith wraps up its North America tour .
Aerosmith attorney Jay Handlin said the band was glad to reach the settlement .
" The band is about the music , " Handlin said .
" So they are glad to be able to resolve this in a way that really focuses on connecting or reconnecting the people of Hawaii with the band and its music . "
US and Russia press reset button Russia and the US are to reopen negotiations about reducing their nuclear warheads , presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama have said .
The discussions will be the first such talks for more than a decade .
Mr Obama said earlier there were very real differences between Washington and Moscow , but that there was also a broad set of common interests .
The announcement came on the fringes of the G20 summit of world leaders which is convening in London .
Mr Medvedev has invited his American counterpart to visit Moscow in July - an invitation Mr Obama has accepted .
Russia and the US have also agreed to discuss " mutual international co-operation " , the two presidents said .
After their meeting , Mr Medvedev said he viewed prospects for future bilateral relations " with optimism " .
Korea concerns Please turn on JavaScript .

In a joint statement , the two leaders said they had ordered nuclear negotiators to report first results in July .
Mr Obama said the US and Russia would be in a much stronger position to strengthen the non-proliferation treaty if they were to lead by example and reduce their own nuclear arsenals .
It is hoped the talks will produce a new arms control treaty to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( Start ) that expires at the end of the year .
Agreed in 1991 , Start limits the world 's two largest nuclear arsenals to between 1,700 and 2,200 warheads .
This is the first tangible sign of the " re-setting " of the relationship between Moscow and Washington heralded by the Obama administration taking office , says the BBC 's diplomatic correspondent , Jonathan Marcus .
This development is important , our correspondent adds , because the hope is that if the nuclear weapons states give up more of their warheads , it will assist efforts to bolster the increasingly threadbare regime that seeks to guard against the spread of nuclear arms .
The presidents ' statement also called on Iran to co-operate with the UN nuclear watchdog and prove its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes - not for making atomic weapons .
The two presidents also agreed to work together on Afghanistan and expressed concern about an upcoming North Korean rocket launch .
World leaders are gathering in London to discuss ways to resolve the financial crisis , which Mr Obama has said was the most severe since World War II .

Here ’s a few reasons why :
The Bikeshed
One common mistake is to not want to leave anyone out of the meeting .
Especially if a team is tasked with designing something that affects many groups in the company .
They ’ll want at least one representative from all those groups if not more .
Granted , these people are smart , but like most smart developers they can’t resist helping build that bikeshed .
I ’ve seen a meeting lost after the first bullet point .
Tip : no more than 5 people at a meeting .
Presumptious
The typical design review meeting goes like this : a team spends weeks engineering a design ( or at least a strawman for one ) , then , they invite other team members to a review meeting giving them at most a few days to prepare .
What usually happens is that the other experts will notice things that are n’t quite right with the presented design .
When these items are shared , the immediate response is “ well , how would you fix it ? "
It is presumptious to believe these people can fix your design when they have spent but a fraction of the time you ’ve spent on it .
Now , of course , this implies that the design was n’t given to a team of junior engineers where the faults and fixes are obvious .
I ’ve seen some common notes on e.g. , scaling issues , security concerns , and performance problems that are brought up by reviewers .
What makes the meeting a waste of time is that when an immediate , all encompassing solution is not offered with the critique , it is ignored .
Therefore , why have this meeting in the first place .
Tip : Invite only experts whose opinion you value .
Get as much detail from their notes as possible ( I ’m not saying to not ask follow up questions ) then take their notes and solve the problem yourself or prove they are incorrect .
Do n’t Invite the CTO
This will surely cause the meeting to become a bikeshed argument .
After all , what CTO or upper manager could not offer something during a design meeting ?
What they should do is listen , keep the meeting on track if it starts to stray , and only , only , offer comments where the design is not in sync with company goals .
That last bit would almost never happen .
So , again , why are they at the meeting ?
Tip : do n’t invite micromanagement – if you ’re CTO is anything like mine you ’re meeting will get so side tracked with his attempts at faux - arbitration and " summing up ” that you ’ll be forced to call a smaller meeting anyway .
Now , I ’m not actually discouraging design reviews .
I think these massive meetings are pointless .
My best advice is to gather small groups together and do multiple meetings .
Try to choose the attendees judiciously ( for instance do n’t invite the guy who hates static polymorphism and the guy who hates runtime polymorphism to the same meeting ) so that you get the best bang for your buck .
A strange and confused chapter in the history of American medical research ended Monday morning , when President Obama signed an executive order ending a ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell lines that were developed after August 9 , 2001 .
The ban has been roundly denounced as hypocritical and destructive , stunting advances in one of the most exciting fields of medical research .
Some restrictions will still apply , and whether research will provide much - anticipated cures is an open question — but at least the question will be answered by science , with the government 's full weight behind it .
" This is a momentous occasion for anyone who believes in the pursuit of biomedical knowledge for the betterment of human health , " said Harvard Stem Cell Institute researcher George Daley .
Embryonic stem cells may be used to replace diseased and failing tissues , and treat now - incurable diseases , from cancer to Parkinson's .
Though most stem cell–based treatments are probably a decade away , some advances , like universal blood made from stem cells , could become available much sooner .
And now , with the ban lifted , money from the the National Institutes of Health's
$ 29 billion budget is likely to pour into the coffers of stem cell scientists across the nation , speeding up the pace of the research .
Over the last seven years , as the therapeutic promise grew , research on embryonic stem cells became a front in the culture wars , with lines drawn between religious fundamentalists and everyone else .
Thirteen states established state - funded stem cell research institutes like the mammoth $ 3 billion California Institute for Regenerative Medicine , but they could n't provide the same level of backing as the national government .
" This marks a new era for stem cell research .
It will not only impact research in the laboratory , but perhaps more importantly , it finally lifts the black cloud that has hovered over this research for so long .
We have been operating for the last decade with one hand tied behind our back , " said Robert Lanza , science director of Advanced Cell Technologies .
" For the first time in almost a decade , we can now apply for government grants to use our cells to treat human diseases .
Rather than keeping the cells in the freezer , now we can use them to help people . "
Though President Bush 's ban has received most of the attention , the political battle over embryo destruction and stem cell research actually dates to the Clinton administration , when Congress passed the little - known Dickey - Wicker amendment .
The law denies taxpayer money for research that creates or destroys embryos .
Creating and destroying embryos is central to a procedure called somatic - cell nuclear transfer , or therapeutic cloning : A nucleus is taken from one cell and put inside a hollowed - out embryo , which is allowed to divide for several days , producing embryonic stem cells that can become any other type of cell in the body .
Under Dickey - Wicker , however , the federal government could still fund research on the resulting cells — just not the original embryo creation and destruction .
President Bush banned government support for all therapeutic cloning research , from inception to application , and prevented research on cells manufactured in other ways .
Scientists could not use embryos discarded by fertility clinics , or from cells taken from embryos without destroying them .
This restricted government - funded research to exactly 21 embryonic stem - cell lines developed in the field 's early days .
Few are useful for anything but basic research .
Obama 's decision was criticized by opponents of embryonic stem cell research , who say that the cells ' medical promise is overhyped , and made unnecessary by advances in research on adult stem cells .
These develop into one cell type rather than a full range , and are relatively better understood than their embryonic counterparts .
" Human embryonic - stem cell - research is now passé , " said James Sherley , a
Boston Biomedical Research Institute biomedical engineer .
In 2007 ,
Sherley was denied tenure at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , a decision resulting , he alleged , from his scientifically unpopular opposition to ESC research .
" The most advertised property of human embryonic stem cells , their potential to produce any tissue type in the body , is also their worst failing .
The tissue types that they always produce are tumors . "
President Obama 's decision , he said , " will not promote human embryonic stem cell research .
However , it will put more resources in the hands of scientists who have been selfishly promoting dead - end research since 2001 . "
But most scientists and medical experts say that research is justified on all types of stem cells :
The insights generated in one type can inform another , just as breakthrough cell reprogramming research — driven , in part , by concerns over embryo destruction — required the identification of genes activated in embryonic stem cells .
Different diseases may also require different treatments ; a single type of stem cell may not suffice .
Comparing adult and embryonic stem cell research is also unfair , wrote University of Pennsylvania bioethicist Art Caplan in an MSNBC editorial .
" After eight years of zero - budget funding of embryonic stem cell research , it is hardly fair and completely disingenuous for critics to point to the practice and wonder why it lags four decades behind government - funded adult stem cell research , " he wrote .

Facing a 93 percent increase in free health care costs to people who cannot afford insurance , the University of Michigan Health System is being forced to take another look at the way they do business , according to hospital officials .
The health system — which provides care to more than 300,000 patients per year — spent $ 170 million of uncompensated care in fiscal year 2008 — almost double the $ 88 million it spent in fiscal year 2006 .
While the national economy has only experienced a downward trend since last fall , Michigan ’s economy has been suffering for years , weighed down by the fledgling auto industry and the nation ’s worst unemployment rate — now more than 11 percent according to U.S. Department of Labor .
As the state ’s economy worsens , the combination of benefit cuts and layoffs has left many Michigan residents on the perilous plateau of being too young to qualify for Medicare and too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid .
In the wake of this boom in charity care , hospitals are re-examining the ways in which they can continue to care for patients in emergency situations , regardless of the patient ’s insurance status , which they are required to do per a 1986 federal law .
Helen Levy , research assistant professor at the University 's Institute for Social Research , said the state ’s compounding unemployment problems have put a significant strain on Michigan ’s hospitals .
“ Because of the recession , fewer people can pay for health care services that they need , so hospitals will have to provide more uncompensated care , ” Levy said .
According to the Center for Healthcare Research & Transformation , from 2006 to 2007 , the number of Michigan residents who did n’t have health insurance increased from 10.5 percent to 11.6 percent of Michigan 's total population .
The increase in uninsured residents has forced the University health system to reorganize their priorities , said Shantell Kirkendoll , senior public relations representative for University Hospital .
“ We are absorbing the cost of charity care and bad debt as part of our overall budget planning , ” Kirkendoll said .
In addition to the $ 170 million of uncompensated direct patient care , Doug Strong , director and chief executive officer of the University Health System , reported at February ’s Board of Regents meeting that through community health programs and services and research costs in excess of funding , UMHS contributed a total community benefit of $ 323 million in the 2008 fiscal year .
“ It is increasingly difficult in this economic environment to provide the level of benefit to the community that it needs , ” Strong said at the February regents meeting .
“ Amidst all of our other demands , we have significantly expanded our commitment to community benefit in recent years . ”
In response rising costs at University Hospital , officials have had to implement a hiring freeze , mainly in administrative areas , and reduce overtime and temporary positions .
Despite recent challenges , Levy said that she expects the federal government to resume a greater responsibility for health care under the Obama administration .
“ I certainly think that the financial troubles facing hospitals as a result of what is essentially an unfunded mandate that they provide care for the uninsured will lend impetus to President Obama ’s efforts to expand insurance coverage , since that is another way to reduce the burden on hospitals of uncompensated care , ” Levy said .
Usually , hospitals receive two forms of compensation for providing charity care .
The first is through tax breaks .
Not - for - profit hospitals , of which most hospitals are , pay lower taxes .
The other method , known as disproportionate share payments , provides higher Medicare reimbursements to hospitals that provide uncompensated care .
However , there is a gap between treatment costs and the amount with which these programs reimburse the hospital .
The hospital is forced to absorb the difference , usually at a loss .
Adding to the problem , government health care programs are expanding and not equally compensating hospitals for their coverage , putting further strain on hospital expenses .

The bacteria lives in the gastrointestinal tract Eating a daily portion of broccoli sprouts could help tame the H. pylori bacteria , linked to stomach ulcers and even cancer , research suggests .
The study in Cancer Prevention Research of 50 people in Japan found eating 2.5 ounces of broccoli sprouts each day for two months may confer some protection .
They contain sulforaphane , previously found to act as an antibiotic .
UK experts said while sprouts may have an effect on the bug , they were likely to make " no difference " to cancer risk .
This small study shows that eating broccoli sprouts might reduce levels of H. pylori infection
Nell Barrie , Cancer Research UK
In the study , an international team of scientists gave half the group a daily portion of broccoli sprouts and the rest alfalfa sprouts , which do not contain sulforaphane .
In those who ate broccoli sprouts , levels of a marker of H. pylori in human stools called HpSA was cut by over 40 % .
There was no HpSA level change in those who ate alfalfa sprouts .
In people who ate broccoli sprouts , HpSA levels had returned to pre-treatment levels eight weeks after people stopped eating them .
The researchers say this suggests that although the sprouts can dampen down H. pylori , they do not eradicate it .
Sprout smoothies Dr Jed Fahey , of Johns Hopkins University in the US who led the study , said : " The fact that the levels of infection and inflammation were reduced suggests the likelihood of getting gastritis and ulcers and cancer is probably reduced . "
It was Dr Fahey who discovered the sprouts contained sulforaphane early this decade .
He is a co-founder of a company licensed by The Johns Hopkins University to produce broccoli sprouts .
A portion of the proceeds is used to help support cancer research .
His team also carried out tests on mice infected with H. pylori , giving them broccoli- sprout smoothies for eight weeks .
The number of H. pylori bacteria in the mice 's stomachs fell significantly - but did not change in infected mice that only drank plain water .
A second group of H. pylori - infected mice were genetically engineered to lack the Nrf2 gene that activates protective enzymes .
They failed to respond in the same way to the sprout - smoothie diet .
Nell Barrie of Cancer Research UK said : " This small study shows that eating broccoli sprouts might reduce levels of H. pylori infection .
" We know that H. pylori is a major risk factor for stomach cancer but only three in a 100 people with the infection will develop the disease , so there are clearly other factors at work .
" This means we can't conclude that eating broccoli sprouts makes any real difference to the chance of getting stomach cancer . "

Sie wollen sich einen guten Kompressor kaufen ?
Dann sind
Sie hier genau richtig .
Genre bearten wir Sie beim Kauf Ihres Druckluftaggregats .
Sie finden bei
Unse eine handverlesene Auswahl an Werkstatt- , Baustellen und gewöhnlichen Garagenkompressoren für Zuhause .
Worauf zu achten ist , wenn man sich einen Kompressor kaufen möchte
Was wäre , wenn Sie 10 - 20 % durch den Kauf Ihres Kompressors im lokalen Geschäft oder durch den Kauf eines wirtschaftlichen Industriekompressors sparen würden und er nur halb so lange hält wie ein anderer Kompressor ?
Hast du wirklich Geld gespart ?
Einige Marken von Baukompressoren sind so konzipiert , dass sie zehnmal so lange halten wie andere und der Preisunterschied ist in der Regel sehr gering .
Kaufen Sie keinen Kompressor , es sei denn , der Händler kann Sie über die Lebenserwartung informieren .
Wenn er es nicht weiß , soll er den Hersteller anrufen .
Als Faustregel gilt : Für jeden Dollar , den Sie ausgeben , um einen besseren oder größeren Kompressor zu bekommen , sparen Sie wahrscheinlich langfristig 3 - 4 Euro .
Neben dem Kauf eines hochwertigen Kompressors , um eine lange Lebensdauer zu erreichen , können Sie auch einen größeren Kompressor kaufen .
Wenn beispielsweise ein 10 - PS - Kompressor die für Ihre Anwendung erforderliche Mindestgröße ist , erhalten Sie einen 15 - PS - Kompressor , da er etwa zwei - drittel so viel läuft und viel kühler bleibt , so dass er doppelt so lange halten kann .
Wenn Sie einen Kompressor kaufen , überlegen Sie , wie viel er pro Stunde Lebenserwartung kostet .

Arnold Klann has a green dream .
It began 16 years ago in a sprawling laboratory in Anaheim .
This year , he hopes , it will culminate at a Lancaster garbage dump .
There , in the high desert of the Antelope Valley , Klann ’s company , BlueFire Ethanol Fuels , plans to build a $ 100 - million plant to convert raw trash into an alcohol - based fuel that will help power the cars and trucks of the future .
It ’s just the sort of improbable concoction that California is now demanding .
On Thursday , the state is expected to adopt the world ’s first regulation to reduce the carbon footprint of fuel .
And , just as California created the first market for catalytic converters decades ago , this rule , a likely model for national and even global calculations , could jump - start a huge demand for new technologies .

Fuel is a critical front in the battle against global warming .
Nearly a quarter of the man-made greenhouse gases that the United States spews into the atmosphere comes from transportation .
And although cars have reduced unhealthy pollutants such as nitrogen oxides by 99 % in recent decades , the gasoline they burn emits as much carbon dioxide as it did a century ago .
California ’s proposal “ is the first time anyone has attempted , for environmental purposes , to change the content of what goes into cars and trucks , ” says Mary D. Nichols , state Air Resources Board chairwoman .
“ It would revolutionize transportation fuel . ”
President Obama has also called for a low - carbon standard for the nation ’s $ 400 - billion transportation fuel market .
A version similar to California ’s is incorporated in climate legislation pending before Congress .
Under California ’s proposal , producers , refineries and importers would be forced to reduce the “ carbon intensity ” of their fuel by 10 % by 2020 , and by increasing percentages after that .
Currently , California gasoline contains 10 % corn - based ethanol , most of it from coal - powered Midwestern plants .
Its carbon footprint is as high as gasoline’s .

But by measuring the “ cradle - to - grave ” effect of various fuels , the new rule would favor ethanol such as Klann ’s , made from non -food sources .
Even “ low - carbon ” corn ethanol -- such as the kind produced in California using gas - fired electricity and efficient machinery -- has a far higher carbon footprint than so - called cellulosic fuel from landfill waste , trees , switchgrass or sugar cane .
“ This is fantastic for us , ” said Klann , who uses recycled sulfuric acid to transform paper , construction debris and grass clippings into ethanol .
“ The paradigm is changing from oil to sustainable fuels .
The ones with the lowest carbon footprint will be the winners . ”
By 2020 , the air board estimates , new - technology fuels along with electricity to power hybrid and electric cars would replace a quarter of the gasoline supply .
And that is a critical element of the state ’s sweeping plan to reduce its global warming emissions .
Across the nation , a rush is on to produce green fuels .
Since 2007 , the federal Department of Energy has invested more than $ 1 billion in advanced fuels research and development .
Last year , venture capitalists pumped $ 680 million into biofuels , including $ 100 million into San Diego - based Sapphire Energy , which would use algae , sunlight , carbon dioxide and non-potable water to make high - octane gasoline .
Advertisement
As yet , no commercial - sized plants exist in the U.S. to make such futuristic substitutes .
It was easier to use corn , which was plentiful , cheap and easy to ferment into ethanol .
But the new standard is bad news for the powerful farm lobby and its corn-ethanol industry .
In recent months , many plants across the country , including all five of California ’s , shut down as the price of ethanol fell along with gasoline .
Battered corn ethanol investors have mounted an intense lobbying effort against California ’s proposal .
Several , including Pacific Ethanol , California ’s biggest , had planned to diversify from corn into cellulosic ethanol .
They argue that by diminishing the value of their existing plants , the new rule also would cripple their advanced biofuel efforts .
“ We will throw the non -food - based advanced fuels out with the corn-ethanol bathwater if we are not careful , ” said Vinod Khosla , a founder of Sun Microsystems , who invested in a now - closed corn ethanol plant in Goshen , Calif .
Khosla has also invested in Gevo , a Denver - based start - up that uses agricultural residues and switchgrass , a crop easily grown on marginal land , to make isobutanol , a higher - energy version of ethanol .
At issue is the Air Resources Board ’s complex modeling , which would calculate each fuel ’s carbon footprint not only by its “ direct ” emissions from drilling or planting to refining to burning , but also “ indirect ” emissions caused by clearing forests or fields to compensate for food crops such as corn or soy that are diverted to fuel .
Opponents say the science behind the indirect modeling is inaccurate .

Nichols calls the complaints “ just noise , ” adding , “ It ’s very clear :
The best fuels will win out . ”
Likewise , the food - based biofuels industry is battling a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposal to count indirect land - use effects in defining fuels under a 2007 federal mandate to produce 36 billion gallons of ethanol by 2022 .
But among entrepreneurs like Klann , the mood has never been more hopeful .
In an Anaheim lab , the 57 - year - old electrical engineer guides a visitor through a maze of pipes , filters , heat exchangers , fermentation tanks and vats of acid like a small boy showing off a chemistry set .
“ We ’re in the forefront of this industry , ” he said of his patented “ concentrated acid hydrolysis ” process .
“ We expect to have the first plant to produce cellulosic ethanol on a commercial scale . ”
Financing for his Lancaster plant , which recently obtained its final permits , has been delayed by the credit crunch .
But if it comes through , the facility will process 170 tons of garbage a day to produce 3.7 million gallons of ethanol a year .
Estimated cost per gallon : about $ 2 , Klann says .
He already has plans for 20 more facilities across the country .
Next on the block : a plant outside Palm Springs , partly funded by the U.S. Department of Energy , that would produce 19 million gallons annually .

Across California , scores of advanced fuel companies are feverish with activity .
Down the road from Klann ’s Irvine - based company , Prometheus Energy is capturing methane gas from rotting garbage in the Frank R. Bowerman Landfill , converting it to liquid natural gas and selling it to fleets of Orange County trucks .
In Thousand Oaks , Ceres , a plant genetics company , has begun to market specialized switchgrass and high - biomass sorghum seeds designed for “ energy crops . ”
In Emeryville , Amyris Biotechnologies attracted $ 90 million in venture capital last year to convert sugar cane to renewable diesel for vehicles and fuel for military jets .
Meanwhile , oil companies are beginning to acknowledge that , thanks in part to government intervention , biofuels are likely to cut into -- or at least complement -- their core petroleum - based business .
Shell Oil bought a 50 % interest in Iogen Corp. , a Canadian company , and invested in Codexis , a Redwood City company , to make cellulose ethanol from wheat straw .
“ California ’s low - carbon fuel standard is going to set the standard for the U.S. and , I expect , the standard globally , ” said Graeme S.S. Sweeney , a Shell executive vice president .
“ There will be a series of commercial - sized plants in the next five years .
There will be different technologies .
It will be good to see competition . ”

Larry O’Donnell went to town this morning on Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) .
The ostensible issue was whether Cantor was going to support Rep. Charlie Rangel ’s bill to tax the heck out the AIG bonuses when it comes up for a vote later today .
He could n’t get an answer out of Cantor , though to my ears it sounded like a no .
But the larger issue this exchange exposes is just how bereft of solutions the Republicans are right now .
The only thing they have managed to muster is a faux populism over the AIG bonuses — a passing fancy they hope will score some short - term political points :

With the state out of money , the economy in a tailspin and our prisons overflowing , California ’s laws against marijuana make no economic sense .
Every year , the state shells out millions in taxpayers ’ dollars to arrest , prosecute and imprison marijuana offenders in a vain attempt to stamp out its use .
Meanwhile , legal and more dangerous drugs such as tobacco and alcohol are generating billions in revenue for the state .
California taxpayers would benefit from a bill by Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , D - San Francisco , that would legalize , tax and regulate marijuana for adult use .
The bill would establish a state licensing system for producers and distributors , who could sell to adults over 21 .
Producers would pay an excise tax of $ 50 per ounce , or about $ 1 per joint .
Additional revenue would be generated from sales taxes .
Altogether , tax revenue would be on the order of $ 1 billion , comparable to the cigarette tax .
This is a common sense , fiscally conservative policy that would regulate cannabis in a manner similar to other legal intoxicants and raise much - needed revenue .
At the same time , this policy would eliminate marijuana - related crime and law enforcement expenses , which include an estimated $ 170 million annually for the arrest , prosecution and imprisonment of marijuana offenders .
It would likewise put an end to such prohibition - related problems as the proliferation of black market dealers , grow houses , smugglers and pirate gardeners on public lands .
Finally , a legal marijuana industry could generate substantial additional economic benefits in legal employment , business and payroll taxes , and spinoff industries — like the wine industry , which currently contributes $ 50 billion to California ’s economy .
History shows that California ’s laws against marijuana have failed .
Only after being outlawed did marijuana become widely popular , eventually spreading to millions of Californians .
By 1975 , enforcement costs had become so high that the Legislature decriminalized possession of small quantities under the Moscone Act , saving the state $ 100 million each year .
Despite dire predictions by opponents , decriminalization had no perceptible effect on marijuana use by either adults or young people .
Nonetheless , production and distribution remained illegal , causing continued prohibition - related problems .
In 1990 , the California Research Advisory Panel urged further decriminalization , noting that “ an objective consideration of marijuana shows that it is responsible for less damage to society and the individual than are alcohol and cigarettes . ”
In 1996 , California voters legalized the medical use of marijuana in Proposition 215 ( though neglecting to establish a legally regulated supply system ) .
Contrary to the predictions of opponents , marijuana use by youths actually declined after Proposition 215 ’s passage , but arrests continued unabated .
In 2007 , marijuana - related arrests jumped to 74,119 — their highest level since the Moscone Act. California now has more than 1,500 marijuana prisoners , more than 10 times as many as in 1980 .
Marijuana accounts for 61 percent of the illicit drug traffic from Mexico , where prohibition - fueled gang wars have killed over 6,800 .
In California , agents eradicated a record 5 million illegal plants last year , up more than tenfold since 2003 .
The value of the illegal crop has been estimated as high as $ 14 billion , enough to qualify as the state ’s leading crop .
Ammiano deserves credit for recognizing that the only way to solve the marijuana problem is to legalize , tax and regulate it .
As usual , California is ahead of the rest of the nation .
Ammiano ’s bill provides a pathbreaking blueprint for change that would benefit our economy , safety and freedom by making marijuana a winning proposition for California .
Dale Gieringer is the director of California NORML ( the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ) , a supporter of Ammiano "s legalization bill .
He wrote this article for the Mercury News .
" There was really nowhere for Jennifer Gale to go to protect herself from the cold last night , " said Bier .
" The Salvation Army ( the only shelter in town that takes in women ) would not let her in there unless she was grouped with the men ( which includes sleeping with , and showering with , other homeless men ) .
They would make her use her male birth name and completely disregard , and disrespect , her identity as a trans - woman .
There is so much to be learned from Jennifer Gale , and so much to be worked on in our community . "
Marti Bier , policy aide for Austin City Council Member Randi Shade , said , " Something Jennifer would never talk about , but was a reality for her , is that she is a transwoman living in a transphobic society .
Homelessness in the trans - community is a really big problem , and one that goes ignored .
There are no laws in Texas protecting transgender people , whether from job discrimination , housing discrimination or hate crimes .
" Jennifer most nights slept outdoors , " said Austin Mayor Will Wynn .
" Jennifer , we believe , is the 136th person who has died sleeping on the streets ( of Austin ) over the last 12 months . "
Equality Texas mourns the death of Jennifer Gale , a 47 - year - old transgender homeless woman who died yesterday .
Jennifer 's body was found Wednesday morning .
She was lying in an outdoor walkway at the First English Lutheran Church in Central Austin . [...]
She did n't deserve to die .
I know the logic when it comes to the homeless - they did something to deserve it , they 're deranged , they should just get a job , providing enough shelters would be too expensive , helping them with a handout like a warm bed or food is n't really helping them , they should just get off the hooch .
And you know what ?
It 's all bullshit .
We live in a culture that believes that is n't generous enough to provide the basics to everyone and often actively hates the homeless .
And the people who are willing to help the homeless are often homophobic and transphobic .
Like the Salvation Army .
It may seem petty to point it out .
They are doing some good work .
It 's needed .
I get that .
But turning away transgender people from a shelter ( or making it so undesirable to be there that they have no choice but to leave ) is n't OK .
It makes people die .
People like Jennifer Gale .
I know , the Salvation Army is improving the world by at least taking in some people .
The people who do receive their services should n't be punished because of their discriminatory policies .
But I have a problem with an organization that picks and chooses who it wants to help based on prejudice .
There 's no excuse for that .
It 's an attempt to control the people that they 're supposed to be helping and that makes it less an act of generosity and more an attempt to gain power .
There are alternatives .
The Ali Forney Center in New York and the Jeff Griffith Center in LA , which both cater to LGBT youth .
And they 're both in desperate need of cash .
Please donate to them instead of the Salvation Army , because if we do n't support these shelters , who will ?
The Salvation Army also practices hiring discrimination against queer people .
But this , to me , is materially worse .
Someone died .
So I do n't put money in the red bucket and I 'm not a Scrooge for not doing so .
Family of environmental activist Ken Saro - Wiwa , hanged by his country 's rulers in 1995 , take oil giant to court in New York
Ken Saro - Wiwa swore that one day
Shell , the oil giant , would answer for his death in a court of law .
Next month , 14 years after his execution , the Nigerian environmental activist 's dying wish is to be fulfilled .
In a New York federal court , Shell and one of its senior executives are to face charges that in the early 1990s in Nigeria they were complicit in human rights abuses , including summary execution and torture .
The Anglo - Dutch company , if found liable , could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in damages .
No multinational has ever been found guilty of human rights abuses , although two previous cases saw major claims settled outside court .
Saro - Wiwa became famous as a campaigner on behalf of the Ogoni people , leading peaceful protests against the environmental damage caused by oil companies in the Niger Delta .
There was worldwide condemnation when , along with eight other activists , he was hanged by the Nigerian military government in 1995 after being charged with incitement to murder after the death of four Ogoni elders .
Many of the prosecution witnesses later admitted that they had been bribed to give evidence against Saro - Wiwa , who was a respected television writer and businessman .
Lawyers in New York will allege that Shell actively subsidised a campaign of terror by security forces in the Niger Delta and attempted to influence the trial that led to Saro - Wiwa 's execution .
The lawsuit alleges that the company attempted to bribe two witnesses in his trial to testify against him .
Members of Saro - Wiwa 's family will take the stand for the first time to give their version of events , among them his brother Owens , who will allege that Brian Anderson , managing director of Shell 's Nigerian subsidiary , told him : " It would not be impossible to get charges dropped if protests were called off . "
Anderson is fighting the action .
Witnesses who were shot by military police in the Niger Delta principally to protect the building of Shell 's oil pipeline will allege that Shell , by paying the police to protect its interests , was complicit in acts of violence .
Speaking to the Observer from Abuja , Nigeria , Saro - Wiwa 's son , Ken Wiwa , said : " For 14 years we have lived with the memory of a father , an uncle , a brother , a son executed for a crime he did n't commit .
We have daily reminders .
It 's painful to live with a monstrous injustice .
To wake up one day to finally get our day in court is tremendously satisfying .
" After the injustice of the original crime against my father , having to watch legal arguments [ by Shell ] using the highest - paid lawyers in the world is sickening .
You can't describe how painful that is to go through .
" Part of the reason for the original protest was the way Shell behaved .
Ogoni people made their living farming and fishing , but Shell was using open waste pits and oil pipelines criss - crossed the land .
These polluting activities were put on top of a delicate ecosystem .
It destroyed people 's ability to sustain themselves .
That 's the impact of Shell and , when people tried to protest , they were brutally repressed . "
In a statement , Shell this weekend described the executions of the Ogoni 9 as " tragic events carried out by the Nigerian government in power at the time " .
" Shell attempted to persuade that government to grant clemency ; to our deep regret , that appeal - and the appeals of many others - went unheard , and we were shocked and saddened when we heard the news .
Shell in no way encouraged or advocated any act of violence against them or their fellow Ogonis .
We believe that the evidence will show clearly that Shell was not responsible for these tragic events .
The allegations made in the complaints against Royal Dutch / Shell concerning the 1995 executions of Ken Saro - Wiwa and his eight fellow Ogonis are false and without merit . "
US lawyers have finally won permission to bring the case to court under the alien tort statute , which gives non-US citizens the right to file claims in American courts for international human rights violations .
The court case had been set for 27 April , though last night the date was moved to 26 May .
Today the oil - producing Niger Delta region is riven by intense violence and corruption .
The Ogoni 9 trial is seen as a way of coming to terms with the past and building a non-violent future .
" We need to know the truth , " said Ken Wiwa last night .
" We need to have people account for their role in the executions and the displacement of the Ogoni people , many of whom feel traumatised .
It will be a relief .
It will enable people to face the future .
That 's the most important thing .
Let 's account for the past , so we can move forward . "
Lawyers representing Saro - Wiwa 's family have not sought specific damages should Shell be found liable , but legal experts say the oil giant could face fines running into hundreds of millions of pounds .
Jenny Green , a senior lawyer at the New York - based Center for Constitutional Rights , who has played a pivotal role in ensuring the Saro - Wiwa case made it to court , said : " Mosop [ the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People ] was formed to stand up to multinationals and the dictatorship that acted hand - in - hand .
This is a significant moment , because it says you can't act with impunity . "

My Photo Blog is the result of having a photo camera with me at all times , but I also always have a video camera with me as well .
In this Pocket Cam segment of my blog I will showcase entertaining bits of video I have captured during my day - to - day life .
Last night Karla and I were walking in the Niederdorf when a lively group of men began singing acappella tunes at random moments as they strolled down the street .
Eventually I pulled out my Canon G9 , switched into video mode , and captured this little gem :
The video from the G9 is obviously not the greatest quality , but there is something very charming about this grainy little video .
I really like how the different people walk in and out of the scene , especially when the couple holding hands moves over the camera .
I also really like the framing , with the Grossmunster in the background and the one street lamp backlighting the singers .
A perfect first entry for Pocket Cam ( although this post probably qualifies as well ) .

Spain was first called Iberia a name given to it by its Iberian inhabitants ( from North Africa ) .
The name was supposedly based on the Iberian word for river , Iber .
They reached Spain around 6000 b.c .
When the Greeks arrived on Spanish soil around 600 b.c. they referred to the peninsula as Hesperia , meaning " land of the setting sun . "
When the Carthaginians came around 300 b.c. they called the country Ispania ( from Sphan , " rabbit " ) , which means " land of the rabbits . "
The Romans arrived a century later and adopted the Carthaginian name of the country , calling it Hispania .
Later , this became the present day Spanish name for the country , España .
Thus , because of the Romans and their language , the rabbits won over the sunset and over the river .

" Anyone who is doing anything sensible right now is either losing money or is out of the market entirely . "
These are the words of a quant trader , who is seeing something scary in the capital markets .
Scary enough to merit a warning that we could be on the verge of another October 87 , August 2007 , or January 2008 .
Let 's back up .
I recently posted a chart which tracks equity market neutral strategies : in essence a cross section of quant funds for which there is public performance tracking .
The chart is presented below .
There is not much publicly available data to follow what goes on in the mystery shrouded quant world .
However , another chart that tracks the market neutral performance is the HSKAX , or the Highbridge Statistical Market Neutral Fund , presented below .
As one can see we have crossed into major statistically deviant territory , likely approaching a level that is 6 standard deviations away from the recent norms .
What do these charts tell us ?
In essence , that there is a high likelihood of substantial market dislocations based on previous comparable situations .
More on this in a second .
Why quant funds ?
Or rather , what is so special about quant funds ?
The proper way to approach the question is to think of the market as an ecosystem of liquidity providers , who , based on the frequency of their trades , generate a cushioning to the open market trading mechanism .
It is a fact that the vast majority of transactions in the market are not customer driven buy / sell orders , but are in fact high frequency , small block trades that constantly cross between a select few of these same quant funds and program traders .
This is a market in which the big players are Renaissance Technologies Medallion , Goldman Sachs and GETCO .
Whereas the first two are household names , the last is an entity known primarily to quant market participants .
Curiously , the Philosophy section in GETCO 's website exactly captures the critical role that quant funds play in an " efficient " market .
A good example to visualize the dynamic of this liquidity " ecosystem " is presented below .
In order to maintain market efficiency , the ecosystem has to be balanced : liquidity disruptions at any one level could and will lead to unexpected market aberrations , such as exorbitant bid / ask margins , inability to unwind large block positions , and last but not least , explosive volatility : in essence a recreation of the market conditions approximating the days of August 2007 , the days post the Lehman collapse , the first November market low , the irrational exuberance of the post New Year rally , and the 666 market lows .
The above tracking charts indicate that something is very off with the " slow " , " moderate " and " fast " liquidity providers , indicating that liquidity deleveraging is approaching ( if not already is at ) critical levels , as the vast majority of quants are either sitting on the sidelines , or are merely playing hot potato with each other ( more on this also in a second ) .
What this means is that marginal market participants , such as mutual and pension funds , and retail investors who are really just beneficiaries of the liquidity efficiency provided them by the higher - ups in the liquidity chain , are about to get a very rude awakening .
Also , it needs to be pointed out that the very top tier of the ecosystem is shrouded in secrecy : conclusions about its state can only be implied based on observable metrics from the HSKAX and HFRXEMN .
It is safe to say that any conclusion drawn based upon observing these two indices are likely not too far off the mark .
Skeptics at this point will claim that it is impossible that quant and program trading has such as vast share of trading .
The facts , however , indicate that not only is program trading a material component of daily volumes , it is in fact growing at an alarming pace .
The following most recent weekly data from the New York Stock Exchange puts things into perspective : According to the NYSE , last week program trading was 8 % higher than the 52 week average , which on almost 4 billion shares is a material increase .
It is probably safe to say that the 1 billion in program trades last week does not account for significant additional low - to high - frequency trades originated at non NYSE members , implying the real number for the overall market is likely even higher .
Some more program trading statistics :
A very interesting data point , also provided by the NYSE , implicates none other than administration darling Goldman Sachs in yet another potentially troubling development .
The chart below demonstrates the program trading broken down by the top 15 most active NYSE member firms .
I bring your attention to the total , principal , customer facilitation and agency columns .
Key to note here is that Goldman 's program trading principal to agency + customer facilitation ratio is a , which is multiples higher than both the second most active program traderthe average ratio of the NYSE , both at or below 1x .
The implication is that Goldman Sachs , due to its preeminent position not only as one of the world 's largest broker / dealers ( pardon , Bank Holding Companies ) , but also as being on the top of the high - frequency trading / liquidity provision " food chain " , trades much more often for its own ( principal ) benefit , likely in tandem with the other top dogs on the list : RenTec , Highbridge ( JP Morgan ) , and GETCO .
In this light , the program trading spike over the past week could be perceived as much more sinister .
For conspiracy lovers , long searching for any circumstantial evidence to catch the mysterious " plunge protection team " in action , you should look no further than this .
Following on the circumstantial evidence track , as Zero Hedge pointed out previously , over the past month , the Volume Weighted Average Price of the SPY index indicates that the bulk of the upswing has been done through low volume buying on the margin and from overnight gaps in afterhours market trading .
The VWAP of the SPY through yesterday indicated that the real price of the S&P 500 would be roughly 60 points lower , or about 782 , if the low volume marginal transactions had been netted out .
And yet the market keeps on rising .
This is an additional data point demonstrating that the equity market has reached a point where the transactions on the margin are all that matter as the core volume / liquidity providers slowly disappear one by one through ongoing deleveraging .
Unfortunately for them , this is not a sustainable condition .
As more and more quants focus on trading exclusively with themselves , and the slow and vanilla money piggy backs to low - vol market swings , the aberrations become self - fulfilling .
What retail investors fail to acknowledge is that the quants close out a majority of their ultra- short term positions at the end of each trading day , meaning that the vanilla money is stuck as a hot potato bagholder to what can only be classified as an unprecedented ponzi scheme .
As the overall market volume is substantially lower now than it has been in the recent past , this strategy has in fact been working and will likely continue to do so ... until it fails and we witness a repeat of the August 2007 quant failure events ... at which point the market , just like Madoff , will become the emperor revealing its utter lack of clothing .
So what happens in a world where the very core of the capital markets system is gradually deleveraging to a point where maintaining a liquid and orderly market becomes impossible : large swings on low volume , massive bid - offer spreads , huge trading costs , inability to clear and numerous failed trades .
When the quant deleveraging finally catches up with the market , the consequences will likely be unprecedented , with dramatic dislocations leading the market both higher and lower on record volatility .
Furthermore , high convexity names such as double and triple negative ETFs , which are massively disbalanced with regard to underlying values after recent trading patterns , will see shifts which will make the November SRS jump to $ 250 seem like child 's play .
For readers curious about just how relevant liquidity is in the current market , I recommend another recent post that discusses DE Shaw 's opinion on the infamous basis trade , in which their conclusion was that establishing a basis trade , which is effectively the equivalent of selling a put option on market liquidity , ended up in massive financial carnage as the market rolled from one side of the trade to another .
Is it possible that what the basis trade was for credit markets ( most notably Citadel Merrill and Boaz Weinstein ) , so the quant unwind will be to equity markets ?
So when will all this occur ?
The quant trader I spoke to would not commit himself to any specific time frame but noted that a date as early as next Monday could be a veritable D - day .
His advice on a list of possible harbingers : continued deleveraging in quant funds as per the charts noted above , significant pre-market volatility swings as quants rebalance their end of day positions , increasing principal program trading by Goldman Sachs on decreasing relative overall trading volumes , ongoing index VWAP dislocations .
One thing is for certain : the longer the divergence between real volume trading / liquidity and absolute market changes persists , the more memorable the ensuing market liquidity event will be .
At the end of the day , despite the pronouncements by the administration and more and more sell - side analysts that the market is merely chasing the rebound in fundamentals in what has all of a sudden become a V - shaped recovery , the " rally " could simply be explained by technical factor driven capital - liquidity aberrations , which will continue at most for mere weeks if not days .

Sweet dreams – got “ Ëœem ?
Many of us do n’t .
For some , bedtime is a nightly battle of tossing , turning and exhausted frustration ; believe me , I ’ve been there myself .
As with any of life ’s imbalances , there ’s usually an underlying reason for insomnia and although stress and tension are usually the root cause , there are natural solutions to help you get the rest you deserve .
Try some of these ideas and see which ones work for you .
Before going to bed , stretch out .
The day ’s tensions are held in your body , so a gentle , relaxing stretching session – even a brief one – can do you a world of good .
Wear comfortable clothing – or none !
You might be surprised to find that going to sleep in your birthday suit helps you get more relaxed .
Or , simply changing the type of PJ ’s you wear can work wonders .
If you ’ve been sticking to cotton or flannel , try bamboo , which breathes well .
Skip the bedtime TV show .
I know a lot of people like to fall asleep to the TV , and if that works for you , great .
But if you find yourself wired after watching Colbert or the midnight sci- fi flick , take the hint and turn off the tube .
With all those flashing images , TV stimulates the brain and that ’s the last thing you need if you ’re trying to sleep .
Unplug electrical appliances in your bedroom at night .
The subtle electrical hum might just be enough to keep you awake , not to mention digital numbers or standby lights .
If you use an alarm to wake up , keep it at least 3 feet from your bed .
Keep your workspace separate from your bedroom .
Using your laptop in bed , or even having your desk right next to your bed will keep stress and sleep intertwined – not a good combination .
If you can , remove clutter your sleeping space and make it harmonious and beautiful .
Perhaps some beautiful art or make an altar of special objects – anything but the office supplies !
Snack smart .
Is it too health - nut of me to remind you not to drink coffee or eat sugary snacks before bedtime ?
Hey , even a few bites of dark chocolate were enough to keep me up an extra few hours one night recently , so watch what you eat in the evening .
Good choices are nuts , cheese , and nut butters .
Is your mattress uncomfortable ?
Are you using the right pillow ?
Make sure your sleeping situation is exactly right for you .
If you ’re tossing and turning on a regular basis , it ’s probably time for a different mattress .
Keep oxygen circulating in your bedroom .
If you do n’t like to leave your windows open , at least crack them or use a small , circulating fan .
The white noise might help you sleep better , too .
Aromatherapy
Try aromatherapy to help you relax and sleep .
Some good essential oil choices are lavender , ylang ylang , jasmine or sandalwood .
Nectar Essences has a misting spray – appropriately called Sleep – made of relaxing flower essences and essential oils .
Melatonin
Melatonin is a hormone produced in the brain that regulates sleep cycles and synthetic melatonin pills are a gentle , over - the - counter option for helping you get to sleep .
There are a few contraindications and potential side - effects , so do your research before taking it , but in general melatonin is considered a very mild and helpful supplement .
Listen to relaxing music .
Try ocean sounds or a meditation podcast , but make sure your stereo does n’t stay on all night with lights and electrical feedback to keep you awake !
Tea
Try the old standard for nighttime relaxation : chamomile tea .
If that ’s too wimpy for you , check out the recipe for EcoSalon ’s Sweet Dream Elixir .
If you consume dairy , a glass of plain old warm milk can help , as well .
Save shower or bath time for your evening ritual .
The warmth and the water will help you relax , unwind and wash away the stresses of your day .
This is especially effective if you use some of those essential oils in your bath .
Valerian root
This is a well known drowsiness - inducing herb .
It is generally considered safe , with few side - effects , but as with any supplement , do some research and chat with your health care practitioner before deciding if it ’s the right remedy for you .
Kava
The Hawaiian kava root is also well known for its relaxing properties .
I tried it a few times when I was living on Maui and I can tell you that it does have a soothing , relaxing effect without any major hangover or side effects .
But kava root is not the ideal herb for everyone .
Do some research before trying it , and get pure kava powder .
Wear a sleep mask .
We sleep best in total darkness , and those little slivers of light from the streetlamp outside your window or the bright numbers of your digital alarm clock are enough to be a distraction .
Simply slip on a mask and enter your own dark cocoon .
Save bedtime for relaxing activities .
You ’ve turned off the TV , now what ?
Read a book ( but not a thriller ! ) or journal just before going to bed .
Or , try a little yoga .
Write your worries or your to - do list .
If your mind is racing , grab a notebook and write everything down .
Write write write until you ’re out of things to write about , until you ’re tired , even bored … then you ’ll be able to shut your eyes and sleep .
Use a pleasantly scented dream pillow .
It sounds strange , but German scientists found that certain smells help us dream better , while other , unpleasant smells play a part in disturbing our dreams .
Slow , deep breathing .
Before you go to bed , do some deep breathing – this will help relax you .
Anytime you notice your mind has drifted away from your breath , gently bring it back .
Or do this meditation lying down in bed and you ’re sure to fall fast asleep .

Money Morning
China Development Bank , one of China 's largest state - owned enterprises , has agreed to lend $ 10 billion to Brazil 's Petrobras ( PBR ) in exchange for a long - term supply of oil – the latest illustration of how Beijing is using the global downturn to further its domestic agenda .
Money Morning first reported in January , that China was building stakes in some of the world 's largest natural - resource companies , which have been made vulnerable by depressed commodities prices , tumbling profits and falling stock prices .
In the scant few weeks since that Money Morning report was published , Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. ( ADR : ACH ) , or Chinalco , has invested $ 19.5 billion in Australian / British mining giant Rio Tinto PLC ( ADR : RTP ) , and China Minmetals Corp. acquired Australian zinc miner Oz Minerals Ltd .
China Development Bank has been particularly active .
Earlier this week , the bank lent $ 15 billion to OAO Rosneft Oil Co. , Russia 's state - owned oil company , and $ 10 billion to the Russian state pipeline monopoly Transneft ( PINK : TRNFF ) .
In return for the needed financing , Russia agreed to supply China with 15 million tons of oil annually for 20 years .
China Development
Bank struck a similar deal with Petrobras Friday , agreeing to loan the Latin American energy giant $ 10 billion to help finance deepwater oil exploration off the coast of Brazil .
Oil exploration will be carried out with the participation of Sinopec ( ADR : SHI ) , the Chinese state oil company , the Macauhub reported .
The contract will be finalized within the next two months so it can be signed when Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva visits China in May , according to Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Sergio Gabrielli .
In addition to the exploration partnership , the deal signed between Petrobras and Sinopec includes the supply of 60,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil per day in the current year .
Petrobras also signed a memorandum of understanding with state company China National Petroleum Corporation ( CNPC ) for the supply of 40,000 to 60,000 barrels per day .
Brazil is n't necessarily the country that comes to mind when taking inventory of the world 's top oil producers .
It currently has about 12 billion barrels of proven reserves , but that figure could grow substantially now that a number of very rich deposits have been found off Brazil 's shores .
Petrobras happened across the second - largest oil find in two decades last year when it found between 5 billion and 8 billion barrels of untapped light oil in the Tupi basin .
Even more impressive are the unofficial figures from a new reservoir , known as Carioca .
That field could hold 33 billion barrels of oil and gas , which would make it the world 's largest discovery in at least 32 years .
With discoveries like these Brazil , currently ranked 13th on the list of the world 's top oil producers could , could easily move into the top ten .
The only problem with the Tupi and Caricoa oil fields is production costs .
The Carioca discovery , for instance , is located 170 miles offshore , more than 6,000 feet under the surface of the water , and is trapped beneath a shelf of salt 500 miles long and 125 miles wide .
Developing oil fields such as these will be very costly and with crude oil trading below $ 40 a barrel financing is imperative .
In that sense China could n't have timed its investment in Petrobras any better .
Petrobras said it plans to invest $ 174.4 billion from 2009 through 2013 , compared with the $ 112.4 billion planned for investment for 2008 - 12 .
The company will invest $ 28.6 billion in 2009 alone .
In 2008 , trade between China and Brazil totaled $ 36 billion making China Brazil 's second largest trading partner .

Gold Buying Opportunity Of A Lifetime
Opportunity and crisis are uneasy handmaidens in times of danger ; and , while crises may increase , opportunities are always rare .
The world is in the grip of an unprecedented crisis .
Unlimited credit has now turned into its deadly nemesis , unlimited defaulting debt ; and whereas only some of us were its beneficiaries , all of us will be its victims — all of us , except the very few .
To heroin addicts , heroin is quite wonderful .
Its effects mitigate and , indeed , obliterate the exigencies of modern life .
Anxieties disappear as do the pressures of living in a derivative reality .
The popularity of heroin lies in its ability to “ solve ” these problems , the same attraction as credit .
The problem of each lies in the conundrum of constant demand and inconstant supply ; and , as the need for each increases , a self - reinforcing and deadly cycle is set in motion , a cycle that inevitably ends in disaster , physical collapse in the case of heroin and economic collapse in the case of credit .
The supply of heroin was originally sourced in the east , in Asia and Afghanistan .
Credit began its journey in the west , in the City of London and New York 's Wall Street then spreading through central banks to the rest of the world .
Credit 's journey , however , is about to end , its extraordinary success the reason for its now imminent failure .
The spread of credit was so successful that productivity , the host of credit , is now drowning under the tsunami wave of debt created by that credit ; and when the host perishes , so , too , will the parasite .
CREDIT —A PARASITE ON THE BODY OF PRODUCTIVITY
Today , we are witness to the parasite 's last struggle , credit 's final attempts to resuscitate the host 's ability to repay its debts and obligations .
It is ironic — and perhaps appropriate — that the bankers ' first victim , government , is its last and most important ally in its struggle to survive .
Were it not for government , credit could not have achieved its central position in today 's world .
The ability to imbue paper coupons with a value previously accruing only to gold and silver was accomplished solely by government decree at the behest of bankers .
What Professor Antal E. Fekete calls the modern tower of Babel , the quadrillion dollar skyscraper of debt built upon the false premise of bankers is now about to come tumbling down — on all of us .
TOMORROW WILL NOT BAIL OUT TODAY ESPECIALLY WHEN ALREADY ENCUMBERED
Under the influence and encouragement of bankers , the US lived as if tomorrow would never come ; for if it did , the debt accrued from today 's expenditures would be due and owing , destroying what had been built on the bankers ' false promise that that tomorrow could always be delayed .
TOMORROW ARRIVED AND GUESS WHAT WE'RE BROKE
Terms like “ quantitative easing ” , “ monetizing debt ” , and “ the nationalization of banks ” are actually socially preferable synonyms describing the collapse of credit , credit - based markets and credit - based paper money .
We are broke , literally and figuratively and the “ we ” is inclusive .
Consumers cannot pay back what they owe , entrepreneurs cannot pay back what they owe , corporations cannot pay back what they owe , governments cannot pay back what they owe and bankers owe so much that not even governments can repay what bankers owe although governments are promising to do so while lying about the amounts actually owed .
We burdened tomorrow with today 's expenditures and tomorrow has refused the bill .
The response is understandable as tomorrow was never a party to the promises to pay and the expectations of such were as self - serving as they were unfounded .
The response of governments is clear :
Governments are using taxpayer money and future taxpayer obligations to bail out banks , a solution designed to perpetrate the bankers system of credit and debt , not to solve the problem or to fix its cause .
The foundation of the bankers ' fraud has been their ability to issue paper coupons as money , an ability made possible by government fiat , i.e. decree .
Paper coupons or “ currencies ” as bankers prefer them to be called are worthless without government legal tender laws , laws obligating debts to be liquidated by payment with their printed coupons
The charade of paper money began with the Bank of England 's claim in 1694 that their paper notes were convertible to gold ; and , as long as people believed that to be so , there was little need to exchange the more convenient paper for the more valuable gold which it represented .
Of course , over time , governments issued more and more paper notes and had less and less gold until there was no longer not enough gold to back the enormous amounts of paper currencies in circulation
This is where we are today and this is why bankers and governments are worried .
Their fraud is becoming apparent because their game of credit and debt is collapsing and the system is being questioned as never before .
DON'T ASK DON'T TELL THE FOUNDATION OF MODERN ECONOMICS
Now that their debt - based system of credit is collapsing , paper currencies are in upheaval as well .
The fall of the US dollar and its subsequent rise even as its economy crumbles is absurdly matched only by the Japanese Yen which rallied as Japanese exports plunged 50 % in six months .
Powerful speculative forces were unleashed in 1973 when the US dollar was de-linked from gold as were all currencies as they had been linked to the US dollar .
What are government coupons called money really worth ?
Ask the punters in the market .
The answer is no one knows .
The value of currencies is subject to speculators wagering enormous sums in foreign exchange markets , markets which exploded from negligible amounts in 1973 to trillions now bet daily on what paper money may or may not be worth .
This is the one bet that bankers need to keep in play , the belief , however false it may be , that government coupons , printed in whatsoever denominations or amounts in whatever sizes and colors and not backed by anything of value , are actually money ; an idea that becomes more and more absurd with each passing day and each new crisis .
THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE CRISIS
The need to maintain this charade in order to maintain the power of government and profits of bankers offers the one truly golden opportunity of this crisis — that of buying gold at below market prices .
Gold prices are manipulated by central banks .
As the value of paper assets and paper profits fall , the lure of gold threatens the ability of bankers to keep investors believing their paper currencies , paper assets and paper promises are worth more than the paper they are printed on .
This is why bankers and governments “ manage ” the price of gold , i.e. manipulate gold .
Gold is the one true measure of monetary distress and when gold prices quickly move upwards , it sends a powerful signal that investors no longer trust paper - based assets and it 's time to sell .
This is the bankers ' greatest fear and they will do anything to prevent the collapse of a system which allows them to profit from the risks and labor of others ; and , to prevent this they sell central bank gold to drive down gold 's price — and why would n't they ?
After all it's not their gold
WHEN GORDEN BROWN SOLD BRITAIN 'S GOLD
In 1999 , it was rumored that investment bank Goldman Sachs had a 1,000 ton gold short position in the markets .
Goldman Sachs was betting that the price of gold would continue to fall and they would be amply rewarded for their apparent “ risk ” .
Because of central bank manipulation , the price of gold had moved inversely to the rise of stocks for almost 20 years and bankers were making easy money on the bet gold would continue its downward spiral .
However , much to the shock of Goldman Sachs and the central bankers , in 1999 gold stopped falling ; and , because Goldman Sachs ' short position was so large , Goldman possibly could suffer catastrophic losses .
This is when England 's then Chancellor of the Exchequer , Gordon Brown , on May 8 , 1999 announced England would sell over 50 % of its gold reserves , 415 tons of the most precious metal on earth at the very bottom of the market .
The decision to sell England 's gold thereby saved Goldman Sachs and insured the political future of Gordon Brown .
Goldman Sachs ' is still in business and Gordon Brown is now the Prime Minister of England — proving that good things come to those who do the bidding of the powerful ( whether either outcome was worth 415 tons of England 's gold is questionable )
Selling a nation 's gold to save the bankers ' parasitic system is now common practice as the banker 's system continues to collapse and gold continues to rise .
Since Gordon Brown sold England 's gold , gold has risen from $ 275 dollars per ounce to its present price of over $ 900 despite the thousands of tons of central bank gold sold to prevent its inexorable movement higher .
GOLD SALE ENDS SOON
The downward pressure on gold will end soon because central bank supplies of gold are running out .
For the past thirty - five years , thousands of tons of central bank gold have been sold to force gold lower .
When those supplies are gone , so , too , will be the gold prices we see today .
When the central bank cap on gold is finally forced off , gold will not just be off to the races , gold will bolt the barn leaving it and the racetrack far behind ; so far , central bankers have been successful at preventing this .
Soon , they will be unable to do so .
Each run-up in gold has forced central bankers to sell their ever dwindling stocks to keep the price of gold from going parabolic .
When gold made its run in the fall of 2007 from $ 680 to $ 1,033 in spring 2008 , the Swiss National Bank sold 22 tons of gold to cap gold 's rise .
One year later ( after the collapse of global stock markets in the fall of 2008 ) , gold made another run at $ 1,000 ; but this time when gold hit $ 1,009 on February 20th , LeMetropole reported central banks sold 220 tons of gold to force gold below $ 900 .
In 2008 , 22 tons of gold were necessary to force gold down from $ 1,000 .
In 2009 , 220 tons were required to do the same .
Next time , central banks may not have enough gold to turn back an even more powerful tide of paper money seeking the safety of gold .
After LeMetropole noted the sale of 220 tons of central bank gold , the Financial Times next reported that the Washington Accord capping central bank gold sales at 500 tons a year may be renegotiated to allow higher sales .
The sale of over 220 tons of central bank gold in only nine weeks leaves approximately only 250 tons left to be sold the rest of the year ; and , if stock markets collapse again this year — and they will — gold will explode upwards but this time with far greater force and take out $ 1,000 as easily as a herd of bulls would take out a picket fence as they run for freedom — especially if central bank sales of gold are limited as they are today .
We are in the last days of paper money 's longest run .
No economy built on fiat paper money has ever lasted in the history of the world ; and , although governments have tried to do so for almost 1,000 years , all have failed .
That the current system lasted three hundred years did not mean it would last forever .
As Bernard Madoff 's Ponzi scheme attests , no fraud , no matter how large , i.e. $ 50 billion or $ 50 trillion , can withstand the test of time .
Not even a Ponzi scheme that has enlisted the participation and cooperation of all governments and all central banks .
All frauds come to an end , even one as large and as long - lasting as the banker 's substitution of government coupons for gold and silver .
The game is over except for the shouting — and not even all the King 's men , e.g. Bernanke , Geithner , Volcker , Summers , et. al. , can put Humpty - Dumpty together again .
It 's been two years since I presented my analysis , How To Survive The Crisis And Prosper In The Process , to Marshall Thurber 's Positive Deviant Network .
In my book , I predicted that real estate would fall 40 % – 80 % and stocks 70 % to 90 % .
Today , we 're halfway there .
This Sunday , Martha and I leave for Hungary to attend the final session of Professor Antal E. Fekete 's Gold Standard University Live , a torch that will now be carried in part by the Gold Standard Institute , see http://www.goldstandardinstitute.com/ .
The Institute 's own charge is to be a voice and catalyst for freedom .
We live in dangerous times , times where government , our own and others , in league with private bankers pose the greatest threat to both our freedoms and to our welfare .
Though , today , we look to government to provide and protect our freedoms and welfare , we are fools for so doing .
Throughout the ages , the greatest threat to freedom has always been government .
It is no less so today .
To be unaware of the dangers of government is directly contrary to the principles upon which America was founded .
The American experiment was mankind 's first attempt to limit the power of government in order to preserve the freedoms of the individual .
Unfortunately , over time , this wonderful and wondrous experiment has buckled beneath government 's insatiable need to control in combination with the bankers ' insatiable need to profit .
Believing that government is now our protector against both tyranny and economic subjugation points out the futility of our present situation .
The bankers , i.e. foxes , are not just in the henhouse , they have owned the US henhouse , via the Federal Reserve , for almost 100 years as they have England 's for almost 300 , i.e. the Bank of England .
We are now about to pay the price for their rogue tenancy .
The henhouse was once ours but we allowed it to be taken over by those whose scurrilous and selfish intent ran contrary to the principles of those who established our great nation and the great principles they left behind to guide us .
Although we were n't alive when the transgression happened in 1913 with the creation of the Federal Reserve , we are alive today when the consequences of so doing are now upon us .
Better days will come but they will come only after the present crisis is long gone .
THE CAULDRON'S FLAME AND FIRE
The Tower of Babel ’s collapsing
And bankers themselves are caught
Their web of debt is everywhere
And governments have been taught
That should the bankers fail
Bankers ’ credit will be no more
And governments could n’t spend
What they do not have in store
So governments give our taxes
To the bankers without our say
So bankers can continue to profit
And continue to plague our days
We pay for even our bondage to debt
We pay for the chains we wear
And we wonder why our governments
Do n’t know what from even where
But it ’s all too clear and obvious
The answers that we seek
For the rapacious and the greedy
Have always lived off the meek
But the bills for debts ’ incurred
Will be paid by all concerned
Including the bankers and government
On the slagheap they will burn
For we ’re now in the final days
Foretold in ancient times
Spoken of by the prophets
In rhythm and in rhyme
Fear not the tumult of the days ahead
Fear not what may transpire
For a new and a better world will come
From the cauldron ’s flame and fire
Buy gold .
Buy silver .
Have faith .

About Darryl Robert Schoon
In college , I majored in political science with a focus on East Asia ( B.A. University of California at Davis , 1966 ) .
My in - depth study of economics did not occur until much later .
In the 1990s , I became curious about the Great Depression and in the course of my study , I realized that most of my preconceptions about money and the economy were just that - preconceptions .
I , like most others , did not really understand the nature of money and the economy .
Now , I have some insights and answers about these critical matters .
In October 2005 , Marshall Thurber , a close friend from law school convened The Positive Deviant Network ( the PDN ) , a group of individuals whom Marshall believed to be " out - of - the - box " thinkers and I was asked to join .
The PDN became a major catalyst in my writings on economic issues .
When I discovered others in the PDN shared my concerns about the US economy , I began writing down my thoughts .
In March 2007 I presented my findings to the Positive Deviant Network in the form of an in - depth 148 - page analysis , " How to Survive the Crisis and Prosper In The Process . "
The reception to my presentation , though controversial , generated a significant amount of interest ; and in May 2007 , " How To Survive The Crisis And Prosper In The Process " was made available at www.survivethecrisis.com and I began writing articles on economic issues .
The interest in the book and my writings has been gratifying .
During its first two months , www.survivethecrisis.com was accessed by over 10,000 viewers from 93 countries .
Clearly , we had struck a chord and www.drschoon.com , has been created to address this interest .

When the case started , the defense was going to focus more on what was in the officer ’s body than on his mind .
Officer Ettienne had been suspended for using steroids  legally , he says , with a doctor ’s prescription .
The defense lawyer , Adrian Lesher of the Legal Aid Society , argued last year that steroids might have created irrational rage in Officer Ettienne .
Then Mr. Lesher tracked down comments Officer Ettienne had made on the Internet about video clips of arrests .
An officer should not have punched a handcuffed man , Officer Ettienne wrote .
“ If he wanted to tune him up some , he should have delayed cuffing him . ”
He added : “ If you were going to hit a cuffed suspect , at least get your money ’s worth ’ cause now he ’s going to get disciplined for ” a relatively light punch .
“ I ’m not going to say it was the best of things to do in retrospect , ” Officer Ettienne said .
“ You want to run your mouth with the best of them .
As the lawyer Ron Kuby says , stupidity on the Internet is there for everyone to see for all times in perpetuity .
That ’s the case for me .
There were hundreds of comments I made that were positive . ”
Officer Ettienne said he has never been disciplined for brutality .
From the defense side , the mouth - running was a gift outright .
“ It supported our theory of the case  this guy was motivated to cover up his use of excessive force , ” Mr. Lesher said .
The prosecutor , Kevin James , tried to persuade the judge , Joel M. Goldberg , that remarks like the one about “ Training Day ” had nothing to do with the arrest .
“ It goes into artistic interpretations to a movie , directorship , actors , ” Mr. James said .
“ I do n’t think it ’s enlightening . ”
The judge replied , “ If you want to redirect and the witness says I liked it because of the cinematography , he can say that . ”
Officer Ettienne said he is now being careful to mask his identity on the Web and that he has curbed his tongue because of the acquittal .

I had a rather long post on the pain of dealing with the system clipboard in Web applications now that Flash went and fixed some security hole :/
The solution in place at that time worked well in Safari , with the on[ cut|copy | paste ] and unfortunately not great with Firefox due to one crucial big of data being omitted .
Then Tom Robinson and a couple of others made the great point that I could get ALMOST everything I wanted with just the hidden textaraea trick .
Instead of tying the trick to the on[ cut|copy | paste ] events , I can just manually grab the Cmd / Ctrl - C X V commands .
The only downside to this is that if the user goes to the Edit menu and chooses something , it wo n’t work .
Annoying , but that ’s the world of the hacky Web sometimes .
I added in this new tactic , and copy and paste works OK for Firefox in the latest version of Bespin in code ( not deployed to bespin.mozilla.com at the time of this writing ) :
dojo . declare ( " bespin.util.clipboard.HiddenWorld " , null , { install : function ( ) { // * Configure the hidden copynpaster element var copynpaster = dojo .
create ( " textarea " , { tabIndex : ' - 1 ' , autocomplete : ' off ' , id : ' copynpaster ' , style : " position : absolute ; z- index : - 400 ; top : - 100 px ; left : - 100 px ; width : 0 ; height : 0 ; border : none ; " } , dojo .
body ( ) ) ; var grabAndGo = function ( text ) { copynpaster .
value = text ; focusSelectAndGo ( ) ; } ; var focusSelectAndGo = function ( ) { copynpaster .
focus ( ) ; copynpaster .
select ( ) ; setTimeout ( function ( ) { dojo .
byId ( ' canvas ' ) . focus ( ) ; } , 0 ) ; } ; this .
keyDown = dojo .
connect ( document , " keydown " , function ( e ) { if ( ( bespin . util .
isMac ( ) && e. metaKey ) || e. ctrlKey ) { //
Copy if ( e. keyCode == 67 /*c*/ ) { // place the selection into the textarea var selectionText = _editor .
getSelectionAsText ( ) ; if ( selectionText && selectionText != '' ) { grabAndGo ( selectionText ) ; } //
Cut } else if ( e. keyCode == 88 /*x*/ ) { // place the selection into the textarea var selectionObject = _editor .
getSelection ( ) ; if ( selectionObject ) { var selectionText = _editor .
model .
getChunk ( selectionObject ) ; if ( selectionText && selectionText != '' ) { grabAndGo ( selectionText ) ; _editor . ui . actions .
deleteSelection ( selectionObject ) ; } } //
Paste } else if ( e. keyCode == 86 /*v*/ ) { focusSelectAndGo ( ) ; setTimeout ( function ( ) { // wait just a TOUCH to make sure that it is selected var args = bespin .
editor .
utils .
buildArgs ( ) ; args .
chunk = copynpaster .
value ; if ( args .
chunk ) _editor .
ui . actions .
insertChunk ( args ) ; } , 1 ) ; } } } ) ; } , uninstall : function ( ) { dojo .
disconnect ( this .
keyDown ) ; } } ) ;
Because of the issues , I took out the UI buttons for cut / copy / paste , and am in fact wondering if the editor needs that row at all .
I wonder if we can consolidate the header to one line , giving us more vertical space .
A code editor for developers is not like Google Docs for average Joe users , so having the visual cues probably does n’t matter in the same way for items like copy .
There are a few subtle annoyances such as running an action like killLine ( Ctrl - K ) which cuts the selection but has to do so in a non-work with the clipboard way .
End result : getting there , but still need to work on making this generally viable for any application on the Open Web Platform .
What do you think ?
Free and open source software is all about sharing so , prompted by a reader who emailed me last week to ask about books on Linux , I spent some time over the weekend doing research .
The result is a short list of books that users – from newbies to gurus – can download and read at their leisure .
There are many more books than just these available online but I chose to limit the list to books that could be downloaded in full .
I also chose a wide range of books , from introductions to Linux , books on implementing open source in schools and in Africa , to books that defined the evolution of free software .

“ A book on culture ? ” you might well ask .
This is not the most geeky book on the list but it is among the most important .
When Lawrence Lessig published this book in the early 2000s he not only wrote a very readable book on the “ culture of free ” but he also spawned a movement that we today know as Creative Commons .
Most of the books on this list are published under a Creative Commons license which means that they are mostly free to share and , in some cases , free to adapt into new works .
You wo n’t learn a new programming skill with this book but it is worth reading to get an insight into the ideas that shaped free culture , a movement very closely aligned with free software philosophy .

Foreword by Anthony Watts :
This article , written by the two Jeffs ( Jeff C and Jeff Id ) is one of the more technically complex essays ever presented on WUWT .
It has been several days in the making .
One of the goals I have with WUWT is to make sometimes difficult to understand science understandable to a wider audience .
In this case the statistical analysis is rather difficult for the layman to comprehend , but I asked for ( and got ) an essay that was explained in terms I think many can grasp and understand .
That being said , it is a long article , and you may have to read it more than once to fully grasp what has been presented here .
Steve McIntyre of Climate Audit laid much of the ground work for this essay , and from his work as well as this essay , it is becoming clearer that Steig et al ( see “ Warming of the Antarctic ice - sheet surface since the 1957 International Geophysical Year ” , Nature , Jan 22 , 2009 ) is n’t holding up well to rigorous tests as demonstrated by McIntyre as well as in the essay below .
Unfortunately , Steig ’s office has so far deferred ( several requests ) to provide the complete data sets needed to replicate and test his paper , and has left on a trip to Antarctica and the remaining data is not “ expected ” to be available until his return .
To help layman readers understand the terminology used , here is a mini-glossary in advance :
RegEM – Regularized Expectation Maximization
PCA – Principal Components Analysis
PC – Principal Components
AWS – Automatic Weather Stations
One of the more difficult concepts is RegEM , an algorithm developed by Tapio Schneider in 2001 .
It ’s a form of expectation maximization ( EM ) which is a common and well understood method for infilling missing data .
As we ’ve previously noted on WUWT , many of the weather stations used in the Steig et al study had issues with being buried by snow , causing significant data gaps in the Antarctic record and in some burial cases stations have been accidentally lost or confused with others at different lat / lons .
Then of course there is the problem of coming up with trends for the entire Antarctic continent when most of the weather station data is from the periphery and the penisula , with very little data from the interior .
Expectation Maximization is a method which uses a normal distribution to compute the best probability of fit to a missing piece of data .
Regularization is required when so much data is missing that the EM method wo n’t solve .
That makes it a statistically dangerous technique to use and as Kevin Trenberth , climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research , said in an e-mail : “ It is hard to make data where none exist . ” ( Source : MSNBC article )
It is also valuable to note that one of the co-authors of Steig et al , Dr. Michael Mann , dabbles quite a bit in RegEm in this preparatory paper to Mann et al 2008 “ Return of the Hockey Stick ” .
For those that prefer to print and read , I ’ve made a PDF file of this article available here .
Introduction
This article is an attempt to describe some of the early results from the Antarctic reconstruction recently published on the cover of Nature which demonstrated a warming trend in the Antarctic since 1956 .
Actual surface temperatures in the Antarctic are hard to come by with only about 30 stations prior to 1980 recorded through tedious and difficult efforts by scientists in the region .
In the 80’s more stations were added including some automatic weather stations ( AWS ) which sit in remote areas and report the temperature information automatically .
Unfortunately due to the harsh conditions in the region many of these stations have gaps in their records or very short reporting times ( a few years in some cases ) .
Very few stations are located in the interior of the Antarctic , leaving the trend for the central portion of the continent relatively unknown .
The location of the stations is shown on the map below .
In addition to the stations there are satellite data from an infrared surface temperature measurement which records the temperature of the actual emission from the surface of the ice / ground in the Antarctic .
This is different from the microwave absorption measurements as made from UAH / RSS data which measure temperatures in a thickness of the atmosphere .
This dataset did n’t start until 1982 .
Steig 09 is an attempt to reconstruct the continent - wide temperatures using a combination of measurements from the surface stations shown above and the post - 1982 satellite data .
The complex math behind the paper is an attempt to ‘ paste ’ the 30ish pre-1982 real surface station measurements onto 5509 individual gridcells from the satellite data .
An engineer or vision system designer could use several straightforward methods which would insure reasonable distribution of the trends across the grid based on a huge variety of area weighting algorithms , the accuracy of any of the methods would depend on the amount of data available .
These well understood methods were ignored in Steig09 in favor of RegEM .
The use of Principal Component Analysis in the reconstruction
Steig 09 presents the satellite reconstructions as the trend and also provides an AWS reconstruction as verification of the satellite data rather than a separate stand alone result presumably due to the sparseness of the actual data .
An algorithm called RegEM was used for infilling the missing data .
Missing data includes pre 1982 for satellites and all years for the very sparse AWS data .
While Dr. Steig has provided the reconstructions to the public , he has declined to provide any of the satellite , station or AWS temperature measurements used as inputs to the RegEM algorithm .
Since the station and AWS measurements were available through other sources , this paper focuses on the AWS reconstruction .
Without getting into the detail of PCA analysis , the algorithm uses covariance to assign weighting of a pattern in the data and does not have any input whatsoever for actual station location .
In other words , the algorithm has no knowledge of the distance between stations and must infill missing data based solely on the correlation with other data sets .
This means there is a possibility that with improper or incomplete checks , a trend from the peninsula on the west coast could be applied all the way to the east .
The only control is the correlation of one temperature measurement to another .
If you were an engineer concerned with the quality of your result , you would recognize the possibility of accidental mismatch and do a reasonable amount of checking to insure that the stations were properly assigned after infilling .
Steig et. al. described no attempts to check this basic potential problem with RegEM analysis .
This paper will describe a simple method we used to determine that the AWS reconstruction is rife with spurious ( i.e. appear real but really are n’t ) correlations attributed to the methods used by Dr. Steig .
These spurious correlations can take a localized climactic pattern and “ smear ” it over a large region that lacks adequate data of its own .
Now is where it becomes a little tricky .
RegEM uses a reduced information dataset to infill the missing values .
The dataset is reduced by Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) replacing each trend with a similar looking one which is used for covariance analysis .
Think of it like a data compression algorithm for a picture which uses less computer memory than the actual but results in a fuzzier image for higher compression levels .
While the second image is still visible , the actual data used to represent the image is reduced considerably .
This will work fine for pictures with reasonable compression , but the data from some pixels has blended into others .
Steig 09 uses 3 trends to represent all of the data in the Antarctic .
In it ’s full complexity using 3 PC ’s is analogous to representing not just a picture but actually a movie of the Antarctic with three color ‘ trends ’ where the color of each pixel changes according to different weights of the same red , green and blue color trends ( PC’s ) .
With enough PC ’s the movie could be replicated perfectly with no loss .
Here ’s an important quote from the paper .
“ We therefore used the RegEM algorithm with a cut - off parameter K=3 .
A disadvantage of excluding higher - order terms ( k>3 ) is that this fails to fully capture the variance in the Antarctic Peninsula region .
We accept this tradeoff because the Peninsula is already the best - observed region of the Antarctic . ”
Above : a graph from Steve McIntyre of ClimateAudit where he demonstrates how “ K=3 was in fact a fortuitous choice , as this proved to yield the maximum AWS trend , something that will , I ’m sure , astonish most CA readers . ”
K=3 means only 3 trends were used , the ‘ lack of captured variance ’ is an acknowledgement and acceptance of the fuzziness of the image .
It ’s easy to imagine that it would be difficult to represent a complex movie image of Antarctic with any sharpness from 1957 to 2006 temperature with the same 3 color trends reweighted for every pixel .
In the satellite version of the Antarctic movie the three trends look like this .
Note that the sudden step in the 3rd trend would cause a jump in the ‘ temperature ’ of the entire movie .
This represents the temperature change between the pre 1982 recreated data and the after 1982 real data in the satellite reconstruction .
This is a strong yet overlooked hint that something may not be right with the result .
In the case of the AWS reconstruction we have only 63 AWS stations to make the movie screen , by which the trends of 42 surface station points are used to infill the remaining data .
If the data from one surface station is copied to the wrong AWS stations the average will overweight and underweight some trends .
So the question becomes , is the compression level too high ?
The problems that arise when using too few principal components
Fortunately , we ’re here to help in this matter .
Steve McIntyre again provided the answer with a simple plot of the actual surface station data correlation with distance .
This correlation plot compares the similarities ‘ correlation ’ of each temperature station with all of the 41 other manual surface stations against the distance between them .
A correlation of 1 means the data from one station is exactly equal to the other .
Because A ->
B correlation is n’t a perfect match for B-> A there are 42 * 42 separate points in the graph .
This first scatter plot is from measured temperature data prior to any infilling of missing measurements .
Station to station distance is shown on the X axis .
The correlation coefficient is shown on the Y axis .
Since this plot above represents the only real data we have existing back to 1957 , it demonstrates the expected ‘ natural ’ spatial relationship from any properly controlled RegEM analysis .
The correlation drops with distance which we would expect because temps from stations thousands of miles away should be less related than those next to each other .
( Note that there are a few stations that show a positive correlation beyond 6000 km .
These are entirely from non-continental northern islands inexplicably used by Steig in the reconstruction .
No continental stations exhibit positive correlations at these distances . )
If RegEM works , the reconstructed RegEM imputed ( infilled ) data correlation vs. distance should have a very similar pattern to the real data .
Here ’s a graph of the AWS reconstruction with infilled temperature values .
Compare this plot with the previous plot from actual measured temperatures .
Now contrast that with the AWS plot above .
The infilled AWS reconstruction has no clearly evident pattern of decay over distance .
In fact , many of the stations show a correlation of close to 1 for stations at 3000 km distant !
The measured station data is our best indicator of true Antarctic trends and it shows no sign that these long distance correlations occur .
Of course , common sense should also make one suspicious of these long distance correlations as they would be comparable to data that indicated Los Angeles and Chicago had closely correlated climate .
It was earlier mentioned that the use of 3 PCs was analogous to the loss of detail that occurs in data compressions .
Since the AWS input data is available , it is possible to regenerate the AWS reconstruction using a higher number of PCs .
It stood to reason that spurious correlations could be reduced by retaining the spatial detail lost in the 3 PC reconstruction .
Using RegEM , we generated a new AWS reconstruction using the same input data but with 7 PCs .
The distance correlations are shown in the plot below .
Note the dramatic improvement over that shown in the previous plot .
The correlation decay with distance so clearly seen in the measured station temperature data has returned .
While the cone of the RegEM data is slightly wider than the ‘ real ’ surface station data , the counterintuitive long distance correlations seen in the Steig reconstruction have completely disappeared .
It seems clear that limiting the reconstruction to 3 PCs resulted in numerous spurious correlations when infilling missing station data .
Using only 3 principal components distorts temperature trends
If Antarctica had uniform temperature trends across the continent , the spurious correlations might not have a large impact in the overall reconstruction .
Individual sites may have some errors , but the overall trend would be reasonably close .
However , Antarctica is anything but uniform .
The spurious correlations can allow unique climactic trends from a localized region to be spread over a larger area , particularly if an area lacks detailed climate records of its own .
It is our conclusion is that is exactly what is happening with the Steig AWS reconstruction .
Consider the case of the Antarctic Peninsula :
The peninsula is geographically isolated from the rest of the continent
The peninsula is less than 5 % of the total continental land mass
The peninsula is known to be warming at a rate much higher than anywhere else in Antarctica
The peninsula is bordered by a vast area known as West Antarctica that has extremely limited temperature records of its own
15 of the 42 temperature surface stations ( 35 % ) used in the reconstruction are located on the peninsula
If the Steig AWS reconstruction was properly correlating the peninsula stations temperature measurements to the AWS sites , you would expect to see the highest rates of warming at the peninsula extremes .
This is the pattern seen in the measured station data .
The plot below shows the temperature trends for the reconstructed AWS sites for the period of 1980 to 2006 .
This time frame has been selected as this is the period when AWS data exists .
Prior to 1980 , 100 % of AWS reconstructed data is artificial ( i.e. infilled by RegEM ) .
Note how warming extends beyond the peninsula extremes down toward West Antarctica and the South Pole .
Also note the relatively moderate cooling in the vicinity of the Ross Ice Shelf ( bottom of the plot ) .
The warming once thought to be limited to the peninsula appears to have spread .
This “ smearing ” of the peninsula warming has also moderated the cooling of the Ross Ice Shelf AWS measurements .
These are both artifacts of limiting the reconstruction to 3 PCs .
Now compare the above plot to the new AWS reconstruction using 7 PCs .
The difference is striking .
The peninsula has become warmer and warming is largely limited to its confines .
West Antarctica and the Ross Ice Shelf area have become noticeably cooler .
This agrees with the commonly - held belief prior to Steig ’s paper that the peninsula is warming , the rest of Antarctica is not .
Temperature trends using more traditional methods
In providing a continental trend for Antarctica warming , Steig used a simple average of the 63 AWS reconstructed time series .
As can be seen in the plots above , the AWS stations are heavily weighted toward the peninsula and the Ross Ice Shelf area .
Steig ’s simple average is shown below .
The linear trend for 1957 through 2006 is +0.14 deg C/decade .
It is worth noting that if the time frame is limited to 1980 to 2006 ( the period of actual AWS measurements ) , the trend changes to cooling , - 0.06 deg C/decade .
We used a gridding methodology to weight the AWS reconstructions in proportion to the area they represent .
Using the Steig ’s method , 3 stations on the peninsula over 5 % of the continent ’s area would have the same weighting as three interior stations spread over 30 % of the continent area .
The gridding method we used is comparable to that utilized in other temperature constructions such as James Hansen ’s GISStemp .
The gridcell map used for the weighted 7 PC reconstruction is shown here .
Cells with a single letter contain one or more AWS temperature stations .
If more than one AWS falls within a gridcell , the results were averaged and assigned to that cell .
Cells with multiple letters had no AWS within them , but had three or more contiguous cells containing AWS stations .
Imputed temperature time series were assigned to these cells based on the average of the neighboring cells .
Temperature trends were calculated both with and without the imputed cells .
The reconstruction trend using 7 PCs and a weighted station average follow .
The trend has decreased to 0.08 deg C/decade .
Although it is not readily apparent in this plot , from 1980 to 2006 the temperature profile has a pronounced negative trend .
Temporal smearing problems caused by too few PCs ?
The temperature trends using the various reconstruction methods are shown in the table below .
We have broken the trends down into three time periods ; 1957 to 2006 , 1957 to 1979 , and 1980 to 2006 .
The time frames are not arbitrarily chosen , but mark an important distinction in the AWS reconstructions .
There is no AWS data prior to 1980 .
In the 1957 to 1980 time frame , every single temperature point is a product of the RegEM algorithm .
In the 1980 to 2006 time frame , AWS data exists ( albeit quite spotty at times ) and RegEM leaves the existing data intact while infilling the missing data .
We highlight this distinction as limiting the reconstruction to 3 PCs has an additional pernicious effect beyond spatial smearing of the peninsula warming .
In the table below , note the balance between the trends of the 1957 to 1979 era vs. that of the 1980 to 2006 era .
In Steig ’s 3 PC reconstruction , moderate warming that happened prior to 1980 is more balanced with slight cooling that happened post 1980 .
In the new 7 PC reconstruction , the early era had dramatic warming , the later era had strong cooling .
It is believed that the 7 PC reconstruction more accurately reflects the true trends for the reasons stated earlier in this paper .
However , the mechanism for this temporal smearing of trends is not fully understood and is under investigation .
It does appear to be clear that limiting the selection to three principal components causes warming that is largely constrained to a pre-1980 time frame to appear more continuous and evenly distributed over the entire temperature record .
Reconstruction 1957 to 2006 trend 1957 to 1979 trend ( pre-AWS ) 1980 to 2006 trend ( AWS era ) Steig 3 PC +0.14 deg C./ decade +0.17 deg C./ decade - 0.06 deg C./ decade New 7 PC +0.11 deg C./ decade +0.25 deg C./ decade - 0.20 deg C./ decade New 7 PC weighted +0.09 deg C./ decade +0.22 deg C./ decade - 0.20 deg C./ decade New 7 PC wgtd imputed cells +0.08 deg C./ decade +0.22 deg C./ decade - 0.21 deg C./ decade
Conclusion
The AWS trends which this incredibly long post was created from were used only as verification of the satellite data .
The statistics used for verification are another subject entirely .
Where Steig09 falls short in the verification is that RegEM was inappropriately applying area weighting to individual temperature stations .
The trends from the AWS reconstruction clearly have blended into distant stations creating an artificially high warming result .
The RegEM methodology also appears to have blended warming that occurred decades ago into more recent years to present a misleading picture of continuous warming .
It should also be noted that every attempt made to restore detail to the reconstruction or weight station data resulted in reduced warming and increased cooling in recent years .
None of these methods resulted in more warming than that shown by Steig .
We do n’t yet have the satellite data ( Steig has not provided it ) so the argument will be :
“ Silly Jeff ’s you have n’t shown anything , the AWS was n’t the conclusion it was the confirmation . ”
To that we reply with an interesting distance correlation graph of the satellite reconstruction ( also from only 3 PCs ) .
The conclusion has the exact same problem as the confirmation .
Stay tuned .

Supporting New Elements in IE
Internet Explorer poses a small challenge when it comes to making use of the new elements introduced in HTML5 .
Among others , these include elements like section , article , header and footer .
The problem is that due to the way parsing works in IE , these elements are not recognised properly and result in an anomalous DOM representation .
To illustrate , consider this simple document fragment :
< body > < section > < p > This is an example </ p> </ section > </ body >
Strangely , IE 6 , 7 and 8 all fail to parse the section element properly and the resulting DOM looks like this .
BODY SECTION P #text :
This is an example / SECTION
Notice how IE actually creates 2 empty elements .
One named SECTION and the other named / SECTION .
Yes , it really is parsing the end tag as a start tag for an unknown empty element .
There is a handy workaround available to address this problem , which was first revealed in a comment by Sjoerd Visscher .
The basic concept is that by using document.createElement ( tagName ) to create each of the unknown elements , the parser in IE then recognises those elements and parses them in a more reasonable and useful way .
e.g .
By using the following script :
document.createElement (" section " ) ;
The resulting DOM for the fragment given above looks like this :
BODY section P #text :
This is an example
This same technique works for all unknown elements in IE 6 , 7 and 8 .
Note that there is a known bug that prevented this from working in IE 8 beta 2 , but this has since been resolved in the latest non-public technical preview .
For convenience , Remy Sharp has written and published a simple script that provides this enhancement for all new elements in the current draft of HTML5 , which you can download and use .

Confessions of an Active Investor
There are some who try to time the market , and there are others who just sit back and let market forces do all the work .
There are those that argue out performing index funds is impossible , and there are a handful that says the opposite .
I am an active investor , so you know which camp I belong .
However , I ’m seriously considering moving all my investments into an series of diversified ETFs and index funds .
The Life of an Active Trader
Unlike most arguments against active investing , I absolutely believe that outperforming the market is possible .
I managed to do it and I ’m still outperforming index funds .
My returns are much higher than the stock market benchmarks .
Unfortunately , it ’s also stressful .
Unless you have experienced it , it ’s hard to imagine how stressful it is to risk your own money in a volatile market .
When you can make or lose 10 % of everything you ever accumulated in one day and any wrong move can wipe out your entire net worth , how can you not have pressure ?
Active investing , to me :
Is Stressful and Tiring – You thought the possibility of losing your job is stressful .
How about your life savings ?
Causes Sleepless Nights – The Chinese is going to announce the results of its stimulus plan honey .
Why do n’t you go to sleep first ?
Prevents
You from Focusing on Other Aspects of Life – Family ?
Wait , let me get an update of my stock prices first .
Can Consume Your Life –
Any wrong move can wipe out a huge chunk of money you need to retire on .
Should n’t you be thinking about it all the time ?
The Case for Worry Free Investing
While winning trades always feel good , I ’m constantly paranoid .
I check my stock positions on the phone constantly and the first thing I do when I wake up is turn on CNBC .
When I golf , I do n’t think about my putts .
Instead , I think about whether Wells Fargo ( WFC ) ’s earning announcement will disappoint .
How great will it be if I can just sit back and not worry about the stock market ?
Coca Cola ( KO ) reporting ?
Do n’t care .
McDonald ’s on fire ?
Good for them but do n’t tell me .
With passive investing , you can do that .
You will never outperform the market , but you wo n’t be poor if your diversified portfolio of investments are well planned .
You might potentially leave money on the table , but working and stressing to get it is basically a second ( or for some , third ) job .

Forty million fridge freezers were imported from China into the EU at a unit cost of just 18 p each between 2005 and 2007 .
Valuable electronic resistors were exported to the US from Malaysia at less than one cent apiece .
These are just two of the examples of how multinationals misprice goods as they trade them around the globe , often between their own subsidiaries , in order to avoid billions of pounds of tax , according to research commissioned by Christian Aid .
In a report , the charity analyses international trade data between 2005 to 2007 to show that £ 581.4bn has passed to EU and US countries from non-EU and developing countries thanks to the mispricing of imports .
If tax had been levied on that capital at current rates , countries outside the EU would have been able to raise £ 191bn in revenue .
The mispricing of fridge freezers from China imported into Spain resulted in China losing £ 5.53 bn of revenue from this trade alone , the authors claim .
About 60 % of world trade now takes place within rather than between multinational corporations .
When transactions take place within a group of companies with the same parent , the price at which they are concluded is covered by a system called " transfer pricing " .
As part of the price , subsidiaries may be charged fees for intellectual property rights , management services , use of brands and logistics expertise .
These services are meant to be determined " at arm 's length " or at the rate that the open market would charge .
Christian Aid's report , False Profits : Robbing the Poor to Keep the Rich Tax - free , has found that abuses of transfer pricing appear frequently in the trade data .
Subsidiaries in some countries appear to be charging vastly reduced rates for goods or services to minimise their tax liabilities .
" The way fees are determined has become increasingly opaque as arm 's length pricing is forgotten and the figures are manipulated to reduce tax , " said David McNair , Christian Aid 's senior economic adviser and author of the report .
" Paying as little tax as possible has for many become an acceptable way of doing business . "
The charity asked Professor Simon Pak , president of the Trade Research Institute in the US , to analyse data on global bilateral trade with the UK , Republic of Ireland , the rest of the EU , and the US , looking at official records for prices of imports from products from nuclear reactors to cornflakes .
He calculated the normal price range for products traded between counties and estimated the amount of capital shifted by trades that were well outside that normal price range .
Among the biggest losers of tax revenue from this capital flight between 2005 and 2007 were Nigeria , Pakistan , Vietnam and Bangladesh .
Instances of mispricing were found on a huge range of goods , from oil and minerals to parts for electronic goods , agricultural commodities and pharmaceutical products .

The modern day internet , better known as the " World Wide Web " , which has completely transformed the way we live , has entered into its twenties today as many will mark the anniversary .
Its inception dates back to 13 March 1989 , when a computer scientist , Sir Tim Berners - Lee , at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research , popularly known as CERN Laboratory , presented a paper containing means and methods by which particles physics scientists could easily share and find out essential electronics documents .
At that time , the use of internet was limited to defence and academics domains only and communication was wholly text - based , banking on general newsgroups , along with remote Telnet chat to send messages .
The document , entitled " Information Management : A Proposal " , heralded the worth of simplified iteration of Standard Generalised Markup Language , and it described what is now known as world wide web that has annealed into almost every sphere of our lifestyles .
The paper resulted into the creation of Hyper Text Markup Language ( HTML ) , a coding language used to illustrate methods of presenting images and texts in the web format , and when this language get combined with Hyper Text Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) and Uniform Resource Locator ( URL ) , it build an essential framework to support sharing of electronic documents in an electronic format .
In order to mark the twentieth birthday of the web , CERN will be hosting a couple of " short presentations from web veterans , in addition to a keynote speech from Sir Tim Berners - Lee , alongside a demonstration of the original browser " .

The WWW has revolutionised the way information is transferred and has changed the life of many , including lads at ITProPortal.com , forever .
The days of 56 K modem where egg timers were a familiar sight are long gone .
Having a service like Youtube or Spotify was near science - fiction .
The world wide web on the whole has matured considerably and will almost certainly look distinctly different in 10 years time .

I ’ve just returned from a week long trip to Shenzhen , China in a “ geek tour ” trip organized by Bunnie Huang , with some assistance from the fine folks at PCH International .
More than just a tour , this was also a tiny conference of open source and physical computing hardware hackers .
The participants were ( from left to right above ) : Jeevan Kalanithi , Eric Schweikardt , Bunnie Huang , Nathan Seidle , Leah Buechley , myself ( Windell Oskay ) , Tom Igoe , and David Merrill .
( Thanks to Tom Igoe for the photo .
Thanks also to Dale Dougherty for helping to get such a great set of folks in contact for the trip ! )
Shenzhen is a vibrant , bustling , young , and modern city of 8 million in southern China .
Just across the border from Hong Kong , Shenzhen and the region around it comprise one of the most active and important manufacturing centers in the world today .
( Hint : “ made in China ” sounds familiar . )
The city itself is filled with people , restaurants , smog and shiny skyscrapers .
At night freakishly large LED billboards illuminate the sides of apartment buildings and animated RGB neon displays ripple above nightclubs and bars .
With a few more flying cars , it might do a good impression of Blade Runner ‘s Los Angeles .
For me personally , one of the most interesting parts of this trip was spending some time in the vast electronic markets of downtown Shenzhen .
The building pictured above , the SEG Electronic Market , is a focal point in the markets .
Bunnie wrote quite a bit about this place two years ago ( and it ’s all true ) .
Here ’s what the 2nd floor of the SEG market looks like a little while after opening – before it gets crowded .
You can see a few dozen vendors– maybe one eighth of the floor .
A typical vendor ’s booth looks like this .
It ’s roughly a 5 - foot square .
( “ And I thought my office was small ! ” )
In the front of the square is a glass cabinet where the wares are displayed , and in the back is a second cabinet for backstock .
This woman is selling LED displays .
On her left is another vendor with cooling fans .
The booth size seems to depends on the particular building and the foot - traffic level of the location .
Elsewhere there are also larger booths – cubicle sized — and private offices with doors .
This is not a flea market .
Most of the booths are run by a particular distributor or factory , and what ’s behind the counter are ( more often than not ) small quantities intended as commercial samples .
This LED vendor , for example , only has a few of each type of display .
If you need more than a few , they ’ll be happy to give you their card that has the phone number you should call .
Moreover , for quantities that they have “ on hand , ” they ’ll often send a runner to pick them up from another booth or storage location .
Walking around , you ’ll see all kinds of components :
Transistors , motors , test probes , crystal oscillators ,
IC ’s , LED ’s , enclosures , sockets .
There were also booths with connectors , switches , wire ( in bundles stacked to the ceiling ) relays , tools , LCD backlight bulbs , resistors , capacitors , inductors , solder paste , glue sticks , cable assemblies , test equipment , and just about anything else you can imagine .
And that ’s only one floor out of ten .
While the scale of this is already hard to grasp , it turns out that the next building over is like this as well – and the one next to that – and the one after that .
I walked through markets like this that were several blocks away .
After several days of walking through the markets , I know that I did n’t make it to every floor .
I do n’t know if I made it to every building .
A curious thing about the organization of the markets : “ Low - level ” components like the aforementioned transistors and capacitors are found on the lower floors , while “ high - level ” devices like computers , storage media , speakers , and all of their friends are found on the upper stories .
At a glance : Laptops , crowded aisles full of flash memory drives , GPS navigation systems , and headphones .
Even up in laptop land , it ’s not uncommon to see one open or under the soldering iron .
Across the street and up the stairs , there ’s a floor full of folks selling ( and building ) desktop computers , and repairing , if not making , laptops – there ’s certainly enough parts to build them from scratch .
The ethic of the place seems to be that “ equivalent substitutes ” are often acceptable .
It ’s a gray market .
Excellent quality – possibly genuine – Nokia , Microsoft , Intel , and Kingston labels are sold openly in sheets and rolls .
They ’re expensive .
This kind of thing leads to some interesting computers :
Down on the component floors , you can see sellers using a heat gun to remove the label from a spool of surface mount resistors .
They might apply a new label , taken from an empty spool of brand - name resistors .
Elsewhere a man uses pliers to straighten the leads of medium - size power transistors before sliding them into their tubes– good as new .
He looks like a man who is whittling .
An ambitious twenty - something uses a clunky $ 2 soldering iron to attach high - power surface mount LEDs in a multi-element bulb fixture .
It will work fine when it ’s tested for the buyer , but those LEDs might not last long without a proper thermal connection .
Two blocks away– even more firmly in the gray market — is a building full of vendors selling cell phones and accessories .
It has five floors , and it ’s the third such market that I saw , not counting the markets ( plural ) that exist for the parts needed to make your own : chips , LCDs , flex circuits , and housings .
It ’s all there .
A truly stunning thing is the amount of life that goes on within the markets .
The awkward sterility of western stores is absent .
People live there , in those tiny booths and stands .
People are constantly eating , chatting , smoking , texting , talking on their many phones , laughing , bargaining , knitting , shouting , running , whispering , playing solitaire ( often cooperatively ) or other video games , watching streaming videos , watching DVDs , humming , napping , and working .
Walking down the aisles you sometimes have to stop and hold still while for a torrent of young kids passes underfoot .
A middle aged man sleeps with his head on a glass countertop while his very young daughter– perhaps granddaughter — plays video games on their computer .
A gleaming white scrolling LED readerboard in the back of the booth illuminates them both .
Down on the steps outside the building , a man opens a small bag to show me a laptop .
“ IBM ? ” I shake my head .
Might as well be a fake Rolex .
They have a market for those too .
The rest of my photos are posted in this photo set .
Tom Igoe , Leah Buechley , David Merrill , and Jeevan Kalanithi also had cameras along on the trip and have posted their photos– many of which are better than mine .
Go take a look . :)
The Story of the Levite 's Concubine
Judges 19:10 - 20:48
Just before midnight one night , Beth heard someone pounding on the front door of their house .
" Hello in there !
Hello !
Let me in , " shouted a man .
" Give me a bunch of money ! "
This frightened Beth and she hid under the covers .
A minute later , Beth heard her father come into the room .
" Beth , " said her father , " would you please go to the front door and see what the man wants ? "
Beth was scared , but she knew that it would be a sin to disobey her father .
She got up , put on her bunny slippers and her robe , and went to the front door while her father returned to bed .
By the time Beth got to the front door , the man was n't there any more .
She peeked out through the curtains and saw him peeing on the lawn .
Then he just walked away .
Even when she was back in bed Beth felt very upset .
She started to cry and her sobs brought her mother into her room .
" What 's the matter , Dear One ? " her mother asked .
" Daddy asked me to go see the strange man at the door , " sobbed Beth .
" But the man scared me .
Why did n't Daddy just go himself and see who it was ? "
Beth 's mother sat at the side of the bed and ran a hand across Beth 's hair comfortingly .
" There 's a story in the Bible that explains it all , Dear One , " said her mother .
And this is the story she told :
One day a Levite and his concubine were traveling through Jebus .
It was late and the servant said , " Let 's find a place to stay and turn in for the night . "
" I do n't want to stop in a town unless Israelites live there , " said the Levite .
" Let 's go to Gibeah or Ramah . "
So they kept going and did n't reach Gibeah -- one of Benjamin 's cities -- until after it was dark .
They could n't find anyplace to stay in Gibeah so they sat in the street .
While they were sitting , an old man on his way home from work came up to them and said , " Where are you going ?
Where do you come from ? "
The Levite answered , " We 're going from Bethlehemjudah to the side of mount Ephraim , where I 'm from , and I went to Bethlehemjudah , but now we 're on our way to God 's place , but there 's nobody to take me into his house .
We 've got straw and food for our donkeys and bread and wine for me and my companions so we do n't want anything . "
" Peace , " said the old man .
" I 'll take care of you , just do n't spend the night in the street . "
Then he brought them to his house , fed their donkeys , washed their feet , and gave them something to eat .
While they were partying , some men from the city , Belial 's sons , surrounded the house and pounded on the door .
" Send out the man who 's visiting you so we can put our penises in him , " they yelled .
The old man went to them and said , " No , brothers , no .
Please , do n't be so naughty .
This guy is my guest , do n't be so silly .
Look , here 's my daughter who 's never had a penis put in her and the guy 's concubine .
I 'll bring them out for you to dominate .
You can do with them what ever you think is a good idea .
Just leave the man alone . "
The men were n't really listening .
They took the concubine and put their penises in her and beat her all night .
The next morning , they let her go .
When the sun was just starting to come up , the concubine fell down in front of the old man 's house and lay there .
When it was full light , the Levite got up and opened the door of the house and started to leave .
On his way out , he found his concubine lying just at the edge of the door .
The Levite picked up his concubine and said , " Get up , let 's get going . "
But she did n't say anything .
Seeing that she was dead , the man put her on his donkey and took her home .
At home , he got a knife and cut her into twelve pieces which he sent all over Israel .
When people saw the pieces they said , " This is the worst thing that has happened since we left Egypt . "
In fact , the Israelites got so mad that a bunch of them went to Gibeah , killed everyone they could find ( including the animals ) and burned down all the cities in the area .
" So you see , " said Beth 's mother , " the strange man might have hurt your father .
That 's why he sent you to the door instead . "
Beth thought about this for a moment .
" But in the story the girl who goes outside gets beat up until she is dead . "
" That 's true , Dear One , " said her mother .
" But she was only a girl .
It 's not a great loss .
And people from other towns made sure that the people who did the bad thing were punished along with their wives , children , and pets . "
" But why do the animals have to die ?
They did n't do anything bad and they do n't even know what 's going on . "
Her mother smiled .
" It 's because God is a just God , Dear One , and animals are just animals .
Now go to sleep ; pleasant dreams . "
And with that , she kissed Beth on the cheek and went back to her own room .
Then Beth pulled the covers over her head and lay awake all night , hoping that the strange man would not come back with a bunch of drunken friends and demand to put their penises in her .
All her questions had been answered .
PRAGUE ( Reuters ) - Following are quotes from U.S. President Barack Obama ’s speech in Prague Sunday .
ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS
“ The United States will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons .
To put an end to Cold War thinking , we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy and urge others to do the same .
Make no mistake , as long as these weapons exist , the United States will maintain a safe , secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary and guarantee that defence to our allies , including the Czech Republic .
We will begin the work of reducing our arsenal .
To reduce our warheads and stockpiles we will negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Russians this year . ”
ON IRAN
“ My administration will seek engagement with Iran based upon mutual interests and mutual respect . ”
“ We will lead a dialogue .
And in that dialogue we will present a clear choice .
We want Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations , politically and economically . ”
“ We will support Iran ’s right to peaceful nuclear energy with rigorous inspections .
That is a path that the Islamic Republic can take . ”
“ Or the government can choose increased isolation , international pressure , and a potential nuclear arms race in the region that will increase insecurity for all . ”
“ Let me be clear : Iran ’s nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat , not just to the United States , but to Iran ’s neighbours and our allies . ”
ON MISSILE Defence
“ As long as the threat from Iran persists , we will go forward with a missile defence system that is cost - effective and proven . ”
“ If the Iranian threat is eliminated we will have a stronger basis for security .
And the driving force for missile defence construction in Europe will be removed . ”
ON NUCLEAR TREATIES
“ And to cut off the building blocks needed for a bomb , the United States will seek a new treaty that verifiably ends the production of fissile materials intended for use in state nuclear weapons . ”
“ If we are serious about stopping the spread of these weapons , then we should put an end to the dedicated production of weapons grade materials that create them . ”
“ Second , together , we will strengthen the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a basis for cooperation . ”
“ To strengthen the Treaty , we should embrace several principles .
We need more resources and authority to strengthen international inspections .
We need real and immediate consequences for countries caught breaking the rules or trying to leave the Treaty without cause . ”
“ And we should build a new framework for civil nuclear cooperation , including an international fuel bank , so that countries can access peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation . ”
“ We must harness the power of nuclear energy on behalf of our efforts to combat climate change , and to advance opportunity for all people .
We go forward with no illusions . ”
ON NORTH KOREA
“ This morning , we were reminded again why we need a new and more rigorous approach to address this threat . ”
“ North Korea broke the rules once more by testing a rocket that could be used for a long - range missile .
This provocation underscores the need for action , not just this afternoon at the U.N. Security Council , but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons .
Rules must be binding .
Violations must be punished .
Words must mean something .
The world must stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons .
Now is the time for a strong international response . ”
“ North Korea must know that the path to security and respect will never come through threats and illegal weapons . ”
ON TEST BAN TREATY
“ To achieve a global ban on nuclear testing , my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty . ”
ON AFGHANISTAN
“ NATO ’s mission in Afghanistan is fundamental to the safety of people on both sides of the Atlantic . ”
“ We are targeting the same al Qaeda terrorists who have struck from New York to London , and helping the Afghan people take responsibility for their future . ”
“ We are demonstrating that free nations can make common cause on behalf of our common security . ”
ON RENEWING PROSPERITY
“ To renew our prosperity , we need action coordinated across borders .
That means investments to create new jobs .
That means resisting the walls of protectionism that stand in the way of growth .
That means a change in our financial system , with new rules to prevent abuse and future crisis . ”
ON CLIMATE
“ To protect our planet , now is the time to change the way that we use energy . ”
“ Together , we must confront climate change by ending the world ’s dependence on fossil fuels , by tapping the power of new sources of energy like the wind and sun , and calling upon all nations to do their part . ”
“ And I pledge to you that in this global effort , the United States is now ready to lead . ”
ON GLOBAL SECURITY
“ One terrorist , one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction . ”
“ Al Qaeda has said that it seeks a bomb and that it would have no problem with using it .
And we know that there is unsecured nuclear material across the globe . ”
“ To protect our people , we must act with a sense of purpose without delay . ”
“ Today , I am announcing a new international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years . ”
ON COOPERATION
“ To denounce , or shrug off , a call for cooperation is an easy but also cowardly thing to do .
That is how wars begin .
That ’s where human progress ends . ”
“ There is violence and injustice in our world that must be confronted .
We must confront it , not by splitting apart , but by standing together as free nations , as free people .
I know that a call to arms can stir the souls of men and women more than a call to lay them down .
But that is why the voices for peace and progress must be raised together . ”

Fish caught near wastewater treatment plants serving five major U.S. cities had residues of pharmaceuticals in them , including medicines used to treat high cholesterol , allergies , high blood pressure , bipolar disorder and depression , researchers reported Wednesday .
Findings from this first nationwide study of human drugs in fish tissue have prompted the Environmental Protection Agency to significantly expand similar ongoing research to more than 150 different locations .
" The average person hopefully will see this type of a study and see the importance of us thinking about water that we use every day , where does it come from , where does it go to ?
We need to understand this is a limited resource and we need to learn a lot more about our impacts on it , " said study co-author Bryan Brooks , a Baylor University researcher and professor who has published more than a dozen studies related to pharmaceuticals in the environment .
A person would have to eat hundreds of thousands of fish dinners to get even a single therapeutic dose , Brooks said .
But researchers including Brooks have found that even extremely diluted concentrations of pharmaceutical residues can harm fish , frogs and other aquatic species because of their constant exposure to contaminated water .
Brooks and his colleague Kevin Chambliss tested fish caught in rivers where wastewater treatment plants release treated sewage in Chicago , Dallas , Phoenix , Philadelphia and Orlando , Fla .
For comparison , they also tested fish from New Mexico 's pristine Gila River Wilderness Area , an area isolated from human sources of pollution .
Earlier research has confirmed that fish absorb medicines because the rivers they live in are contaminated with traces of drugs that are not removed in sewage treatment plants .
Much of the contamination comes from the unmetabolized residues of pharmaceuticals that people have taken and excreted ; unused medications dumped down the drain also contribute to the problem .
The researchers , whose work was funded by a $ 150,000 EPA grant , tested fish for 24 different pharmaceuticals , as well as 12 chemicals found in personal care products .
They found trace concentrations of seven drugs and two soap scent chemicals in fish at all five of the urban river sites .
The amounts varied , but some of the fish had combinations of many of the compounds in their livers .
The researchers did n't detect anything in the reference fish caught in rural New Mexico .
In an ongoing investigation , The Associated Press has reported trace concentrations of pharmaceuticals have been detected in drinking water provided to at least 46 million Americans .
The EPA has called for additional studies about the impact on humans of long - term consumption of minute amounts of medicines in their drinking water , especially in unknown combinations .
Limited laboratory studies have shown that human cells failed to grow or took unusual shapes when exposed to combinations of some pharmaceuticals found in drinking water .
" This pilot study is one important way that EPA is increasing its scientific knowledge about the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment , " said EPA spokeswoman Suzanne Rudzinski .
She said the completed and expanded EPA sampling for pharmaceuticals and other compounds in fish and surface water is part of the agency 's National Rivers and Stream Assessment .

Nintendo have announced the next batch of games for the DSi are being prepared for release in Japan .
The new games seem to be taking the handheld console into a slightly different direction away from the gaming market and further into the PDA arena as the new “ games ” will involve the addition of an alarm clock and a train map – how fun !
Nintendo are planning on releasing 8 new games under the cloak of what they are calling DSiWare , including a card game , two artistic shortform games and a to - go version of Planet Puzzle League .
These additions to the DSi are fine , but when you start throwing in an alarm clock and calling it a game , that ’s when you know the ideas are pretty thin on the ground .
In a time when 5 year olds are given iPhones , I do n’t think many DSi users will be too over the moon about getting an alarm clock to play with .
Nintendo have even taken the alarm clock game a little further allowing the user / player to pay 200 DSi points for the ability to set alarm sounds recorded through the microphone .
Is this really coming from the creators of the record breaking Wii and DS consoles ?
At least the train maps provide useful information for its users .
The map application will allow Japanese train - goers to plan their routes using the DSi stylus .
The DSiWare games will be ready for release on the 28th January .
With the likes of the alarm clock and the train map application , Nintendo are also releasing Chotto Panel de Pon , an updated version of the classic puzzle game .
They ’re not stopping there , however , as another puzzle game will be available called Chotto Suujin Taisen which allows its players to connect to up to 3 other DSis over the Wi-Fi Connection mode .
The two artistic games involve moving and matching blocks that are dropping in a game called PicoPict , which sounds a little too similar to Tetris .
The other artistic game involves matching coloured balls and moving about panels that again are coloured in a game called Somnium .
Each of these games would cost the average user ( residing in Japan ) a mere 500 DSi points , or £ 4.25 to those who work in pounds .
The card game that will also be made available is actually a collection of five different card games for the DSi user ’s entertainment .
Blackjack , American Page One , Page One , Daifugou and Poker make up the five card games that will be found in the game entitled Chotto Asobi Taizen Jikkuri Trump .
Although the games are only available in Japan , as is the case with the actual DSi console itself , there is still no word as to when we will be able to get the chance to have a go at either games or console in Britain .
It will be interesting to see how successful this DSiWare idea is in this country .
Last year I visited the Hall of Presidents in Disney World , home of the walking , talking animatronic presidents .
In the anteroom where they hold you before the show starts , they had paintings of all the important early presidents .
There was Washington .
Then John Adams , the second president .
Then Thomas Jefferson , the third president .
Then the fourth president , James Monroe .
Wait ....
Rally in support of Nepal 's Maoists .
Kathmandu --
On April 2 , 2009 , Lal Salam's Ben Peterson -- a socialist activist visiting from Australia -- had the opportunity to interview Suresh Kumar Ale Magar , who is an elected member of Nepal 's Constituent Assembly and a militant of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) .
`` We see the policies and the struggle of the people in Venezuela , Bolivia and the Latin American countries against imperialism , particularly against US imperialism ...
I strongly believe that in the future that there could be an international anti-imperialist organisation , of which those countries would be a major part . '' * * *
So you are a member of the Constituent Assembly and the Unified Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) .
How long have you been part of the Maoist movement ?
The Maoist movement ?
About 30 years , three decades .
That 's a considerable amount of time .
So you were with the party throughout the People 's War period ?
When I joined the movement it was not the Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) , it was named at that time the Communist Party of Nepal ( Masal ) .
But later there were many separations , separate factions and then we became the Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) .
After the reintegration of the CPN ( Masal ) and the CPN ( Maoist ) , the party is now the Unified CPN ( Maoist ) .
You were elected to the Constituent Assembly in the first past the post system ?
( 1)
Yes .
From which district ?
From constituency number one Tanahun district .
There has been a lot of talk from the party leadership about leading the revolution from the government , this is very new and a very different tactic , and it is a very different tactic to the People 's War , which went for over 10 years .
The tactics of the party have changed , but have the overall goals and aims of the party changed as well ?
No , the overall goal of the party has not changed at all and shall not ever change .
Our ultimate goal will remain the same , of course there will be different tactics , tactical change .
This is what we have done in the context of Nepal .
No revolution ever repeats , revolutions can be developed after taking into account the particular context , the particular situation in a society .
We need a Marxist and Leninist model for the particular context of Nepal .
That 's what we need to develop .
We have to chart a new path , a new phase .
That 's what we have done , and our vision is that in our revolution the reactionaries of Nepal are trapped in a very critical situation .
Because of the contradictions between them they had to change sides , and because of our interpretation of the contradictions in the reactionary classes , one group of the reactionary class was compelled to make a kind of compromise or coalition ( with the revolutionaries ) .
Certain parliamentary parties were compelled to do so because of the autocratic rule of the then monarchy of King Gyanendra .
This is what happened and this is why we had to refine our practices in this way .
There were elections to the Constituent Assembly in which the UCPN ( M ) emerged as the largest political force .
And later our party had to lead the government .
( 2 )
Now there is the situation where there is both the People 's Liberation Army and the ( ex - Royal ) Nepal Army , and this is a big point of different between the Maoist - led government and the political opposition ( 3 ) -- how to integrate these armies and implement security sector reform .
What are the Maoists ' plans for security sector reform and the integration of the armies ?
What needs to happen is the merger of the two armies , and the creation of a new national army .
Of course there will be a sort of " process " as the comprehensive peace accord stipulates -- supervision , integration and rehabilitation of the Maoist combatants .
It is the responsibility of the government .
So we must respect it , respect both armies and build a new army .
Of course if anybody from the PLA does not want to join the new army , they can leave .
Maybe they would prefer to join the police force or another security sector .
But in the end all the soldiers , the whole PLA , must be able to join the new army .
This has all been complicated recently by the actions of the Nepal Army with the support of the political opposition , with the recruitment issue and the retirement of eight generals being resisted .
At present the Nepal Army really is renegade , so is this and the actions of the opposition Nepali Congress a threat to democracy in Nepal ?
Yes , there are serious challenges to the peace process , but I think in the end this will not be a problem .
After all , in the interim constitution and the comprehensive peace accords , it is clear that integration will happen , so no one can go back from that and those understandings and agreements .
I think it is fair to say that the situation in Nepal is currently one of refounding the nation .
As a new beginning for a " New Nepal " .
" New Nepal " has been talked about a lot by the UCPN ( M ) leadership , such as Prime Minister Prachanda , Dr Bhattarai and others , so what will the " New Nepal " look like , and what will the new constitution include ?
It will be a republic , this has already been achieved .
" New Nepal " for us , for Maoists and revolutionaries , means a Nepal on the road to socialism .
A new democratic Nepal .
Of course , for other people " New Nepal " may not mean this .
Some want " New Nepal " to be like what the old Nepal already is .
Other people may say " healthy Nepal " or " democratised Nepal " but not a Nepal that is on the road to socialism .
I have a document , " A Brief Introduction to the Policies of the C.P.N. ( Maoist ) " , written by Prachanda in 2004 , and it talks about the Maoists ' minimum program .
It talks a lot about what would be bourgeois - democratic norms , such as sovereignty of the people , secular state , press freedom etc. , but there are things here that are very interesting and go beyond a normal Western democracy .
It talks about special rights for women and dalits ( 4 ) , a revolutionary land reform and it also talks about " the guarantee of minimum wages and workers ' participation in industrial management " .
Are these still a part of the Maoist program ?
This is all part of the Maoist program of course .
Until now we have taken government , but state powers are not in our hands and this problem has to be rectified .
The revolution has not been completed , it continues , but of course as the revolution is completed a new kind of economy will be here on top of the world ( 5 ) .
A new economy will exist , there can be no victory in Nepal without that .
So workers ' involvement in the economy and the state ?
Oh yes .
Nepal is at the frontline of what could be a new socialist revival .
There are also other countries around the world undergoing similar processes , also rewriting their constitutions with new provisions , such as Venezuela and Bolivia .
Have the Maoists in Nepal been looking at the experiences in Latin America ?
One difference .
We are interested at looking to Venezuela , Bolivia and others , but still but we think our party is better as we consider Marxism - Leninism - Maoism as our guiding principle and we follow the path of Mao Tse Tung , which means a New Democratic Revolution .
For the accomplishment of the revolution , it is critical to follow the principles of Marxism - Leninism - Maoism , we follow and therefore our policies will be better suited to opposing our class enemies .
But we see the policies and the struggle of the people in Venezuela , Bolivia and the Latin American countries against imperialism , particularly against US imperialism .
They stand against this , which we strongly appreciate , and I strongly believe that in the future that there could be an international anti-imperialist organisation , of which those countries would be a major part .
So the revolution in Nepal would be looking to make international anti-imperialist allies in Latin America ?
Not only that but we think that that is a must .
To accomplish revolution in a particular country against the reactionary forces of that country is not enough .
Today 's world is such that every ruling class of any country is completely supported by imperialist forces .
No ruling class can sustain by itself .
So for that matter the fight against a particular ruling class in a particular country much develop into a fight against imperialism .
In any struggle it would be typical for foreign intervention to come and support [ imperialist ] interests .
So not only do we need relations with these Latin American countries , but to be able to properly handle the international contradictions , some kind of international anti-imperialist organisation is a must .
This is something we hope we can build with the Latin American countries .
( 6 )
Speaking of foreign intervention , there has been a lot of opposition leaders , such as GP Koirala [ of the Nepali Congress ] , the ex-King Gyanendra and KP Oli [ Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxist Leninist ) ] all congregating in Dehli under different pretexts .
Also in the Constituent Assembly there has been increasing pressure on the Maoists .
It has widely been speculated that there may be attempts to overthrown the government .
If this was to happen what would be the response of the Maoists ?
This is a risk , and we are aware that they may try to do so , but they have a problem , they are not in a position to do so .
They want to run the government , they want to run the agenda , they want to form their own government , they want to run the country themselves , but it is not easy for them to do so .
People have a consciousness .
People have supported communist forces .
This government has come to power , not by means of insurrection or guns or means they do not like , but through a process of elections , which our party was a part .
So , constitutionally and legally , they are not able to overthrow us .
This is why India wants to be involved , to endanger the Maoist - led government .
We know very well what they want , we are thinking only what we must do .
We know what they want and we only worry about what we should do .
I do n't think they will be able to threaten the government .
( 7 )
This can tie in with the situation where it is clear that while you have government you do not have state power .
The army does what it wants to do , the bureaucracy has been either unwilling or unable to implement the budget , so does the party aspire to challenge for state power ?
We hope to do so .
We plan to do so , as we know very well that the old bureaucracy is steeped in the " status quoist " mindset and we have new and fresh ideas .
There can be no link with the past and its conflicting thinking .
At the moment we are helpless to move forward , but we are looking for ways that we can tackle this .
Smash the old bureaucracy and create a new one .
We are looking for ways .
So one final question .
Are you optimistic for the " New Nepal " and what are your dreams ?
What do you want the sons and daughters of Nepal to inherit from the current generation ?
Definitely , why not ?!
We are optimistic , if we were not , why join the revolution ?
We may as well not have joined the party !
There are many challenges , which for revolutionaries and our movement , we have to face them , we believe that , we are confident that , the strong lead of Marxism - Leninism - Maoism will be successful .
We will be successful in climbing all the obstacles and beating the challenges and ultimately we will be victorious , and accomplish the revolution .
Not by taking old paths but by taking a new one , because this is the 21st century .
For this reason we would like to call upon progressive and leftist forces of the world -- like you people from Australia -- to support us so that the revolution can be accomplished .
Notes
1. Nepal 's election of the Constituent Assembly was a mixed electoral system , with some MPs being directly election from electoratal districts on a first past the post system and others elected by proportional representation .
2 . This passage might not be particularly clear unless you are familiar with the processes in Nepal .
In short , the Maoist - led people 's war came to an end when the Maoists made a peace agreement with the parliamentary parties after they adopted the Maoist call for a Constituent Assembly .
They were compelled to do so after the monarchy ousted them from their limited parliament and created a police state .
Now , however , they are " trapped in a very critical situation " , the writing of a new constitution in which the Maoists have the final say on the constitution .
3 . The political opposition is led by the Nepali Congress , which has remained outside the government , however it also includes forces within the government , particularly the Communist Party of Nepal ( United Marxist Leninist ) .
The ``opposition '' refers to all these parties .
4. Dalits are people from the lowest caste in the Hindu caste system , which exists in Nepal .
Also known as untouchables .
5 . " On top of the world " refers to that fact that Nepal is the site of Sagarmatha ( Mt Everest ) and eight of the 10 highest mountains in the world .
6 . These comments on Latin America are very interesting .
I should add that there is a bit of a difference of opinion between the Maoists as to what to make of Latin America .
Some see it as a revolution , others as ( such as in these comments ) as an anti-imperialist uprising in need of " Marxist - Leninist - Maoist thought " , so in my opinion the UCPN ( M ) has n't fully defined how it relates to the Latin American revolution .
What is standard however is a recognition that these are significant events and there is a need for greater intercontinental links .
7 . This passage is a little confusing , the essence of what is being said is that because the Maoists have taken government in a process that has the support of the vast majority of people and was supported by the reactionary powers in India and the parties of the political opposition , now these political parties are not left with a leg to stand on and are unable to remove the Maoists from power , and the consciousness of the people means that the political opposition is unable to use extra-constitutional means without rousing the mass of the people against them .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) -
An Israeli human rights group said on Monday the military violated medical ethics codes during its Gaza offensive , the latest accusation against the conduct in combat of Israel ’s military .
Physicians for Human Rights - Israel ( PHR ) described alleged incidents which “ reveal that not only did the ( military ) not evacuate besieged and wounded families , it also prevented Palestinian ( medical ) teams from reaching the wounded . ”
PHR ’s report followed accusations by other human rights groups and Palestinians that Israel ’s actions during the 22 - day offensive in the Palestinian coastal enclave , controlled by the Islamist Hamas group , warranted war crimes investigations .
The Israeli military said the High Court had dismissed a petition PHR lodged on January 19 , a day after the offensive ended , and that the allegations were still being investigated .
PHR quoted figures issued by the World Health Organization which showed 16 Palestinian medical personnel were killed by Israeli fire during the offensive and that 25 were wounded while performing their duties .
Zvi Bentwich , a PHR board member , said this was “ a reflection of what we consider unclear orders from above to the soldier on the field . ”
He said the Israeli military was “ almost indiscriminately shooting at such teams . ”
PHR said Israeli forces attacked 34 medical care facilities , including eight hospitals during the assault that Israel waged with the declared aim of halting cross - border rocket fire .
The Israeli military said its forces were instructed to “ act with the utmost caution in order not to cause harm to medical vehicles and medical facilities . ”
“ Accordingly , there were various instances where ( Israeli ) forces refrained from operating in an area due to the presence of medical vehicles or teams , ” the spokesman ’s office said .
EVACUATION DELAY
PHR report said there were cases in which the military did not allow the evacuation of injured civilians for days , while leaving others without food or water for “ considerable periods . ”
The military said Hamas fighters had “ methodically made use of medical vehicles , facilities and uniforms in order to conceal and camouflage terrorist activity , and in general used ambulances to carry terror activists and weapons . ”
Bentwich said his group had not encountered a single instance during the Gaza offensive of Hamas and other militants using medical vehicles to transfer weapons .
“ Basically it reflected a general approach to medical institutions , incriminating them without actually testing that or putting that into more careful scrutiny , ” said Bentwich .
Last week , Gaza war veterans gave their accounts in the Israeli media of the killing of civilians and alleged that there was deep contempt for Palestinians among the ranks .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak responded to those accusations by repeating Israel ’s description of its forces as the most moral in the world .
The military said its judge advocate - general had ordered an investigation of the alleged incidents .
The Palestinian Center for Human Rights ( PCHR ) has put the Palestinian death toll during the war at 1,434 -- 960 civilians , 235 fighters and 239 police officers .
Israeli officials have disputed the figures .
Thirteen Israelis were killed .
Is the Government Bailout Just Dollars and Nonsense ?
Let the Bubble Burst : Some Economists Say the Market Needs to Self - Correct
Think we 're in an economic crisis ?
Politicians are eager to remind us that we are .
It 's frightening just to turn on the television .
You can't change the channel without hearing a politician use the word " crisis " or " catastrophe . "
" A failure to act , and act now , will turn a crisis into a catastrophe , " President Obama said on Feb. 4th .
" We have an economic crisis , the worst since the Great Depression , " Vice President Joe Biden said of the situation at the House Democratic Issues Conference on February 6th .
Indeed , the situation is bad .
The stock market has continued to fall and unemployment has reached 8.1 percent .
But what should a country do about that ?
The political class says we need " stimulus . "
And so stimulus we got , along with bailouts and rescues adding up to billions and trillions of your dollars .
Everything that has been spent and promised to be spent will wind up costing each taxpayer around $ 16,000 .
The politicians say they must take this money from you not just to bail out homeowners and financial institutions like AIG , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , but also to spend it on roads , schools , the arts , trains , hiking trails and more .
It will jump - start our economy , they say .
" We have a consensus that we need a big stimulus package that will jolt the economy back into shape , " Obama said last November while introducing his economic team , calling for immediate governmental action .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer agreed : " Every economist from right to left , Republican , Democrat , advises that it has to be a very substantial package , " he told ABC News .
That 's all we seem to hear from politicians and pundits : " Every economist " agrees that this massive stimulus is the only answer .
But that 's not true .
More than 350 professional economists , including three Nobel Prize winners , signed a Cato Institute petition opposing the stimulus , arguing that government spending will only worsen the situation .
" Government should , instead of increasing spending , it should cut spending , " said David Tuerck of Suffolk University .
He and the other economists in the petition argue that the government simply cannot spend its way out of a crisis .
" How is it the government is going to be able to spend a dollar in such a way that it generates a dollar or more in value ? " asked George Mason University economist Peter Leeson .
" A more likely possibility is that a dollar that government takes out of the private sector is a dollar the private sector does n't have to spend anymore . "
Building a New Bubble ?
It 's quite a conceit to assume that a few people in Washington are smart enough to know precisely how to spend trillions of your tax dollars .
It raises the question : Because careless spending got us into this mess , should we be trying to spend our way out of it ?
" Absolutely , " Maxine Waters of the House Finance Committee told ABC News .
" We are in an economic crisis .
Government can't just sit and twiddle its fingers . "
Hoyer agreed , insisting that spending is necessary because " we are in the deepest recession we have seen since the Great Depression . "
Politicians and pundits alike keep saying that , but unemployment reached 25 percent during the Great Depression .
It 's only 8 percent today .
It reached nearly 11 percent in 1982 , yet few people even remember that .
" Markets go through corrections all the time , " said Lydia Ortega of San Jose State University .
She argues that right now the " markets need to go through this correction . "
That 's a reason these economists oppose the bailouts .
For a market to recover , they say , it must discover its true bottom and cleanse itself of poor investment decisions .
So do n't bail out failing companies , let them fail , they say .
These skeptical economists also pointed out that all this government action prevents market self - correction because it causes widespread uncertainty among investors .
" They do n't know what these characters in Washington are going to do , " said Howard Baetjer of Towson University .
" It 's not clear which firms are going to be bailed out , and which ones are going to get an extra check , so investors wait and see . "
In a sense , it seems as though " what they want to do is re-bubble the economy , " as George Mason University economist Donald Boudreaux said .
And when that bubble was created by lots of debt , should the answer be more debt ?
" Most economists believe that 's the case , " said Majority Leader Hoyer .
But should n't the bubble be allowed to completely pop and grow back on its own ?
" Well , sure .
And it's in the process of doing that .
But that does n't mean you just have to wring your hands and say ' You 're on your own , ' " Hoyer answered .
' Government 's Not the Answer '
But what if more government action only causes more damage ?
It seems like the stock market plunges nearly every time there 's an announcement of more intervention .
" It 's the government 's own policies that contributed to the bubble , " argued Suffolk University economist Ben Powell .
" The government 's not the answer to it . "
In order to finance all this spending , the government " either has to raise taxes or print more money , " pointed out economist David Tuerck .
But printing more money creates inflation , and that makes each dollar worth less .
This can cause great harm to the average consumer .
If we continue to print more money , " we will look like 1920s Germany where you had to take a bushel basket full of money to the store in order to buy a loaf of bread , " said Tuerck .
" This represents a huge burden on future generations that we can't fix , except by printing more money , and that 's where we 're headed . "
When asked whether massive government spending could result in such hyperinflation , Majority Leader Hoyer replied : " We hope it does n't . "
Despite all the issues brought up by opponents of the stimulus , the government does n't seem to be thinking twice about hastily spending so many tax dollars .
You'd think lawmakers would be absolutely certain that this will solve the crisis .
But is Hoyer sure that all this spending will definitely work ?
" I hope so , " he said .
20/20 – John Stossel Discusses Medical Marijuana and the Charlie Lynch Case
A surprisingly candid conversation on 20/20 with John Stossel about states ’ rights vs federal medical marijuana laws .
First off , I have a post up on Buddhist economics at the other site .
Second , see Ali Frick , “ As Economy Sheds 600,000 Jobs In One Month , Senate Conservatives Ask : Whatâ€™s The Rush ? ”
I would like to explain to Congress that people are getting genuinely panicky out here .
Panicky as in the last lifeboat is gone and we ’re still on the deck of the Titanic .
See also Paul Krugman .
And as the boat begins to break apart , what are the Republicans doing ?
Playing games .
As Steve Benen says , “ The opposition party , when it ’s not blatantly lying about the recovery plan , is offering ideas that are a ) nonsensical ; b ) dangerous ; or c ) nonsensical and dangerous . ”
In right - wing rhetoric , all public spending is pork .
Here ’s a list of the “ pork ” about to be cut from the stimulus bill .
Head Start , Education for the Disadvantaged , School improvement , Child Nutrition , Firefighters , Transportation Security Administration , Coast Guard , Prisons , COPS Hiring , Violence Against Women , NASA , NSF , Western Area Power Administration , CDC , Food Stamps
It really is time for torches and pitchforks , people .

There are no words to describe how epic this video is .
Just listen and watch for yourself .
The business model of forced prostitution is remarkably similar from Pakistan to Vietnam — and , sometimes , in the United States as well .
Pimps use violence , humiliation and narcotics to shatter girls ’ self - esteem and terrorize them into unquestioning , instantaneous obedience .
One girl working with Pross was beaten to death after she tried to escape .
The brothels figure that occasional losses to torture are more than made up by the increased productivity of the remaining inventory .
After my last column , I heard from skeptical readers doubting that conditions are truly so abusive .
It ’s true that prostitutes work voluntarily in many brothels in Cambodia and elsewhere .
But there are also many brothels where teenage girls are slave laborers .
Young girls and foreigners without legal papers are particularly vulnerable .
In Thailand ’s brothels , for example , Thai girls usually work voluntarily , while Burmese and Cambodian girls are regularly imprisoned .
The career trajectory is often for a girl in her early teens to be trafficked into prostitution by force , but eventually to resign herself and stay in the brothel even when she is given the freedom to leave .
In my blog , www.nytimes.com/ontheground, I respond to the skeptics and offer some ideas for readers who want to help .
Pross herself was never paid , and she had no right to insist on condoms ( she has not yet been tested for HIV , because the results might be too much for her fragile emotional state ) .
Twice she became pregnant and was subjected to crude abortions .
Image Nicholas D. Kristof Credit ... Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
The second abortion left Pross in great pain , and she pleaded with her owner for time to recuperate .
“ I was begging , hanging on to her feet , and asking for rest , ” Pross remembered .
“ She got mad . ”
Venezuelan television has broadcast new video of another conversation between President Obama and Venezuela 's bombastic leader Hugo Chavez .
Critics of the new U.S. administration have begun gaining some online ground this week suggesting that a naive Obama was being too chummy with dictators in his early foreign policy initiatives with Cuba and forays abroad .
The widely displayed photo above from last week of an apparently quite pleasant conversation between Obama and Chavez with huge smiles fueled such criticism .
Obama himself has dismissed such talk , calling it merely a polite encounter with the leader of a country that owns Citgo and has 1/600th the military budget of the United States .
Now , thanks to Jake Tapper 's blog entry over at ABC this afternoon , we 've got fresh Venezuelan news videotape from the same Americas summit through a door showing the two leaders conversing through a female interpreter .
No smiles in this exchange .
In fact , Obama at first appears eager to walk away and is held back by Chavez .
The American president then dominates the ongoing discussion and is seen gesturing with his right hand and pointing his finger several times at Chavez 's chest .
No word yet from the White House on the contents of this little - known exchange .
But it appears to shed a different light on the encounter .
Watch the video below closely .

Interior at Paddington , Lucian Freud , 1951 .
Courtesy of the Walker Art Gallery A chance discovery with an intriguing painting has the potential to change you , says Laurie Taylor .
Apart from the monthly changing bathing belles on the local garage calendar which hung from a cupboard knob in the kitchen , there was only one other picture in my childhood home .
Unlike the calendar , this picture was afforded a special place of honour .
It hung proudly above the china cabinet in the middle of the back wall of our rarely used , but regularly swept and dusted , front room .
In this position it could readily catch the attention of the very few visitors who were considered of sufficient status to use the room .
Bluebell Wood , my mother would say when she saw them glancing in the right direction .
" You can see the path going through the wood . "
" Ah yes , " they 'd say .
" Lovely " .
It was , I 'm slightly ashamed to say , that damned path through the wood which captured my own attention .
In the foreground of the picture it was a broad yellow sandy track , but as it wound its way through the bluebells , it became thinner and thinner , until it was only a speck of ochre amidst the packed trees on the horizon .

Or download the podcast here Because it was the only art in the house , the only self - consciously framed artwork I ever saw as I grew up , it came to stand for all artistic representations .
Art , I assumed , was largely about nature and landscapes and perspectives .
Painters were of course permitted to escape from the clutch of bluebells and try their hand at daffodils and roses and sunflowers .
They might even choose to place their flowers in gardens or meadows rather than woods with receding paths , but on the whole that should be the limit of their ambition .
It was this pre-conception which made my first teenage visit to the Walker Art Gallery so disconcerting .
I 'd only wandered into the place because it was in the same Liverpool street as the Picton Hall where I regularly attended traditional jazz evenings .
I reasoned that if it was so close to a venue where I had such good times , then it might offer some pleasures of its own .
Gallery fear I 've heard that the present day Walker Gallery is a well - organised , friendly place , but back then it was about as welcoming as a Grand Masonic lodge .
Everything conspired to give the casual visitor the sense that they were only being allowed to view the works of art on sufferance .
Several years later , when I learned about Lucien Freud 's eminence , I still somehow believed that I 'd been the first to discover him
In the absence of any fellow visitors , I did n't know how or where or how long to look .
Was I getting it wrong ?
Would I be seized by the uniformed attendant at the end of the room and marched outside for committing some error of judgement - getting too close to a painting , spending too little time in front of it , skipping past an acknowledged masterpiece ?
And where were the bluebells and the woods ?
Where was nature ?
Where was beauty ?
Where was perspective ?
It was then that I rounded a corner and saw on the wall a picture that shocked me out of all such expectations .
For ever .
It was simply called Interior , Paddington and showed a very small , scruffy - looking young man standing against a wall .
He wore a V - necked pullover , an open - necked scruffy shirt , and a crumpled gabardine mac .
In one of his hands was an unlit cigarette .
Slightly in the foreground stood a bedraggled Yucca plant .
Who was the man ?
What was he doing in the room ?
And how tall was he ?
Did he look so small because of the size of the plant and the wall behind him ?
Word of mouth I read that the artist was Lucian Freud .
My mother had n't heard of him .
Neither had anyone at school .
But that did n't stop me from taking friends to see " my sinister man " .
He was my discovery .
My own piece of art .
Several years later , when I learned about Lucian Freud 's eminence , I still somehow believed that I 'd been the first to discover him , that he would n't have been so well - regarded without my personal approval and earnest recommendations .
Twelve years ago , or maybe more , I was standing in a Soho pub when I felt a touch on my arm .
" You 're Laurie Taylor are n't you ? " said a voice .
I turned and found myself staring into the face of a small gabardine coated , scruffy middle - aged man .
I recoiled .
" Do n't worry , " he said .
" It often happens .
Walker Art Gallery ?
Lucian Freud ?
Yes ? " I nodded .
Searched for something to say .
Found words forming in my mouth .
" You know , " I said , glancing down at the unlit cigarette in his left hand , " if it was n't for you I might have had to spend all my childhood looking at a path winding through a bluebell wood . "
I could n't have made any sense to him .
But he smiled sympathetically .
" I suppose anything 's better than a bluebell wood , " he said , and lit the cigarette that I 'd come to know so well .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I can't believe how closely this article relates to my first steps into the world of art appreciation .
Bluebell Wood has been a particular favourite of my mother 's for many years .
It 's the first thing you see as you enter her house .
Like Laurie , as a child I too used to stare into the arboreal depths and wonder what lied further down the path .
However , it did nothing for me .
It did n't make me think .
Three years ago , my then girlfriend wanted to see as many galleries as possible before she started her art course at university .
The Walker in Liverpool was our first port of call .
The lasting impression I got of that day was of the underlying tense atmosphere of Interior at Paddington .
I too had never heard of Lucian Freud but the clenched fist , the dirty mac , the stare simply blew me way .
The girl has been long forgotten about but this painting stays with me everyday .
A copy of it hangs on the other side of the partition wall to where Bluebell Wood hangs at home .
Some juxtaposition that is .
David , Wirral Reading this almost made me spill my morning coffee .
You have just described , more eloquently than I ever could , an incident in my life that I will never forget .
The profound shock of seeing that Lucian Freud painting for the first time , will live with me forever .
I was quite young at the time , maybe 14 years of age and I remember a feeling that something significant had happened , but I did n't know what .
I returned on many occasions , to stand in front of that painting and so began my lifelong appreciation of art .
Thank you for bringing back the memory .
By the way , we did n't have the Bluebell Wood , we had the Hay Wain in our front room ( the original according to my father ) .

You should have mentioned that the " scruffy man " is in fact a great artist himself ; one of Britain 's most underrated photographers , Harry Diamond , whom George Melly described as " the only one capable of photographing the Blues " .
I first met Harry in ' 76 when I worked in Ronnie Scott 's Jazz Club .
He would shuffle in with the most remarkable photos in his shabby carrier bag , happy to show them to anyone interested enough to look .
I also had the joy of being his neighbour in Whitechapel and found him to be a hilarious raconteur , one of the great Soho characters .
His frugality was legendary : he boasted that he never slept in an air raid shelter throughout the whole of World War II , as he was " already paying good money for a bed in a lodging house " .
And of organising an evening 's drinking with Jeffrey Bernard : " He bought the gin , I brought the lemon .
But the way I sliced it , it lasted the whole bottle ! "
A true gem .
Lucian Freud should consider a second portrait .

Thank you !
I have spent the last few years trying to work out what that painting was called .
Interior , Paddington .
When I was 16 I went to the Walker Art gallery on a school trip with the Liverpool beat poet Adrian Henry .
We had to choose a picture and write a poem about it .
I chose this one and wrote a very teen angst filled poem as a result .
I love this painting .
The odd looking man , nicotine stained fingers , distress plant .
Everything about it says I should n't like it , but for some reason I do .
I bought a postcard of the painting during the trip and stuck it to my wall .
That man stared at me looking as confused as I felt for most of my teenage years , until it was eventually taken down and stuffed in a draw .
When I eventually dug it up a few a years back , the name and artist had gone .
So now I know .
Will be getting a print up as soon a possible framed and stuck on my wall .
Russian Linesman , Nottingham
In 1957 , just before I left home to work as an apprentice , I went to an art exhibition in Nottingham Castle .
Whilst wandering around , I happened upon a picture entitled " The Betrayal " It consisted of , what looked like , a whole jumble of purple - ish lines .
I looked at it for some time and began to turn away whe suddenly I saw it all .
There , in the lines was the haggard face of a bearded man , ( St Peter ) .
Surprised I stepped back and blinked and the picture changed and I could see three cockerels depicted side by side as if a photo had been taken with a shaking camera .
That memory has stayed with me , but for the life of me I cannot discover who the artist was although I have searched for the last 50 years .
Does anyone know ?

The man in the picture ( Harry ) still lives n East London and up until quite recently was well .
He has not long ago come out of hospital after a fall at home when he broke some bones , we all hope that he will soon be back at our local pub with his unlit ciggy .
Andrew , London , England
When I was a teenager I took a life drawing class at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington , DC .
The teacher said my two minute charcoal sketches reminded her of de Kooning .
I had no idea who he was .
I wandered over to the National Gallery and found myself face to face with the ugliest painting I ever saw ( one of his Woman series from the 50s ) .
It really disturbed me , but I had to find out more about him and took out some books on Abstract Expressionism from the library .
Still thought it was garbage , but I was satisfied I 'd at least checked it out .
The next summer I saw another de Kooning in Chicago ... and suddenly all the surging power and staggering beauty of his work exploded before me .
I got it .
It was like a religious epiphany and I was born again , baptised in the swirling cacophony of paint and emotion .
Hallelujah .
Nick , Seattle , US I was about 12 when I first came across the picture of Harry Diamond that Lucian Freud had painted and my feelings towards the painting and the subject correspond with Laurie's .
I too was in a pub in Soho when I became aware of this man standing in the centre of the pub , not drawing attention to himself in any obvious way but he made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck .
Thirty or more years since first setting eyes on his portrait he had stepped out from the frame and wandered into my line of vision .
Talking to Lucian Freud later , he confirmed who he was .
Steve Turner , Redhill UK
I once ordered 50 copies of the postcard of this Lucian Freud picture to use as party invites .
As well as being a great picture it does actually look quite like me and at the time I had some similar trousers

MapReduce is a framework originally developed at Google that allows for easy large scale distributed computing across a number of domains .
Apache Hadoop is an open source implementation .
I 'll gloss over the details , but it comes down to defining two functions : a map function and a reduce function .
The map function takes a value and outputs key : value pairs .
For instance , if we define a map function that takes a string and outputs the length of the word as the key and the word itself as the value then map ( steve ) would return 5 : steve and map( savannah ) would return 8 : savannah .
You may have noticed that the map function is stateless and only requires the input value to compute it 's output value .
This allows us to run the map function against values in parallel and provides a huge advantage .
Before we get to the reduce function , the mapreduce framework groups all of the values together by key , so if the map functions output the following key : value pairs :
3 : the 3 : and 3 : you 4 : then 4 : what 4 : when 5 : steve 5 : where 8 : savannah 8 : research
They get grouped as :
3 : [ the , and , you ] 4 : [ then , what , when ] 5 : [ steve , where ] 8 : [ savannah , research ]
Each of these lines would then be passed as an argument to the reduce function , which accepts a key and a list of values .
In this instance , we might be trying to figure out how many words of certain lengths exist , so our reduce function will just count the number of items in the list and output the key with the size of the list , like :
3 : 3 4 : 3 5 : 2 8 : 2
The reductions can also be done in parallel , again providing a huge advantage .
We can then look at these final results and see that there were only two words of length 5 in our corpus , etc ...
The most common example of mapreduce is for counting the number of times words occur in a corpus .
Suppose you had a copy of the internet ( I 've been fortunate enough to have worked in such a situation ) , and you wanted a list of every word on the internet as well as how many times it occurred .
The way you would approach this would be to tokenize the documents you have ( break it into words ) , and pass each word to a mapper .
The mapper would then spit the word back out along with a value of 1 .
The grouping phase will take all the keys ( in this case words ) , and make a list of 1's .
The reduce phase then takes a key ( the word ) and a list ( a list of 1 's for every time the key appeared on the internet ) , and sums the list .
The reducer then outputs the word , along with it 's count .
When all is said and done you 'll have a list of every word on the internet , along with how many times it appeared .
Easy , right ?
If you 've ever read about mapreduce , the above scenario is n't anything new ... it's the " Hello , World " of mapreduce .
So here is a real world use case ( Facebook may or may not actually do the following , it 's just an example ) :
Facebook has a list of friends ( note that friends are a bi-directional thing on Facebook .
If I 'm your friend , you 're mine ) .
They also have lots of disk space and they serve hundreds of millions of requests everyday .
They 've decided to pre-compute calculations when they can to reduce the processing time of requests .
One common processing request is the " You and Joe have 230 friends in common " feature .
When you visit someone 's profile , you see a list of friends that you have in common .
This list does n't change frequently so it'd be wasteful to recalculate it every time you visited the profile ( sure you could use a decent caching strategy , but then I would n't be able to continue writing about mapreduce for this problem ) .
We 're going to use mapreduce so that we can calculate everyone 's common friends once a day and store those results .
Later on it 's just a quick lookup .
We 've got lots of disk , it 's cheap .
Assume the friends are stored as Person ->[ List of Friends ] , our friends list is then :
A -> B C D B -> A C D E C -> A B D E D -> A B C E E -> B C D
Each line will be an argument to a mapper .
For every friend in the list of friends , the mapper will output a key - value pair .
The key will be a friend along with the person .
The value will be the list of friends .
The key will be sorted so that the friends are in order , causing all pairs of friends to go to the same reducer .
This is hard to explain with text , so let 's just do it and see if you can see the pattern .
After all the mappers are done running , you 'll have a list like this :
For map ( A -> B C D ) :
( A B ) -> B C D ( A C ) -> B C D ( A D ) -> B C D
For map ( B -> A C D E ) : ( Note that A comes before B in the key )
( A B ) -> A C D E ( B C ) -> A C D E ( B D ) -> A C D E ( B E ) ->
A C D E
For map( C -> A B D E ) :
( A C ) -> A B D E ( B C ) -> A B D E ( C D ) -> A B D E ( C E ) -> A B D E
For map ( D -> A B C E ) :
( A D ) -> A B C E ( B D ) -> A B C E ( C D ) -> A B C E ( D E ) -> A B C E
And finally for map( E -> B C D ) :
( B E ) -> B C D ( C E ) -> B C D ( D E ) -> B C D
Before we send these key - value pairs to the reducers , we group them by their keys and get :
( A B ) -> ( A C D E ) ( B C D ) ( A C ) -> ( A B D E ) ( B C D ) ( A D ) -> ( A B C E ) ( B C D ) ( B C ) -> ( A B D E ) ( A C D E ) ( B D ) -> ( A B C E ) ( A C D E ) ( B E ) -> ( A C D E ) ( B C D ) ( C D ) -> ( A B C E ) ( A B D E ) ( C E ) -> ( A B D E ) ( B C D ) ( D E ) -> ( A B C E ) ( B C D )
Each line will be passed as an argument to a reducer .
The reduce function will simply intersect the lists of values and output the same key with the result of the intersection .
For example , reduce ( ( A B ) -> ( A C D E ) ( B C D ) ) will output ( A B ) : ( C D ) and means that friends A and B have C and D as common friends .
The result after reduction is :
( A B ) -> ( C D ) ( A C ) -> ( B D ) ( A D ) -> ( B C ) ( B C ) -> ( A D E ) ( B D ) -> ( A C E ) ( B E ) -> ( C D ) ( C D ) -> ( A B E ) ( C E ) -> ( B D ) ( D E ) -> ( B C )
Now when D visits B's profile , we can quickly look up ( B D ) and see that they have three friends in common , ( A C E ) .
You may never buy a new video card ever again .
Actually , the only PC gaming hardware you might ever need will cost you less than a Wii , should OnLive 's potential live up to its promise .
Advertisement
OnLive is a new video games on demand service that may just change the way you play PC games .
The brainchild of Rearden Studios founder Steve Perlman , formerly of Atari , Apple , WebTV and more , and Mike McGarvey , formerly of Eidos , the technology looks to revolutionize the way computer games are brought home .
Instead of spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on the latest video game hardware that will make games like Crysis playable at nearly maxed settings , let OnLive 's servers handle the processing .
All that 's required is a low cost " micro console " or a low end PC and a broadband internet connection .
Yes , even your sub $ 500 netbook or MacBook can play processor intensive , GPU demanding PC games .
In fact , that 's the whole point .
How does it work ?
Advertisement
The concept is simple .
Your controller input is n't going from your hand to the controller to the machine in front of you , it 's going from your hand to the controller through the internet to OnLive 's machines then back again as streamed video .
Whether you 're using a USB gamepad , Bluetooth wireless controller , or tried and true keyboard and mouse , the processing and output happens on OnLive 's side , then is fed back to your terminal , with the game " perceptually " played locally .
In other words , it 's cloud computed gaming .
Using patented video compression in tandem with algorithms that compensate for lag , jitter and packet loss , OnLive delivers video at up to 720 p resolution at frame rates up to 60 frames per second .
Of course , the quality of the video feed relies on your connection .
Advertisement
For standard definition television quality , a broadband connection of at least 1.5 megabits per second is required .
For HDTV resolution , a connection of at least 5 mbps is needed .
What about lag , you say ?
OnLive 's technology " incubator " Rearden Studios claims that its servers will deliver video feeds that have a ping of less than one millisecond .
Its patented video compression technique is also advertised as blazing fast , with video compression taking about one millisecond to process .
Advertisement
That speedy delivery of video game content means more than just video games on demand , it means no install times .
It also means cross-platform compatibility , the ability to try demos instantly , and an opportunity to rent or play games almost instantaneously .
Advertisement
It also means real - time streaming of video feeds from players far and wide playing their own games at home via OnLive which could ultimately mean broadcast style feeds to observers .
Up to a million , according to OnLive reps .
The best part ?
It already has serious buy - in from major publishers , including EA , THQ , Codemasters , Ubisoft , Atari , Warner Bros. , Take - Two , and Epic Games .
Oh , and 2D Boy .
Advertisement
The appeal on the publisher side is that it essentially means less opportunity for profit - whittling piracy .
There 's little modification on the developer side to make a game run with OnLive .
There 's even an SDK available .
On the consumer side , the prospect of no cheating — or at least heavily reduced cheating — is also desirable .
OnLive is showing 16 of the games planned for the service this week at GDC , some of them playable on low - spec machines , the kind of Dell your grandmother might buy .
Advertisement
Of course , they 'll also be playable on OnLive 's micro console , a simple , low - cost device that 's about the size of your hand .
It 's simple tech — there 's not even a GPU in the device .
It simply acts as a video decoding control hub , with two USB inputs and support for four Bluetooth devices , and outputs audio and video via optical and HDMI connections .
The micro console is expected to be priced competitively , " significantly less " than any current generation console on the market and potentially " free " with an OnLive service contract .
Advertisement
Plans for a monthly subscription are in the works , said to be priced on par with Xbox Live fees , offering the same community and multiplayer features popularized by Microsoft 's gaming service .
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the unified OnLive community is the option to save and upload Brag Clips , a 15 second replay of , well , whatever just happened in - game .
We too were a little suspicious of OnLive 's capability to deliver perceptually lag - free on - demand games .
But then we played a hasty online game of Crysis Wars on the service today and became a little less suspicious .
It seemed to work .
Obviously , it was in a controlled environment with only a few hundred internal beta testers populating the system .
But it worked .
Advertisement
Will it work in the wild ?
It might .
OnLive is currently beta testing internally , with an external beta planned for Summer and a launch later this year .
Expected to be deployed by launch will be five server centers hosting the latest and greatest games —
OnLive is n't aiming to be GameTap , with no immediate plans to host archival PC games .
Server clusters will be located in Santa Clara , Texas , Virginia and elsewhere , hoping to offer OnLive subscribers within 1,000 miles a seemingly lag - free experience .
We 'll be testing the service later this week , letting you know what we thought .
The police in Beijing have done little to prevent such abuses .
They are regularly accused of turning a blind eye or even helping local thugs round up petitioners .
That raises suspicions that the central government is not especially upset about efforts to undermine the integrity of the petition system .
The petition system provides people with the semblance of an appeals process that top leaders hope will keep them off the streets .
But for officials at all levels , it seems , the appearance of order  measured by reducing the number of petitions  is an acceptable approximation of actual order .
Rights advocates say that black houses have sprouted in recent years partly because top leaders have put more pressure on local leaders to reduce the number of petitioners reaching Beijing .
Two of the largest holding pens , Majialou and Jiujingzhuang , can handle thousands of detainees who are funneled to the smaller detention centers , where cellphones and identification cards are confiscated .
China ’s petition system originated in the Ming Dynasty , from the 14th to the 17th centuries A.D. , when commoners wronged by local officials sought the intervention of the imperial court .
Since the Communist Party came to power , the right to petition the central government has been enshrined in the Constitution .
With few legal channels available , petitioners come to Beijing , saying it is their only hope for resolving grievances .
“ I know my life is in danger , but I just ca n’t swallow this injustice , ” said Mr. Wang , explaining why he has made 10 trips to Beijing in recent years , each ending in detention .

Chinese Human Rights Defenders , an organization in Hong Kong that recently interviewed more than 3,000 petitioners , has documented what it says is the lucrative business of abduction and repatriation .
“ When you ’re taken to a black jail , no one knows where you are and you are totally vulnerable , ” said Wang Songlian , a researcher .

Debbie Dujanovic reporting
Produced by Kelly JustMIDVALE -- The Midvale Police Department fired Officer Jack Guenon in October .
For more than a year , Guenon had spoken out about internal office problems .
After we saw the photos he found and the reports he filed , we wondered : what is going on at the Midvale Police Department ?
Officer Jack Guenon 's resume is impressive .
As a cop for nearly two decades , Guenon has tackled tough assignments , including a summer spent searching the Salt Lake County Landfill for the body of murder victim Lori Hacking .
" When I became a law enforcement officer , " said Guenon , " I took an oath to protect and defend human life and to uphold the laws . "
Jack Guenon , Former Midvale Police Officer
The Midvale Police Department thought so highly of Guenon 's skills , it named him 2004 's Officer of the Year .
So when Guenon believed the force was beginning to falter under new leadership , he voiced concerns to his supervisors , including the chief of police .
But Guenon felt several problems were not getting fixed and did something officers are conditioned against .
He sought help from the outside .
Guenon said , " I was approached by many officers who came out saying you know they 're going to witch hunt you .
They 're going to come after you .
You do n't double - cross them . "
Despite those warnings , Guenon submitted a complaint to the Midvale city manager .
It alleged questionable discipline practices and sloppy operating procedures .
Guenon also pointed to low morale , high turnover and a cop shop that had become a hostile work environment .
Guenon turned to federal authorities over the Midvale Police Department improperly storing 50 pounds of explosives in closets at the police station , which sits next to apartments .
If the explosives had gone off , Guenon said , " It would 've killed a lot of people , a lot of people . "
Once Guenon got federal investigators on the case , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms or ATF , ordered the Midvale Police Department to move the explosives immediately , due to public safety .
Then there were the vacation photos Guenon found on a computer the city assigned to him .
They showed a group of Midvale officers and their families enjoying an R - rated getaway at a lake .
One of the outfits was flat out see - through .
And , they 're being filmed dancing in skimpy lingerie in front of children .
" What disturbed me the most is their young daughters were dancing around in negligees with the adults , " said Guenon .
Guenon delivered a copy of the photos to the Utah Attorney General 's Office where investigators reviewed them and determined no crime was committed .
The attorney general 's office then referred the photos to the Utah Peace Officer Standards and Training or POST , the state agency that certifies law enforcement officers .
Lt. Steve Winward , Utah Police Officers Standard and Training ( POST )
According to POST spokesman Lt. Steve Winward , " The pictures you have there are some questionable activities going on .
I think the intent was they were going to stay with the family that were on that vacation . "
POST decided the photos did not warrant an investigation .
Records show the Midvale Police Department issued a verbal reprimand to the officers who were involved .
By now , Guenon had filed reports about Midvale with several agencies including Midvale itself .
The police department had had enough .
It decided to put Guenon on leave , investigated him and then fired him .
Midvale said Guenon could not be trusted and no longer deserved to carry a badge .
The department said that Guenon making a copy of the photos violated the city 's theft policy and that he should have reported both the photos and the explosives through his chain of command .
That 's a problem .
Guenon 's command staff was in those photos .
And city records show commanders already knew about the explosives .
The Midvale Police Department claimed that Guenon had violated other policies too .
KSL wanted to hear directly from the department .
It turned down our requests for an interview .
However , KSL obtained a recording from a Midvale hearing on the case where the city sided with Police Chief Tony Mason .
" I determined we were dealing with a serious breach of violations of various policies , " said Mason .
" I had simply lost all trust and confidence in him as an officer . "
Guenon says the city trumped up a list of allegations against him .
In fact , when Midvale tried to prevent him from collecting unemployment benefits , a state administrative judge heard the facts and determined the police department did not prove its case for termination .
Guenon can receive monthly benefits .
He is now asking the Utah Court of Appeals to overturn his termination .
Because the case is in court , Midvale City says it cannot comment .
But , in a letter to KSL , Midvale Mayor JoAnn Seghini says the city is satisfied that Officer Guenon 's allegations have been properly investigated and put to rest and the city has full confidence in its police department .
Then , there is POST .
The agency that did not investigate the Midvale cops in the photos has told Guenon it is pursuing a case against him and that he will probably lose his badge .

THE BRIEF BUT GLORIOUS LIFE OF WEB 2.0 , AND WHAT COMES AFTER
Bruce Sterling , Wellington , Feb 2009
So , thanks for having me cross half the planet to be here .
So , just before I left Italy , I was reading an art book .
About 1902 , because we futurists do that .
And it had this comment in it by Walter Pater that reminded me of your problems .
Walter Pater was a critic and an artist of Art Nouveau .
There was a burst of Art Nouveau in Turin in 1902 — because what Arts and Crafts always needed was some rich industrialists .
Rich factory owners were the guys who bought those elaborate handmade homes and the romantic paintings of the Lady of Shalott .
Fantastic anti-industrial structures were financed by heavy industry .
I know that sounds ironic or even sarcastic , but it is n’t .
Creative energies are liberated by oxymorons , by breakdowns in definitions .
The Muse comes out when you look sidelong , over your shoulder .
So Walter Pater was a critic , like me , so of course he ’s complaining .
The Italians in 1902 do n’t understand the original doctrines of the PreRaphaelites and Ruskin and William Morris !
That ’s his beef .
The Italians just think that Art Nouveau has a lot of curvy lines in it , and it ’s got something to do with nude women and vegetables !
They ’re just seizing on the superficial appearances !
In Italy they call that stuff “ Flower Style . ”
And that ’s your problem , too , here in New Zealand .
Far from the action here at the antipodes , you people , you just do n’t get it about the original principles of Web 2.0 !
Too often , you ’ve got no architecture of participation , sometimes you do n’t have an open API !
Out here at the end of the earth , you think it ’s all about drop shadows and the gradients and a tag cloud , and a startup name with a Capital R in the middle of it !
And that ’s absolutely the way of the world … nothing any critic can do about it .
People do make mistakes , they interpret things wrongly — but more to the point , they DELIBERATELY make mistakes in creative work .
Creative people do n’t want to “ do it right . ”
They want to share the excitement you had when you yourself did n’t know how to do it right .
Creative people are unconsciously attracted by the parts that make no sense .
And Web 2.0 was full of those .
I want you to know that I respect Web 2.0 .
I sincerely think it was a great success .
Art Nouveau was not a success — it had basic concepts that were seriously wrongheaded .
Whereas Web 2.0 had useful , sound ideas that were creatively vague .
It also had things in it that pretended to be ideas , but were not ideas at all : they were attitudes .
In web critical thinking , this effort , Web 2.0 , was where it was at .
Web 2.0 has lost its novelty value now , but it ’s not dead .
It ’s been realized : it has spread worldwide .
It ’s Web 1.0 that is dead .
Web 1.0 was comprehensively crushed by Web 2.0 , Web 2.0 fell flaming on top of web 1.0 and smashed it to rubble .
Web 2.0 is Wikipedia , while web 1.0 is Britannica Online .
“ What ?
Is Britannica online ?
Why ? ”
Web 2.0 is FlickR , while web 1.0 is Ofoto .
“ Ofoto ?
I ’ve never even heard of Ofoto . ”
Web 2.0 is search engines and Web 1.0 is portals .
“ Yeah man , I really need a New Zealand portal !
I do n’t think I can handle that information superhighway without a local portal ! ”
What do we talk about when we say “ Web 2.0 ? ” Luckily , we have a canonical definition !
Straight from the originator !
Mr Tim O’Reilly !
Publisher , theorist , organizer , California tech guru !
“ Web 2.0 is the network as platform , spanning all connected devices ; Web 2.0 applications are those that make the most of the intrinsic advantages of that platform : delivering software as a continually - updated service that gets better the more people use it , consuming and remixing data from multiple sources , including individual users , while providing their own data and services in a form that allows remixing by others , creating network effects through an ‘ architecture of participation , ’ and going beyond the page metaphor of Web 1.0 to deliver rich user experiences . ”
I got all interested when I heard friends discussing web 2.0 , so I swiftly went and read that definition .
After reading it a few times , I understood it , too .
But — okay , is that even a sentence ?
A sentence is a verbal construction meant to express a complete thought .
This congelation that Tim O’Reilly constructed , that is not a complete thought .
It ’s a network in permanent beta .
We might try to diagram that sentence .
Luckily Tim did that for us already .
Here it is .
( ( ( Web 2.0 Meme Map . ) ) )
The nifty - keen thing here is that Web 2.0 is a web .
It ’s a web of bubbles and squares .
A glorious thing — but that is not a verbal argument .
That ’s like a Chinese restaurant menu .
You can take one bubble from sector A , and two from sector B , and three from sector C , and you are Web 2.0 .
Feed yourself and your family !
Take away all the bubbles , and put some people there instead .
Web 2.0 becomes a Tim O’Reilly conference .
This guy is doing x , and that guy is doing y , and that woman is the maven of doing z .
Do these people want to talk to each other ?
Do they have anything to say and share ?
You bet they do .
Through in some catering and scenery , and it ’s very Webstock .
Web 2.0 theory is a web .
It ’s not philosophy , it ’s not ideology like a political platform , it ’s not even a set of esthetic tenets like an art movement .
The diagram for Web 2.0 is a little model network .
You can mash up all the bubbles to the other bubbles .
They carry out subroutines on one another .
You can flowchart it if you want .
There ’s a native genius here .
I truly admire it .
This chart is five years old now , which is 35 years old in Internet years , but intellectually speaking , it ’s still new in the world .
It ’s alarming how hard it is to say anything constructive about this from any previous cultural framework .
The things that are particularly stimulating and exciting about Web 2.0 are the bits that are just flat - out contradictions in terms .
Those are my personal favorites , the utter violations of previous common sense : the frank oxymorons .
Like “ the web as platform . ”
That ’s the key Web 2.0 insight : “ the web as a platform . ”
Okay , “ webs ” are not “ platforms . ”
I know you ’re used to that idea after five years , but consider taking the word “ web ” out , and using the newer sexy term , “ cloud . ”
“ The cloud as platform . ”
That is insanely great .
Right ?
You ca n’t build a “ platform ” on a “ cloud ! ”
That is a wildly mixed metaphor !
A cloud is insubstantial , while a platform is a solid foundation !
The platform falls through the cloud and is smashed to earth like a plummeting stock price !
Imagine that this was financial thinking — instead of web design thinking .
We take a bunch of loans , we mash them together and turn them into a security .
Now securities are secure , right ?
They are triple - A solid !
So now we can build more loans on top of those securities .
Ingenious !
This means the price of credit trends to zero , so the user base expands radically , so everybody can have credit !
Nobody could have tried that before , because that sounds like a magic Ponzi scheme .
But luckily , we have computers in banking now .
That means Moore ’s law is gonna save us !
Instead of it being really obvious who owes what to whom , we can have a fluid , formless ownership structure that ’s always in permanent beta .
As long as we keep moving forward , adding attractive new features , the situation is booming !
Now , I would n’t want to claim that Web 2.0 is as frail as the financial system — the financial system that supported it and made it possible !
But Web 2.0 is directly built on top of finance .
Web 2.0 is supposed to be business .
This is n’t a public utility or a public service , like the old model of an Information Superhighway established for the public good .
The Information Superhighway is long dead — it was killed by Web 1.0 .
And web 2.0 kills web 1.0 .
Actually , you do n’t simply kill those earlier paradigms .
What you do is turn them into components , then make the components into platforms , then place more fresh components on top .
That is native web logic .
The World Wide Web sits on top of a turtle , and then below that is an older turtle , and that sits on the older turtle .
You do n’t have to feel fretful about that situation — because it ’s turtles all the way down .
Now , we do n’t have to think about it in that particular way .
The word “ turtles ” makes it sound absurd and scary , like a myth or a confidence trick .
We can try another , very different metaphor — as Tim O’Reilly once offered us .
“ Like many important concepts , Web 2.0 does n’t have a hard boundary , but rather , a gravitational core .
You can visualize Web 2.0 as a set of principles and practices that tie together a veritable solar system of sites that demonstrate some or all of those principles , at a varying distance from that core . ”
Okay , now we ’ve got this kind of asteroid rubble of small pieces loosely joined .
As a science fiction writer , I truly love that metaphor .
That ’s the web .
Web pieces are held by laws of gravity , and supposedly the sun is n’t gonna do anything much .
Right ?
The sun is four and half billion years old , it ’s very old and stable .
Although the web sure is n’t .
Let ’s look at a few of these Web 2.0 principles and practices .
“ Tagging not taxonomy . ”
Okay , I love folksonomy , but I do n’t think it ’s gone very far .
There have been books written about how ambient searchability through folksonomy destroys the need for any solid taxonomy .
Not really .
The reality is that we do n’t have a choice , because we have no conceivable taxonomy that can catalog the avalanche of stuff on the Web .
We have no army of human clerks remotely able to tackle that work .
We do n’t even have permanent reference sites where we can put data so that we can taxonomize it .
“ An attitude , not a technology . ”
Okay , attitudes are great , but they ’re never permanent .
Even technologies are n’t permanent , and an attitude about technology is a vogue .
It ’s a style .
It ’s certainly not a business .
Nobody goes out and sells a kilo of attitude .
What is attitude doing in there ?
Everything , of course .
In Web 2.0 the attitude was everything .
Then there ’s AJAX .
Okay , I freakin’ love AJAX .
Jesse James Garrett is a benefactor of mankind .
I thank God for this man and his willingness to look sympathetically at users and the hell they experience .
People use AJAX instead of evil static web pages , and people literally weep with joy .
But what is AJAX , exactly ?
It ’s not an acronym .
It does n’t really stand for “ Asynchronous Java and XTML . ” XTML itself is an acronym — you ca n’t make an acronym out of an acronym !
You peel that label off and AJAX is revealed as a whole web of stuff .
AJAX is standards - based presentation using XHTML and CSS .
AJAX is also dynamic display and interaction using the Document Object Model .
AJAX is also data interchange and manipulation using XML and XSLT ;
AJASX is also asynchronous data retrieval using XML - http request .
With JavaScript binding everything .
Okay , that was AJAX , and every newbie idiot knows that Web 2.0 is made of AJAX .
“ AJAX with JavaScript binding everything . ”
JavaScript binding everything — like the law of gravity , like there ’s a sun somewhere .
Okay , that sounds reassuring , but suppose something goes wrong with the sun .
Sun were the guys who built JavaScript , if you recall .
That sounds kind of alarming … because Sun ’s JavaScript , the binder of AJAX , is the core of the Web 2.0 rich user experience .
JavaScript is the duct tape of the Web .
Why ?
Because you can do anything with it .
It ’s not the steel girders of the web , it ’s not the laws of physics of the web .
Javascript is beloved of web hackers because it ’s an ultimate kludge material that can stick anything to anything .
It ’s a cloud , a web , a highway , a platform and a floor wax .
Guys with attitude use JavaScript .
There ’s something truly glorious about this .
Glorious , and clearly hazardous , bottom - up and make - do .
I ’m not gonna say that I will eat my own hat if the Internet does n’t collapse by 1995 .
Guys say that —
Metcalfe said it — he had to eat the damn hat .
That doomsayer , man , he deserved it .
He invented Ethernet , so what did he ever know about networking .
What I have to wonder is : how much of Javascript ’s great power is based on an attitude that Javascript is up to the job ?
Duct - taping the turtles all the way down .
I certainly do n’t want to give up Javascript — but is Sun the center of the web 2.0 solar system ?
Sun ’s not lookin’ real great right now , is it ?
That is our solid platform , our foundation ?
Can you have Javascript without a sun ?
Duct - tape in the dark ?
e Bay reputations and Amazon reviews .
“ User as contributor . ”
Are “ user ” and “ contributor ” the right words for the people interacting with Amazon ?
Let ’s suppose there ’s a change of attitude within Amazon ; they ’re going broke , they ’re desperate , the stock price has cratered , and they really have to turn the screws on their users and contributors .
Then what happens ?
This is a social attitude kinda held together with Javascript and duct tape , is n’t it ?
I mean , Amazon used to sell books .
Right ?
You might want to talk to some publishers and booksellers about the nature of their own relationship with Amazon .
They do n’t use nice terms like “ user and contributor . ”
They use terms like “ collapse , crash , driven out of business . ”
The publishing business is centuries old and bookstores have been around for millennia .
Is Amazon gonna last that long ?
Are they a great force for our stability ?
Are we betting the farm on the Web 2.0 attitude of these guys ?
Blogs — “ participation not publishing . ”
Okay , I love my blog .
Mostly because there ’s never been any damn participation in it .
My blog has outlived 94 percent of all blogs every created .
I ’ve got an ancient turtle of a blog .
I may also have one of the last blogs surviving in the future , because the rest were held together with duct tape and attitude .
Try going around looking for a weblog now that is literally a log of some guy ’s websurfing activities .
Most things we call “ blogs ” are not “ weblogs ” any more .
Even MY ancient writer - style blog is n’t quite a weblog .
My blog is n’t participatory , but it ’s got embedded videos , FlickR photos , links to MP3s .
You can go read my blog from four years ago .
Five years ago .
Still sitting there in the server .
Absolutely consumed with link - rot .
I ’m blogged to stuff that has vanished into the ether , it ’s gone into 404land .
It had “ granular addressibility , ” just like Tim recommends here , but those granules were blown away on the burning solar wind .
Not that I ’m the Metcalfe prophet of doom here — there were more granules .
Sure .
I got supergranules .
I get granules direct from Tim O’Reilly ’s tweets now , I get 140 - character granules .
And man , those are some topnotch tweets .
Tim O’Reilly is my favorite Twitter contact .
He is truly the guru .
I do n’t know anybody who can touch him .
I also know that the Fail Whale is the best friend of everybody on Twitter .
He ’s not a frail little fail minnow , either .
The Fail Whale is a big burly beast , he ’s right up there with the dinosaurs .
Let me throw in a few more Web 2.0 oxymorons here because , as a novelist , these really excite me .
“ Web platform , ” of course — that one really ranks with ‘ wireless cable , ’ there ’s something sublime about it …
“ Business revolution . ”
Web 2.0 was often described as a “ business revolution . ”
Web 1.0 was also a business revolution — and it went down in flames with the Internet Bubble .
That was when all the dotcom investors retreated to the rock - solid guaranteed stability of real - estate .
Remember that ?
Before the 1990s , nobody had any “ business revolutions . ”
People in trade are supposed to be very into long - term contracts , a stable regulatory environment , risk management , and predictable returns to stockholders .
Revolutions do n’t advance those things .
Revolutions annihilate those things .
Is that “ businesslike ” ?
By whose standards ?
“ Dynamic content . ”
Okay , content is a stable substance that is put inside a container .
It ’s stored in there : that ’s why you put it inside .
If it is dynamically flowing through the container , that ’s not a container .
That is a pipe .
I really like dynamic flowing pipes , but since they ’re not containers , you ca n’t freakin’ label them !
“ Collective intelligence . ”
Okay , there is definitely something important and powerful and significant and revolutionary here .
Google ’s got “ collective intelligence . ”
I do n’t think there ’s a revolutionary in the world who does n’t use Google .
Everybody who bitches about Google uses Google .
I use Google all the time .
I do n’t believe Google is evil .
I ’m quite the fan of Sergey and Larry : they are like the coolest Stanford dropouts ever .
I just wonder what kind of rattletrap duct - taped mayhem is disguised under a smooth oxymoron like “ collective intelligence . ”
You got to call it something — and “ collective intelligence ” is surely a lot better than retreating to crazed superstition and calling it “ the sacred daemon spirits of Mountain View who know everything . ”
But if collective intelligence is an actual thing — as opposed to an off - the - wall metaphor — where is the there there ?
Google ’s servers are n’t intelligent .
Google ’s algorithms are n’t intelligent .
You can learn fantastic things off Wikipedia in a few moments , but Wikipedia is not a conscious , thinking structure .
Wikipedia is not a science fiction hive mind .
Furthermore , the people whose granular bits of input are aggregated by Google are not a “ collective . ”
They ’re not a community .
They never talk to each other .
They ’ve got basically zero influence on what Google chooses to do with their mouseclicks .
What ’s “ collective ” about that ?
Talking about “ collective intelligence ” is like talking about “ the invisible hand of the market . ”
Markets do n’t have any real invisible hands .
That is a metaphor .
And “ collective intelligence ” does n’t have any human will or any consciousness .
“ Collective intelligence ” is n’t intelligently trying to make our lives better , it ’s not an abstract force for good .
“ Collective credit - card fraud intelligence ” — that is collective intelligence , too .
“ Collective security - vulnerabilities intelligence ” — that ’s powerful , it ’s incredibly fast , it ’s not built by any one guy in particular , and it causes billions of dollars of commercial damage and endless hours of harassment and fear to computer users .
I really think it ’s the original sin of geekdom , a kind of geek thought - crime , to think that just because you yourself can think algorithmically , and impose some of that on a machine , that this is “ intelligence . ”
That is not intelligence .
That is rules - based machine behavior .
It ’s code being executed .
It ’s a powerful thing , it ’s a beautiful thing , but to call that “ intelligence ” is dehumanizing .
You should stop that .
It does not make you look high - tech , advanced , and cool .
It makes you look delusionary .
There ’s something sad and pathetic about it , like a lonely old woman whose only friends are her cats .
“ I had to leave my 14 million dollars to Fluffy because he loves me more than all those poor kids down at the hospital . ”
This stuff we call “ collective intelligence ” has tremendous potential , but it ’s not our friend — any more than the invisible hand of the narcotics market is our friend .
Markets look like your friend when they ’re spreading prosperity your way .
If they get some bug in their ear from their innate Black Swan instability , man , markets will starve you !
The Invisible Hand of the market will jerk you around like a cat of nine tails .
So I ’d definitely like some better term for “ collective intelligence , ” something a little less streamlined and metaphysical .
Maybe something like “ primeval meme ooze ” or “ semi-autonomous data propagation . ”
Even some Kevin Kelly style “ neobiological out of control emergent architectures . ”
Because those weird new structures are here , they ’re growing fast , we depend on them for mission - critical acts , and we ’re not gonna get rid of them any more than we can get rid of termite mounds .
So , you know , whatever next ?
Web 2.0 , five years old , and sounding pretty corny now .
I loved Web 2.0 — I do n’t want to be harsh or dismissive about it .
Unlike some critics , I never thought it was “ nonsense ” or “ just jargon . ”
There were critics who dismissed Tim ’s solar system of ideas and attitudes there .
I read those critics carefully , I thought hard about what they said .
I really thought that they were philistines , and wrong - headed people .
They were like guys who dismissed Cubism or Surrealism because “ that is n’t really painting . ”
Web 2.0 people were a nifty crowd .
I used to meet , interview computer people … the older mainframe crowd , Bell Labs engineers and such .
They were smarter than Web 2.0 people because they were a super - selected technical elite .
They were also boring bureaucrats and functionaries .
All the sense of fun , the brio had been boiled out of them , and their users were hapless ignoramus creatures whom they despised .
The classic Bell subset telephone , you know , black plastic shell , sturdy rotary dial …
For God ’s sake do n’t touch the components !
That was their emblem .
They were creatures of their era , they had the values of their era , that time is gone and we have the real 21st century on our hands .
I am at peace with that .
I ’m not nostalgic .
“ Even nostalgia is n’t what it used to be . ”
Web 2.0 guys : they ’ve got their laptops with whimsical stickers , the tattoos , the startup T - shirts , the brainy - glasses — you can tell them from the general population at a glance .
They ’re a true creative subculture , not a counterculture exactly — but in their number , their relationship to the population , quite like the Arts and Crafts people from a hundred years ago .
Arts and Crafts people , they had a lot of bad ideas — much worse ideas than Tim O’Reilly ’s ideas .
It would n’t bother me any if Tim O’Reilly was Governor of California — he could n’t be any weirder than that guy they ’ve got already .
Arts and Crafts people gave it their best shot , they were in earnest — but everything they thought they knew about reality was blown to pieces by the First World War .
After that misfortune , there were still plenty of creative people surviving .
Futurists , Surrealists , Dadaists — and man , they all despised Arts and Crafts .
Everything about Art Nouveau that was sexy and sensual and liberating and flower - like , man , that stank in their nostrils .
They thought that Art Nouveau people were like moronic children .
So — what does tomorrow ’s web look like ?
Well , the official version would be ubiquity .
I ’ve been seeing ubiquity theory for years now .
I ’m a notorious fan of this stuff .
A zealot , even .
I ’m a snake - waving street - preacher about it .
Finally the heavy operators are waking from their dogmatic slumbers ; in the past eighteen months , 24 months , we ’ve seen ubiquity initiatives from Nokia , Cisco , General Electric , IBM … Microsoft even , Jesus , Microsoft , the place where innovative ideas go to die .
But it ’s too early for that to be the next stage of the web .
We got nice cellphones , which are ubiquity in practice , we got GPS , geolocativity , but too much of the hardware just is n’t there yet .
The batteries are n’t there , the bandwidth is not there , RFID does not work well at all , and there are n’t any ubiquity pure - play companies .
So I think what comes next is a web with big holes blown in it .
A spiderweb in a storm .
The turtles get knocked out from under it , the platform sinks through the cloud .
A lot of the inherent contradictions of the web get revealed , the contradictions in the oxymorons smash into each other .
The web has to stop being a meringue frosting on the top of business , this make - do melange of mashups and abstraction layers .
Web 2.0 goes away .
Its work is done .
The thing I always loved best about Web 2.0 was its implicit expiration date .
It really took guts to say that : well , we ’ve got a bunch of cool initiatives here , and we know they ’re not gonna last very long .
It ’s not Utopia , it ’s not a New World Order , it ’s just a brave attempt to sweep up the ashes of the burst Internet Bubble and build something big and fast with the small burnt - up bits that were loosely joined .
That showed more maturity than Web 1.0 .
It was visionary , it was inspiring , but there were fewer moon rockets flying out of its head .
“ Gosh , we ’re really sorry that we accidentally ruined the NASDAQ . ”
We ’re Internet business people , but maybe we should spend less of our time stock - kiting .
The Web ’s a communications medium — how ’bout working on the computer interface , so that people can really communicate ?
That effort was time well spent .
Really .
A lot of issues that Web 1.0 was sweating blood about , they went away for good .
The “ digital divide , ” for instance .
Man , I hated that .
All the planet ’s poor kids had to have desktop machines .
With fiber optic .
Sure !
You go to Bombay , Shanghai , Lagos even , you ’re like “ hey kid , how about this OLPC so you can level the playing field with the South Bronx and East Los Angeles ? ”
And he ’s like “ Do I have to ?
I ’ve already got three Nokias . ”
The teacher is slapping the cellphone out of his hand because he ’s acing the tests by sneaking in SMS traffic .
“ Half the planet has never made a phone call . ”
Boy , that ’s a shame — especially when pirates in Somalia are making satellite calls off stolen supertankers .
The poorest people in the world love cellphones .
They ’re spreading so fast they make PCs look like turtles .
Digital culture , I knew it well .
It died — young , fast and pretty .
It ’s all about network culture now .
We ’ve got a web built on top of a collapsed economy .
THAT ’s the black hole at the center of the solar system now .
There ’s gonna be a Transition Web .
Your economic system collapses : Eastern Europe , Russia , the Transition Economy , that bracing experience is for everybody now .
Except it ’s not Communism transitioning toward capitalism .
It ’s the whole world into transition toward something we do n’t even have proper words for .
The Web has always had an awkward relationship with business .
Web 2.0 was a business model .
The Transition Web is a culture model .
If it ’s gonna work , it ’s got to replace things that we used to pay for with things that we just plain use .
In Web 2.0 , if you were monetizable , it meant you got bought out by the majors .
“ We stole back our revolution and we sold ourselves to Yahoo . ”
Okay , that was embarrassing , but at least it meant you could scale up and go on .
In the Transition Web , if you ’re monetizable , it means that you get attacked .
You gotta squeeze a penny out of every pixel because the owners are broke .
But if you do that to your users , they will vaporize , because they ’re broke too , just like you ; of course they ’re gonna migrate to stuff that ’s free .
After a while you have to wonder if it ’s worth it — the money model , I mean .
Is finance worth the cost of being involved with the finance ?
The web smashed stocks .
Global banking blew up all over the planet all at once …
Not a single country anywhere with a viable economic policy under globalization .
Is there a message here ?
Are there some non-financial structures that are less predatory and unstable than this radically out - of - kilter invisible hand ?
The invisible hand is gonna strangle us !
Everybody ’s got a hand out — how about offering people some visible hands ?
Not every Internet address was a dotcom .
In fact , dotcoms showed up pretty late in the day , and they were not exactly welcome .
There were dot-orgs , dot edus , dot nets , dot govs , and dot localities .
Once upon a time there were lots of social enterprises that lived outside the market ; social movements , political parties , mutual aid societies , philanthropies .
Churches , criminal organizations — you ’re bound to see plenty of both of those in a transition …
Labor unions … not little ones , but big ones like Solidarity in Poland ; dissident organizations , not hobby activists , big dissent , like Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia .
Armies , national guards .
Rescue operations .
Global non-governmental organizations .
Davos Forums , Bilderberg guys .
Retired people .
The old people ca n’t hold down jobs in the market .
Man , there ’s a lot of ’em .
Billions .
What are our old people supposed to do with themselves ?
Websurf , I ’m thinking .
They ’re wise , they ’re knowledgeable , they ’re generous by nature ; the 21st century is destined to be an old people ’s century .
Even the Chinese , Mexicans , Brazilians will be old .
Ca n’t the web make some use of them , all that wisdom and talent , outside the market ?
Market failures have blown holes in civil society .
The Greenhouse Effect is a market failure .
The American health system is a market failure — and most other people ’s health systems do n’t make much commercial sense .
Education is a loss leader and the university thing is a mess .
Income disparities are insane .
The banker aristocracy is in hysterical depression .
Housing is in wreckage ; the market has given us white - collar homeless and a million empty buildings .
The energy market is completely freakish .
If you have no fossil fuels , you shiver in the dark .
If you do have them , your economy is completely unstable , your government is corrupted and people kill you for oil .
The human trafficking situation is crazy .
In globalization people just evaporate over borders .
They emigrate illegally and grab whatever cash they can find .
If you do n’t export you go broke from trade imbalances .
If you do export , you go broke because your trading partners can’t pay you …
Kinda hard to face up to all this , especially when it ’s laid out in this very bald fashion .
But you know , I ’m not scared by any of this .
I regret the suffering , I know it ’s big trouble — but it promises massive change and a massive change was inevitable .
The way we ran the world was wrong .
I ’ve never seen so much panic around me , but panic is the last thing on my mind .
My mood is eager impatience .
I want to see our best , most creative , best - intentioned people in world society directly attacking our worst problems .
I ’m bored with the deceit .
I ’m tired of obscurantism and cover-ups .
I ’m disgusted with cynical spin and the culture war for profit .
I ’m up to here with phony baloney market fundamentalism .
I despise a prostituted society where we put a dollar sign in front of our eyes so we could run straight into the ditch .
The cure for panic is action .
Coherent action is great ; for a scatterbrained web society , that may be a bit much to ask .
Well , any action is better than whining .
We can do better .
I ’m not gonna tell you what to do .
I ’m an artist , I ’m not running for office and I do n’t want any of your money .
Just talk among yourselves .
Grow up to the size of your challenges .
Bang out some code , build some platforms you do n’t have to duct - tape any more , make more opportunities than you can grab for your little selves , and let ’s get after living real lives .
The future is unwritten .
Thank you very much .
Over at Boing Boing Gadgets , Joel introduces today 's episode of Boing Boing Video :
After we noticed the Voice Box FX pedal from Electro - Harmonix , I noticed that they were based in Long Island City , just a short train ride away from my place in Brooklyn .
Since I 'm getting ready to move to Oregon– Hello , Eugene !
–I figured I ought to get up there and check out one of the last family - owned music gear companies in America .
Turns out that EHX also manufacturers a huge percentage of the world 's vacuum tubes in its factory in Russia , which are then sent back to New York for testing and pairing before being sold to vintage and high - end audio fans , as well as manufacturers like McIntosh .
I had a really good time checking out the factory floor to see the hand - made vacuum tube testing machines , as well as talking to the engineers that sit around all day and try to figure out how to get the ideas for new FX processors out of their crazy boss 's head and into working hardware .
And thankfully for you , [ Wes and Derek on the Boing Boing Video crew ] edited out all the footage where I was wanking around with FX boxes , looking mournfully at the camera and whining that " Hey , this box does n't make me sound as good as it does when people with talent use it .

Under discussion : Meltdown : A Free Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed , the Economy Tanked , and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse , Thomas E. Woods Jr. , Regnery ( 2009 ) , 194 pages .
Reality often bites , but news this fall of collapsing asset values and housing prices hit a baffled American public like a bombshell .
After all , for years , so many Americans had been basking in the glow of their 401Ks and home - equity loans and generally enjoying the most prosperous years of their lives .
Playing the stock market .
Buying up Dream Houses with no money down .
Going on fantasy vacations .
Was n’t that the American Dream ?
What the hell happened !?!
The term  American dream was coined by author James Truslow Adams in his 1931 book , The Epic of America .
He wrote :  It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely , but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable , and be recognized by others for what they are , regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position . 
Reading that , it ’s clear that the modern interpretation has strayed far from the original meaning .
In fact , the American Dream represents something more than the cars and big money that Adams warned about .
Central planners and social engineers misappropriated the term a long time ago , and put it into use as a slogan to convey a sense of entitlement and equality as they began to shape and subsidize the home ownership nation that first got started with the creation of Fannie Mae in 1938 .
In his new book , Meltdown , Thomas E. Woods Jr. suggests that the American dream became the American Nightmare through the reckless , self - serving actions of government institutions .
And at once , Woods puts his finger on the unmistakable elephant in the living room — the Federal Reserve System .
Sad to say , other than a few assorted rumblings , there has been almost no discussion in the mainstream media of the Federal Reserve ’s role in launching the crisis .
But as Woods details , the Fed , which centrally plans monetary policy and interest rates , sowed the seeds of destruction by drastically reducing interest rates beyond levels that would otherwise have been set by a free market .
 Making cheap credit available for the asking does encourage excessive leverage , speculation , and indebtedness ,  Mr. Woods writes .
He adds ,  Manipulating interest rates and thereby misleading investors about real economic conditions does in fact misdirect capital into unsustainable lines of production and discombobulate the market .
This begins the authors ’ explanation of the boom - bust phenomenon and how an artificial boom , and the financial holocaust it leaves behind , can be perfectly clarified and understood in terms of the Austrian theory of the business cycle .

The Best of Karen De Coster
In a similar vein to our previous article , we take another look at some of the more exciting videogame locations that have scrolled across our screens in recent years .
DOAX
Also referred to as Also referred to as Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball , takes place on the luxurious Zack Island .
With rolling dunes , the clearest seawater , a multitude of ways to relax , there was always something graphically appealing to look at .
Oh and there were the girls playing beach volleyball in little to no clothing , too .
Eternal Sonata Or Trusty Bell : Chopin ’s Dream , whichever you prefer , was a visual ( and aural ) delight set in an imaginary world which is dreamed by composer Or Trusty Bell : Chopin ’s Dream , whichever you prefer , was a visual ( and aural ) delight set in an imaginary world which is dreamed by composer Frédéric Chopin in the last hours of his life .
As it was set in a world that was entirely imaginary ( even for a game - world ) , you could always expect such fascinating sights
Final Fantasy X I know , I know , you ’re probably wondering [ fanboy rage ]
“ Why Spira ?
I know it ’s awesome , but why is n’t * insert another FF game / location * here ? ” [ / fanboy rage ] .
There ’s no real answer , Spira was chosen as an * example * of the incredible and exotic locations that one can travel to in any instalment of the stalwart series .

There ’s no real answer , Spira was chosen as an * example * of the incredible and exotic locations that one can travel to in any instalment of the stalwart series .
Spira was the ( quite obviously ) fictional realm in which FFX and its sequel FFX - 2 ( which could translate as FF 10 - 2 , making you sound a bit dumb when you say it ) were set .
Traversing the in - game globe rewarded the player with a plentiful supply of sights , sounds and events .
From the ruins of Zanarkand to the snowy peaks of Mt. Gagazet , Spira was pretty awesome .
GTA
The Grand Theft Auto series has always had some awesome stand out moments , with certain aspects of the scenery burying themselves into the subconscious of everyone to pick up the game .
I even remember doing that immense jump over the bridge that was being repaired in the first city of the first GTA , good times .
However , as the years go by , it ’s obvious that graphics improve and are made more impressive over time , so the most pleasant - looking of the GTA series is generally seen as being GTA IV .
From the outset it might look like various shades of brown and grey , but seen up close as you ’re weaving through the streets and crashing from a bridge , plunging to your doom just as the sun rises over the horizon , lens flare on overdrive ...
It ’s glorious .

It took real talent to piece this game together , toiling away for many , many hours .
It ’s a real feat to have accomplished something this outstanding magnificent .
What I could n’t get over was how the whole thing was their own work and they in no way stole from Diablo or Oblivion .
It was still an interesting world to visit ( downloaded for nothing , of course ) , if only to go “ lolololol ” and delete the game from your computer and subsequently your memory .

Prince of Persia The Persia in these games ( well , maybe not in the first one , that looked kinda boring ) always looks like a pleasant place to visit ( if you like places to be really sandy and full of guys wanting to kill you ) .
The Prince ’s last outing took the optical decadence to a new level and at times almost looked like a place you ’d want to visit , but then remembered that sand gets “ everywhere ” .

Animal Rights Activists Indicted as â€œTerroristsâ€  For Home Protests
When four animal rights activists were arrested under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism
Act , it was unclear how prosecutors would proceed , and what specific accusations the activists would face .
Now , the government indictment , available here for the first time , makes it strikingly clear that prosecutors intend to use terrorism laws to target First Amendment activity .
The â€œAETA 4 , â€ â € ” Joseph Buddenburg , Maryam Khajavi , Nathan Pope , and Adriana Stumpoâ € ” have been indicted for â€œconspiracyâ€ to violate the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act .
As justification of the charge , the indictment lists three specific acts :
A protest on October 21 , 2007 , at an animal researcherâ€™s home .
The government says this amounts to â€œthreats , criminal trespass , harassment and intimidation .â€ 
In the criminal complaint , the FBI said that on this date â€œprotesters trespassed onto Professor Number Oneâ€™s front yard and rang his doorbell several times .
The group was making a lot of noise and chanting animal rights slogans ( â€œ1 , 2 , 3 , 4 open up the cage door ; 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , smash the locks and liberate ; 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , vivisectors go to hellâ€ ) â€¦â€ 
A protest on January 27 , 2008 , at an animal researcherâ€™s home .
The government says this amounts to â€œthreats , harassment , and intimidation .â€ 
In the criminal complaint , the FBI said that on this date approximately 11 individuals demonstrated at the homes of multiple researchers .
â€ œAt each residence , the individuals , dressed generally in all black clothing and wearing bandanas over their nose and mouth , marched , chanted , and chalked defamatory comments on the public sidewalksâ€¦â€ 
Use of the Internet .
They allegedly â€œused the Internet to find information on bio-medical researchers at the University of California at Santa Cruz.â€ 
Even more telling , though , is what is not listed in the indictment .
In the criminal complaint and the FBI press release , the government mentioned the above allegations along with two other incidentsâ € ” the only two incidents even approaching a â€œgray areaâ€ between protected speech and illegal conduct .
At one protest attended by the defendants , a researcher â€œstruggled with one individual and was hit with a dark , firm object , â€ according to the FBI .
( February 24 , 2008 )
A stack of fliers titled â€ œMurderers and torturers alive & well in Santa Cruz July 2008 editionâ€ was found at a local coffee shop , CafÃ© Pergolesi .
The fliers said â€œwe know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuseâ€  and listed home addresses and telephone numbers .
The FBI used video surveillance to allegedly link the flier distribution to the defendants .
( July 29 , 2008 )
Now , to be very clear , the details in an indictment arenâ€™t the final word in any criminal case .
They never reveal too much of the prosecutionâ€™s hand .
They do , however , lay the backbone of the governmentâ€™s case and put the prosecutionâ€™s best foot forward .
Omitting the most controversial , potentially - illegal activity , and instead focusing on protests that involved chalking slogans and chanting , sends a very clear message of where this is all heading .
This case and others like it are not about underground groups like the Animal Liberation Front , they are not about â€œviolence , â€ they are not about the real potential for violence .
They are about using the “ War on Terrorism ” to chip away at basic First Amendment rights and criminalize dissent .
The Karen independence movement in Myanmar has entered its seventh decade .
Episode 1
Three years before she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , Burma ’s Aung San Suu Kyi emerged as a national leader when thousands of protesting students and monks were mowed down by the ruling junta .
The 8888 Uprising ( August 8 , 1988 ) was reprised , if on a lesser scale , in 2007 when over 100 civilians and monks were killed during the “ Saffron Revolution . ”
The regime that has been in power since 1962 in Burma — many are uncomfortable with the name Myanmar that the junta imposed — has held Ms. Suu Kyi under house arrest for a total of 13 years , the last six consecutively .
Nor has it any qualms about designating whoever it chooses to be a threat to the state .
A recent New York Times article reports that among those the junta has recently imprisoned are an 80 - year - old Buddhist nun serving four years for , of all things , insulting Buddhism .
Then there ’s the case of the popular comedian sentenced to 59 years for criticizing the government response to Nargis , the May 2008 cyclone that killed more than 130,000 Burmese .
Others recently jailed include farmers , an ice cream seller , and a bus conductor .
If that ’s how Burma deals with civil protest , imagine how it treats the armed opposition .
As early as 1948 , when U Nu became the first prime minister , ethnic minorities seeking statehood rebelled against the central government .
Some minorities , such as the Chin , Kachin , and the Shan , were granted the status of a state within the state .
Others eventually signed ceasefires with SLORC ( State Law and Order Restoration Council ) , as the ruling junta was called before it was reconstituted as the State Peace and Development Council ( SPDC ) — benign in name only — in 1997 .
Today , fighting is largely confined to the east where the Shans now seek secession and the Karens still seek statehood .
The Karens inhabit the Burma - Thailand border regions , as well as the Irrawaddy delta , the region of Burma hardest hit by Nargis .
At 60 years , the Karen resistance against the three A’s — annihilation , absorption , and assimilation — is either the world ’s longest - running war for independence or its most extended exercise in futility .
Moviegoers were exposed to the plight of the Karens last year if they saw the fourth installment of Rambo , which was set in Burma ( though filmed , in part , in Thailand ) .
Sylvester Stallone demonstrated just how universal contempt for the junta had become , especially after it obstructed aid to Nargis survivors .
When John Rambo killed off 236 of its soldiers , objections were raised to one of the highest body counts of any action movie ever , but not to who was killed .
Understandably , the film was reported to have boosted the morale of Karen freedom fighters who viewed it .

An unidentified weapon packed with strange " cube shaped shrapnel " killed or wounded civilians in the recent Gaza war , according to a new report from Amnesty International .
Amnesty 's report on weapons used by both sides in Gaza finds much to condemn .
The group is particularly hard on the U.S. , having found numerous remains of American munitions – including white phosphorus shells from Pine Bluff Arsenal , and a Hellfire missile made in Orlando .
Another weapon which bothers Amnesty is a mysterious munition , filled with cubic particles .
" Amnesty International delegates in Gaza also found evidence of the use of a new type of missile , seemingly launched from unmanned drones , which explodes large numbers of tiny sharp - edged metal cubes , each between 2 and 4 mm square in size .
This purpose - made shrapnel can penetrate even thick metal doors and many were seen by Amnesty International ’s delegates embedded deep in concrete walls .
They appear designed to cause maximum injury …
The signature of these new missiles , in addition to the deadly tiny metal cubes , is a small and deep hole in the ground ( about 10 cm or less in diameter and up to several meters in depth ) [ emphasis mine ]
While it 's impossible to say for certain , we can make a very educated guess that where the shrapnel came from -– and also evaluate the claim about maximum injury .
One likely candidate is the Spike missile , made by the Israeli company Rafael ( not to be confused with the U.S. Navy 's Spike missile we featured previously ) .
Originally designed as an anti-tank missile , it is comes in several versions – including a man-portable one and a vehicle - mounted version .
It has also been shown fitted to the Israeli Heron drone .
A naval version is featured in this video , being used against targets in Gaza .
One interesting feature of the Spike is that the latest version features " fire and forget plus " : a trailing fiber - optic cable relays video back to the operator , allowing them to see from the missile 's point of view and switch targets .
When used in this mode , it performs a pop-up maneuver , giving a better view and diving on the target from above .
A promotional – video here shows how this approach can be used to attack a target out of sight behind a ridge .
Marc Garlaso of Human Rights
Watch previously noted the Spike 's use in Gaza , describing it as " a special missile that is made to make very high - speed turns , so if you have a target that is moving and running away from you , you can chase him with the weapon . "
Like virtually all anti-tank missiles , the Spike has a shaped charge warhead , which produces a narrow jet of metal at very high velocity .
This is excellent for slicing through armor , but does little damage to anything not immediately in front of the missile .
Blast alone is not an effective killer for a small warhead .
To turn an anti-tank missile into a general purpose one capable of damaging other targets ( such as people or soft vehicles ) , the answer is invariably to add a " fragmentation sleeve . "
This is wrapped around the warhead to produce lethal fragments , which are much more deadly than blast alone .
The procedure was done to turn the anti-tank Hellfire into the general - purpose AGM - 114K Hellfire , and to transform the Viper - Strike from an anti-armor weapons to anti-everything .
The tungsten cubes in Viper Strike weigh 15 - 30 grains , which would correspond to an three to four - and - a - half millimeter cube , approximately .
In other words , right in the range of Amnesty 's mysterious weapon .
However , the Israeli military is not known to have Viper Strikes in its arsenal .
But they do have Spike missiles – which could have been outfitted with a fragmentation sleeve .
As the U.S. Army illustration ( above ) shows , the fragmentation is enhanced by embossing – cutting grooves into the sleeve .
But the best method is to pre-form the fragments , typically producing tiny cubes like those shown .
The cube shape is not particularly vicious ; that 's just how the manufacturing process works .
And without any kind of fragments the weapons would be far less effective .
( Of course you can pack warheads around with ball - bearings or other shrapnel – like Hamas did , with its rockets . )
The end result is a missile which hits the ground almost vertically after the pop-up , leaving a narrow deep hole as described , and spraying the area with small cubic shrapnel .
This is not some specific Israeli invention and it is far from the only nation armed with this type of weapon .
It 's really just another version of Henry Shrapnel 's bursting ammunition which has been increasing casualties for over two hundred years .
But unless it gets banned like nerve gas and dumdum bullets it will be very much a part of warfare for more centuries to come .
Perhaps what is more alarming is the number of civilian deaths that Amnesty documents related to the new weapon .
This type of ultra- precise strike capability is supposed to limit collateral damage and civilian casualties .
But , as with the " focused lethality " DIME weapon , this does not seem to be happening .
So we turn once again to Garlasco 's comment , from an earlier conflict :
" It is unfortunate that these weapons are being developed specifically for use in densely populated areas which may negate the intended effect . "

An early warning system , more than a decade in development , successfully predicted the 2006 - 2007 outbreak of the deadly Rift Valley fever in northeast Africa , according to a new study led by NASA scientists .
Rift Valley fever is unique in that its emergence is closely linked to interannual climate variability .
Utilizing that link , researchers including Assaf Anyamba , a geographer and remote sensing scientist with the University of Maryland Baltimore County and NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , used a blend of NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration measurements of sea surface temperatures , precipitation , and vegetation cover to predict when and where an outbreak would occur .
The final product , a Rift Valley fever " risk map , " gave public health officials in East Africa up to six weeks of warning for the 2006 - 2007 outbreak , enough time to lessen human impact .
The researchers described their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The first - of - its - kind prediction is the culmination of decades of research .
During an intense El Niño event in 1997 , the largest known outbreak of Rift Valley fever spread across the Horn of Africa .
About 90,000 people were infected with the virus , which is carried by mosquitoes and transmitted to humans by mosquito bites or through contact with infected livestock .
The 1997 outbreak provoked the formation of a working group -- funded by the U.S. Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System -- to see if predictions of an outbreak could be made operational .
Such predictions would not only aid mitigation efforts in the endemic countries and protect the global public , but would help protect American civilian and military personnel located and traveling overseas , ensure the safety of imported goods and animals , and prevent infected humans or mosquitoes from entering the United States .
" To do all that , we need to understand a disease in the endemic region , " Anyamba said .

The link between the mosquito life cycle and vegetation growth was first described in a 1987 Science paper by co-authors Kenneth Linthicum of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Compton Tucker of NASA Goddard .
Then , a subsequent 1999 Science paper described link between the disease and the El Niño - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) .
ENSO is a cyclical , global phenomenon of sea surface temperature changes that can contribute to extreme climate events around the world .
For some areas , the warm phase of ENSO brings drought , while in some areas like the Horn of Africa , ENSO leads to above - normal rainfall .
Excessive , sustained rainfall awakens the eggs of mosquitoes infected with Rift Valley fever that can remain dormant for up to 15 years in dried - out dambos — shallow wetlands common in the region .
Building on that research , Anyamba and colleagues set out to predict when conditions were ripe for excessive rainfall , and thus an outbreak .
They started by examining satellite measurements of sea surface temperatures .
One of the first indicators that ENSO will bring an abundance of rainfall is a rise in the surface temperature of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and the western equatorial Indian Ocean .
But perhaps the most telling indicator of a potential outbreak is a measure of the mosquito habitat itself .
The researchers used a satellite - derived vegetation data set -- processed at NASA Goddard and called the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index — that measures the landscape 's " greenness . "
Greener regions have more than the average amount of vegetation , which means more water and more potential habitat for infected mosquitoes .
" Greenness describes habitat and represents life , " Anyamba said .
" Without such systematic , continuous Earth system measurements from satellites , we would not be able to translate the information into outbreak predictions . "
The final product is a risk map for Rift Valley fever , showing areas of anomalous rainfall and vegetation growth over a three - month period .
The forecast is updated and issued monthly as a means to guide ground - based mosquito and virus surveillance .
advertisement
As early as September 2006 , the monthly advisory from Anyamba and colleagues indicated an elevated risk of Rift Valley fever activity in East Africa .
By November , Kenya 's government had begun collaborating with non-governmental organizations to implement disease mitigation measures — restricting animal movement , distributing mosquito bed nets , informing the public , and enacting programs to control mosquitoes and vaccinate animals .
" There is no human vaccine , " Anyamba said , " so prevention is critical . "
Between two and six weeks later — depending on the location — the disease was detected in humans .
" Satellite data is a valuable tool that allowed us to look remotely at large sections of land in Africa and understand what was happening on the ground , " Linthicum said .
After the 2006 - 2007 outbreak , Anyamba and colleagues assessed the effectiveness of the warning maps .
They compared locations that had been identified as " at risk " with the locations where Rift Valley fever was reported .
Of the 1,088 cases reported in Kenya , Somalia , and Tanzania , 64 percent fell within areas delineated on the risk map .
The other 36 percent of cases did not occur within " at risk " areas , but none were more than 30 miles away , leading the researchers believe that they had identified most of the initial infection sites .
The potential for mapping the risk of disease outbreaks is not limited to Africa .
Previous research has shown that risk maps are possible whenever the abundance of a virus can be linked to extremes in climate conditions .
Chikungunya in east Africa and Hantavirus and West Nile virus in the United States , for example , have been linked to conditions of rainfall extremes .
" We are coming up on almost 30 years of vegetation data from satellites , which provides us with a good basis for predicting , " Linthicum said upon returning from a Rift Valley fever workshop in Cairo , Egypt in January .
" At this meeting , it was clear that using this tool as a basis for predictions has become accepted as the norm . "
Unhappy with the “ tenor and doctrinal content of addresses given at annual assemblies , ” former San Francisco Archbishop William Levada , now head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ( CDF ) , has initiated an investigation of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious ( LCWR ) , the largest women ’s religious leadership organization in the country .
From the National Catholic Reporter …
The Vatican assessment has become necessary , according to Levada , because at the 2001 meeting between the women ’s leadership conference and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , which took place in Rome , the women were invited “ to report on the initiatives taken or planned ” to promote the reception of three areas of Vatican doctrinal concern : the 1994 apostolic letter Ordinatio sacerdotalis , the 2000 declaration Dominus Jesusfrom the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , and “ the problem of homosexuality . ” …
In a 1986 letter written by then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , now Pope Benedict , to the world ’s bishops , he wrote : “ Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin , it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil ; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder . ”
I ’m glad at least that they can look at my disorder objectively .
The LCWR has long been at odds with Vatican over their more open and modern attitudes toward gays and lesbians .
Back in 1999 they expressed sadness over the termination — by the CDF no less — of gay - supportive services provided by the New Ways Ministry in Maryland .
We respectfully acknowledge those congregations ’ longstanding support of their members ’ efforts to educate and challenge society to recognize the human rights and pastoral needs of persons who are lesbian or gay .
Sister Gramick and Father Nugent , in the course of their long ministry , have consistently affirmed the essential dignity of each human being and have worked to change attitudes that , unchecked , have led to derision and physical violence against lesbian and gay people .
We regret the suffering and sense of alienation experienced now by those who have found ministry a reflection of God ’s love for them in the ministry of Sister Gramick and Father Nugent .
We applaud the SSND ( School Sisters of Notre Dame ) decision to establish a fund that will support an individual in pastoral ministry to those who are lesbian and gay as an authentic expression of the congregation ’s charism .
The current Executive Director of LCWR Sister Jane Burke , helped establish that fund .
Later in 2002 LCWR issued a letter to the New Ways Ministry …
In the spirit of lived eucharistic communion , we members of the national board of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious wish to express our gratitude to you and your staff for your compassionate presence in ministry to our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters in the Church .
We recall the words of our bishops in their pastoral letter , “ Always Our Children , ” affirming that all are children of one God .
I applaud LCWR for moving their faith into the 21st century , and hope they and their ideals can survive until a more inclusive and sympathetic Pope becomes head of the Catholic Church .
In response to the investigation LCWR has issued the following statement :
“ At this time , LCWR knows neither the process nor timeline for completion of this assessment .
As more information is made available to LCWR , the conference will take the appropriate steps to prepare for its participation in the assessment .
LCWR faces this process with confidence , believing that the conference has remained faithful to its mission of service to leaders of congregations of women religious as they seek to further the mission of Christ in today ’s world . ”
Prefect William Levada should be wary of what closet doors he chooses to open , as he has a host of skeletions hiding in his own closet .

Following the Columbine High School shootings of April 20 , 1999 , an Illinois carpenter by the name of Greg Zanis constructed a number of crosses and erected them atop the hill in Clement Park across the street from Columbine .
He created one for every victim of the school shooting : Cassie Bernall , Steve Curnow , Corey DePooter , Kelly Fleming , Matt Kechter , Dan Mauser , Daniel Rohrbough , Rachel Scott , Isiah Shoels , John Tomlin , Lauren Townsend , Kyle Velasquez , and Coach Dave Sanders .
And Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold .
The inclusion of the two shooters provoked rage that ultimately ended up with their two crosses being torn down and burned .
But Harris and Klebold were victims just as surely as they were murderers .
As such , they too were deserving of a level of sympathy that , to the best of my knowledge , they never recivied .
These two profoundly disturbed young men gave warning signs to a world that , for a number of reasons , was n’t equipped to detect them or to act upon them .
Harris and Klebold ’s friends missed or ignored the signs .
Their families missed or ignored the signs too .
As did the Columbine staff .
And the police .
Everyone who was in a position to do something to stop the Columbine tragedy before it happened failed to do so , and fifteen people died as a result .
Another two dozen were injured .
39 injured or dead .
But that ’s the complete list of victims of the Columbine tragedy .
All of the families of the injured and dead are victims too .
As were their friends .
As was the entire faculty , staff , and student body of Columbine High School .
As was a significant percentage of the Jefferson County School District , faculty , staff , administration , students , and all their families as well .
As were the two men serving sentences for firearms violations , and their families and friends .
We can count the dead and injured easily enough , but just as with the victims of the 9/11 attacks , the dead and injured represent but a small percentage of the true victims of the Columbine tragedy .
It is perhaps a cold comfort to all the victims that schools are safer today than they have ever been , that the state of Colorado has implemented an anonymous tip line that has supposedly prevented another 27 school shootings , and that the organizational barriers that prevented law enforcement , social services , and schools from sharing information on troubled students have largely been knocked down , at least in Colorado .
After all , their nightmares and pain and loss can never be relieved by actions designed to prevent more school shootings .
Contrary to what was being said around Denver in late April and May of 1999 , we are not all Columbine .
We do not all grieve equally or in the same way or to the same deity ( ies ) .
But Zanis still had the right idea .
He fought desperately to include Harris and Klebold because he understood that they , and their friends and families , were victims , too .
Zanis ultimately failed , and I ’m sure that there are those out there today who cannot bring themselves to consider the Harris and Klebold families with anything but derision and hatred .
I would ask that this week , as we read and listen to all the anniversary stories and reminiscences from that tragic day , all of us try to include all the multitude of victims , not just those most directly affected , in our thoughts .
All the victims .

• Former Germany coach fails to meet club's high expectations • Jupp Heynckes to take charge for remainder of season
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Jürgen Klinsmann has been sacked as manager of Bayern Munich and replaced by Jupp Heynckes for the final five matches of the season .
Klinsmann , who took over the German champions in the summer , has failed to meet the high expectations of the Bavarian club , who won the title last season , and was dismissed after a meeting with club chairman Karl - Heinz Rummenigge , general manager Uli Hoeness and director Karl Hopfner today .
" The board has seen the minimum aim for the season come under threat with the recent results and has therefore decided to take this step , " read a club statement today .
" The board thanks Jurgen Klinsmann and his coaching team for their work and wish them all the best for the future . "
With five to play Bayern are lying in third place in the Bundesliga , just three points behind leaders Wolfsburg , but the recent 5 - 1 humbling at the hands of Barcelona in the Champions League quarter - final was viewed dimly by the club 's hierarchy .
That result , compounded by Saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat at home to Schalke – Bayern 's sixth league reverse – proved sufficient for the club to part company with the 44 - year - old former Germany manager .
Unsurprisingly Klinsmann described himself as " very disappointed " after what proved to be an " eventful time " with the German champions .
This will be Heynckes 's second time at the club where he enjoyed a four - year spell between 1987 and 1991 .
We 've all experienced the feeling of not knowing where we are .
Being disoriented is not pleasant , and it can even be scary , but luckily for most of us , this sensation is temporary .
The brain employs a number of tricks to reorient us , keeping our confusion to a minimum and quickly pointing us in the right direction .
Research has suggested that animals and young children mainly rely on geometric cues ( e.g. lengths , distances , angles ) to help them get reoriented .
Human adults , however , can also make use of feature cues ( e.g. color , texture , landmarks ) in their surrounding area .
But which method do we use more often ?
Psychologists Kristin R. Ratliff from the University of Chicago and Nora S. Newcombe from Temple University conducted a set of experiments investigating if human adults have a preference for using geometric or feature cues to become reoriented .
The first experiment took place in either a large or small white , rectangular room with a landmark ( a big piece of colorful fabric ) hanging on one wall .
The study volunteers saw the researcher place a set of keys in a box in one of the corners .
The volunteers were blindfolded and spun around , to become disoriented .
After removing the blindfold , they had to point to the corner where the keys were .
After a break , the volunteers were told the experiment would be repeated , although they would n't watch the researcher hide the keys .
Unbeknownst to them , during the break the researchers moved the landmark to an adjacent wall — this change forced the volunteers to use either geometric cues or feature cues , but not both , to reorient themselves and locate the keys .
For the second experiment , the researchers used a similar method , except they switched room sizes ( the volunteers moved from a larger room to a smaller room and vice versa ) during the break .
The results , reported in Psychological Science , reveal that the brain does not have a distinct preference for certain cues during reorientation .
In the first experiment , volunteers reoriented themselves by using geometric cues in the smaller room but used feature cues in the larger room .
However , the volunteers who went from the larger room to the smaller room in the second experiment also relied on feature cues , searching for the landmark to become reoriented .
During the second experiment , the researchers surmise , the volunteers had a positive experience using feature cues in the large room , so they kept on relying on the landmark in the smaller room to become reoriented .
These findings indicate that the brain takes into account a number of factors , including the environment and our past experiences , while determining the best way to reorient us to our surroundings .
President Obama received a lesson in international gamesmanship last week , when his secret offer to trade the deployment of a controversial missile defense system in Eastern Europe for Russian assistance in getting Iran to back down from its nuclear program was publicly rebuffed .
The lesson ?
You do n’t get something for nothing , especially when the something you ’re looking for is , itself , nothing .
If the members of the Obama administration would bother to take a stroll down memory lane , they might recall that once upon a time there was a document called the anti-ballistic missile treaty , signed in 1972 between the United States and the former Soviet Union , which recognized that anti-missile defense shields were inherently destabilizing , and as such should not be deployed .
The ABM treaty represented the foundational agreement for a series of strategic arms limitation and arms reduction agreements that followed .
President Obama was 10 years old when that treaty was signed .
He was 40 years old when President George W. Bush withdrew from it , in December 2001 , and set in motion a series of events that saw arms control between the U.S. and Russia completely unravel .
The proposed U.S. missile defense shield , to be deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic , had the Russians talking about scrapping the INF treaty ( which eliminated two classes of nuclear - armed ballistic missiles that threatened Europe ) and deploying highly accurate SS - 21 “ Iskander ” missiles within striking range of the proposed Polish interceptor site .
Russia did not create the missile defense system crisis .
The United States did , and , as such , cannot expect to suddenly receive diplomatic credit when it puts this controversial program on the foreign policy gaming table as if it were a legitimate chip to be bargained away .
Russia has always , correctly , claimed that any missile defense system deployed in Eastern Europe can only be directed at Russia .
While both the Bush and Obama administrations denied that was the case , Poland has all but admitted its concerns are not about missiles coming from Tehran , but rather missiles coming from Moscow .
The American “ sweetener ” for a potential Polish loss of a missile shield is to offer Poland advanced Patriot surface - to - air missiles , whose intended target is clearly not a Persian missile which cannot reach Polish soil , but rather Russian missiles and aircraft which can .
There are three basic facts that the Obama administration needs to address , but as of yet has not :
First , missile defense systems are inherently destabilizing and only contribute to the acquisition of offensive counters designed to defeat those defenses .
Second , the rapid expansion of NATO in the past decade has in fact threatened Russia .
And third , the Iranian missile “ threat ” to Europe has always been illusory .
The proposed U.S. missile defense shield in Eastern Europe has been a highly flawed concept from its very inception .
Although it used unproven technology , it was sold as a means of protecting Europe from a threat that did not exist ( Iranian missiles ) , while creating the conditions for exposing Europe to a real threat that the missile defense shield was incapable of defeating ( Russian missiles ) .
The fact that Obama would put the missile defense shield up for trade as part of a “ Grand Bargain ” with Russia on Iran only underscores how little value the system has to begin with .
It is a big zero , both from a military and diplomacy perspective .
Obama , in making it part of his bargain , was trying to give it value it lacked , and the Russians were n’t buying .
The Iranian situation is far too real , but not in terms of the dangers posed by anything Iran itself is doing .
The United States has not helped matters by hyping the threat posed by nonexistent Iranian missiles targeting Europe and capable of carrying nonexistent nuclear warheads .
Russia has expressed a desire to work with the United States to better control Iran ’s program of uranium enrichment , which Iran and the nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , state has been clearly demonstrated as part of a peaceful nuclear energy program .
For Russia to buy into Obama ’s “ deal , ” it would have to buy into a threat from Iran ’s missile and nuclear programs , a threat Russia does not believe to exist .
Obama would do well to call in his national security team and have it lay out the intelligence information used to assert the Iranian threat .
There must be such a foundational document , since Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm .
Michael Mullen and the president himself all have repeatedly referred to the “ threat ” posed by Iran ’s “ nuclear weapons ” ambitions .
It is important to distinguish between what we know and what we think we know .
For instance , we know that Iran does not have any highly enriched uranium , the kind needed to produce a nuclear weapon .
Just ask Adm. Dennis Blair , the director of national intelligence .
This is what he told the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee this week in testimony on Iran .
And yet many in the U.S. intelligence community continue to state unequivocally that Iran is on the verge of possessing a nuclear weapon .
Obama should take each assertion put forward about Iran ’s nuclear ambition and then reverse - engineer the underlying factual basis for making that assertion .
If he did so , he would quickly find that he and his advisers know less about Iran than they think they do .
The entire U.S. case against Iran is built on supposition and speculation .
If the president disassembled the speculative assertions , he would find them cobbled together from an ideologically motivated methodology designed more to justify a policy of containing and undermining Iran ’s theocracy than understanding its nuclear ambitions .
Obama ought to reacquaint himself with the 1972 ABM treaty and the case of the CIA versus “ Team B . ”
This chapter of America ’s failed arms control policy unfolded from 1975 - 1976 , during the administration of Gerald Ford .
Once upon a time , there was a Soviet Union , and a Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States .
In an effort to prevent the Cold War from becoming a “ hot war , ” the two powers launched arms control initiatives , packaged as part of a larger East - West détente , to better manage the escalation of an arms race derived from Cold War tensions .
It was critical in this effort to have an accurate understanding of not only the physical reality of Soviet strategic weapons programs , but also their intent .
The CIA produced a report that addressed these issues , National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) 11-3/8-74 , “ Soviet Forces for Intercontinental Conflict Through 1985 . ”
The benign picture painted by the CIA ’s estimate of Soviet strategic capability clashed with ideologues in and out of government who were pushing for U.S. defense programs that could not be justified if the CIA ’s estimates were allowed to stand .
Rather than confront the facts of the CIA ’s estimates , these ideologues instead assaulted the methodology used to determine them .
Political pressure was brought to bear on President Ford by conservative opponents of détente to prepare a “ Team B ” of analysts ( outside ideologues ) who would challenge the conclusions put forward in the CIA estimate by “ Team A ” ( the CIA ’s own staff ) .
“ Team B ” did n’t produce better facts ( indeed , every one of its assertions was proved to be wrong ) , but it did produce better fear .
Its claims about Soviet intentions and capabilities , highly inflated and inaccurate , were political dynamite that could not be ignored , especially in the politically charged presidential election year of 1976 .
“ Team B ” won out over “ Team A , ” and the foundation was set for not only the dismantling of U.S. - Soviet détente , but also for the biggest arms race in modern history , culminating in the destruction of the very agreements designed to constrain such an escalation .
Obama should acquaint himself with the story of “ Team B , ” because “ Team B ” exists today , propagating myths about an Iranian “ threat ” that are analogous to those employed by the team that sold the fable of the Soviet “ threat . ”
The new president was critical of the Iraq war , and the sad tale of misinformation and deception that has since been repackaged as an “ intelligence failure . ”
There was no “ failure ” because there was no “ intelligence . ”
“ Team B ” does n’t produce intelligence , but rather ideological assertions used as justification for policy .
The same “ Team B ” - based methodologies which gave us the Iraq assertions about WMD programs are in play today in the Iran “ intelligence ” used by President Obama and his national security team .
Obama might be surprised that one of the programs being sold by “ Team B ” in its assault on truth was a missile defense shield to counter the team ’s perception of a Soviet missile threat .
The falsehoods and fabrications sold by “ Team B ” back in the 1970s set America on the path toward the withdrawal from the ABM treaty in 2001 , and the proposed deployment of the very missile defense shield Obama is trying to bargain away to get Russia to help confront an Iranian “ threat ” manufactured by none other than “ Team B . ”
Secretary of State Clinton impressed many when she spoke of the need for America to embrace “ smart power . ”
The implication of her words was that the United States , under President Obama , would use all the tools available , especially diplomacy , in seeking to solve the myriad problems it faces around the world in the post - Bush era , including the problem of Iran .
But one cannot begin to solve a problem unless one first accurately defines the problem , for without that definition the “ solution ” would in fact solve nothing .
Any solution to the problem of Iran must be derived from an accurate intelligence picture of what is transpiring inside the country today , one drawn more from fact than ideologically based fiction .
Obama is advised to challenge the totality of the current U.S. intelligence used to define Iran as a threat , and purge once and for all the corrupting ideological “ Team B ” holdovers who still reside within the structure of the American intelligence community .
Intelligence is never about hearing what you want to hear , but rather about learning what you need to know .
Obama needs to learn the truth about Iran , and about the proposed missile defense system in Europe .
This truth would be inconvenient , but it would also liberate him to develop meaningful solutions to serious problems in a manner that avoids a repeat of his embarrassing “ Grand Bargain ” gambit with Russia , trying to trade nothing for nothing in an effort to certify something for nothing .
There are a lot of “ zero sums ” in that equation , which pretty much sums up Obama ’s Iran and Russia policies to date .
Over the last two decades , colleges and universities doubled their full - time support staff while enrollment increased only 40 percent , according to a new analysis of government data by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity , a nonprofit research center .
During the same period , the staff of full - time instructors , or equivalent personnel , rose about 50 percent , while the number of managers increased slightly more than 50 percent .
The data , based on United States Department of Education filings from more than 2,782 colleges , come from 1987 to 2007 , before the current recession prompted many colleges to freeze their hiring .
Neither the report nor outside experts on college affordability went so far as to argue that the increase in support staff was directly responsible for spiraling tuition .
Most experts say that the largest driver of tuition increases has been the decline in state financing for higher education .
Pennsylvanians for Responsible Sex Education ( PARSE ) , a coalition of different organizations , including the ACLU of PA , sponsored a lobby day in Harrisburg yesterday in support of two new bills .
The day was a great success as over 100 constituents from all over the state came and met with their legislators to advocate for the bills .
The Healthy Youth Act and the Notice Home Act , are geared towards bettering sex education policy in Pennsylvania .
The Healthy Youth Act , which is sponsored by Representative Chelsa Wagner , would require the teaching comprehensive sex education in all public and public charter schools in Pennsylvania .
This version of sex education would still include and stress abstinence as the only one hundred percent way to avoid pregnancy or STI contraction , however , it would also provide scientifically accurate , age - appropriate information on forms of contraceptives .
The Notice Home
Act would require a notice to be sent home to parents in the event that their school teaches or is having an outside instructor come in to teach an abstinence - only program , giving them the opportunity to opt their child out of the instruction .
This seems especially important to anyone who has seen the antics of many of these “ abstinence educators ” like Derek the Clown .
This bill is sponsored by former teacher , Representative Ed Pashinski .
A rally was held in the rotunda of the capitol building in Harrisburg , featuring several speakers including Jordyn Bowen , a Union City High School student who is for comprehensive sex education .
Fun was had and some positive change was hopefully made !
Thanks to all of those involved !
Check out a video that was taken of the event as well as a radio interview of another student .

Since it was founded by his great - grandfather in 1880 , Carl Martin Welcker ’s company in Cologne , Germany , has mirrored the fortunes of manufacturing , not just in Europe but around the world .
That is still true today .
In a pattern familiar to industrial businesses in Europe , Asia and the United States , Mr. Welcker says his company , Schütte , which makes the machines that churn out 80 percent of the world ’s spark plugs , is facing “ a tragedy . ”
Orders are down 50 percent from a year ago , and Mr. Welcker is cutting costs and contemplating layoffs to prevent Schütte from falling into the red .
That manufacturing is in decline is hardly surprising , but the depth and speed of the plunge are striking and , most worrisome for economists , a self - reinforcing trend not unlike the cascading bust that led to the Great Depression .
Good read in the New York Times where you can put some faces to names , studio execs , agents , and producers all having to face Hwood as it reformulates itself :
After riding two decades of almost nonstop growth from the cable and video revolutions , a new generation of Hollywood power players is finally being forced to test its mettle .
These executives — consummate insiders who enlisted when young and worked their way up — now find themselves pushing 50 just as some brutal problems are pushing back : a collapse in DVD sales , a credit crisis that has curtailed financing for new movies , a group of corporate owners determined to pull more profits from studios to compensate for hard - hit publishing and broadcast television divisions .
From a screenwriter ’s perspective , three things to buoy hopes : ( 1 ) Movies and TV are still a growth industry ( although the delivery systems will continue to change ) ; ( 2 ) Movie studios have distribution networks that require the regular delivery of product ( i.e. , movies ) ; ( 3 ) In times of economic upheaval , business leaders generally rely on the most basic truths — and about the oldest and most trustworthy bit of CW is “ Great stories make great movies . ”
So again , it all comes back to the script .
The people who did speak acknowledged that many outside the glamour industry have it much worse .
Hollywood is manufacturing one of the only products consumers are still lining up to buy , evidenced by a surge in box office revenue since December .
That uptick is not nearly enough to offset the decline in DVD sales , but other businesses — online streaming , mobile , video - on - demand — are expanding and could pick up the slack .
“ I look at it as growing pains , ” said Donald De Line , 50 , a Disney and Paramount executive who is one of the industry ’s leading producers .
“ We ’re going to figure it out , and the revenue streams will get healthy again .
That ’s the history of Hollywood . ”
And hopefully the future .

Webcam stripping is proving lucrative for some Swedish women Sweden 's tax authorities are seeking the bare facts about webcam strippers ' income , estimating that hundreds of Swedish women are dodging the law .
The search involves tax officials examining websites that feature Swedish strippers , in an effort to identify them and chase them for tax returns .
The tax loss is estimated at about 40 m Swedish kronor ( £ 3.3 m ) annually .
Project leader Dag Hardyson said 200 Swedish strippers had been investigated so far .
He said the total could be 500 .
" They are young girls , we can see from the photos .
We think that perhaps they are not well informed about the rules , " said Mr Hardyson , head of the tax authority 's national project on internet trade .
The investigation into strippers is part of a wider tax project that includes online poker and fake trader locations .
Detective work Mr Hardyson told BBC
News that the strippers could be liable to pay about half of their earnings in tax .
Striptease via webcam is quite legal in Sweden , unlike prostitution , he added .
" I do n't think they have any costs really - almost 100 % of what they earn is pocketed .
Many have regular work and this is extra income .
We want them to register their activity as a business - it 's still taxable , even if it's a hobby , " he said .
He stressed the difficulty of identifying strippers , saying the contact information on the websites was often " not obvious " .
" We have to visit the companies behind the websites to get the information , then we have to work with the electronic wallets where the money is going in . "
He said the Swedish tax authorities had been tipped off about Swedish internet strippers by the Dutch authorities , who had started a similar investigation earlier .
Web search tools like spiders had failed to detect the Swedish strippers .
" When we investigated the sites manually it worked better , " he added .

Burnt Orange Report has the statement from Texas State Rep. Jimmie Dunham blasting Texas Governor Rick Perry ’s crazy talk about secession :
Talk of secession is an attack on our country .
It is the ultimate anti-American statement .
Serious discussion that we would even contemplate dividing our country , the greatest country in the world , shows lack of judgment — and any words from the Texas Governor will be taken seriously .
Finally , such statements — particularly in a time when we are at war overseas , with over 4,000 American lives lost , and thousands in combat as we speak — are both offensive , irresponsible and not the words of a patriot .
I am surprised that Governor Perry would reinforce a sentiment that is so clearly anti-American .
He should choose his words more carefully unless they are intentional , and if his words were intentional , they should be condemned .
Perry is anti-American and if his words are intentional , he should be arrested .
But , Perry has supporters including one of the Republicans who led us into the economic quagmire , Tom DeLay , who thinks secession is a valid option .
Even Chris Matthews said this is “ nut talk . ”
DeLay , on the other hand , thinks Governor Perry is “ standing up for the sovereignty of Texas . ”
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glWhVBn21Vw]
Tom DeLay should be in jail for all of the corrupt dealings that drove him out of Congress .
If he keeps up the secessionist talk , charge him with seditious conspiracy or insurrection .
[ UPDATE :
There are federal law governing both : ” Rebellion or insurrection ” ( 18 USC § 2383 ) and “ seditious conspiracy ” ( 18 USC § 2384 ) . ]
If the situation were reveresed , if a Democrat was threatening secession , you know the GOP would be hold hearings and drawing up indictments .
ALBANY  Gov. David A. Paterson , after a confusing and even embarrassing two - month ordeal , said Thursday that he would announce a replacement to fill Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s Senate seat at noon on Friday .
Mr. Paterson made the announcement after a day of anonymous and often bitter sniping over Caroline Kennedy ’s mystifying departure from the Senate field , which , after several twists and turns , was announced shortly after midnight on Thursday .
Because the governor has often contradicted his own comments about the Senate pick in the course of a single day , no one in the capital appeared ready to say for certain who the new senator would be .
But among lawmakers , Democratic operatives and even some of the governor ’s advisers , the name most frequently mentioned as the likely pick was Representative Kirsten E. Gillibrand , though other candidates , including Randi Weingarten , the president of the American Federation of Teachers , were not ruled out .
But if Mr. Paterson is hoping to quiet the tumult by picking Ms. Gillibrand , there are already indications he may not get his wish .
Ms. Gillibrand , a centrist Democrat from upstate who has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association , is controversial among some of the party ’s more liberal leaders downstate .
Artist Shepard Fairey cut his teeth on the mean streets of Los Angeles , so he 's definitely not going to let some pipsqueak organization called the Associated Press push him around .
This week , Fairey responded to a lawsuit filed by the AP in which the news organization claims that the artist broke copyright laws when he used its photograph of Barack Obama for his " Hope " poster .
Fairey 's lawyers said in papers filed at a New York court Wednesday that the artist 's use of the photograph is protected by the First Amendment as well as by fair - use laws .
But the real attention - grabber was Fairey 's assertion that the AP itself violated copyright laws when it used a photo of the artist 's " Hope " poster without getting permission .
In other words , he 's arguing that the AP can't reproduce an image by Fairey that the artist himself appropriated from the AP .
Did we just fall into a rabbit hole ?
Here 's what Fairey 's lawyers wrote :
" On January 7 , 2009 The AP distributed a story entitled ' Iconic Obama portrait headed to Smithsonian museum ' by Brett Zongker .
The AP 's article included a photograph attributed to The AP , which depicted Fairey 's Obama Hope Stencil Collage that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution ....
The AP did not obtain a license to use Fairey 's work in this photograph .
As shown below , the photograph attributed to The AP consists of nothing more than a literal reproduction of Fairey 's work . "
They also accuse the AP of similarly infringing the copyright on works by Jeff Koons , Banksy Keith Haring and George Segal .
We at Culture Monster know that L.A. art - hipsters can be a pretty sarcastic and smart - alecky group of people .
( Call it a permanent state of ironic detachment . )
Whether Fairey is merely thumbing his nose at the venerated news institution or if these new claims have real merit -- or both ! -- remains to be seen .
However you look at it , this saga is long from over .
Check back often , folks .

The Bank of England is prepared to cut interest rates below 1 % and use " unconventional measures " to dig the economy out of the " deep recession " that it failed to spot six months ago , the governor of the Bank of England said today .
Mervyn King said Threadneedle Street would use the " full range of instruments at its disposal " to counter the impact of the credit crunch and a collapse in confidence .
After predicting in August that the economy would be broadly flat over the coming year , the Bank said yesterday output would be slumping at an annual rate of 4 % this year .
King said the Bank 's nine - strong monetary policy committee had not erred by leaving interest rates at 5 % last spring and summer before slashing them repeatedly since October ; the shock to the global economy last autumn had been unexpected and could not have been predicted , the governor said .
Unveiling the Bank 's quarterly inflation report , King said : " The UK is in a deep recession .
Monetary fiscal and financial policy have all responded vigorously to that prospect . "
The governor added that the UK was caught up in a synchronised global downturn .
" Restoring both lending and confidence will not be easy and will take time , " he warned .
Despite the aggressive downgrading of the MPC 's growth forecasts in recent months , King said there was a risk that the recession could be even worse than currently envisaged .
" The MPC judges that the balance of risks to the path for GDP is very much to the downside , reflecting in large part uncertainty about when lending and confidence will recover . "
Inflation is forecast to be 0.5 % in two years ' time , assuming interest rates are kept at their current 1 % .
The Bank believes that the deflationary forces hitting the economy will require " further easing in monetary policy " to bring inflation back up to the government 's 2 % target .
" That is likely to include actions aimed at increasing the supply of money in order to stimulate nominal demand . "
King explained that the Bank stood ready to pursue " quantitative easing " – a policy that involves an expansion of the money supply through the purchase of gilts .
The Treasury has already given outline approval for the emergency measures , which are designed to boost growth once the interest - rate avenue has been exhausted .
King said that Threadneedle Street could introduce quantitative easing at any time .
" Bank rate does n't have to go to zero , because we 're getting to the point where it does n't make a great deal of difference where it is . "
The governor added : " We now will be moving to is a world in which we would be buying a range of assets , certainly including gilts , to ensure that the supply of money will grow at an adequate rate to keep inflation at the target so that normal economic growth can resume . "
Asked about the Bank 's approach to the crisis , the governor admitted : " I 'm not pretending that everything worked well .
It clearly did n't " .
He added , however , that the Bank needed new policy instruments if it was to target both inflation and the boom in asset prices that led to the financial crisis of the past 18 months .
As for savers , King said that he had " immense sympathy " for them because they are " clearly the one group who did not cause any of the problems we are facing " .
However , he said that , in the short run , " if we did not take measures to stimulate the economy then the savers would find they would be actually worse off – there would be even higher unemployment and even more of a downturn in the economy " .
Colin Ellis , European economist at Daiwa Securities , said the Bank was expecting growth to bounce back in 2010 and be at 3 % a year by the end of the year .
" The marked rebound in growth that the MPC is expecting raises fears that it is still too relaxed about the recession , " he warned .
" Perhaps that is not surprising , given King 's aversion to admitting past policy mistakes – indeed , when pressed on these at the press conference , King lost his cool , responding more aggressively than usual to questions about past policy errors .
Unfortunately … big errors were made . "
Ratings Results for the Week of March 8th – Heroes Continues to Sink
By John J. Joex
As we mentioned previously , NBC ’s entertainment president has announced that Heroes will return for a fourth season , so I am dropping the Cancellation Alert back down to Low .
Still , the show sunk in the ratings yet again dropping to only 6.6 million total viewers .
I realize that NBC wants to stick with this one because , despite its struggles , it is one of the struggling networks highest performing series in the 18 - 49 and 19 - 34 demographics .
However , if the downward trend continues , do n’t be too surprised if they do a turnaround on their stance .
The entire Monday night lineup saw a drop this last week , so all of those shows are on unsure footing .
Still , I say that if Heroes comes back , Chuck will come with it .
Medium , on the other hand , could get left out in the cold .
Why are n’t people watching Reaper ?
It ’s one of the funniest shows on television and provides a nice contrast to some of the darker and / or more intense fare on Prime Time .
Still , it did nothing to improve on the ratings of its premiere and actually dipped just a bit .
The TV by Numbers guys says this has to do with Daylight Savings Time and that all shows in the 8 PM EST timeslot suffer in the week after the time change .
They also think that if the show holds its current numbers that it stands a good chance of getting renewed .
Still , I ’d like to see the viewer tally head northward just to feel safe .
Did I miss a memo or something , what was with the Lost repeat ?
I thought that one was supposed to run straight through without breaks .
ABC apparently just decided to ceded the night to American Idol running Scrubs repeats in the 8 PM hour prior to the Lost retread .
Bad news for Life on Mars as its already poor numbers plummeted without a new episode of its lead - in to give it some sort of boost .
I ’m guessing it will go back up next week when new episodes of Lost resume , or perhaps its few followers have just given up ( this past week ’s episode was pretty bad ) .
Dollhouse stayed flat in the 18 - 48 demographic this week and actually gained a bit in total viewers from last week .
However , I think it ’s time to raise the Cancellation Alert on this one to “ Medium ” .
I just do n’t think it has done enough yet to convince FOX to bring it back for a second season .
It does continue to score well with DVR viewing and iTunes downloads , but I ’m not sure that adds enough to the show ’s defense .
The numbers for The Sarah Connor Chronicles dwindled to almost nothing this week , assuring that show ’s fate .
Smallville and Supernatural returned with new episodes after a month a repeats .
Their numbers were down a bit from where they were , but they will continue to edge up in the coming weeks .

Audi is establishing quite a promising legacy at the 12 Hours of Sebring .
The last three Audi prototypes – the R8 ( 2000 ) , R10 TDI ( 2006 ) and R15 TDI ( 2009 ) – have all won their racing debuts in the American Le Mans P1 class .
The # 2 car , driven by Dindo Capello , Tom Kristensen and Allan McNish completed 383 laps , beating the old distance record by 13 laps in the fastest Sebring race ever .
Despite being prototypes , the Audi R15 TDI cars ran into no technical problems during the race , thanks to a mad scramble prior to start by the crew in preparation for temperatures that were twice as high as they had previously tested and on a track that was especially bumpy .
The Audi R15 TDI driven by Allan McNish got off to a fast start , quickly moving past the pole Acura / Honda car and establishing a 5 second advantage after the first lap .
However , the majority of the race was spent battling two Peugeot 908s .
There were twelve lead changes between these two diesel - powered prototypes .
However , the # 2 R15 was able to pull off the ninth overall victory for Audi at Sebring with a 22.279 second lead over Peugeot .
In addition to winning the race , Audi also won the Michellin Green X Challenge with its pair of R15s .
The competition pits fuel consumption vs performance .

Rather than relying on warm , fuzzy feelings to protect animals , conservationists suggest appealing to something more reliable : greed .
By selling financial contracts pegged to species health , the government could create a market in the future of threatened animals , making their preservation literally valuable to investors .
" The incentive to conserve would increase as the likelihood of species survival decreases , " said Cornell University biologist James Mandel .
" If a species declines , investors have a bunch of paper that 's now worthless . "
Mandel and the co-authors of the proposal , published in Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment , are not the first to put a price on nature .
The U.S. government already pays developers to preserve habitat for some endangered animals , such as the red-cockaded woodpecker .
Those simple programs , however , do n't make full use of market powers , and are used only for endangered species .
There 's little reason for developers — say , Wyoming farmers with pronghorn antelope on their land , or oil companies prospecting on polar bear habitat in Alaska — to protect species that are merely in trouble .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife services lists 163 animal species as threatened .
As habitat shrinks and human development expands , many of them will become officially endangered .
With that categorization comes expensive recovery programs , costly lawsuits and halted projects .
In this atmosphere , developers often hide evidence of endangered animals on their land — " shoot , shovel and shut up , " as the saying goes — instead of saving them .
Rather than waiting for situations to go critical , say Mandel 's team , conservationists could immediately use the money they 'd eventually spend to make animal protection profitable and more effective .
" There 's not much the government can do until a species is listed , and then they spend intense amounts of money , as they should .
A species essentially goes from worthless to worth a lot , " said Mandel .
" We 're looking for some way to ease the transition , to put a price on a species before it becomes listed , and prevent the need for last - minute recovery . "
" Acting late is always more costly than acting early , " said Josh Donlan , another study co-author and director of Advanced Conservation Strategies .
Under their plan , the government would determine the cost of protecting a species if it becomes endangered .
That money would be set aside to fund contracts with payouts pegged to species health .
The contracts would be sold to landowners and developers whose actions directly affect the animals , though the contracts could be freely re-sold .
Should animal numbers fall beneath a predetermined threshold , contracts would be voided , and money devoted to anticipated recovery programs .
If the species thrives , investors would be rewarded , with profits growing in direct proportion to species health .
" If there 's a 99 percent chance that a species is going to survive , " said
Mandel , " you could trade that like a high - ranking bond .
You know it 's going to pay out . "
Many details would need to be worked out on a case - by - case basis .
If priced too low , the contracts would represent an easy payoff for environmental destruction .
And both the government and investors would need to be sure that , come animal - counting time , nobody cooked the scientific books .
But the basic premise , said Ray Victurine , director of the conservation finance program at the Wildlife Conservation Society , " makes a whole lot of sense . "
Now it needs to be tested in the real world .
" If you put all the pieces together , it has the potential to work , "
said Victurine , who was not involved in the study .
" But it 's going to work in very specific circumstances that have to be identified . "
Victurine said the idea was well - received at a conference of the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature , the world 's oldest environmental group , but that the audience did n't quite grasp the details .
Their difficulty may stem from the tricky finances involved .
After all , the contracts are better - known by another confusion - engendering name : derivatives .
But unlike mortgage and credit derivatives that have crippled
America 's economy , said Mandel , these derivatives would n't be sold and re-sold until their risks were hidden .
Instead they take risk currently assumed by the government , who foot endangered species bills , and place it with people who actually control species fate .
" We want to take the risk out of the bureaucracy in Washington , and price it into everyday decisions for stakeholders , " said Mandel .

I ’ve been highly critical of the government bailout of AIG .
But the new spectacle of the company paying $ 100 million in bonuses to executives , even over Secretary Geithner ’s objections is an example of what ’s wrong with it .
First , lest there be any confusion , we ’re not talking about bonuses for executives at the conventional insurance providing divisions of AIG .
We ’re talking about $ 100 million in bonuses for executives at the company ’s Financial Products division , the shop in London that wrote almost half a trillion dollars of credit default swaps ( in effect , unfunded de facto insurance policies on wildly overvalued assets ) — the ones that caused the company ’s death spiral and put taxpayers on the line for what will likely eventually be a quarter trillion dollar price tag .
So Secretary Geithner told AIG CEO Edward Liddy that the these bonuses would not fly .
Liddy said : sorry .
We ’re contractually obligated to pay these bonuses .
And if we do n’t we could open ourselves to legal liability .
We could get sued .
Now , as a narrow legal matter , I do n’t doubt there is a contractual obligation .
But bankruptcy disrupts contractual obligations .
I ’m actually not sure where employees with contractual bonuses come in line in a bankruptcy proceeding .
But I bet it ’s really far toward the end of the line .
And in business terms AIG was bankrupt .
Not just bankrupt but driven to bankruptcy entirely by the division that these execs work at .
It is only because — rightly or wrongly — the government believes that allowing AIG to founder would threaten the entire economy that we have agreed to let the taxpayer take the hit for all these reckless actions .
So on the business merits , they ’re bankrupt .
But we decide it ’s in the national interest to prevent formal bankruptcy .
And these sharks — not everyone at AIG , but the execs that created this mess — use that as a lever to get paid the money they never would have seen if we ’d let ( market ) nature take its course .
The 2008 economic troubles seem to be blamed on the subprime mortgage market .
The subprime mortgage industry began to feel the effects of a looming crisis , and it spread across different areas of the economy .
To understand the financial lessons from the economic slowdown , you need to understand why it happened .
How the Mortgage Market Works
A subprime mortgage is a mortgage lent to someone who would not normally qualify .
This could be due to income , poor credit history or both .
As a safeguard , these loans usually have a higher interest rate .
Many of these loans were made as adjustable rate mortgages , which means that the rates would adjust up over time and increase the monthly payments .
The subprime mortgage loans have a greater risk of default and so banks usually limit the percentage that they have on the books .
However with the dropping interest rates of the last few years many more people who would n’t normally qualify for a mortgage took advantage of the lower interest rates and got mortgages .
Many of these people stretched themselves to the limit , assuming that they would be able to refinance when their interest rates adjusted up .
The housing boom ended and many did not build as much equity as they were hoping and did not qualify to refinance their mortgages .
They found they could no longer make payments and began defaulting on the loans .
Secondary Mortgage Market
The secondary mortgage market is the market where banks sell mortgages to other banks .
They will package groups of mortgages together , and sell the groups to other banks .
In theory , this spreads the risk between multiple banks and protects everyone if the housing market were to burst in one area .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are key in helping the secondary mortgage market to function .
They purchase the loans from the original banks , so that the banks will have liquidity to make new loans and then sell them to other banks , often investment banks .
The secondary mortgage market experienced trouble when investment firms , other countries , and banks stopped wanting to buy these mortgages .
They feared that they were no longer valuable because of the recent foreclosures and defaults on all the subprime mortgages .
Bailout
The United States government offered a bailout and agreed to back most of the loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held on September 6 , 2008 .
Interest rates on mortgages dropped ; the market seemed to rally a bit around the fact that these loans were guaranteed .
Thus , the government agreed to cover up to $ 200 billion in loans so that the market could remain liquid .
The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailout was not enough to save the two biggest investment firms in the United States .
Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy the following week , and Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America .
This caused a crisis on Wall Street and resulted in plummeting stock market prices in the United States and around the world .
Consumer confidence was shaken as AIG faced a crisis as well .
AIG got into trouble by offering insurance products that guaranteed the loan amounts to investors when the loans went into default .
With the recent increase of default , the company found that they no longer had enough to cover all of the defaults .
The United States government again stepped in and backed up AIG so that it would not go under as well .
A Recovering Market and What You Should Do
It has taken many years for the housing market to recover .
Many people ended up losing their homes , and the banks began to be much more cautious about lending money to people .
The prices of homes fell , but are beginning to see an increase in value again .
However , banks are much more cautious about lending money to people .
The bailouts and the use of golden parachutes for the executives that led their companies into needing bailouts led to the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 .
The movement focused on the inequality between the world 's wealthiest and the other 99 % of the world 's population .
many people who graduated during the economic crisis had a difficult time finding jobs .
The bailouts may have saved a few companies but did not seem to have the hoped - for effect on the economy as it continued to struggle for several more years .
You should also take a look at your debt load .
It is a good idea to reduce the amount of debt that you have .
Many people are looking at all types of credit and feel that the crisis might spread to the credit card market as well .
You can protect yourself by living within your means and focusing on getting out of debt .
Your savings and investing strategy should remain the same .
You should continue to save and invest your money .
The FDIC should be able to handle any other bank collapses .
The stock market will recover eventually and your money will continue to grow .
Remember to spread your investments so that you do not have them all in one company .
An easy way to do this is to invest in Mutual Funds .
You may also need to build up your emergency fund because it can become more difficult to find a job during a recession .
Usually , a recession leads to layoffs , which in turn leads to a bigger recession , which then leads to more layoffs .
It is a vicious cycle .
It can lead to a period of deflation , which is even more difficult to recover from .
Do what you can to prepare yourself to remain competitive in the job market .
It is important to be prepared to handle an economic crisis .
Good basic money management with a budget that allows you to get out of debt and build your savings can help you handle an economic crisis much better .
Take the steps during good economic times to prepare for the bad ones .
Reporting from Zihuatanejo , Mexico , and Mexico City --
It was a brazen assault , not just because it targeted the city ’s police station , but for the choice of weapon : grenades .
The Feb. 21 attack on police headquarters in coastal Zihuatanejo , which injured four people , fit a disturbing trend of Mexico ’s drug wars .
Traffickers have escalated their arms race , acquiring military - grade weapons , including hand grenades , grenade launchers , armor - piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals .
Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea , eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto - matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas , New Mexico , Arizona and California .
The proliferation of heavier armaments points to a menacing new stage in the Mexican government ’s 2 - year - old war against drug organizations , which are evolving into a more militarized force prepared to take on Mexican army troops , deployed by the thousands , as well as to attack each other .
These groups appear to be taking advantage of a robust global black market and porous borders , especially between Mexico and Guatemala .
Some of the weapons are left over from the wars that the United States helped fight in Central America , U.S. officials said .
“ There is an arms race between the cartels , ” said Alberto Islas , a security consultant who advises the Mexican government .
“ One group gets rocket - propelled grenades , the other has to have them . ”
There are even more ominous developments : Authorities reported three thefts of several hundred pounds of blasting material from industrial explosives plants in Durango during a four - day period last month .
Authorities believe the material may have been destined for car bombs or remotely detonated roadside devices , which have been used with devastating effect in Iraq , killing more than 1,822 members of U.S. - led forces since the war there began nearly six years ago .
The Mexican army has recovered most of the material , and there has been no reported use of such devices .
Grenades or military - grade weapons have been reported in at least 10 Mexican states during the last six months , used against police headquarters , city halls , a U.S. consulate , TV stations and senior Mexican officials .
In a three - week period ended March 6 , five grenade attacks were launched on police patrols and stations and the home of a commander in the south - central state of Michoacan .
Other such attacks occurred in five other states during the same period .
At least one grenade attack north of the border , at a Texas nightclub frequented by U.S. police officers , has been tied to Mexican traffickers .
How many weapons have been smuggled into Mexico from Central America is not known , and the military - grade munitions are still a small fraction of the larger arsenal in the hands of narcotics traffickers .
Mexican officials continue to push Washington to stem the well - documented flow of conventional weapons from the United States , as Congress holds hearings on the role those smuggled guns play in arming Mexican drug cartels .
There is no comprehensive data on how many people have been killed by heavier weapons .
But four days after the assault on the Zihuatanejo police station , four of the city ’s officers were slain in a highway ambush six miles from town on the road to Acapulco .
In addition to the standard AK - 47 and AR - 15 assault rifles , the attackers fired at least six .50 - caliber shells into the officers ’ pickup .
The vehicle blew up when hit by what experts believe was a grenade or explosive projectile .
The bodies of the officers were charred .
“ These are really weapons of war , ” said Alberto Fernandez , spokesman for the Zihuatanejo city government .
“ We only know these devices from war movies . ”
U.S. law enforcement officials say they detected the smuggling of grenades and other military - grade equipment into Mexico about a year and a half ago , and observed a sharp uptick in the use of the weapons about six months ago .
The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years , in contrast to 59 seized over the previous two years .
The enhanced weaponry represents a wide sampling from the international arms bazaar , with grenades and launchers produced by U.S. , South Korean , Israeli , Spanish or former Soviet bloc manufacturers .
Many had been sold legally to governments , including Mexico’s , and then were diverted onto the black market .
Some may be sold directly to the traffickers by corrupt elements of national armies , authorities and experts say .
The single deadliest attack on civilians by drug traffickers in Mexico took place Sept. 15 at an Independence Day celebration in the central plaza of Morelia , hometown of President Felipe Calderon and capital of Michoacan .
Attackers hurled fragmentation grenades at the celebrating crowd , killing eight people and wounding dozens more .
Amid the recent spate of attacks in Michoacan , federal police on Feb. 20 announced the discovery of 66 fragmentation grenades in the fake bottom of a truck intercepted in southern Mexico , just over the border from Guatemala .
The two men arrested with the cargo told police they were transporting the grenades to Morelia .
Grenades used in three attacks in Monterrey and Texas were linked to a single Monterrey warehouse , packed with explosives and high - caliber guns , reportedly belonging to the Gulf cartel .
Mexican authorities raided the warehouse in October and seized the cache , which contained South Korean - manufactured grenades similar to the American M67 fragmentation grenade .
Grenades from the same lot were used in a Jan. 6 attack on the Televisa television station in Monterrey , which caused damage but no injuries , and during an Oct. 12 attack against the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey .
The device at the consulate did not detonate .
Late on the night of Jan. 31 , a Saturday , a man tossed a grenade into the El Booty Lounge in Pharr , Texas .
Three off - duty Texas police officers were there , though authorities would not say whether they were the target .
The explosive , which did not detonate , was traced to the Monterrey warehouse .
Traffickers using M203 40 - millimeter grenade launchers last year attacked and killed eight Mexican federal police officers in Culiacan , the capital of Sinaloa state .
In the northern border city of Nogales , the Sonora state police commander was killed Nov. 2 in an ambush by purported traffickers firing AK - 47s and lobbing grenades .
He had been returning from a meeting with U.S. authorities in Arizona to discuss gun smuggling .
In the western state of Durango , three people , including a 3 - year - old child , were killed in a grenade attack in January .
The firepower has gone beyond grenades .
Armed with light antitank weapons , would - be assassins went after the nation ’s top counternarcotics prosecutor in December 2007 .
The assailants were intercepted before they reached Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos , who was not hurt .
The weapons seized were linked to the notorious Sinaloa cartel .
“ They were betting on being able to escalate with a spectacular strike precisely to terrify society , ” Santiago Vasconcelos said at the time .
( He was killed in November in a plane crash . )
Beyond the weaponry , drug gangs for several years have demonstrated the ability to form squads and employ military tactics , including the use of assault rifles , hand grenades , grenade launchers and fully automatic weapons to pin down army forces .
This has enabled them to attack army patrols frontally , as they did with lethal results Feb. 7 in the central state of Zacatecas , killing one sergeant and critically wounding a colonel .
“ At this stage , the drug cartels are using basic infantry weaponry to counter government forces , ” a U.S. government official in Mexico said .
“ Encountering criminals with this kind of weaponry is a horse of a different color , ” the official said .
“ It ’s not your typical patrol stop , where someone pulls a gun .
This has all the makings of an infantry squad , or guerrilla fighting . ”
The fear of guerrilla warfare was compounded in February when 270 pounds of dynamite and several hundred electric detonators were stolen from a U.S. firm in the state of Durango .
On Valentine ’s Day , about 20 masked gunmen , led by a heavyset man wearing gold rings and chains , stormed the warehouse of a subsidiary of Austin Powder Co. , an industrial explosives manufacturer , according to official accounts .
They overpowered guards and emptied the warehouse .
Two similar thefts were reported within four days in the same area .
Although the Mexican army recovered most of the dynamite , the incident augurs an even bloodier trend , officials said .
“ There is only one reason to have bulk explosives , ” said Thomas G. Mangan , spokesman in Phoenix for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
“ An improvised explosive device .
A car bomb . ”
In addition to grenades , high - powered guns such as the .50 - caliber Barrett sniper rifle have become a weapon of choice in narcotics traffickers ’ arsenals , Mangan said .
Unlike grenades and antitank weapons , the .50 - caliber guns can be obtained by ordinary citizens in the U.S. and smuggled easily into Mexico , like the tons of assault rifles and automatic pistols .
Mexican law enforcement , such as the police in Zihuatanejo , is grossly outgunned .
Officers have protested , seeking better protective gear , weaponry and pay .
Shortly after the Zihuatanejo attacks , police officers staged a brief work stoppage outside their headquarters , where scars from the grenade attack were still visible .
One of the blasts left a cereal bowl - shaped divot in the stone pavement and pockmarks on the front of the police building .
It went off 100 feet from the nearest street , prompting some officers to suspect that the assailants employed a grenade launcher .
Police have piled sandbags 4 feet high around the compound and security is tight .
Commanders have bought 10 bulletproof vests , but say they need at least 280 to equip the city ’s 343 officers .
The police commander , Pablo Rodriguez , said his officers are terrified .
They are armed with semiautomatic .223 - caliber rifles made in Italy , Germany and Mexico .
The rifles , with folding stocks , are snazzy , but they are no match for the weapons being stockpiled by the drug cartels .
“ They are good weapons , but to counteract the types of weapons they ’re using against us , they ’re not equal , ” Rodriguez said .
His officers know they do n’t stand a chance .
Not five days after the highway attack that blew up the police truck , Rodriguez had jobs to fill .
Twenty - two of his cops had abruptly quit .

NEW YORK —
A task force charged with assessing technologies for protecting children from unwanted contact online has concluded that no single approach is foolproof and that parental oversight is vital .
The Harvard - led panel , in a report obtained by The Associated Press and scheduled for release today , dismissed prospects for age - verification technologies , the approach favored by many law enforcement officials who had pushed for the creation of the task force .
The yearlong Internet Safety Technical Task Force also played down fears of Internet sexual predators who target children on social - networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace .
While citing other dangers such as online bullying , the panel said cases of predators typically involved youths well aware they were meeting an adult for sexual activities .
Technology can be a component in the strategy to protect minors online , but Internet companies “ should not overly rely upon any single technology or group of technologies as the primary solution , ” the task force said .
“ Parents , teachers , mentors , social services , law enforcement and minors themselves all have crucial roles to play in ensuring online safety for all minors , ” the report said .
The findings come as little surprise as law enforcement , Internet companies , child - safety advocates and policymakers seek to address fears of Internet sexual predators .
Rather , the report serves to synthesize what many researchers and child - safety advocates have been saying .
The report also identifies areas in which more studies are needed — on what sex offenders do at social - networking sites , and how minors are approached sexually by other minors .
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal , one of the leading forces behind the task force ’s creation , criticized the report for relying on “ outdated and inadequate ” research to downplay the threat of predators .
Blumenthal said the task force should have made more specific recommendations for implementing and improving technologies .
Parry Aftab , a child - safety advocate with task - force member WiredSafety.org , said the group produced a report that essentially “ we could have done without spending a year .
We could have said there is n’t enough research out there . ”
But she said she agreed with its conclusions :
Kids are typically at risk because they put themselves at risk rather than because they are tricked , and technology is n’t enough to address that .
The task force was headed by Internet scholars at Harvard University and grew out of an agreement MySpace reached with most state attorneys general a year ago .
Members of the panel include Internet service companies and nonprofit groups , including those focused on children ’s safety .
The panel ’s recommendations are nonbinding .
I do n’t mean take a knife and cut it into eight parts but instead follow the design that our friend Charlie has in mind for us .
He has devised the Dynamically Augmenting Wheel System or simply DAWS .
His aim was to design a wheel system that would allow a car to shift its center of gravity without losing its traction footprint .
DAWS is kind of inspired by a motorcycle wheel .
Lemme explain , a motorcycle wheel allows you to shift or roll your body into a turn giving the bike improved maneuverability and is accomplished by having rounded wheels .
This also implies that a bike wheel has a “ decreased footprint size when compared to a car wheel and sacrifices traction hurting acceleration , braking and turning speed . ”
DAWS essentially features eight segments that are guided on a liner bearing at the hub the wheel can shift the entire vehicle without decreasing footprint size .
The motion is kinda similar to our foot movement than a conventional wheel .

Rice Defends Enhanced Interrogations
Updated 2:07 p.m.
By Glenn Kessler
While Vice President Cheney has publicly defended the Bush administration 's use of enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding , other senior decision - makers at the time have remained silent .
But former secretary of State and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice -- who declined to comment last week on the release of Justice Department memos authorizing the practice -- was caught on video tape this week giving a finger - wagging defense to a persistent Stanford University student .
" In terms of the enhanced interrogation and so forth , anything that was legal and was going to make this country safer , the president wanted to do , " Rice said .
" Nothing that was illegal .
And nothing that was going to make the country less safe . "
She also urged the student to remember the context of the decision - making in 2002 , shortly after the sept .
11 attacks .
" Unless you were there , in a position of responsibility after September 11th , you cannot possibly imagine the dilemmas that you faced in trying to protect Americans , " she said , adding " you were determined to do anything that you could that was legal to prevent that from happening again . "
Rice became riled when the student noted that the United States did not torture during World War II .
" With all due respect , Nazi Germany never attacked the homeland of the United States , " Rice shot back .
Japan , Germany 's ally , however , attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii , killing 2,350 military personnel and civilians .
The student persists , and says that the United States tortured detainees at Guantanamo Bay .
" No , no dear , you 're wrong , " Rice said .
" You 're wrong .
We did not torture anyone .
And Guantanamo Bay , by the way , was considered a model quote - ' medium security prison ' by representatives of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe who went there to see it .
Did you know that ? "
( Alain Grignard , an expert for the OSCE , said in 2006 that Guantanamo was a " model prison " where inmates are treated better than in Belgian jails , though he added that holding people for many years without telling them what would happen to them is a form of " mental torture . " )
At one point , Rice puts on her best professorial voice and jabs , " Do your homework first . "
Rice insisted she did not authorize the CIA to use the interrogation techniques , as was widely reported last week : " I did n't authorize anything .
I conveyed the authorization of the administration to the agency that they had policy authorization , subject to the Justice Department 's clearance .
That 's what I did . "
Asked whether waterboarding is torture , Rice replied emphatically : " We were told , nothing that violates our obligations under the Convention Against Torture .
And so , by definition , if it was authorized by the president , it did not violate our obligations under the Conventions Against Torture . "
Rice made much the same case when she toured Europe in late 2005 , defending U.S. detainee practices .
Earlier this year , however , President Obama declared the practice is torture and violated U.S. international obligations .

In February the Justice Department charged Forest Laboratories with illegally marketing antidepressants Celexa and Lexapro to younger patients and burying a study that showed suicidal side effects in children .
But the next month the FDA approved Lexapro for depression in adolescents 12 to 17 .
In March the Justice Department charged AstraZeneca with knowing and hiding the diabetes side effects of Seroquel .
But this month the FDA considers expanding the anti-psychotic ’s approvals to depression and anxiety .
And in January , Eli Lilly pled guilty to promoting its antipsychotic Zyprexa for unapproved and dangerous uses in a $ 1.4 billion settlement .
But in March the FDA approved Lilly ’s Zyprexa / Prozac combo , Symbyax for treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) .
What do you get when you cross Zyprexa with Prozac ?
Someone who gains 100 pounds and feels great about it !
“ TRD ” is such a new pharma invention it googles as Toyota Racing Development and Teacher Recruitment Days .
But it will soon move ‘ script like GAD ( general anxiety disorder ) , MDD ( major depressive disorder ) ADD ( attention deficit disorder ) RLS ( restless legs syndrome ) GERD ( gastroesophageal reflux disease ) and PMDD ( Premenstrual dysphoric disorder ) –and for the same reasons .
Of course FDA drug approvals are only as good as the studies .
Which is the problem .
Forest paid Massachusetts General Hospital ’s Jeffrey Bostic , MD $ 750,000 to chat up Celexa and Lexapro according to US District Court in Boston filings .
AstraZeneca paid University of Minnesota Charles Schulz , MD $ 112,000 to push Seroquel according to US District Court in Orlando filings .
And a decade of pain “ studies ” conducted by Baystate Medical Center ’s Scott S. Reuben , MD on Vioxx , Lyrica , Celebrex and Effexor were completely fabricated –including the patients say published reports .
And speaking of “ made up , Coast IRB , an institutional review board which oversees some 300 clinical trials and 3,000 researchers agreed last year to approve a human trial for “ Adhesiabloc , ” a surgical gel which Congress and the Government Accountability Office completely made up in a sting operation .
Oops .
And let ’s not forget Joseph your - child - is - bipolar Biederman , MD at Harvard who assured benefactor Johnson & Johnson his studies would have pro Risperdal results according to the New York Times–in advance of doing them .
( Why leave things up to science ? )
And Charles “ Paxil ” Nemeroff , MD who was forced to step down in December as psychiatry chairman at Emory University thanks to unreported GlaxoSmithKline income of up to $ 800,000 .
And the pharma funded studies continue !
Last May a pro Lexapro article , “ Escitalopram and Problem - Solving Therapy for Prevention of Poststroke Depression , ” ran in JAMA , the Journal of the American Medical Association , with no mention of financial ties author Robert G. Robinson , MD has to Forest .
Why was , “ a researcher with a history of being funded by SSRI makers … given a forum in the national media to tell the general public that anyone who has had a stroke , whether or not they have been diagnosed with depression , should start a prophylactic regimen of Lexapro…even though non-medical approaches perform just as well , ” wrote Jonathan Leo , PhD , Associate Professor of Neuroanatomy at Lincoln Memorial University in the British Medical Journal in March .
And then there ’s AstraZeneca ’s “ studies . ”
Seroquel is linked to high blood sugar , weight gain , diabetes , cholesterol and triglycerides abnormalities , sudden cardiac death , suicide , Iraq war veteran deaths and the tardive dyskinesia it is supposed to prevent .
But its “ safety ” was established by a different kind of chemistry .
Research director for Seroquel , Wayne MacFadden , was having affairs with two women responsible for Seroquel studies say court documents : a researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry in London and a ghostwriter at Waltham , MA - based medical communications firm Parexel .
The studies upon which the FDA approved Seroquel for bipolar disorder–called “ Bolder ” I and II –were written by a ghostwriter , possibly accelerated by a motel room .
And seated on the FDA ’s Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee at the time was Jorge Armenteros , MD , who has been a paid AstraZeneca speaker for five years according to the Philadelphia Inquirer .
He now heads the committee as the FDA considers expanding Seroquel approvals to include depression and anxiety this month–and to children in June .
Hopefully FDA will keep some Seroquel for itself .
Its members belong to what is thought to be the oldest surviving culture in the Andes , a tribe that has survived for 4,000 years on the barren plains of the Bolivian interior .
But the Uru Chipaya , who outlasted the Inca empire and survived the Spanish conquest , are warning that they now face extinction through climate change .
The tribal chief , 62 - year - old Felix Quispe , 62 , says the river that has sustained them for millennia is drying up .
His people cannot cope with the dramatic reduction in the Lauca , which has dwindled in recent decades amid erratic rainfall that has turned crops to dust and livestock to skin and bones .
" Over here used to be all water , " he said , gesturing across an arid plain .
" There were ducks , crabs , reeds growing in the water .
I remember that .
What are we going to do ?
We are water people . "
The Uru Chipaya , who according to mythological origin are " water beings " rather than human beings , could soon be forced to abandon their settlements and go to the cities of Bolivia and Chile , said Quispe .
" There is no pasture for animals , no rainfall .
Nothing .
Drought . "
The tribe is renowned for surviving on the fringe of a salt desert , a harsh and eerie landscape which even the Incas avoided , by flushing the soil with river water .
As the Lauca has dried , many members of the Uru Chipaya have migrated , leaving fewer than 2,000 in the village of Santa Ana and the surrounding settlements .
" We have nothing to eat .
That 's why our children are all leaving , " said Vicenta Condori , 52 , dressed in traditional skirt and shawl .
She has two children in Chile .
Some members of the tribe blame the crisis on neglect of the deities .
The chief has lobbied for greater offerings and adherence to traditional customs .
" This is in our own hands , " he said .
Scientists say rising temperatures have accelerated the retreat of Andean glaciers throughout Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador and Peru .
A ski resort in Bolivia 's capital , La Paz , the highest in South America , closed several years ago because of the retreat of the Chacaltaya glacier .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in 2007 that warmer temperatures could melt all Latin America 's glaciers within 15 years .
A recent World Bank study sounded fresh alarm on the issue .
Indigenous groups from around the world are meeting in Alaska this week to discuss global warming .
" Indigenous peoples are on the frontlines of climate change , " said the host , the Inuit Circumpolar Council .
A new Oxfam report , meanwhile , has warned that within six years the number of people affected by climate - related crises will jump by 54 % to 375 million .
Evo Morales , Bolivia 's president , told the Guardian that his government would form a united front with indigenous groups for a " big mobilisation " at a summit in Denmark this year to draw up a successor to the Kyoto treaty .
They intend to push industrialised countries to cut carbon emissions .
" We are preparing a team from the water and environment ministries to focus not only on the summit but beyond that . "
One of South America 's poorest countries , Bolivia is struggling with competition for natural resources .
Water scarcity has hit La Paz and its satellite city , El Alto , prompting conservation campaigns .
The shortage is nationwide .
The Uru Chipaya accuse Aymara communities , living upriver from the Lauca , of diverting more and more water supplies .
" It 's a dual cause : climate change and greater competition .
The result is an extremely grave threat to this culture .
I am very worried , " said Alvaro Díez Astete , an anthropologist who has written a book on the tribe .
With so many of the young people migrating to cities , where they speak Spanish , the Uru language could disappear within a few generations .
Some Uru Chipaya fear the battle for cultural survival could already be lost .
The rutted streets of Santa Ana are largely deserted and little disturbs the stillness of the dry plains that once were fields .
Several dozen , mostly elderly , people gathered on a recent Sunday to share soup from communal pots .
" We are at risk of extinction , " said Juan Condori , 55 .
" The Chipaya could cease to exist within the next 50 years .
The most important thing is water .
If there is no water the Chipaya have no life . "

Senate Republicans are now privately threatening to derail the confirmation of key Obama administration nominees for top legal positions by linking the votes to suppressing critical torture memos from the Bush era .
A reliable Justice Department source advises me that Senate Republicans are planning to “ go nuclear ” over the nominations of Dawn Johnsen as chief of the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice and Yale Law School Dean Harold Koh as State Department legal counsel if the torture documents are made public .
The source says these threats are the principle reason for the Obama administration ’s abrupt pullback last week from a commitment to release some of the documents .
A Republican Senate source confirms the strategy .
It now appears that Republicans are seeking an Obama commitment to safeguard the Bush administration ’s darkest secrets in exchange for letting these nominations go forward .
Not a single Republican indicated an intention to vote for Dawn Johnsen , while Senator John Cornyn of Texas was described as “ gunning for her , ” specifically noting publication of the torture memos .
Barack Obama entered Washington with a promise of transparency .
One of his first acts was a presidential directive requiring that the Freedom of Information Act , a near dead letter during the Bush years , was to be enforced according to its terms .
He specifically criticized the Bush administration ’s practice of preparing secret memos that determined legal policy and promised to review and publish them after taking office .
But in the past week , questions about Obama ’s commitment to transparency have mounted .
On April 2 , the Justice Department was expected to make public a set of four memoranda prepared by the Office of Legal Counsel , long sought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy organizations in a pending FOIA litigation .
The memos , authored by then - administration officials and now University of California law professor John Yoo , federal appellate judge Jay Bybee and former Justice Department lawyer Stephen Bradbury , apparently grant authority for the brutal treatment of prisoners , including waterboarding , isolated confinement in coffin - like containers , and “ head smacking . ”
The stakes over release of the papers are increasingly high .
Yoo and Bybee are both targets of a criminal investigation in a Spanish court probing the torture of five Spanish citizens formerly held in Guantánamo ; also named in the Spanish case are former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and three other Bush lawyers .
Legal observers in Spain consider the Bush administration lawyers at serious risk of indictment , and the memos , once released , could be entered as evidence in connection with their prosecution .
Unlike the torture memos that are already public , these memos directly approve specific torture techniques and therefore present a far graver problem for their authors .
The release of the memos that the Senate Republicans want to suppress was cleared by Attorney General Eric Holder and White House counsel Greg Craig , and then was stopped when “ all hell broke loose ” inside the Obama administration , according to an article by Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff .
Newsweek attributes internal opposition to disclosure of the Bush - era torture memos to White House counterterrorism adviser and former CIA official John O. Brennan , who has raised arguments that exposure of the memoranda would run afoul of policies protecting the secrecy of agency techniques and has also argued that the memos would embarrass nations like Morocco , Jordan , Pakistan , Tunisia and Egypt , which have cooperated closely with the CIA in its extraordinary renditions program .
Few informed independent observers , however , find much to credit in the Brennan objections because the techniques are now well - known , as is the role of the cooperating foreign intelligence services — any references to which would in any event likely be redacted before the memoranda are released .
Moreover , the argument that the confidence of those engaged in torture — serious criminal conduct under international and domestic law — should be kept because they would be “ embarrassed ” if it were to come out borders on comic .
The Justice Department source confirms to me that Brennan has consistently opposed making public the torture memos — and any other details about the operations of the extraordinary renditions program — but this source suggests that concern about the G.O.P. ’s roadblock in the confirmation process is the principle reason that the memos were not released .
Republican senators have expressed strong reservations about their promised exposure , expressing alarm that a critique of the memos by Justice ’s ethics office ( Office of Professional Responsibility ) will also be released .
“ There was no ‘ direct ’ threat , ” said the source , “ but the message was communicated clearly — if the OLC and OPR memoranda are released to the public , there will be war . ”
This is understood as a threat to filibuster the nominations of Johnsen and Koh .
Not only are they among the most prominent academic critics of the torture memoranda , but are also viewed as the strongest advocates for release of the torture memos on Obama ’s legal policy team .
A Republican Senate staffer further has confirmed to me that the Johnsen nomination was discussed at the last G.O.P. caucus meeting .
Not a single Republican indicated an intention to vote for Dawn Johnsen , while Senator John Cornyn of Texas was described as “ gunning for her , ” specifically noting publication of the torture memos .
No decision was taken at that Republican caucus meeting whether to filibuster or not , though Cornyn was generally believed to support filibustering Johnsen and potentially other nominees .
Johnsen has met recently with moderate Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , both of whom are being lobbied heavily by colleagues and religious right groups to oppose her nomination .
Both Koh and Johnsen are targets of sustained attacks coming from right - wing lobbying groups .
The Daily Beast previously reviewed the attacks on Johnsen , while Slate ’s Dahlia Lithwick has catalogued the recent attacks on Koh. Former Bush administration Solicitor General Ted Olson recently endorsed the Koh nomination , calling the Yale dean “ a man of great integrity . ”
But connecting the Obama nominations to the Bush torture memos escalates the conflict toward a thermonuclear level .
RELATED STORY : The CIA Torture Cover Up by John Sifton
Scott Horton is a law professor and writer on legal and national - security affairs for Harper 's magazine and The American Lawyer , among other publications .
It ’s hard to imagine now , but in 1944 , six years after Kristallnacht , Lessing J. Rosenwald , president of the American Council for Judaism , felt comfortable equating the Zionist ideal of Jewish statehood with “ the concept of a racial state -- the Hitlerian concept . ”
For most of the last century , a principled opposition to Zionism was a mainstream stance within American Judaism .
Even after the foundation of Israel , anti-Zionism was not a particularly heretical position .
Assimilated Reform Jews like Rosenwald believed that Judaism should remain a matter of religious rather than political allegiance ; the ultra-Orthodox saw Jewish statehood as an impious attempt to “ push the hand of God ” ; and Marxist Jews -- my grandparents among them -- tended to see Zionism , and all nationalisms , as a distraction from the more essential struggle between classes .
To be Jewish , I was raised to believe , meant understanding oneself as a member of a tribe that over and over had been cast out , mistreated , slaughtered .
Millenniums of oppression that preceded it did not entitle us to a homeland or a right to self - defense that superseded anyone else ’s .
If they offered us anything exceptional , it was a perspective on oppression and an obligation born of the prophetic tradition : to act on behalf of the oppressed and to cry out at the oppressor .
For the last several decades , though , it has been all but impossible to cry out against the Israeli state without being smeared as an anti-Semite , or worse .
To question not just Israel ’s actions , but the Zionist tenets on which the state is founded , has for too long been regarded an almost unspeakable blasphemy .

Yet it is no longer possible to believe with an honest conscience that the deplorable conditions in which Palestinians live and die in Gaza and the West Bank come as the result of specific policies , leaders or parties on either side of the impasse .
The problem is fundamental : Founding a modern state on a single ethnic or religious identity in a territory that is ethnically and religiously diverse leads inexorably either to politics of exclusion ( think of the 139 - square - mile prison camp that Gaza has become ) or to wholesale ethnic cleansing .
Put simply , the problem is Zionism .
It has been argued that Zionism is an anachronism , a leftover ideology from the era of 19th century romantic nationalisms wedged uncomfortably into 21st century geopolitics .
But Zionism is not merely outdated .
Even before 1948 , one of its basic oversights was readily apparent : the presence of Palestinians in Palestine .
That led some of the most prominent Jewish thinkers of the last century , many of them Zionists , to balk at the idea of Jewish statehood .
The Brit Shalom movement -- founded in 1925 and supported at various times by Martin Buber , Hannah Arendt and Gershom Scholem -- argued for a secular , binational state in Palestine in which Jews and Arabs would be accorded equal status .
Their concerns were both moral and pragmatic .
The establishment of a Jewish state , Buber feared , would mean “ premeditated national suicide . ”
The fate Buber foresaw is upon us : a nation that has lived in a state of war for decades , a quarter - million Arab citizens with second - class status and more than 5 million Palestinians deprived of the most basic political and human rights .
If two decades ago comparisons to the South African apartheid system felt like hyperbole , they now feel charitable .
The white South African regime , for all its crimes , never attacked the Bantustans with anything like the destructive power Israel visited on Gaza in December and January , when nearly 1,300 Palestinians were killed , one - third of them children .
Israeli policies have rendered the once apparently inevitable two - state solution less and less feasible .
Years of Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have methodically diminished the viability of a Palestinian state .
Israel ’s new prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , has even refused to endorse the idea of an independent Palestinian state , which suggests an immediate future of more of the same : more settlements , more punitive assaults .
Advertisement
All of this has led to a revival of the Brit Shalom idea of a single , secular binational state in which Jews and Arabs have equal political rights .
The obstacles are , of course , enormous .
They include not just a powerful Israeli attachment to the idea of an exclusively Jewish state , but its Palestinian analogue : Hamas ’ ideal of Islamic rule .
Both sides would have to find assurance that their security was guaranteed .
What precise shape such a state would take -- a strict , vote - by - vote democracy or a more complex federalist system -- would involve years of painful negotiation , wiser leaders than now exist and an uncompromising commitment from the rest of the world , particularly from the United States .
Meanwhile , the characterization of anti-Zionism as an “ epidemic ” more dangerous than anti-Semitism reveals only the unsustainability of the position into which Israel ’s apologists have been forced .
Faced with international condemnation , they seek to limit the discourse , to erect walls that delineate what can and ca n’t be said .
It ’s not working .
Opposing Zionism is neither anti-Semitic nor particularly radical .
It requires only that we take our own values seriously and no longer , as the book of Amos has it , “ turn justice into wormwood and hurl righteousness to the ground . ”
Establishing a secular , pluralist , democratic government in Israel and Palestine would of course mean the abandonment of the Zionist dream .
It might also mean the only salvation for the Jewish ideals of justice that date back to Jeremiah .
Choice appears to be the hallmark of this edition of the System Guide .
Both the Budget Box and Hot Rod have excellent choices from Intel and AMD available in the CPU and motherboard selection , running the gamut from low - to high - end .
Combine this with continued jumps in video card performance from both NVIDIA and AMD , and we end up with lots of choice in both the Budget Box and Hot Rod .
The Budget Box
This time around , the Budget Box goes a little more middle - of - the - road than usual , mostly in the name of flexibility .
Lower - cost Intel boards either are n't quite as overclocking - friendly or are n't quite as feature - packed as their AMD equivalents , but Intel 's dual - core chips appear to match up somewhat better than AMD 's in several metrics .
Strictly speaking , we were very tempted to go Intel at the price point we chose , or AMD near the top of the price cap .
Again , we chose the more flexible route .
It 's a tough call .
Motherboard
Asus M3A78-EM
Basic requirements for the Budget Box have always been pretty straightforward : whatever CPU socket is appropriate , at least two memory sockets , one PCI -e x16 slot for the discrete video card , decent onboard sound and Ethernet , enough SATA and USB ports to fill our expansion needs , and enough overclocking potential to make it a viable option .
Cost , naturally , is a concern as well .
CPU performance for our money at stock speeds must be adequate as well ; overclocked performance is nice , but we consider stock performance a little more heavily .
Optional features that we 've been able to require for the last few updates are : onboard video , which gives considerable flexibility to potential Budget Box builders who do not need additional 3D performance ; four memory sockets rather than two for more flexibility ; and a microATX form factor , which gives us more flexibility in case selection — particularly since the modern Budget Box generally needs very little beyond the absolute basics of a motherboard , CPU , memory , video card , a single harddisk , single optical drive , case , and power supply .
The end result today is that we have lots of choices for the Budget Box .
On the Intel side , motherboards on the NVIDIA Geforce 9300 and 9400 chipsets are feature - packed and quite good , but the de facto standard remains Intel chipsets such as the G35 , G43 , and G45 with integrated video , and the P43 and P45 without .
Almost all boards available with integrated video tend to come fully loaded , although the higher cost of nicer boards tends to exclude them from the Budget Box , and the G43 boards do n't always OC all that well .
AMD boards tend to be slightly better off in cost - sensitive applications with the brand - new low - cost 760G at the lowest - end , and the 780G chipset at the higher - end .
The faster onboard video of the AMD 790GX makes it a tough call , as the 780G is already quite good .
NVIDIA 's chipset for AMD processors , the Geforce 8200 and 8300 , is also excellent .
In the end , we go the AMD route as we have in previous updates .
Intel 's Pentium dual - core and low - end Core 2 Duo offerings , particularly a low - cost Intel P43 - based motherboard such as the Gigabyte GA - EP43 - DS3L or Intel G43 - based Asus P5QL - CM are worth looking at , but their feature set does n't quite match AMD - based offerings in value , and they do n't overclock as well as their higher - end brethren .
Several NVIDIA - based boards out there would fill our needs well , but the maturity , price / performance and features of some of the AMD 780G offerings are hard to beat .
We would actually love to try an AMD 760G / SB710 board to see how the SB710 overclocks , but such boards are still in their infancy .
The Asus M3A78 - EM is a microATX board with the AMD 780G chipset and SB700 southbridge , which means it's not the greatest overclocker , but it does just fine .
Socket AM2+/ AM2 , four DDR2 sockets , one PCI -e 2.0 x16 slot , one PCI -e x1 slot , five SATA ports , 7.1 audio , VGA , DVI , Display Port , and HDMI out , Firewire 400 , optical S / PDIF out , gigabit ethernet — the spec list is nothing if not comprehensive .
That said , many of its competitors are good too , such as the Gigabyte GA - MA78 GM - US2H .

Processor
AMD Athlon 64 X2 7750 + Retail ( Socket AM2 )
This chip 's vitals — 2.7ghz , dual core , 1MB total L2 cache , 3600 mhz Hypertransport , 95W ADP — are pedestrian by today 's standards , but the price is definitely right and the performance is excellent .
Based on the newer K10 core powering the multi-core Phenoms , the Athlon 64 X2 7750 + is superb processor for the money if you can handle its heat dissipation .
For significantly better power efficiency , the Athlon 64 X2 5050e at 2.6ghz and 45W ADP is much cooler but also somewhat slower for similar money .
Intel 's Pentium dual - core E5200 ( 2.5 ghz , 2MB L2 , 65W TDP ) is similar in price and slightly faster , which means an Intel - based Budget Box is definitely worth considering if you can handle what will probably be a few extra bucks on the motherboard compared to the AMD solution .
Intel - based Budget
Box builders face some interesting choices ; a Pentium dual - core with an affordable Intel G43 - based motherboard should be very close in price to the AMD combination we 've picked out .
It probably wo n't overclock as well , and if you want to use the onboard video you 'll have to accept some reduced performance here .
Going with a higher - end Intel P45 board such as the Gigabyte GA - EP45 - UD3L skips onboard video but gets you a board that 's an excellent overclocker , if you plan to overclock .
If you plan to use the onboard video and skip a discrete card , but still demand some ( very small ) 3D performance , an Intel G45 - based board like the Asus P5Q - EM or the NVIDIA Geforce 9400 - based Gigabyte GA - E7AUM -DS2H are both good but pricey .
The most interesting turn for the Budget Box is the Phenom X3 710 , a triple - core 2.6ghz , 3x512 KB cache processor for about double the price of the X2 7750 or E5200 .
The price of other components in the Budget Box lets a Budget Box builder squeeze this in fairly easily if their apps benefit from three cores at a price far under anything from Intel 's quad - core lineup .
Given how fast modern desktop processors are , we elect to save money here and go the cheaper route , as it's still more than adequate for the Budget Box .
As a bonus , we get by far the most flexibility for what is still more than enough performance .

RAM
4GB DDR2-800
DDR2 memory is affordable for pretty much everyone , and DDR2 - 800 prices regularly hit $ 20 after rebate if you shop carefully .
2GB is enough memory to keep Windows and most programs happy , but with 4GB being so little more versus the pain of hitting the swapfile more often , less than 4GB of RAM just is n't worth it .
Faster DDR2 -1066 memory may be nice if you are overclocking , but usually you need to be pushing it pretty hard to justify it .
Typical , good quality DDR2 - 800 today operates at JEDEC - specified 1.8v with 5 - 5 - 5 - 15 timings , such as this Corsair 2x2GB kit or one of many others from Crucial , OCZ , Kingston , GeIL , etc .
For ease of assembly , stick with DDR2 - 800 memory at the standard 1.8 v ; it 's so common today that older modules requiring more memory are virtually gone from the market , or they are confined to higher - than - standard clock speeds where additional voltage is still sometimes needed .

Video
Sapphire Radeon HD 4850 512MB
The Budget Box is in uncharted waters , which is just the way we like it -- at least when it comes to video cards .
AMD and NVIDIA have been duking it out with increasing intensity over the years , with the trickle - down from the high - end hitting the mid-range and even lower - mid - range in the past year or so .
Cards such as the NVIDIA Geforce GTS 250 are excellent buys for the Budget Box , although the GTS 250 really is a die- shrink of the G92 GPU that started life in the Geforce 8800 GT in late 2007 .
Despite the G92's excellence , AMD 's competing products have proven just as able or better in this area of the market .
The relatively recent AMD Radeon HD 4830 is perhaps the card best suited to the Budget Box for price and performance , but we do a very modest reach to the Radeon HD 4850 , which is considerably faster for not a whole lot more money .
We leave the higher - end discussion to the Hot Rod ( such as the Radeon HD 4870 1GB and Geforce GTX260 Core 216 ) , but the lower - end merits additional comments .
Keep in mind that the " lower " end around $ 75 -100 today is still blazingly fast compared to cards even 3 years old today , so downgrading even a " gaming " box to save a few bucks might make sense if your requirements are more modest than ours .
For more modest , the AMD Radeon HD 4670 is probably the best card around , and it still drives a lot of games at 1680x1050 or higher just fine .
The Geforce 9800GT is almost as good , but it is closer to the Radoen HD 4830 in price and hence is not as good a value .
We 're recommending the Sapphire Radeon HD 4850 , with 512MB of RAM , 625 mhz core speed , 993 mhz memory speed , dual DVI output , and the usual good stuff .
Power draw is typically a little over 9A on the +12 v line at peak , which means you 'll want a decent power supply -- but the rest of the Budget Box is fairly modest , so you do n't need to worry about it too much .

Hard drive
Western Digital Caviar SE16 640 GB SATA
Price compression between the smallest drives ( 80 GB to 160 GB ) to what we used to consider small ( 320 GB to 320 GB ) means the cost to jump to a bigger drive is almost nothing ; going to 500 GB or even 640 GB is almost as cheap .
320 GB is probably as small as we'd go in a contemporary Budget Box today , but the cost difference to double your space is so small we can't pass it up .
The fundamental goal is to buy as much hard disk space as you need , and not worry about the rest .
Power consumption is quickly becoming another marketing point , although it looks like energy - efficiency improvements have already spread .
Short of going to SSDs , a modern 7200rpm hard disk is already pretty good .
Seagate , Hitachi , Western Digital , and Samsung are all fairly similar in performance in the Budget Box 's eyes .
The Western Digital Caviar SE 640GB is an excellent performer with a 7200 RPM spindle speed , two - platter design , low noise , 16MB cache and a three - year warranty .

Optical drive
DVD-RW/CD-RW : Pioneer DVR - 216D
The recently discontinued Samsung SH - S203N and Pioneer DVR - 216D are the current favorites among those picky about drive performance , although they have plenty of competition .
Even for the most picky , performance differences are academic most of the time , so buy what you like .
We switch to the Pioneer in this update as the Samsung SH - S223 F does n't seem to be quite as good as its predecessor , or the current Pioneer for that matter .
The Pioneer DVR - 216D supports DVD reads and writes up to 20x , CD reads up to 40x , has a 2MB cache , and a SATA interface .
22 x drives are now out , but differences are so small they 're academic .

Case
Antec NSK4480
Finding an economical , well - built chassis with a good quality PSU is tougher than we'd like , but In - Win , Apex , Evercase , Antec , and others cover the low - end spectrum with both features and quality : a rear 120 mm fan , a decent PSU , some internal 3.5 " bays that are n't too flimsy , no sharp edges , etc .
The multitude of models offered means we have lots to choose from , varying in quality from junk to pretty decent .
Pay close attention to PSUs in the world of low - end cases , as those seemingly amazing high - wattage deals usually mean amazing junk .
Those who choose to go the microATX route will find that case selection is somewhat more limited than standard ATX , although many home theater PCs use this form factor — if you are willing to pay the premium for a sleek HTPC - styled setup .
The Antec NSK3480 is an excellent choice for those with a little more money to spend .
The In - Win EM013 is also very good at its price point .
For those who want the extra expansion of an ATX chassis , good choices include the Antec NSK4480 and its siblings , the In - Win C589T , Coolermaster Centurion 5 , Lian - Li PC - V1010B , and many more .
The Antec NSK4480 has a rear 120 mm fan , 3x5.25 " and 2x3.5 " external drive bays , 3x3.5 " internal drive bays , fits ATX and microATX motherboards , and has the requisite front USB ports .
It comes with the Antec Earthwatts EA380 power supply included , which is a fairly decent unit that can handle the growing needs of the Budget Box .

Speakers
Logitech X - 240
Speakers have been fairly boring for quite a while in the Budget Box .
The Logitech X - 240 — which replaced the previous X - 230 — is a passable , albeit bland , choice in this category .
In this price range , a good pair of headphones might make more sense , or even a pair of nice ones such as Etymotic ER - 6 i's .
Cambridge Soundworks , Altec Lansing , Swan , and others have suitable setups as well .
Creative 's Inspire T3100 are another , similarly mediocre alternative .
If you want better speakers , there are some good alternatives at varying price points .
The Behringer MS40 and the M - Audio Studiophile BX8a are higher - end 2.0 setups , while the Logitech Z-2300 and Altec Lansing VS3251 are more multimedia - oriented .

LCDs have become cheap enough that even a 22 " model fits the Budget Box .
Does that seem ridiculous ?
It does to us , too , but prices on LCDs as large as 22 " are getting very low and squeezing out smaller models .
The displays priced in Budget Box territory are all low - cost twisted nematic ( TN ) panels , so viewing angles and color reproduction are not the greatest , but they suit our needs fairly well .
Sales on LCDs now are fairly common , so picking up a better value or a larger monitor for the same money may not be hard to do for the patient buyer .
Stepping down to a smaller 17 " , 19 " , or 20 " LCD offers a few decent choices , such as Viewsonic VX1940w and the HP w2007 .
22 " competition is probably the strongest area right now .
The Samsung T220 ( which is quite decent ) , Viewsonic VX2255 wmb , and the hard - to - find LG L227WTG / L227WTQ are all nice choices for TN panels , with the L227WT 's almost zero input lag making it a top choice for hardcore gamers .
The Dell Ultrasharp 2209WA is a new surprise with one of the only 22 " non -TN panels available , and it's an excellent e-IPS panel if you are more worried about color accuracy and viewing angles than low input lag .
Stepping up to 24 " opens up a ton of options , such as the Samsung 245BW and BenQ G2400Wd .
We have enough video card power to handle the 1920x1200 that 24 " monitors demand in some games ( but not all ) -- pretty amazing for the Budget Box .
If you prefer PVA / MVA or IPS panels over TN panels for photo editing and other color sensitive work , the HP LP2475w and Dell 2408 WFP 24 " are excellent choices .
Keep in mind that they tend to have higher input lag than the TN panels we 've recommended , which makes them considerably less suitable for hardcore gaming .
We choose the Asus VW224U , in no small part , due to its 300 cd/m2 brightness , 1000:1 native contrast ratio , 1680x1050 resolution , and its 2 ms grey - to - grey response time .
It 's surprisingly good for the money .

Recommended operating systems
The release of Service Pack 1 for Windows Vista makes us comfortable with recommending Microsoft 's newest OS .
Interface quirks , driver model changes , and everything else aside , Vista now looks to be a reasonably solid OS .
Service Pack 1 did n't make as much of an improvement as we were hoping , but it does n't seem to have hurt anything for most users .
We also continue to recommend Linux , although some may be surprised that we 're fairly distro-agnostic here in the Orbiting HQ .
Keep in mind that to use all of your 4GB of memory , you will need to run a 64 - bit version of Windows rather than a 32 - bit version .
Windows Vista Home Premium
Vista Home Premium adds Aero Glass , Windows Media Center , and a whole host of additional features .
Combined with the increasing driver support in Vista , there 's less of a need to stick with older versions of Windows XP .

Windows Vista Home Basic
The most basic version of Vista .
It lacks Aero Glass , but , for the Budget Box user , it handles all of the basics just fine .
Plus it 's cheap , and , when it comes down to it , cheap and functional are what the Budget Box is all about .

Russian Warship Sinks Chinese Freighter
by James Dunnigan
March 3 , 2009
The Russian Coast Guard sank a Chinese coastal freighter , the New Star , on February 15th , after the ship left the Russian Pacific port of Nakhodka without permission .
The New Star arrived in Nakhodka nearly three weeks ago , with a cargo of rice .
But the firm that purchased the rice complained that the cargo was of low quality , and demanded a lower price .
The Russian buyer went to local officials , and got the government to forbid the New Star from leaving until the matter was settled .
Caught in the middle of this dispute between the Chinese rice broker and the Russian buyer , the Hong Kong owner of the New Star ordered the captain to leave port anyway .
When the Russian Coast Guard was notified , they sent a patrol ship out to bring the New Star back .
The Russian patrol boat caught up with the New Star , about 80 kilometers from Nakhodka , and ordered the Chinese ship to return to port .
The Chinese ship refused , and eventually the Russians opened fire with a 30 mm auto - cannon .
After several hours , 515 30 mm shells were fired into the hull of the New Star , causing it to take on water and begin to sink .
While getting off the New Star , eight of the crew died when one of the two life rafts flipped over in rough seas .
The other eight members of the crew were picked up by a Russian Coast Guard ship .
The Russians blame the Chinese ship captain , but China wants an investigation .
With that in mind , the Russian Coast Guard now says the New Star was suspected of smuggling as well .
One the most candid portraits taken of the model turned war photographer Lee Miller shows a beautiful but exhausted woman washing herself in Adolf Hitler 's bathtub .
Her muddy combat boots and grime - covered face stand out amongst Hitler 's pristine tiled washroom , still decorated with a picture of the recently deceased leader and a tacky classical - style statute of a naked woman .
The famous frame , taken by fellow war photographer David E Scherman , captures the remarkable life of a woman who went from starring on the cover of Vogue to the front line .

Today a new and no less remarkable chapter in Miller 's life will be uncovered : the American - born photographer , who lived in Britain during and after the Second World War , was placed under minute surveillance by MI5 even as she went about documenting some of war 's worst horrors , according to intelligence reports released by the National Archive .
For much of the 1940s and 1950s , intelligence officers intercepted Miller 's post and kept a close eye on her circle of artistic friends , which the security services believed had strong Communist sympathies .
In justifying their spying , a Special Branch report written in 1941 concluded that the beautiful photographer , who once had an affair with the surrealist painter Man Ray , was an " eccentric " who indulged in " queer food and queer clothes " and needed to be watched carefully .
The entry said : " She is regarded as an intellectual communist and theoretical political student and the managing director of Conde Nast Productions Ltd Mr HW Yoxall has chaffed her about it .
Mr Yoxall states that [ Miller ] is eccentric and indulges in queer foods and queer clothes etc . ”
Miller first began to attract the interest of the intelligence service 's Communist hunters because her second husband , Roland Penrose , was deemed to be sympathetic towards Stalin 's Russia .
She also had a close friendship with Wilfred McCartney a former Communist International member who was jailed for 10 years in 1925 for spying on the Russians .
Described in the intelligence reports as " violently anti-Nazi " , Miller – whose real name was Elizabeth Miller Eloui – was eventually deemed to not constitute any threat .
" The general opinion of Eloui is that her Communism is more a mental outlook than anything and I have obtained no information that she is associated with any particular subversive organisation , " one officer concluded .
That MI5 kept tabs on Miller reveals how even those who were perceived to have been true patriots during the Second World War were deemed suspicious as fear of Communism gripped the West in the post - war era .

Miller 's pictures of a bombed - out London during the Blitz for Vogue Magazine helped increase American support for the war effort .
Among just a handful of female photographers officially accredited by the Allies , Miller made an astonishing journey once the invasion of Europe began , from the beaches of Normandy to the concentration camps of Dachau and Buchenwald , documenting several of the most harrowing episodes of the Second World War .
Her immersion in the overwhelmingly male arena was all the more startling given her modelling background .
Miller spent most of the 1920s and 1930s as a muse to artists in New York and Paris before moving behind the lens .
Her early work , clearly influenced by her surrealist lover and his friends , included playfully witty images which were to contrast with the grittier and harrowing work she developed as a photojournalist .
Professor Chris Andrew , the official historian of MI5 , said yesterday : " What is not sufficiently realised is that her career was absolutely unique in British history .
There had never been anybody like her before , there 's no reason to think there will be anyone like her again .
She was extremely talented , she was extremely beautiful . "
Writing for a 1992 collection of Miller 's war photographs , her friend and travel companion Scherman wrote : “ It is almost impossible today , 50 years later , to conceive how difficult it was for a woman correspondent to get beyond a rear - echelon military position , in other words to the front , where the action was . ”
The firefighter crawled on his stomach through the pitch - black apartment , the smoke so thick he could n't see his hand in front of his face .
Somewhere inside was a baby and he had to find her .
A window broke , light filled the room , and he saw her lying in her crib , dressed only in a diaper , unconscious .
Soot covered her tiny nose .
She was n't breathing and had no pulse .
He grabbed her and breathed life into her as he ran from the apartment .
A newspaper photograph captured their image - a white firefighter from South Boston with his lips pressed to the mouth of a black baby from the Roxbury public housing development - at a time when riots sparked by racial tensions were burning down American cities .
But despite this most intimate of introductions , they remained strangers .
William Carroll won a commendation for the rescue , stayed on the job another 34 years , and retired .
Evangeline Harper grew up , lost her family to drugs and illness , had six children of her own , and became a nursing and teaching assistant .
And through it all someone would often tell her the story about the day she almost died and the man who would not let it happen .
She always wanted to meet him and say thank you .
Yesterday , more than 40 years after the fire , she finally did .
In the neighborhood where they first met , Carroll , a slim 71 - year - old , got out of his car , dressed in a navy blue uniform he had borrowed from a fellow firefighter , strode up to the 40 - year - old woman , and beamed .
" You 've grown a lot since the last time I saw you , " he said , laughing and putting out his hand .
She smiled , gently took his hand , and looked at him almost shyly .
" Thank you so much for remembering me , " he told her .
Then he pulled her into a tight embrace and they held on to each other as they stood on Keegan Street , just a few yards from where he had carried her limp body decades ago .
" Thank you so much , " she said softly .
The Globe arranged the meeting after Evangeline Harper , now Evangeline Anderson , introduced herself to a reporter at a community meeting and asked for help tracking down Carroll .
Anderson , who now lives in Dorchester , had tried twice before to locate the firefighter , first when she was 18 , after her adoptive mother told her about the rescue , and again right after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
She tried to get his address from the Fire Department , but they said they could not give out personal information .
She left her name and phone number , but never heard back .
California corrections officials say the state will no longer spend the estimated $ 10 million a year it costs to lock up undocumented immigrants with prior convictions who reenter the country illegally after being deported .
The stance refers to immigrants who had committed crimes in California and finished serving their terms .
In the past , the state kept them on parole after deportation and incarcerated them for four to eight months for violating their parole by reentering the country illegally .
But California is facing an order from a panel of federal judges to reduce the population of its overcrowded prisons .
In a letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on Friday and in a news conference Monday , California corrections chief Matt Cate said the federal government should prosecute illegal immigrants who return to the country after deportation because that is a crime under federal law .

Now , when illegal immigrants are released from state prison and given to federal authorities for deportation , they will automatically be discharged from parole .
“ Those short prison stints are not punishment enough for these repeat offenders , yet they cost California millions every year to recycle them through our parole process , exacerbating the crowded positions in our prisons , ” Cate , secretary of the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , said in his letter to Napolitano .
“ California can no longer afford this practice . ”
Michael Keegan , a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security , said the agency had received the letter and was reviewing it .
“ We . . . will be responding to the state of California through the proper channels as soon as we ’re done analyzing the information , ” he said .

Out of 12,000 undocumented immigrants released to federal authorities for deportation in 2007 , nearly 1,600 returned illegally and were sent to prison , which cost the state up to $ 10 million a year , corrections officials said .
Under federal law , they could have been prosecuted and given sentences for up to 20 years for returning to the country illegally , Keegan said .
“ In far too many cases , when the federal government did not prosecute , the only recourse was a four - to eight - month parole revocation term , ” Cate told reporters .
Cate said the immigrants use up resources when they are admitted to state prison because they undergo medical and mental health reviews , but their terms are so short there is no time for rehabilitation .
The state has always had the option of dealing with illegal immigrants by turning them over to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to be deported , even if federal prosecutors decline to file charges .
State officials , however , preferred sending repeat offenders to prison so they would receive some punishment , said Seth Unger , a spokesman for the state corrections department .

The situation has changed now that three federal judges have said they intend to order the state to reduce its prison population by nearly 60,000 inmates .
And Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last month cut $ 400 million from the state prisons ’ budget .

Rove : Bush administration ' fulfilled ' its Katrina responsibilities David Edwards and John Byrne

Don't be surprised if this causes you to spill your coffee .
When pundits began to critique the recent speech of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal in an ABC News green room on Sunday , former Bush adviser Karl Rove declared that the federal government met its responsibilities with regard to the Hurricane Katrina disaster .
The following exchange appears on the video below at 2:11 .
" With all due respect , the government official who was responsible for managing Katrina under the Stafford Act was the governor of Louisiana and she lost office in large measure due to the poor quality of her performance , " Rove quipped .
" I think many thought that Katrina was the bookend to Iraq , " The Nation 's Katrina vanden Heuvel said .
" That 's when millions of Americans , left or right , woke up to the incompetence of an administration that had worked hard to diminish government as a force for good and therefore was able to pinpoint --"
" With all due respect , the federal government 's responsibilities were met under Katrina which were to provide the immediate assistance , to pluck people off of the roofs , " Rove remarked .
" The people in charge with calling the evacuations are the state and local officials . "
" The voters have made their judgment , " pollster Stan Greenberg interjected .
But Rove continued to defend Bush .
" Ignoring what the law requires , ignoring what the reality of the situation is , policymakers set the laws in certain way and policy describers ignore what the law did and ascribed the problems of the law to the federal government , " he said .
Rove made the comments during an webcast on ABCNews.com .

The F - 35B supersonic stealth jumpjet which will replace the famous Harrier in the British and US forces has successfully completed " hover pit " testing , according to lead maker Lockheed .
The company says that the plane is able to generate 550 pounds more vertical thrust than was required .
The big fliptop lid is the lift - fan shaft cover .
The smaller dorsal gates let more air into the engine for hover operations .
The ventral doors at the rear let the exhaust swivel down .
Hi-res here .
The F - 35B is intended to take off fully loaded after a short forward run , perhaps assisted by a " ski-jump " ramp as used on the current British aircraft carriers .
After a mission , having burned fuel and possibly released weapons , the lightened plane is expected to hover down and make a vertical landing .
It achieves this partly by swivelling its jet exhaust downwards , and partly by blasting air down through a central shaft with an engine - driven lift fan mounted in it .
This kind of operation is generally known as " STOVL " , for Short Take Off , Vertical Landing .
The first F - 35B prototype has already flown , but only as a normal runway jet .
The engine it was originally fitted with failed to satisfy engineers that it could reliably deliver the required power levels for hovering , and so modifications have had to be carried out .
But now engineers have a jumpjet which they believe is up to the challenge .
Mounted on a grating above a pit at Lockheed 's Forth Worth facility in Texas , the F - 35B has apparently been able to deliver some 41,100 pounds of thrust using its lift fan and downward - pointed jet exhaust - enough to support more than 18 tonnes in a hover .
Project engineers say that the jumpjet needs only 40,550 pounds to meet its performance targets .
" We 've demonstrated critical performance such as inlet pressure recovery , pitching moment , rolling and yawing moment , effective vector angles of the exhaust , and control - input response time , " said Doug Pearson of the F - 35 Integrated Test Force .
" The outstanding STOVL performance gives us plenty of confidence to begin in - flight transitions to STOVL - mode flight and ultimately our first vertical landing this summer . "
In the US , the F - 35B is intended for service with the US Marines , who today operate Harriers both ashore and from amphibious - warfare ships not unlike the Royal Navy 's carriers .
The US Navy will buy the F - 35C arrester hook version and fly it from their massive , fully - equipped fleet carriers , and the US air force will purchase F - 35A runway versions .
Here in Blighty , the idea is that the existing Harrier fleet , jointly operated by the Royal Navy and RAF , will be replaced by F - 35 Bs .
These will fly from the navy 's new carriers , which wo n't have arrester wires or catapults , and from shore bases as required .
In both countries and elsewhere , however , the F - 35 programme faces opposition and doubts for various different reasons .
Lockheed execs and programme officials will be hoping that the ongoing tests go as well as Mr Pearson says they will . ®

Every day I sit at my computer and open two browsers : Firefox and Internet Explorer ( first 6 , then 7 and , as of late , 8 ) .
" Why do I do that ? " I 've often asked myself .
It 's been going on for years .
I maintain two separate " browser lives , " in a sense .
Firefox opens my Yahoo and Gmail mail accounts .
Internet Explorer is aimed at my banking and stock trading accounts .
I have news sites as part of the home pages for both browsers .
One is CNN ( for my serious news ) and the other is MSN ( more for entertainment tidbits ) .
Yes , I 'm living a dual browser life , and I know I 'm not alone .
Yesterday , however , I made up my mind to drop Firefox altogether .
I wrote a chapter for my upcoming " Windows 7 Spotlight " book on Internet Explorer 8 , and I was so impressed by the features that I decided Firefox was history .
Yesterday morning , I found out that Firefox released the 3.5 beta ( 4 ) , and many features are the same as in IE8 .
And so the personal war rages on .
[ Which browser is more secure ?
InfoWorld 's Roger A. Grimes puts them to the test . ]
Where IE8 and Firefox 3.5 Are Similar
Let 's take a look at some of the features that they each have .
Obviously they both possess a multiple - tab capability .
Personally , I like that IE has a tab waiting for you to click to open .
Google Chrome has that as well .
Firefox now has a little plus sign to allow the same functionality -- a small but important improvement I 've been waiting for .
IE8 has a feature called InPrivate Browsing , which prevents IE from storing data about your browsing sessions , including cookies , temporary Internet files , history , and other data .
I 've used this mode at conferences while on kiosk machines , and it adds to my comfort level , even though I still cannot help but delete browsing history whenever I access a public machine .
Likewise , Firefox 3 has Private Browsing , which provides the same functionality and does not retain visited pages , form and search bar entries , passwords , cookies , temporary or cached Internet files , and so forth .
They both offer at least one superscary privacy - invasion tool .
In the case of IE8 , it is called Suggested Sites , where your browsing history is sent to Microsoft to compare to related Web sites ; then a link in your Favorites Bar offers " suggestions " to help you find new items .
This feature is something that many ( most ) people are not pleased about .
Microsoft said it will not store this information , but at the same time , Windows Help and Support information says that even items deleted from your browsing History " will be retained by Microsoft for a period of time to help improve our products and services . "
In Firefox , there is Location Aware Browsing ( aka geolocation ) , where Firefox takes your IP address , information about nearby wireless access points , and a temporary cookie - like identifier and passes that off to Google ( through an encrypted SSL connection , if that makes you feel any better ) so that searching in Google retrieves results that relate to your current location .
If you are searching for pizza , there 's no need to type in all the information about where you are .
That 's something else I opt out of .
What IE8 Has That 's Cool
In addition to their common items , IE8 has some cool features to make browsing and working smoother .
These include :
Accelerators , which let you do in one ( or a few ) clicks what it used to take you more clicks , often with cutting and pasting and so forth , to accomplish various tasks .
The accelerator tasks include mapping locations and translation of words .
You select the text you need and then see a little blue accelerator icon that you can click to obtain directions , a definition , or a translation ; to e-mail content ; or to search , all with a click or two -- sort of like a contextul menu .
Web slices , aka automatic feed updates .
If these are turned on , IE8 periodically checks online for updates to specific feeds , much in the same way you might check for RSS feeds for blog posts .
IE8 does n't have to be running for these online checks to occur .
A great example would be to monitor the status of a bid at eBay without having an eBay browser window always up .
Slices display in your Favorites Bar , and when the item has changed , its text becomes bold .
The new SmartScreen Filter ( an enhancement to the Phishing Filter ) and Compatibility Views , as well as cool features that combine only when working with Windows 7 , like Jump Lists and Windows Touch .
What Firefox 3.5 Promises
Firefox 3.5 beta 4 touts increased performance and stability with the new TraceMonkey JavaScript engine ( where Firefox needs to outdo Chrome and Safari ) , support for native JSON and Web worker threads , and new Web technologies like HTML5 video and audio features , all of which have developers ' mouths watering .
I 'm confident Firefox will be a solid contender to continue challenging Internet Explorer in the browser wars .
What Makes a Browser " Enterprise - Ready " ?
One important feature for enterprises is multiple language availability .
Firefox currently boasts 70 languages .
IE8 currently supports 43 , with 20 more coming in the near future .
Another key attribute is controllability by administrators : IE8 uses Microsoft 's well - entrenched group policies , a plus .
However , for Firefox , there are other ways ( some of them free , like FrontMotion 's Firefox Community Edition ) to enforce settings across your organization through ActiveDirectory using administrative templates -- similar to locking down settings with mozilla.cfg on one computer .
You might also consider FirefoxADM from Sourceforge.net or PolicyPak for Firefox and other Group Policy configuration tools .
Microsoft categorizes browsers as having either Level 1 or Level 2 support for its SharePoint server .
Microsoft recommended Level 1 browsers , which were only its own browsers ( IE6 and IE7 ) .
Level 2 support permitted only basic functionality and encompassed competing browsers such as Firefox 1.5 and Safari 2.0 .
But that 's changing .
SP2 for the Microsoft Office 2007 System , which shipped yesterday , provides official support for both IE8 and Firefox 3.0 browsers .
With SharePoint becoming a larger staple in intranets of late , this broader support is a plus for those holding back on Firefox deployments due to SharePoint .
( Similarly , Exchange 2010 Outlook Web Access also offers broader browser support for the full OWA experience , as opposed to the OWA Lite that Firefox users encountered in the past . )
In life , it may come down to what you know and like .
But in the business world , it might come down to what is easiest .
With IE8 being a part of Windows 7 , it may simply be the de facto enterprise browser because it is what people know and what administrators can count on being included and controllable without any further effort on their part .
Then again , Firefox is not all that difficult to deploy and manage these days , and it is well liked .
What will you deploy in your organization ?
Are IE8 's features compelling to retain it as the desktop browser in your enterprise , or are you ready to enter Firefox into your deployment app list ?
Deep inside Gabon 's rainforest , is a sacred place bathed in a permanent rainbow .
The breathtaking Kangou Falls have inspired awe among the local pygmy and Bantu ethnic groups for centuries .
They believe that many of their ancestors originated in these frothy pools , explains Marc Ona Essangui , an environmentalist who has been jailed for his fight to protect Gabon 's rainforest .
Ona , who has been an activist since he developed polio as a child – campaigning for disabled rights and the environment – says : " My fight is the fight of all the people concerned with the survival of the planet .
Our forest is home to the most extraordinary biodiversity .
It is also a huge natural pharmacy .
To destroy it would mean the ruin of humanity . "
Yesterday , Ona , 45 , won the Goldman environmental prize , the world 's richest prize for grassroots environmentalists , for his fight to save Gabon 's protected Ivindo national park against development .
He will share the $ 900,000 ( £ 607,000 ) prize between the winners from six continental regions .
The Ivindo park was created in 2002 to protect the Kangou Falls , as well as the forest elephants , chimpanzees and the myriad of rare plants and animals , which form the rich ecosystems of Gabon 's equatorial rainforest .
The 3,000 - square - kilometre park is part of a conservation effort by President Omar Bongo , Africa 's longest - ruling leader , who declared 11 % of the country 's territory as national parks in 2002 .
Yet , in spite of that promise , the president has backed the Chinese - led Belinga project , a controversial $ 3.5 bn iron ore mining development , which includes a mine , railroads , a deep - water port north of the capital , Libreville , and a dam on the Ivindo river at the Kangou Falls .
The project was negotiated between the government and the Chinese consortium CMEC , but affected communities were not consulted .
Ona , who is president of the NGO Brainforest and the NGOs network Environment Gabon , and his colleagues , repeatedly called for a full environmental impact assessment of the dam , arguing it would have a catastrophic impact on the forest and its villagers .
" All the villages upstream of the dam will be flooded and people displaced , " Ona told the Guardian .
" People drink the water of the river and fish in it ; they 'll lose their livelihoods .
Near the mine , the water will be polluted .
" A project of this scale in a national park could also have implications for Gabon 's wider conservation efforts , he adds .
The Gabonese forests are part of the Congo Basin rainforest , the second largest rainforest in the world after the Amazon and a vital asset in the fight against global climate change .
In July 2007 , in violation of Gabon 's Environment Code , president Bongo allowed CMEC to begin constructing a road directly through the park to the waterfalls , leaving a wide red gash that opened this once impenetrable forest to poachers .
" Before , it was almost impossible to reach the Kangou Falls .
Now there are elephants ' carcasses all over the park . "
A few months later , Ona managed to obtain a leaked copy of the Belinga contract , showing that Gabon would receive only 10 % of the mining profits while the Chinese corporation would receive a 25 - year tax break .
" The paradox is that most of Gabon 's citizens remain poor , despite the billions of dollars in revenues that are generated from the extraction of its natural resources .
Ona had the courage to ask who is really benefiting from Gabon 's resource wealth , " comments Radhika Sarin , international coordinator of the global civic society coalition Publish What You Pay .
" When we threatened to divulge the secret contract , President Bongo agreed to negotiate with us and re-evaluate the terms of the concession , " Ona says .
As a result , the area to be affected by the dam has been substantially reduced and the road through Ivindo Park has been rerouted through less of the protected area .
The president also agreed to let two representatives from Environment Gabon monitor the project .
This represents an unprecedented victory for civil society in Gabon .
Under intense public scrutiny , the government also renegotiated the contract on more favourable terms in May 2008 .
However , the Chinese bank behind the project is now questioning whether the new deal would be profitable enough , so the development is on hold .
Meanwhile , Ona is paying a heavy prize for his campaigning work .

Mike Carona ’s fall from “ America ’s Sheriff ” to convicted felon reached bottom Monday as a federal judge gave Orange County ’s former top law enforcement officer a half - hour lecture about honesty before sentencing him to 5 1/2 years in prison for attempting to obstruct a grand jury investigation .
“ I need a sheriff I can trust , ” U.S. District Judge Andrew J. Guilford told Carona .
“ Lying will not be tolerated in this courtroom , especially by the county ’s highest - ranking law enforcement officer . ”
The sentence marks the final major act in a case that shadowed the state ’s second - largest sheriff ’s office for years and changed the reputation of an ambitious lawman who moved into the national spotlight in 2002 with the search for the killer of 5 - year - old Samantha Runnion .
Back then , Carona was seen as a rising political star .
But instead , a long - running federal investigation into allegations of misconduct led to his indictment on multiple counts of corruption .
After a two - month trial , Carona was acquitted in January of five charges , but convicted of witness tampering .
The judge noted that a theme of Carona ’s campaigns for sheriff was that he would not coddle criminals .
“ What goes around , comes around , ” Guilford said .
“ There will not be any coddling here . ”
The judge also expressed disappointment about Carona ’s post - verdict celebration outside the Santa Ana courthouse after the jury verdict .
At the time , the former sheriff had described the verdict as “ an absolute miracle ” that reflected the forgiveness of God.
Carona , his family , attorneys and other supporters held a party about a week later that cost $ 3,700 at an Orange County restaurant .
The Jones Day law firm , which represented him free of charge , picked up the tab .
“ I cannot understand the unrestrained celebration and proclamations of innocence and complete vindication , ” Guilford said of the courthouse celebration .
As the judge handed down the sentence , Carona , 53 , was stoic with chin up and lips pursed .
His hands remained clasped on his lap .
During his opportunity to speak to the court , he did not address the charges and simply thanked Guilford for his courtesy and for allowing him into the courtroom to contest the case .
The judge agreed to let Carona remain free on bail until July 24 , in part so that he can attend his son ’s high school graduation .
He asked prosecutors and defense attorneys to prepare arguments about whether Carona should continue to remain free on bail pending an appeal .
In addition to the prison term , Guilford fined the former sheriff $ 125,000 .
Carona must serve 85 % of his sentence before he will be eligible for release .
After sentencing , Carona declined to comment .
Brian A. Sun , one of his attorneys , said that they respect the court ’s decision but disagree with it .
Unlike their jubilation in January , there was virtually no reaction from Carona ’s wife and friends who attended the sentencing .
During the hearing , Assistant U.S. Atty .
Brett A. Sagel argued that Carona deserved to go to prison because he had shaken the public ’s trust in law enforcement and disrupted the operations of the Orange County Sheriff ’s Department .
Prosecutors sought a nine - year sentence .
Carona has blamed everyone else for his predicament , Sagel said , including the news media , prosecutors and Don Haidl , a former assistant sheriff who was the government ’s star witness .
Defense attorneys argued for probation and community service , contending that the government had snared their client into witness tampering and that the acquittals should not be ignored .
“ This is not the usual witness tampering case , ” Sun said .
“ Mr. Carona is a flawed man -- someone who has made mistakes that have led to public exposure and humiliation the likes of which we have n’t seen and wo n’t see for some time . ”
But sentencing him to more than probation would “ just not be right , ” Sun told Guilford .
Carona ’s trial was peppered with accounts of influence peddling within his administration .
Witnesses talked about bribes handed over in cash - stuffed envelopes , hidden cameras in the sheriff ’s department and reserve badges given to supporters and those with political connections .
The testimony also exposed the raw details of his relationship with a longtime mistress , including tales of a love nest , Las Vegas getaways and secret bank accounts .
The jury acquitted Carona on charges that he misused his office to enrich himself and his associates in pursuit of hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash , bribes and gifts such as vacations , World Series tickets and Montblanc pens .
During interviews after the trial , jurors said that they believed Carona had accepted cash and gifts , but that the statute of limitations prevented them from considering many of the alleged acts .
The conviction for witness tampering relates to an August 2007 meeting between Carona and Haidl at a Newport Beach restaurant .
At the time , federal prosecutors were years into their investigation of Carona ’s administration and Haidl was cooperating by wearing a hidden microphone .
Guilford said during sentencing that he found Haidl credible .
Carona ’s attorneys argued the tapes should not have been allowed as evidence because prosecutors knew Carona was being represented by an attorney at the time .
Played repeatedly during the trial , the tapes captured a profane Carona making sexist and racist remarks .
He bragged about being the “ most lethal ” politician in Orange County and sounded far removed from the man who exuded professionalism and spoke with passion at churches and prayer breakfasts .
During one exchange , Haidl told Carona that money he had given him came from a private safe and was untraceable .
“ Well , on my end of it , completely untraceable , ” Carona said .
At other points in the tape , Carona vowed that he would deny receiving money from Haidl , and that they could track each other ’s grand jury testimony through their attorneys .
“ Your answer is my answer , ” Carona told Haidl .

Confirmation that Switzerland had suffered its first case of swine flu is big news today .
According to the Swiss federal health department , a young man recently returned from Mexico exhibited symptoms of the virus .
He is now tucked up in bed in Baden , north of Zurich , where it is hoped he will make a full recovery .
Not considered quite so newsworthy by perspiring international media infected by a global sneezing fit was the latest extreme violence in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo .
According to Human Rights
Watch , 35 civilians were killed , 91 women and girls raped , and hundreds of homes burned down in fresh reprisal attacks by Rwandan Hutu militias in North Kivu .
Additional , escalating killing is now feared in South Kivu as the Congolese army and allied militia deploy southwards , said Oxfam spokeswoman Rebecca Wynn .
At least 100,000 people have been displaced in recent weeks amid continuing atrocities by all sides .
In total , an estimated 1.4 million are homeless .
Promised UN peacekeeping reinforcements have not arrived .
The sudden surge in first world swine fever has also overshadowed the plight of millions in the Horn of Africa , principally in Somalia where a reconfigured government is struggling to survive .
Random violence , suicide attacks , kidnapping and armed robbery are daily problems facing the 3 million people currently dependent on food aid .
Over 1 million Somalis are displaced , many living in insanitary tent cities .
For them , flu is not a big issue .
A little - reported donors conference in Brussels last week coughed up $ 213 m to help equip a new Somali national security force and African Union peacekeepers .
But analysts worry the money and guns destined for the government will end up in the hands of Islamists and clan chiefs .
" As much as 80 % of [ external support to the transitional federal government ] has been diverted to private purposes , the arms market or opposition groups , " the UN's Somalia monitoring group reported in December .
Government officials and soldiers simply sell weapons to the highest bidder , thereby circumventing the UN 's 1992 arms embargo , one analyst said .
The UN report concluded : " On balance , contributions to the government security sector have represented a net source of insecurity in Somalia and an obstacle to stabilisation efforts . "
In any case , a principal reason the donors pledged so much was not civilian security .
They were motivated by another sensational , costly epidemic : Somali piracy .
The swine flu mega-story also threatens to block out Saturday 's first anniversary of Cyclone Nargis , which killed 140,000 people in Burma and caused extraordinary damage .
Thanks in large part to the callousness of the country 's military junta , an estimated 500,000 people , including 200,000 children , are still living in makeshift shelters , living from hand to mouth and still , as before , at the mercy of the elements .
Burma 's continuing misery has been compounded by the failure of international efforts to induce the generals to embrace political reform – a failure acknowledged by the EU this week when it extended limited sanctions for another year .
The Karen National Union , an opposition group , this week condemned plans for elections next year as a cruel parody .
" Internal repression is at an all - time high , army attacks against civilians continue , there are more political prisoners than at any time for 20 years , all media are censored , there is no freedom of assembly or freedom of speech , political parties are severely restricted ... and members who are not in jail face regular harassment , " it said in a statement that few seemed to hear .
For some governments , the flu frenzy makes every day a good day to bury bad news .
Political repression in China , hardly a new topic , proceeds more smoothly when the world looks elesewhere .
One example is the ongoing persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual group .
Last week , Zhang Xingwu , a retired physics professor from Shandong province , was jailed for seven years for possessing Falun Gong literature .
Human rights experts say that up to 8,000 practitioners have been detained in the past year and at least 100 have died in custody .
For others , like the Israeli and Sri Lankan governments , flu victims provide a welcome diversion from military victims .
While the Sri Lanka 's Tamil - bashing president , Mahinda Rajapaksa , seems hell - bent on turning his country into a rogue state , Israel 's army has been quietly insisting its not dissimilar operations in Gaza in January were entirely in accordance with international law .
Human Rights
Watch heaped scorn on Israel 's claims this week while the International Crisis Group warned that a " boiling " Gaza could soon explode again .
But with the world busy holding its nose and examining the contents of its handkerchief , who 's listening ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A U.S. judge set a $ 5 million bond , house detention and other conditions of bail on Wednesday for accused hedge fund manager Arthur Nadel , who authorities say was on the run for two weeks in January before the FBI arrested him .
Nadel ’s lawyer indicated that his client will not be able to meet the conditions of release set by Judge Denise Cote at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan .
The judge noted that tens of millions of dollars were still unaccounted for in the case in which investigators alleged Nadel told investors the funds he managed held more than $ 300 million when they had less than $ 1 million .
“ I do n’t think he has a million dollars , ” Nadel ’s lawyer Todd Foster said after the hearing .
“ We can come back and ask for an adjustment when the money issues are settled and the accounting is performed . ”
Nadel , 76 , is based in Sarasota , Florida , but jailed in New York where he has been charged with securities and wire fraud because he traded through a brokerage in the city .
Passionate Productions , UKTheyve got funny names for cancer researchers , like Captain Jennings and Tibbs .
Theyre also a little furry and have a tendency to lick their white - coated colleagues .
But these canine lab assistants may one day make it possible to detect cancers early enough to keep them from becoming fatal .
The Pine Street Foundation , a cancer education and research center in San Anselmo , Calif. , is hoping one day to train these dogs to sniff out , literally , early - stage ovarian cancer — a disease that kills two - thirds of the 22,000 women diagnosed with it each year , according to the American Cancer Society , because it is often caught only after it has spread beyond the ovaries .
In 2006 the foundation published a study showing it was possible to train dogs to identify , based on breath samples , which patients had lung and breast cancer .
Now the organization is recruiting ovarian cancer patients and dogs for a new study .
Nicholas Broffman , executive director of the foundation , says the dogs are helping to answer an important question that may one day lead to earlier detection of diseases like ovarian and pancreatic cancers , which are often caught only in very late stages :
Does cancer have a smell ?

Does cancer have a smell ?
" Is there something about the breath of people with cancer that is different in people who do not have cancer ? "
Broffman wants to know .
" Our goal is to identify what collection of molecules in the breath are unique to ovarian cancer , pancreatic cancer , and lung cancer , and develop a test to find those . "
Using animals to detect disease is not new , and this line of research is not as out there as it may sound .
The African pouched rat has been trained to detect tuberculosis in Petri dishes .
By some accounts , they are better and more efficient at spotting the disease in tissue samples than other conventional methods in the developing world .
( Watch a YouTube video of the pouch rats at work . )
Diabetes is detectable , too
Dogs , which have been used for decades as aides for the blind or hearing impaired and as companions for the infirm , have also taken new roles in alerting epileptics to impending seizures and diabetics to low blood sugar .
A few dozen miles east of the Pine Street Foundation , in Concord , Calif. , Mark Ruefenacht , who runs Dogs4 Diabetics , says the link between a dog's smell and its ability to detect hypoglycemia is well - established .
He 's been training dogs for 10 years to pick up the scent of diabetics on the verge of hypoglycemia .
" We do n't know the complete science here , but when blood sugar starts to drop , the body starts to kick out chemicals in the breath , sweat , whatever , " Ruefenacht says .
" Those chemicals indicate a change .
The dogs can pick that up .
Low blood sugar has a smell ; high blood sugar has a smell ; even the rapid change in blood sugar has a smell . "
In diabetics , the presence of ketones — substances produced by the body as it breaks down fat for energy — can be smelled in urine and on the breath when blood sugars are high .
Dogs , Ruefenacht says , can pick up on other smells that humans can't when glucose levels drop .
These chemical scents are what scientists at the Pine Street Foundation and the University of Maine , which is helping in the ovarian cancer study , hope to identify for ovarian cancer .
The research is still in its infancy , but researchers are clearly excited about the potential — and theyre not alone .
In a case study published in The Irish Journal of Medical Sciences last year , researchers claimed that a family pet had recognized hypoglycemia in an elderly man who had never been diagnosed with diabetes .
" Dogs have a sense of smell far superior to humans , " says study coauthor Mortimer O'Connor , MD , of Victory University Hospital in Cork , Ireland .
Smell is just one way dogs may detect a condition change like low blood sugar , O'Connor says ; he also suggests that they may taste a difference on a person 's skin or sense changes in the electric or magnetic energy the body emits .

Looking toward the future
Scientists may be years from identifying the specific biomarkers that distinguish the breath of people with cancer from those without , cautions Broffman — and years more from being able to distinguish one type of cancer , such as ovarian , from another .
Even further in the future : Developing a mechanical device that can sense those biomarkers when someone breathes into it .
" It would be great to have a Breathalyzer - type machine that could do this , " Broffman says .
" Our goal is to identify what collection of molecules are unique to ovarian cancer , pancreatic cancer , or lung cancer , and can we develop a test to find those .
Scientifically , this is very difficult . "
That 's because this wouldnt require just detecting one molecule — which is difficult enough — but a range of molecules , Broffman says .
“ Together , these molecules smell like cancer .
When we smell a rose , we 're not smelling individual rose molecules , but our brain puts all the molecules together and says , ' OK , that 's a rose . ' "
For a computer to accomplish that level of pattern recognition , Broffman says , the patterns have to be extremely well - defined .
" This is the challenge , scientifically .
This may why we never replace dogs .
Maybe dogs will be always be better at this . "
Dogs can detect scents as small as one part per trillion — or the equivalent of a drop of ink in an Olympic - sized swimming pool , Broffman says .
" No scent detection device on the planet that can come close to that . "
Them and us child register : Politicians and celebrities can keep their details off a controversial new database
Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti says there are serious security doubts about the Government 's child register
Tens of thousands of politicians , celebrities and local bigwigs will be able to keep their addresses and details about their families off the Government 's new children 's database , it was revealed yesterday .
They will be allowed to withdraw everything but their children 's names , sex and ages from the controversial computer record .
Powerful and influential parents who believe they will be in danger from others who may be ' hostile ' will have their details struck off the ContactPoint database along with domestic violence victims and those in witness protection programmes .
But the great majority of ordinary families will be compelled to display their contact details alongside information about their children and their schools , doctors and social workers .
News of the ' get - out ' clause will only add to the anger and suspicion that has greeted the £ 224 million project .
It has already has been hit by a string of delays over concerns over the security of the highly sensitive data it holds .
Ministers released details about the numbers likely to be able to take advantage of the ' get - out ' rules as they launched the database .
Officials estimate that hundreds of parents in each local authority will be included in a ' shielding ' system which will limit information about them on ContactPoint because they are judged to be 'at risk of significant harm ' .
Across all the 150 town halls that will run the database , that adds up to at least 50,000 .
The scale of the get - out provoked further concerns about the security of the database .
Nearly 400,000 individuals will be able to look at information on ContactPoint , including council staff , health workers , police officers , and even staff of voluntary groups and charities who have passed criminal records checks .
Jill Kirby of the centre - right think tank Centre for Policy Studies said : ' This is a clear admission by the Government that ContactPoint will not be secure .
' It is not surprising that public figures will not want their addresses or details about their children on it .
But why should they have different rules from the rest of us ? '
According to the Department for Children , Schools and Families , ' some people may need to have some of their details hidden to prevent their location being identified ' .
Anyone who wants their address kept off the database must apply to their local council .
Town hall officials will then make a choice based on national guidelines .
Some authorities have published their rules on shielding .
Somerset , for example , has said that shielding ' may be appropriate where a parent / carer whose child 's record appears on ContactPoint may be at risk were the address to become known to ... a hostile adult ' .
Opposition MP Michael
Gove says the controversial database must be scrapped
It acknowledges that some members of the public who have no involvement with police or social workers and whose children have no illnesses , injuries or school problems ' will wish to apply for their child 's case to be shielded ' .
The county guidelines add : ' this may include celebrities , politicians and other high profile members of the public ' .
Council officials may also be able to escape seeing their addresses listed on the database if there are special circumstances , for example if the worker concerned is going through a difficult divorce .
Opposition politicians said ContactPoint must be scrapped .
Tory children 's spokesman Michael Gove said : ' This will look like MPs are yet again creating one rule for themselves and one for everyone else .
Creating more bureaucracy with sensitive information accessible to millions of people will do nothing to improve child protection . '
Liberal Democrat children 's spokesman David Laws said : ' The fact that celebrities and politicians can have their children 's records shielded will hardly inspire confidence among other parents . '
Shami Chakrabarti of the Liberty pressure group said : ' If you feel you need to shield one group of children , it throws doubt over everyone 's security .
Every child should be shielded from this database . '
Henry Porter of the Convention on Modern Liberty said : ' This gives the lie to every claim they make about security .
It is going to be insecure .
' We have a government that wants to track our every move , store and share our data , fingerprint our children , retain our DNA , hack our computers , log every email internet connection and phone call . '
Ministers say ContactPoint will help teachers , doctors , police officers and social workers find out rapidly whether other organisations have involvement with a child .
A spokesman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families said : ' All ContactPoint records are extremely secure whether or not they are shielded . '
Decisions on shielding ' will be taken on a case by case basis ' .
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
Courtesy Global GrindHip - hop mogul Russell Simmons is the co-founder of Def Jam Records , a sometime reality star , and an entrepreneur who ’s launched a number of successful ventures including clothing lines Phat Farm and Baby Phat .
He ’s also a yoga - practicing vegan who ’s hoping to use his resources to make change in the world of hip - hop — and the world at large .
Describing himself as “ hip - hop to the bone , ” Simmons is quick to hail the power of that community in influencing politics , pointing to a recent change in drug policy in New York State .
“ That was because Jay - Z and Puffy and Rev Run and LL Cool J and many other people came out to rally , ” he says .
“ A lot of politicians joined them , but the artists made the noise and created the energy and made the change . ”
Simmons has high hopes for rallying that same energy in the fight against climate change — an issue , he admits , the community has yet to truly embrace .
But he ’s harnessing more than the power of lyrics and videos to get the message out .
He ’s recently given birth to a new - media company called Global Grind — a hip - hop HuffPo , if you will — featuring news stories , video clips , and celeb blog posts on topics ranging from music and entertainment to “ politricks . ”
Simmons has also taken on the role of spokesperson for the America ’s Greenest Campus campaign , an effort to get college students ( a key hip - hop demographic ) to reduce their carbon footprint .
The contest runs through October and offers prizes to the school with the most participants , the school with the largest percentage of carbon emissions reduced , and the creator of an online ad for sponsor SmartPower .
During a recent phone call — and between bites of a Gardenburger - topped salad garnished with both salad dressing and ketchup ( a combination his staff poked fun at , he says ) —
Simmons talked about his commitment to reducing his own footprint , the brand power of hip - hop , and the importance of well - informed consumers .
Q. Tell me about the America ’s Greenest Campus contest .
Why have you signed on to help publicize this campaign ?
A . The hip - hop community has not been as concerned about the environment as they could be , so if I can loan my voice and my resources … into growing it very quickly , then I believe that companies can create more awareness on this subject .
It ’s something that I ’m very committed to , so I want to tie this educational vehicle , Global Grind , directly to this “ America ’s Greenest Campus ” idea , and I want to see how I can help others to lighten their footprint .
Q . What role can young people play in helping change the way we think about climate change in this country ?
A. [ This campaign ] is an educational tool and an empowerment vehicle .
People do n’t understand what it is to lighten their footprint , what steps to take .
So if we give them the simple steps and we tell them exactly how much it affects the environment if they make certain changes — being a vegetarian , doing other things that make a dramatic difference in how much weight they carry in the world — people want to know that .
When they realize that by changing simple things they can make a difference , it ’s an empowerment vehicle .

You ’ve said that you used to live a life of overconsumption and abundance — how have your priorities changed over time ?
A . One thing is that I ’m an animal activist .
I felt very disturbed about the way humanity treats its species on this planet .
It was a spiritual matter , and it was not connected , at first , to the environment .
And then when I found out that your footprint is so much heavier because you eat animals — that ’s [ a bigger ] cause of global warming … than all forms of transportation put together — it became a part of my discussion when I was trying to get people to stop eating animals and abusing themselves by eating them .
I did n’t realize how much they were abusing the planet as well .
Q. Hip - hop culture definitely trumpets a life of luxury and overconsumption , and that message is going straight to the youth , so it feels a little bit contradictory to say “ hey , green your campus , lessen your footprint ” but also be telling them “ have the pimpest car and the blingiest bling ” —
A. I ’m going to interrupt you .
First of all , the abuse comes from the top down .
The president ’s flying around in a private plane .
Stop playin’ !
Everybody ’s abusive and every channel ’s abusing us …
All the people pointing the finger at hip - hop need to point at themselves .
If hip - hop decides to buy something that ’s popular in culture and talk about it , that certainly does n’t make them more abusive .
They ’re more conscious , not less .
They ’re less homophobic , not more .
They ’re less violent , not more .
They ’re less racist , not more .
But it ’s wrong [ to say that ] in general , they ’re less concerned .
I will say that it is a community that needs to be enlightened more .
But that ’s not the issue — their mission of getting ahead .
That ’s a mission America sends on every network , in every promotion , on every channel , and every commercial .
Because they sing about the things that people buy ?
I think that ’s a reflection of us .
They are reflections of us , and our dirt is coming right out of their mouths …
Q . Do you think the hip - hop community can lead the charge to help shepherd these changes ?
A . You ’ve gotta hope so , because the biz is depending on hip - hop to pick which color diamond is popular .
The only way [ the Maybach ] beats Phantom Rolls Royce is to get rappers to choose it .
Tommy Hilfiger ’s praying that hip - hop discovers him again .
So is Coca - Cola ; [ they ’re ] worried what hip - hop says versus Pepsi .
We need them ; they ’re the best brand - building community in the world .
If we can get a large number of hip - hoppers to take this on , then they will have a greater impact in lots of forms of media .
Q . Are there any artists in particular who have taken on this cause ?
A. I do n’t have a rapper that I can point to the way I can point to Leonardo DiCaprio .
But I ’m going to work now as an individual , and I ’m trying to find some leaders in the community who can make a huge difference .
Q . Have you done any work to move along environmental changes in the music industry — or have you seen any promising changes in the way the industry is run ?
A. I do n’t know that they ’ve done a lot of work yet .
The reason I signed on [ to this campaign ] is because I felt they were not serving this initiative .
They work on many things that are social and political , but this has not been one .
It ’s not been on the forefront in their minds , and that ’s why I ’m trying to make a difference now by joining on .
I ’m not joining on because they have a lot of hip - hoppers involved in the environmental movement .
I ’m joining on because they do n’t , and I think that we can put it in their face and they ’re conscious people and a lot of them will join .
Q. What about your clothing lines ?
Have you made moves to ensure they have minimal impact on the earth ?
Not as much as I should .
It ’s something we ’ve talked about a lot .
In fact , we had a discussion about making a lot of organic cotton for Wal - Mart yesterday .
Q. What ’s holding you back on that front ?
What needs to happen so that it makes sense from a business point of view ?
A . You have to get customers to value it .
Some of these choices we want to make — in order for us to be competitive and still make a difference , we have to be profitable .
There is a resistance on the part of some consumers that is making it more difficult .
We have to promote the value of organic choices to the consumers …
We ’re working on it .
It ’s a marketing exercise .
Q . Do you feel it ’s your role as a public figure to use your status to promote change ?
A. I try to go to work every day and make sure my businesses have a light footprint in every area .
I stopped my licensees a long time ago from making fur ; my new companies are not making leather .
I ’m trying , you know ?
I try to every day do a little better , but that ’s for me to sleep at night .
If you live by example , if you speak in a way that people can digest it and see the value in it , then you can get people to join in .
I know that as [ people ] learn to do better , they do better , they feel better , and they sleep better as a result of making a good choice .

From the Desk of Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton :
Strike Three … Obama ’s Third Commerce Secretary Nominee Has Corrupt Ties to Chinagate
This is all starting to get a little ridiculous .
Obama ’s first pick for Commerce Secretary , Bill Richardson , had to withdraw his name when it was discovered that he was the subject of a federal grand jury investigation concerning influence peddling .
Obama ’s second choice , New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg , first accepted and then rejected the nomination , citing irreconcilable policy differences ( which included Gregg ’s objecting to the politicization of the Census by the Obama White House ) .
Next up : Former Washington Democratic Governor Gary Locke .
So is the third time the charm for the president ?
Or , as columnist Michelle Malkin put it , " Is it possible for Barack Obama to pick a Commerce Secretary nominee who ’ll actually make it past first base ? "
Locke may in the end get the votes he needs but he is a horrible choice for such a sensitive post .
Allow me explain .
Remember the Chinagate scandal , where the Clintons and the Democratic National Committee raised gobs of cash from communist Chinese operatives ?
( This is perhaps the worst fundraising scandal in U.S. history , and Judicial Watch was one of the first to get on top of it .
Check out the first three related lawsuits listed on this page . )
Well , the Clinton Chinagate scheme had a focus in the Clinton Commerce Department .
One of the key figures in Chinagate is none other than former Clinton Commerce official and DNC fundraiser John Huang .
You may recall , when deposed by Judicial Watch in its Chinagate litigation , Huang took the fifth more than 2,000 times in connection to the scheme , although he did eventually plead guilty to violations of campaign finance laws .
In the midst of violating all those campaign finance laws in the 1990s , Huang also found time to raise money for another key Democratic rising star , Gary Locke .
Huang personally stroked a $ 1,000 check for Locke and also co-sponsored fundraising events that netted $ 30,000 in 1996 alone .
Of course , when criticized for his connections to Huang , Locke quickly yanked out the race card .
( Liberals always seem to have the " race card " handy in their breast pocket , do n’t they ? )
In 1999 , Locke told a group of Asian American journalists that the Chinagate scandal will have a negative impact on Asian Americans seeking top - level appointments in the U.S. Government .
" If they have any connection to John Huang , " Locke lamented , " those individuals will face greater scrutiny and their lives will be completely opened up and examined – perhaps more than usual . "
We can only hope .
There is little doubt that there was a plan by the Chinese Communist government to influence our politics with campaign cash .

Federal Government Meddles in Corporate Takeover
Not that there was ever any doubt the federal government has used the financial crisis to interfere in the private sector and expand its power and influence , but new documents uncovered by Judicial Watch illustrate just how meddlesome the feds can be .
According to CNBC :
Negotiations to have JP Morgan take over Bear Stearns in March of 2008 produced an avalanche of emails from government officials .
Worried that the collapse of Bear would trigger a world wide domino effect , the Federal Reserve and Treasury urged JP Morgan to take over Bear .
The Fed went on to approve a $ 30 billion credit line to JPM to make the deal go through .
The deal was formally announced on March 17 , 2008 .
The emails here are correspondence between Fed and Treasury officials over the weekend of March 14 through the 16 , 2008 .
They are a result of a Freedom of Information ( FOIA ) request by the group Judicial Watch .
Some of the names mentioned in these emails , which can be read their entirety here , include former President George Bush , former Treasury Secretary Paulson and current Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner .
Judicial
Watch ’s main goal with respect to the financial crisis is to make sure all government activities are completely transparent to the American people , especially now that the Obama administration plans to spend trillions more than first estimated on additional bailouts .
( Bloomberg puts the total cost of the bailout at $ 8.5 trillion , which is a far cry from the $ 250 billion first proposed last fall . )
Of course , government officials would rather we all just go about our business and trust them to preside over the deal - making and fund disbursement .
But since they ’re the ones who helped get us into this mess we think it ’s wise to keep an eye on them .
So instead of looking the other way , we ’re going to scrap to get our hands on documents related to the government ’s dealings in the financial crisis .
Along these lines , as I told you few weeks ago , on January 26 , 2009 , Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department , seeking all records related to a meeting Paulson held with top bank officials on October 13 , 2008 , as the financial crisis was just getting started .
During that meeting Paulson reportedly offered bank executives a deal they could not refuse , which certainly raised our eyebrows and our suspicions .
We filed a FOIA immediately , and sued when the government stonewalled .
Incredibly , the Treasury Department now says there are no responsive documents !
One of the most important meetings at Treasury in the past decade and there are no related documents ?
I simply do n’t believe it .
Stay tuned .
With federal government power over the private sector increasing at an alarming rate , there is great potential for mischief .
Judicial Watch will continue to investigate .
California Court Scandal Continues
How ’s this for irony ?
California judges angered by a California court ruling in a Judicial Watch lawsuit recently persuaded lawmakers to create a new law that effectively invalidated the ruling !
The new deal will allow these judges to accumulate millions of dollars annually in benefits and perks from Los Angeles County that they already receive from the state .
Here ’s the scoop according to the February 20 , 2009 , edition of Cal Law :
After five round - the - clock days of legislative horse trading and stalemates , California ’s judicial leaders scored two key political victories Thursday as state lawmakers finally closed a $ 40 billion budget deficit .
Among the three - dozen bills legislators sent to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s desk to handle the shortfall was language that lets counties continue paying extra benefits to local judges .
Proponents say that bill effectively overturns a 4th District ruling from October finding that only the state , not counties , can set compensation levels for judges …
… Judges ’ campaign to keep their extra benefits was a bold move at a time when state leaders were drafting deep cuts to education and social services programs .
Bold does n’t quite capture it .
This " double dipping " by trial court judges costs Los Angeles County taxpayers $ 20 million per year .
And , again , these are benefits they already receive from state coffers , which is why the court ruled in our favor last October .
Let me give you just one example .
Even though judges receive a full benefits package from the state , Los Angeles County also provides each judge $ 27,324 annually in cash allowances to purchase on a pre-tax basis additional health , life , disability and other benefits .
Given that there are no requirements as to how the money must be spent , judges may either purchase the benefits or keep the cash allowance as taxable income .
( The total cost of duplicate benefits for each judge is estimated to be $ 46,000 . )
This latest piece of legislation , called the " Sturgeon fix bill " because it intends to overturn the victorious Judicial Watch lawsuit , Sturgeon v. County of Los Angeles .
Correct me if I ’m wrong .
But are n’t judges supposed to be interpreting the law , not paying big bucks to lobby a legislature to pass laws that benefit them ?
We ’re still evaluating how any new law might affect our lawsuit ( or whether new law is , in fact , constitutional ) .
In the meantime , our lawsuit continues – and with more outrageous moves by the court .
The Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles ( " State Court " ) , using a big name private law firm , recently sought to intervene as a defendant in our Sturgeon lawsuit .
This is extraordinary and , frankly , beyond the lawful powers of the court .
To give you a sense of the impropriety of this latest action , I ’ll quote from our brief opposing the move :
If the State Court is allowed to intervene , the State Court would be litigating a matter before the State Court … the State Court ’s intervention would create an irreconcilable conflict , as the litigation would be pending in the State Court , who would be a party .
Plaintiff strongly objects to having the State Court consider whether the State Court should be allowed to intervene in a matter pending before the State Court .
If this does n’t give you a sense that the court is out of control , I do n’t know what would .
You can be sure we ’re going to fight this judicial fix on behalf of California taxpayers .
Until next week …

The human population is reaching such proportions it is feared that it will exceed the capacity of the planet to sustain it .
More than 80 per cent of the human population is in developing countries .
Population growth is also concentrated there .
Of more than 90 m people who engross the human population every year , about 90 per cent is expected to live in developing countries .
The problem seems clearly to be in the developing world .
According to present tendencies , by 2050 the human population would reach 9,000 million , of which 7,500 million would live in developing countries .
The population increase implies additional demands on natural resources and ecosystems , which in turn would magnify the environmental and social degradation affecting humanity today .
The solution is then to control , through whatever means possible , the population of these countries .
The massive and free flow of contraceptives , mass sterilization , cultural disruption , and even genocide has been proposed to achieve this goal .
All in the name of the environment and " sustainable development " .
However , most of these arguments , as well as most of the proposed solutions , are only a reflection of the ignorance , racism and prejudice that permeate the debate on population and the environment .
Some effective measures against population growth in developing countries have been rhetorically supported in international negotiations , such as badly needed improvements in education , health care and nutrition ; the creation of productive jobs ; the diversification of economic output , and the export of processed or semi-processed products instead of raw materials .
But in practice , such measures have been taken with a considerable dosage of apprehension .
It has been argued that they would imply improved standards of living for the people affected .
This might in turn lead to higher levels of consumption of resources , as well as to the production of larger amounts of waste and pollutants .
The environmental argument has thus been used to strengthen the already mighty interest in avoiding any disruption of the established international economic order .
The result has been a dramatic collapse of education , health and nutrition indicators throughout Latin America and other developing regions in the last 20 years ; the massive growth of unemployment ; further dependence on the export of raw materials , and growing masses of people living in extreme poverty .
In the meantime , the gap between the standard of living of industrial and developing countries has reached staggering proportions .
The main impact of people on the environment is related to two fundamental variables :
The consumption of resources
The production of waste and pollutants
In the year 2000 there were approximately six billion people on the planet , 21 per cent in industrial countries , and the remaining 79 per cent in developing countries .
Nevertheless , industrial countries accounted for nearly 80 per cent of all resources consumed .
They were also responsible for the production of nearly 80 per cent of all waste and pollutants .
If we were to measure the environmental impact of human population with a uniform yardstick , such as the amount of resources consumed by the average person in developing countries , or the amount of waste and pollutants produced by the same average person , we would then conclude that while in 2000 there were 4.7 billion people in developing countries , the population - equivalent of industrial countries would amount to 19 billion people .
From the point of view of environmental impact , where is then the real population problem ?
If we consider the long history of slavery , abuse , exploitation and misery that , for centuries , have been imposed on developing countries by the main industrial nations , we could conclude in a gigantic environmental , economic and social debt , with which industrial countries have so far got away with .
The unsustainable growth of the population of developing countries is closely related to the extreme levels of poverty they must endure , partly a consequence of the established international economic order , designed by industrial nations at Bretton Woods to enhance their own interests , and then imposed upon the rest of the world .
Environmental devastation is related to international economic and political relationships .
Developing countries must play the role of exporters of ever - larger amounts of ever - cheaper raw materials [ natural resources ] , to maintain the industrial output and wealth of the " North " .
The depletion of resources , and the environmental and social costs involved , are deliberately ignored by the established economic system .
Developing countries are the most affected by the growing social and environmental damages derived from decades of imposition of the established international economic order .
Most of their economies are based on the ruthless exploitation of both people and natural resources , to feed industrial processes mainly driven by industrial nations .
Nearly three quarters of all people in developing countries are already below the poverty line .
Over 14 million children , under the age of 5 , die each year from hunger , thirst , malnutrition , or from easily curable or preventable diseases .
An average of 26 children per minute .
At the same time , nearly 14 million hectares of natural tropical forests are destroyed every year , also in tropical developing countries .
A massive and irreversible destruction , mainly due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier , in order to accommodate growing numbers of people in extreme poverty , practicing survival agriculture .
The growing numbers of people involved are not only due to the increase in population .
It is mainly driven by rampant unemployment and a dramatic economic impoverishment .
Nearly 70 per cent of the accumulated emissions of carbon dioxide in the last 50 years have come from the excessive consumption of energy of industrial countries .
Carbon dioxide emissions are among the main culprits of global warming , now threatening the stability of people and ecological processes all over the world , particularly in tropical developing countries .
Population growth is certainly one of the key problems facing developing countries .
Decisive and effective action is necessary to address it , with due respect for the cultural , ethical and religious differences between diverse sectors of humanity .
The lack of democratic processes of governance , and the profound social inequalities evident in most developing countries , are part of the array of issues where fundamental changes are required .
But the population dilemma should not be isolated from the political and economic context it which it has thrived .
The perception of population growth in developing countries as the culprit of worldwide environmental damage is a fallacy that deserves to be eradicated .
It is , nevertheless , at the very bottom of foreign policies in most industrial nations , as part of the overall attempt to preserve the established international economic order , regardless of how profoundly unfair it may be to the majority of the human race .

Most companies with any sort of IT infrastructure have got some sort of disaster recovery plan .
Whether it be a set of tapes or CD ’s or a redundant data centre , the idea of losing the company accounts on a hard drive that has become a paperweight is something that keeps IT managers awake at night .
Fortunately , the total disaster is somewhat rare , and tails of data loss tend to have happy endings , but not always .
Here are five calamities that have befallen poor hairless IT staff , and a few tips for those nervous about loosing their data .
( 1 ) . HMRC
To prove the far reaching and broad scope of data loss , you can not get much worse than our own HM Government .
The loss of 25 Million child benefit records goes to show that your data needs not only to be secure in your data centres , but outside them as well .
On the 18th of October 2007 , a junior official downloaded the records on to a CD at HMRC in the north east UK , and posted them to the National Audit Office in London .
The CD never arrived .
The CD contained names , bank account details , NI numbers , and addresses of people who were in receipt of child benefit .
The CD was password protected , but not encrypted , and the data was vulnerable .
The loss was so bad the Revenue and Customs chairman Paul Gray resigned , we even got an apology from Gordon Brown .
Fancy that .
( 2 ) . The Alaska Department of Revenue .
Einstein once said , that there were two things that were infinite .
One was the universe , the other is human stupidity , and he was n’t sure about the former .
The next tail is about a technician at the Alaska Department of Revenue who managed to wipe out an account worth $ 38 billion .
This poor chap reformatted a disk on the computer housing the data , and then managed to reformat the backup disk as well , deleting applicant information for an oil - funded account .
There was no panic however , as they turned to the backup tapes , only to find that they too were unreadable .
Consultants from Microsoft and Dell were called in to retrieve the data , but the nightmare was there to stay .
Nine months worth of applicant information for the yearly payout from the Alaska Permanent Fund was gone .
( 3 ) . Journalspace.com
Data loss does not just stem from hardware failure .
There is always the jilted ex-employee to worry about as well .
Blogging platform Journalspace.com discovered this to their peril when an ex-employee overwrote the database .
The decision was made by this fellow that RAID was the only backup that they would need , and indeed , their HTTP server managed to last the distance , but their SQL server lost the lot .
The consequence of these actions was that Journalspace went out like a light , and many people lost their posts and personal data .
The silver lining to all of this was that some of the posts were recoverable from the Google cache .
Happy days for those who had their posts readable by the Google bot , but not for those who had posts set to private .
( 4 ) . TK Maxx
The next example of data loss goes to the dark and murky world of the computer hacker .
As those who shopped at TK Maxx in 2003 – 2004 may testify .
In 2007 , hackers got away with 45.7 million debit and credit card details over an 18 month period .
The hackers were also able to get their mitts on 451,000 records containing names addresses and even driving licence details from people who had returned goods without a receipt .
The data related to transactions made between 2003 and 2004 , and the company warned that customers should be checking their bank statements for any unusual activity .
The hackers used a technique called War Driving .
War Driving is the act of driving around looking for wireless networks with weak , or no encryption .
Once such a network has been discovered , the attacker can “ sniff ” or intercept the data that is transmitted and save it to look at later .
Because of the week encryption , the initial hack was not particularly difficult , and is possible with freely downloadable software .
( 5 ) . AOL
My last example of data loss is the enemy within .
In 2004 a 24 year old software engineer at AOL managed to steal 92 million email addresses that he later sold to spammers .
The addresses were used to send millions of unsolicited emails peddling plonker enhancement pills to the masses .
Jason Smathers was also able to get his hands on other AOL member information , including telephone numbers , and Zip codes .
Smathers was eventually caught , after an informant tipped off the authorities and was arrested in his home .
Investigators uncovered instant messages and emails sent from Smathers ’ computer that alluded to the sale of the stolen data .
Though this type of data loss can be negated with checks and balances , it is still vulnerable to anyone who has access to the data .
Even if you stop email and block up all the USB ports and DVD drives , the most cunning hacker can still use the most sly tool they have , the paper and pencil .
So what can we do to help stem the tide of leaking and disappearing data ?
Well
In the case of human stupidity , we have little hope of finding a cure , but there are more practical things we can do .
For example , both TK Maxx , and HM Government could both have done with better encryption , and any encryption respectively .
In TK Maxx ’s case , and in the case of many people , stop using WEP .
The problem being it ’s weak .
Move on to WPA or WPA2 .
Both of which offer substantially better protection for your wireless LAN than WEP does .
Also choose a good password , or even a passphrase .
In the case of a password , use at least 14 random characters for super security .
For sending extremely sensitive data out of the data centre , first , try using registered post , then apply encryption .
Encrypting data need not be difficult , and for company ’s there are many products on the market that can encrypt data so that it would take a supercomputer millennia to decipher .
Encryption is not just for those who can afford it either , there are free utility ’s like GnuPG , based on Philip Zimmermans PGP , that will do the honours splendidly .
Backups , backups , and more backups are all very well and good , but if that data is wiped by someone who has a version of typing tourettes , and can only knows the command “ format C : ” , then perhaps off site backups are the answer .
There are many services out there like Dropbox , Data Backup Technology , Mozy etc. that can take care of those precious accounts for you , and restore them in case of human error .
Data theft from within the company is a little harder to nail down .
Products are available that disallow the use of removable media , like CDs and USB sticks .
Some software ( like sophos ) will also enforce encryption on USB hard drives and other types of removable media so that your civil servants employees will not leave readable data on trains and in taxis .
It is also important to educate staff as to why giving their password away for a Creme Egg may be dangerous .
There are many threats that may compromise our data , but with a little common sense , most of them can be avioded .
Perhaps if there is anyone with a tail of data loss woe , they could share it with us below .
No prizes for the most data lost though !

To whom it may concern :
I have been a customer of Bank of America since October 2006 .
In that time I have maintained , in good faith , a checking account , a savings account , an investment account and two credit card accounts .
This letter is to inform you that I am displeased with the service I ’ve received from BOA and will no longer be doing business with you .
It has become evident to me that in light of BOA ’s irresponsible and abusive overdraft and credit card policies and their associated fees which are in direct opposition to your customer ’s wishes and in light of your dishonesty regarding your concern for your customers ’ welfare and in light of the moral hazard that you ’ve accepted in receiving constitutionally illegal appropriations from the federal government to the tune of some $ 150 billion and in light of your breach of our good faith contract to provide me the understood banking services in a reasonable and professional manner , I find BOA to be a disreputable organization and have chosen to no longer do business with you .
As of today , I have an outstanding negative balance in my checking account of $ 440 as well as two outstanding balances on my credit cards totaling approximately $ 7,800 .
I consider my debt to BOA to be paid in full by BOA for the following reason : from information I could find on the Internet BOA has a U.S. consumer base of some $ 29 million .
I calculated my share of the bailout funds allocated to BOA then to be approximately $ 5200 .
This is money I ’ve already given to BOA from my federal tax allowances .
Now this is just a loan understand .
BOA is responsible for paying this money back in full and with interest , to me .
Since the federal government made this loan without the constitutional authority to do so and with my money I would like to inform BOA of my terms of agreement which are in addition to whatever TOA you might already have with the feds .
The loan origination fee is $ 440 .
I will start you out with an introductory rate of 10 % APR .
I reserve the right , however , to change this rate at any time and without notification .
Like right now .
It just went up to 15 % .
See how that works ?
Now as you make repayments to the federal government I will calculate my share of those repayments and apply my entire share to your calculated accrued interest for the year first before I apply any of it to the principle .
BTW , your APR just increased to 20 % .
This is in the best interest of BOA so that if you have other loan payments to make , you wo n’t be overburdened by unmanageable principle payments to me .
Of course the juice will continue to run on your principle .
Furthermore , since you ’ve been shown to be financially insolvent and on the verge of bankruptcy requiring a bailout from your customers , I ’m afraid I ’m going to have to cut off your line of credit from me at $ 5200 but of course I ’ll continue to calculate the accrued interest and expect you to pay it in full .
In the case that the federal government decides to loan you additional bailout funds even though your credit with me has been canceled , you will then exceed your available credit limit with me and I will assess BOA an “ over the credit limit ” fee in the amount of $ 1000 .
Unfortunately , there is nothing you can do about this fee as it is my lending policy .
I should also inform you that there is a penalty for early repayment of $ 1000 .
So to formalize our contract : you currently owe me $ 5200 at an APR of 40 % ( another increase ) for the fiscal year 2009 .
This calculates to an annual interest payment of $ 2080 .
Any outstanding principle remaining after fiscal year 2009 , along with over the limit fees , will accrue interest at an APR of your current APR + 10 % .
If you pay your loan off in full in 2009 at the current annual interest rate of 50 % ( did it again ) then you ’ll owe me a total of : $ 7800 which along with my loan origination fee settles your debt with me and hence my debt with you , assuming you do n’t exceed your available credit limit .
In this case please post a check for $ 1000 to the last known address you have for me .
Since the feds loaned you my money without discussing it with me , this TOA is implicitly accepted by you and must be honored .
I realize that some of my terms might seem excessive but trust me : it ’s in your best interest .
I get nothing out of this .
If you have any questions regarding your loan or the TOA , who gives a s__t ?
But if you do feel the need to speak with an impersonal , automated , touch - tone , menu - driven customer service system followed by an impersonal , auto - programmed , mono - tone , policy - driven , lobotomized , carbon based unit , then dial : 800-432-1000 and enjoy .

Finally , a Republican stood up to Rush Limbaugh and that Republican was Rep. Ron Paul on MSNBC ’s 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. with David Shuster .
Paul said that he really does n’t think about Rush Limbaugh and that Republicans should not be terrified of the talk show host .
Here is the video :

Host David Shuster asked Ron Paul if he wanted Obama to fail .
Paul replied , “ No , I do n’t even think about in those terms .
I want nobody to have credibility on bad ideas … I take it out of the context of personalities .
I think the personalities are irrelevant .
It is only the issues that count .
It is only the ideas that count .
It is only our philosophy that counts . ”
Paul would n’t say that Limbaugh was wrong , but he did say , “ I do n’t even think about him . ”
Paul said he supports
Obama ’s goals , but not his policies , which is a fair position to take .
Paul said he would like to ask Rush does n’t support civil rights and Paul ’s position on the Federal Reserve .
Paul said , “ I was disappointed with Rush because he is a good conservative , yet he never said hardly boo against George Bush .
He supported all that big spending .
Did he complain about all those wars that were going on that caused us so much trouble ? ”
Dr. Paul also said that Rush Limbaugh is n’t the head of the GOP .
Paul said Rush is very influential , but Republicans should n’t be terrified of him .
Paul said the GOP is having personality conflicts because they are n’t talking about the real problems and why they lost .
It was nice to hear from an actual conservative .
I disagree with Ron Paul on lots of things , but the GOP would be wise to listen to what he is saying here .
Rep .
Paul did n’t fall into the personalities trap , but he also did a great job of explaining why this is going on .
Host David Shuster tried to get Paul to play the game , but to his credit he rolled with the punches and let the Texas Republican get into some other areas .
This was one of the few interviews where Paul was allowed to freely speak .
I think Paul ’s conservative criticism of Limbaugh is spot on , and I think that until many other Republicans have the courage to see Rush for what he really is , this distraction will continue to weigh down their attempt to get their act together .
I noticed recently that the Proceedings for the 2008 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games ( CIG’08 ) are now available online .
There were a number of interesting presentations at the conference , including a few neat pathfinding - related talks ( which I discuss in an earlier summary ) but the really cool thing is the other stuff the organisers have made available :
All 3 Keynote talks :
Slides from the various tutorials :
Learning to Play Games ( Simon Lucas )
Inducing Agent Models from Examples ( Bobby Bryant )
Measuring and Optimizing Player Satisfaction ( George Yannakakis and Julian Togelius ) .
And of course copies of all 53 accepted papers .
I ’m very impressed that the organisers were kind enough to make all these resources available .
In my experience , it ’s above and beyond what one could reasonably expect from similar events .
Together with the recent decision open the AAAI digital library to the public , this gives me hope that we ’re seeing a move away from subscription - based models for accessing academic literature .
Now if only someone could convince those pesky Journal archives to do the same .
Elsevier , I ’m looking at you !
Do n’t expect any apologies from Dick Cheney , said Thomas DeFrank in the New York Daily News .
“ In a blizzard of exit interviews , the normally reclusive vice president has defended waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques for suspected terrorists , ” along with just about every other part of the Bush administation ’s war on terror .
Talk about revisionist history , said Nicole Belle in Crooks and Liars .
Cheney told CNN that the controversial method was used sparingly , and yielded actionable intelligence that saved American lives .
Besides , he said , unlike pulling out someone ’s toenails , waterboarding is n’t torture , anyway .
But there ’s no telling how many al Qaida suspects were really waterboarded , and any expert will tell you that information you get using torture is unreliable .
Tell that to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , said Erick Erickson in Human Events .
He belonged to Osama bin Laden 's inner circle , and was the operational planner behind the Sept. 11 attacks .
He was also one of the three people who were subjected to waterboarding , which simulates drowning .
Without the basic information on al Qaida he provided , " the United States would have been seriously set back in the early advancement of the war . "
Soon Cheney 's opinion on the issue wo n't matter , said USA Today in an editorial .
And President - elect Barack Obama says that waterboarding is , in fact , torture , and he wo n't stand for it .
Cheney may be right that it made sense to go over to the " dark side " in the wake of 9/11 , but now it 's up to Obama to reverse the damage that torture has caused .

Just when one thinks that America 's credit card issuers cannot become any more greedy and abusive of their customers than they already are , they manage to find new ways to scam us .
Take the latest , in the form of a form letter received from most of our major credit card companies .
Here is the typical wording , from one of the largest , the One that wants your Capital :
" Due to extraordinary changes in the economic environment , we 're reviewing our existing credit card accounts .
Having considered these economic conditions , your account 's current Purchase rate , and the length of time you 've had this rate and account , we will be changing your Purchase and Balance Transfer rate . "
The " disclosure " then goes on to impose a variable rate , currently 15.9 % , in place of our former user - friendly fixed rate .
We are also told that their Cash Advance Annual Percentage Rate will go to 24.9 % backdated to January 28 , 2009 .
And it is also variable , too !
Now , maybe I 'm naive , but one would think that given these " extraordinary changes in the economic environment " the nation 's credit card issuers would want to give us a break , in the form of lower rates , better terms , and fewer and less - onerous provisions , charges , and fees .
Instead -- and the card changes quoted above are quite typical -- they seek to make matters worse for their customers .
If that is n't greed , I 'm not an aggrieved American -- and , indeed , we should all feel aggrieved , used , and exploited by the credit card companies .
To make matters even worse , most of the large credit card issuers are also banks or other financial institutions receiving TARP and other Federal bailout funds .
Obviously , they do not hesitate to take all those hundreds of billions of dollars , but they surely refuse to pass any share on to us , even indirectly in the form of more reasonable interest rates and credit terms .
Reversing the Biblical motto , these giant companies believe that it is far better to receive than to give -- except for the shaft , which they are very good at giving us .
Congress and the Obama Administration should absolutely stipulate that any and all credit card issuers ( and , for that matter , other credit providers ) not be allowed to change their terms adversely against new or old customers once they have taken any form of Federal bailout money .
Such stipulations should not be necessary , but when firms put their greed ahead of our need for fair and equitable treatment , ultimately everyone loses .
In the present instance , the card whose provisions were changed adversely as quoted above was cancelled by us .
We 're happy that it is no longer in our wallets , to paraphrase their own annoying advertisements .

Commercial " baking " yeast is a single kind of organism that belches a lot of gas really fast .
Sourdough is two organisms , wild yeast and bacteria , in symbiosis .
Together they transform the grain to make it more healthful , more digestible , and also resistant to getting moldy or stale .
Many people with wheat allergies or yeast allergies have no problem eating real sourdough .
With sourdough , you are keeping and feeding a population of friendly yeast and bacteria , called a " culture " , or a " starter " .
The population rises and falls , depending on where you keep it and what you feed it .
When you make a loaf of bread , you are carefully managing a population explosion .
The sour flavor comes from acids made by the yeast and bacteria , and when it gets really strong , that does not mean the sourdough is strongly active , but that it is depleted , that the population has already eaten its food and collapsed ..
Most grains will work , though only wheat has enough gluten to hold together big air bubbles and make a fluffy loaf .
I use a mix of whole wheat or whole rye flour and white flour ..
It will work better if the chlorine is taken out , either with a carbon filter , or just by setting it in an open container for a day or so .
to keep your sourdough in .
The wider the mouth , the better .
Glass is ideal for sourdough .
Pottery is good too , and probably wood .
Metal is not good because it reacts with the acids .
Stainless steel is okay for mixing bowls for utensils . , depending on what you 're making .
Anor at least a stove .
Some people have sourdough cultures that are more than 100 years old .
I wonder how the yeast and bacteria have changed in that time , whether they 're getting domesticated , losing their edge .
So I like to catch a fresh culture now and then .
Catching sourdough is easy !
Books make it sound like it 's difficult and complicated and takes a long time .
Using the following system , I have never once failed , and it usually takes less than three days .
Mix equal volumes of good flour and good water , and set it in a glass jar in a warm place .
Some people say to keep the lid off so yeast falls into it from the air , but evidence suggests that the yeast is already in the flour , so I just put the lid on loosely so it can breathe .
A loose lid is easier than cheesecloth and works just as well .
If you do keep the lid off , put it on a high shelf where less bad stuff will fall into it .
What you 've got now is a race between good and bad microcritters to take over your jar of food .
If the sourdough wins , it will smell sour , probably with a layer of brown liquid on top , but not moldy or rotten .
If it gets moldy or rotten , it 's almost certainly because you 're using low quality flour or water .
If it does n't do anything , it 's probably because of irradiated flour , chlorinated water , or a location that 's too cold .
Rye flour is said to work better for starting the yeast , and then you can switch to a different flour if you want .
Another trick is to put it in a warm place , but not above body temperature .
Another trick ( do n't tell anyone ) is to add a tiny bit of your saliva .
I 've heard that you can catch different strains of wild yeast and bacteria that behave differently , but I 've done it many times and never noticed a difference .
If you add commercial yeast , you 'll just get a culture that 's dominated by commercial yeast and not sourdough yeast .
I 've heard that you get something good if you use the white mold that grows on grapes .
So : flour , water , jar , wait a couple days , it turns sour .
By the time you 're sure that your jar has been taken over by the good stuff , it will be much too depleted to use .
So you need to dump out almost all of it , and add fresh flour and water , again in roughly equal amounts , and stir it well .
Then it will rise , and be good enough to use , but still not as good as it will be after one or two more cycles ( see below ) .
After you 've caught the right yeast and bacteria , you want your jar of flour / water to get bubbly and increase at least 50 % in volume .
If it does n't bubble , smell it .
If it smells like nothing , or like flour , it needs more time and warmth .
If it smells really sour , but is n't bubbling well , refresh it again : throw out all but a little bit and add more flour and water .
What you 're aiming for is a jar of what I call peak sourdough .
It 's also called levain , or a sponge .
The purpose of the sponge is not to make air , but to grow a higher yeast population , and also to give it more time to transform the flour .
When it 's at its peak , it has risen to maximum volume , it 's full of living yeast , it 's thick enough to hold air bubbles , and it 's not yet very sour .
That 's when it 's perfect for eating , or for going to the next step if you 're making bread .
When it passes its peak , it falls in volume , the bubbles go out , the yeast population crashes , and it gets too sour -- too much acid and not enough sugar .
Past - peak sourdough is great in a pie crust or anything leavened with baking powder , but it 's difficult to use it for bread .
You have to add a lot of flour and water ( compared to the quantity of sourdough ) to dilute the acid , and then wait longer for the next rise .
Do not mistake sourness for rising power !
The surest way to get your bread to rise is to build up to it , with good bubbly rising at every step .
It 's not as hard as a baby , or even a dog , but it requires more attention than a plant .
It 's a bunch of tiny living animals that need frequent food .
If you neglect them , they 'll eat up all the food and die down to almost nothing , and possibly other organisms will take over .
But the nice thing is , they do everything slower at lower temperatures .
Unless you 're eating sourdough at every meal , or your kitchen is cold , you 'll need to keep it in a refrigerator .
To feed it , remove almost all your sourdough ( ideally you will eat it ) and add more flour and water to what 's left in the jar .
Some people say to remove only half but this not only gives you less sourdough to eat , it leaves an overly sour acid bath for the next batch .
You can remove 99.99 % and your sourdough will still be alive -- it will just take a long time to build its population back .
I remove about 90 % -- I just dump it out and leave in whatever clings to the sides of the jar .
When you add the flour and water , you 'll have to learn through practice how thick to make it , depending on your flour .
Some flour gets thicker after it soaks in water , so you have to start it runnier , and some flour gets runnier so you start it thicker .
When it 's done , if you need a spoon to get it out , it 's too thick .
If you 're getting a layer of water , it 's too thin .
Also , as you 'll quickly find out , you should only fill the jar about two thirds full , to give it room so it does n't explode or run out everywhere .
I always add the water first , and shake up the jar to evenly distribute the dregs of living sourdough , and then add the flour .
And if I 'm making bread that 's part whole wheat and part white , I add the whole wheat now , because whole wheat contains stuff that 's easier to digest if it 's been soaked .
It will often happen that you do n't use your sourdough in time and it gets flat .
The only thing to do is " reset " it : save a little bit , feed it fresh flour and water , and throw the rest out , or use it in something other than bread .
You can save sourdough that has been neglected for a long time .
Even if it 's turned black on top and smells totally nasty , there 's probably still some living yeast in there .
Take a bit out and feed it fresh flour and water , and see what you get .
And if it 's dead , just catch a new one .
Sourdough exercises your foresight and awareness .
For example , at noon , I anticipate that I will make a waffle at 10 PM , and I know that I used and fed the sourdough last night and put it straight in the fridge , so it 's nowhere near ready .
If it 's a hot summer day , I should wait until about 6 PM to take it out , but if it 's cold I need to take it out now to give it all day to get to its peak .
If I need it fast , I 'll put the jar in some warm water .
Another trick is to leave it out , bring it mostly to its peak , and then ( if you remember ) put it back in the fridge , where it will remain ready to use for maybe a day .
The point is , you have to devote a permanent bit of attention to where your sourdough is in its life cycle .
I just take sourdough that 's right at its peak , and pour it straight on a hot oiled pan or waffle iron .
That 's it !
If you want to mix in other ingredients , or if you stir it at all , you will pop the bubbles and you 'll have to stir in some baking powder to get it to rise enough .
A waffle , because of the greater surface area , is more forgiving than a pancake .
Even when I do it perfectly , my pancakes are a little gummy , but imperfect sourdough can still make excellent waffles .
You 'll be surprised how good it tastes with nothing but flour , water , and friendly microbes .
Put on some pasture - raised butter and real maple syrup , and you 've still spent less money than with white - flour white - sugar aluminum - baking - powder hydrogenated - oil restaurant pancakes .
Almost any kind of flour will work .
These are the next easiest thing .
You still do n't even need a bowl .
Clear a space on the countertop or a big cutting board , pour some flour down , pour some sourdough on top of it , mix it with your fingers , fold it over a few times , add some more flour , and roll it out with a rolling pin or wine bottle .
It will take some practice to get the proportions right and keep it from sticking .
The more gluten is in your flour , the easier it is .
With anything but wheat , you 'll have to settle for very small tortillas .
If you want a light , flaky crust , forget sourdough , and see my recipes here .
A whole grain sourdough crust will not have light texture , but it will have more interesting flavor and be better for you .
I recommend a mix of white flour and whole wheat pastry flour .
Whole wheat bread flour is slightly easier to work with but the crust will be brick - like , and non -wheat is so fragile and sticky that I would n't even try to roll it out , but just press it into the pan .
In a bowl , cut some butter into some flour .
You can use your fingers , a pastry blender tool , or my new favorite method is to use frozen butter and a cheese grater .
Most recipes call for a whole stick or more , but if I 'm eating lots of pie , I might use as little as half a stick .
For vegans , I recommend palm or coconut oil , or no - trans - fat margarine , which is common now .
Liquid oil works too , but you 'll probably have to roll the crust out between sheets of waxed paper .
Just dump the oil in at the same time as the sourdough .
Now add the sourdough .
Two cups ( 16 oz , half a liter ) of bubbly sourdough should be enough for a two - crust pie , or more than enough for a single crust .
Mix it in with the flour , do n't work the dough too much , get it firm but pliable , and roll it out with more flour .
Pie crust is not easy !
For a lot more info , check out my pie crust page .
In a bowl , cut butter or other solid oil into flour , then mix in one or two teaspoons of baking powder , maybe a half teaspoon of baking soda , and dump in the sourdough .
It 's basically like a pie crust , except you need baking powder / soda to make the biscuits rise .
Have your oven already heated and your pan already oiled , and when you add the liquid stuff to the dry stuff , mix it quickly and gently , fold it over a couple times , and form the biscuits .
I either make a fat disc and cut it into six wedges , or if the dough is too sticky , I just drop six gobs of it in the pan .
Bake it at 350-375 F for 20 - 30 minutes.can be made by varying the biscuit recipe .
For example , to make scones , add sweetener .
For blueberry muffins , add sweetener and blueberries and cook them in a muffin pan .
For banana bread , add some mashed up bananas and maybe walnuts , and make one big thing instead of several little ones .
For most of this stuff I 'd increase the baking powder to a tablespoon -- it 's full of sodium but it 's your insurance against the bread coming out wet and gummy .
I now use a method based on the one at The Perfect Loaf .
That site has some helpful photos , but the excruciating instructions make me want to have nothing to do with bread .
My goal is to keep it as simple as I can get away with .
I do n't measure , I do n't use a thermometer , and I still get nice loaves .
First , you need a good quantity of good sponge .
If I 'm going to make bread the next day , in the evening I 'll take my jar of dregs out of the fridge , add some filtered water and some flour , stir it well , and set it in a cool place all night .
It will take some practice to get the time and temperature right , so that when you 're ready to make the dough , the sponge is bubbly and only slightly sour .
I like to add all the water that I 'm going to add , in the sponge , so that when I make the loaf I just add more flour , plus salt and other stuff .
There are all kinds of options for flour .
The easiest is just regular white flour , a.k.a. all purpose flour .
It kneads smoothly and holds lots of air , but it also has the least flavor and nutrition .
The next easiest is whole wheat bread flour , and then wheat ancestors and other grains .
As you go down that road , the dough becomes stickier and harder to work , and the bread becomes denser , but better tasting .
I like to use a blend of difficult flour and white flour .
If you 're going to use any white flour , it 's better to put it in closer to the end of the process , because whole grain flour benefits more from fermentation .
So for the sponge , I might use whole wheat bread flour , or rye , or spelt , or einkorn , a nutty and sticky ancient wheat .
Then for the loaf , I 'll add more of that plus some white flour .
I just pour the flour on the countertop , pour the sponge over it , throw on some salt , and start kneading .
There are different kneading techniques , but the important thing is that you repeatedly fold the dough over on itself .
It 's better to start too wet , and gradually add flour , than have the dough get too dry and have to add water .
There 's no easy way to know when to stop adding flour , or when to stop kneading .
Some recipes say it's when the dough feels silky , or when it cleans your hands , but unless you 're using a lot of white flour , you 'll never get to that stage , or you 'll get there by making the dough too dry .
I like to knead for about five minutes , and have the dough be somewhat sticky and somewhat firm , maybe halfway from a gooey mess to a rubbery ball .
The next stage , which I got from my sister , who got it from the perfect loaf guy , is delayed stretch - and - fold .
This is basically very slow kneading .
The point is to get more air in the loaf , and more stretching of the gluten , in a gentle way that gives you bigger and lighter dough before the final shaping .
Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl , and let it sit for maybe half an hour .
If you 're doing it right , it will rise , not double , but enough that you 'll notice .
If it does n't rise , try waiting longer .
Now , rather than using more flour to keep it from sticking , wet your hands , and very gently take it out .
Let it stretch , fold it over , then let it stretch another way and fold it over , three or four folds total , then put it back in the bowl .
Wait about half an hour , and do it again .
After you 've done this about three times , put the dough in whatever pan you 're going to bake it in .
First , rub the pan with oil and then dust it with flour .
I use coconut oil and white flour .
A rectangular loaf pan is good for sandwich bread , but a round pan , like a pie pan , will give the dough more room to rise .
The final rise is also called the proof .
How long it takes depends on a lot of things , including the temperature , the vigor of your yeast , the density of the loaf , and the amount of salt .
As with the sponge , what you 're aiming for is the point where the yeast has eaten its food and transformed the dough and made lots of bubbles , but it has n't started declining , which will make the loaf collapse because the air bubbles are no longer being filled .
White bread might double in volume but whole grain probably wo n't increase more than 50 percent .
Now you put it in a hot oven , where ideally the warmth will give the yeast one final push of growth , and then the heat will expand the air bubbles and fix them in place in a not - too - dense loaf .
I like to start at 425 F , then turn it down to 400 and bake 30 - 40 minutes .
Professional bakers go much hotter and also use steam .
A trick for making a regular oven steamy is to put a pan with a little water on the lower rack , while it 's preheating .
The test for doneness is to take the loaf out and tap the bottom .
It should sound hollow .
The nice thing about pizza dough is it 's so flat that there 's no danger of it collapsing , so you can get away with a wetter dough .
Otherwise it 's just like regular bread .
I put some olive oil and dry oregano in the mix , and shape it and raise it in the pizza pan I 'm going to cook it in .
When it 's ready , I pre-bake it for about five minutes , then add the toppings and bake it the rest of the way .
Make a large batch of bread dough ( as above , wet dough is OK ) , and then instead of shaping it into a loaf , roll it out in a big square , maybe 8 inches by 24 inches ( 20x60 cm ) .
A great trick is to use cinnamon instead of flour to roll it out .
Then spread sweetener , nuts , raisins , whatever , making sure to go all the way to the edges , and roll it up from short edge to short edge , so you get a short thick cylinder .
Cut it into about six pieces , and arrange them in a pan with high edges and just a little extra room , so when they rise they will fill the pan .
Rise and bake .
You can also form bread dough into round flat shapes and fry them !
So if you 're squatting , camping , or living in your car , and you have a stove but no oven , you can still have homemade bread .

The British media were filled last week with weasel words of peace from politicians following a spate of armed attacks on British troops and the police in Northern Ireland .
In one particularly incoherent piece of hypocrisy , Gordon Brown praised “ the unyielding resolution to say with one voice that the peace that the people of Northern Ireland are building no murderers should ever be allowed to destroy ” .
Ordinary people in Northern Ireland have also shown their opposition to the shootings .
But they did not use the cliches favoured by establishment politicians .
Tens of thousands have taken part in protests across Northern Ireland to condemn the return to violence .
Veteran civil rights leader Eamonn McCann spoke at a protest in Derry on behalf of the local branch of the rally organisers , the Irish Council of Trade Unions .
People were determined not to return to the days of sectarian violence , he said .
“ We stood here in protest and in sympathy with the bereaved after the Shankill bombing , the Greysteel massacre , the City of London bombing which broke the original ceasefire and the cruel murder of David Caldwell in the Waterside , ” he said in reference to the victims of what is known as “ the Troubles ” .
“ It is our earnest hope that we never have to come here again and stand in protest and in sympathy .
The message from this demonstration here today is never again – no more .
We stand for peace between our people and an end to the cruel grief inflicted on so many families in this part of the world . ”
It ’s worth recalling that it was protests by ordinary people that gave the spur for the peace process that ended 30 years of armed conflict between the mainly Catholic Republicans , who want a united Ireland , and Protestant Unionists backed by the British state .
Time and time again people took to the streets to push the process forward when establishment politicians were blocking it .
There is a contradiction at the heart of Northern Irish politics .
While those at the top herald peace , the peace process they promote has deepened sectarian division and poverty .
Neil , a postal worker in Belfast , told Socialist Worker , “ Sectarianism has n’t gone away .
While the politicians play their games , we are left where we always are .
“ But the real bitterness this creates is just going into a dead end .
I do n’t think the paramilitaries have anything useful to say , but do any of the politicians ?
“ There are a lot of issues we should be rioting about , but some rerun of the armed struggle is n’t going to change anything for the better . ”
Working class people in Northern Ireland have suffered the most over the last 40 years .
Over 28,000 people have been forced to leave work through intimidation .
And 54,000 familes were forced to move home .
Some 80,000 people have spent time in prison .
Remarkably some aspects of life have got worse during the period of the peace process .
Over the last ten years the overall suicide rate has risen by 31 percent , and the use of prescribed anti-depressants has doubled .
The way that politics and , increasingly , society in Northern Ireland is organised makes it seem like “ common sense ” to blame the “ other side ” – which helps stop anyone questioning the growing inequality within their “ own ” community .
The result is that it is often the poorest in each community that attack each other , while the well - off escape to the leafy suburbs .
Throughout the Troubles , the endemic poverty and poor public services were blamed on “ the paramilitaries ” .
Yet over the last decade of peace most people in Northern Ireland have seen their living standards fall .
Bigotry
Sectarian bigotry is a crucial part of the set up in Northern Ireland .
The British state has always boasted of bringing “ democracy ” to the North , but it far outdid the paramilitaries in its capacity for terror .
Sectarianism is not inherent to life in Northern Ireland .
It was created and fostered from the outside .
The violence of the Northern Ireland state provoked a quarter of a century of open conflict .
By the mid-1990s British governments had realised that they could not defeat the Republicans by force ( see box ) .
Britain ’s rulers wanted to stabilise Northern Ireland .
So they pushed Unionist politicians into accepting that peace talks had to take place and that Sinn Fein – the political wing of the Republican movment – had to be part of the process .
Now Sinn Fein is part of the establishment – as are the Protestant bigots of parties such as the Democratic Unionist Party .
Unfortunately , the peace in Northern Ireland is not based on drawing ordinary Protestants and Catholics together , but on policing people apart .
While Northern Ireland has seen the systematic oppression of Catholics , the divide in the working class also holds back Protestant workers .
Managers in Northern Ireland earn 20 percent more than their counterparts in Britain , while average private sector earnings are 10 percent lower .
Ciaran , a Belfast community worker , told Socialist Worker , “ I think the rallies show that people do n’t want to go back .
But we should realise that the divisions make everyone ’s life worse .
We need to be attacking poverty and sectarianism now , not waiting for politicians to divide up an ever - shrinking cake . ”
Mary is a nurse who lives in the Short Strand in East Belfast .
She said , “ All the hotels and calls centres are on the doorstep , but we ca n’t get jobs there .
People then exploit that as a Protestant - Catholic thing .
But the real problem is the class thing and the money thing .
“ The whole point of the peace process was to get equality .
But we are very much still a divided society .
Shooting a policeman wo n’t solve that . ”
There is a growing sense of cynicism about politics from both communities .
Since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 , which ended the armed conflict , the number of people who do n’t support a political party has more than doubled from 12 percent to 26 percent .
Some 37 percent support neither Unionist nor Republican parties .
The claim is constantly repeated that the establishment has brought peace .
In reality the peace process is bringing Protestant and Catholic workers together in poverty while at the same time dividing them politically on sectarian lines .
The events of last week have shown that a few people will look to the gun to challenge the state .
They have also shown that many more are not looking for a return to the armed struggle of a minority – but are searching for an alternative to poverty and sectarianism .
1. No More Drama :
The Republican Party is reeling from a disastrous 2008 election and a race for party chair that publicly exposed the fissures between its warring factions .
The last thing the party needs now is further chaos at the top , which is what would almost certainly ensue if Steele was ousted .
2. Symbolic Suicide :
In the after - action report of the 2006 and 2008 elections , Republican operatives concluded that one of the party 's biggest problems was that they were viewed as the party of old white men .
Putting Steele atop their party infrastructure was a move greeted with a sigh of relief by the GOP 's professional political class .
Pushing Steele aside just over a month into his tenure would send the exact wrong message about who the Republican Party is and where it 's going .
3. If Not Steele , Who ? :
The field for RNC chair was roundly panned as lacking any real star power .
Among a group of largely unknown party chairs from around the country , Steele was the only candidate who could make the case that he could be a star thanks to his personal magnetism and charisma .
While that bet has n't paid off to date , there 's not an obvious candidate who could step into the void if Steele was knocked out .
4. Procedural Problems : National party committees are ruled by a series of arcane rules and procedures for doing just about anything .
( Ask anyone who attended the RNC chair election ; it seemed to go on forever . )
Removing a party chairman , not surprisingly , is not something that can be done quickly or easily .
5. Positive Movement : After a month occupied by a huge internal review led by a committee of 10 RNC members , the senior staff is starting to fall into place .
Ken McKay , a former chief of staff to Rhode Island Gov. Don Carcieri , was named executive director on Thursday , and today Trevor Francis , a managing director in Burson - Marsteller 's media practice , will be announced as communications director .
Putting the senior staff in place should quiet some of the chatter that the committee is off the rails .
On February 7 , just a week after Steele was elected , the Washington Post reported in a front - page story that Alan Fabian , the finance chairman of Steele 's unsuccessful 2006 run for the U.S. Senate , told federal prosecutors that Steele " arranged for his 2006 Senate campaign to pay a defunct company run by his sister for services that were never performed . "
The day after the Post story appeared , Steele , speaking on ABC's " This Week , " said the money -- it was about $ 37,000 -- was " a legitimate reimbursement of expenses " for catering and other services provided by his sister 's company .
Steele pointed out that Fabian has been convicted in a multi-million dollar fraud case and made the allegations against Steele in an unsuccessful attempt to have his sentence lowered .
" Those allegations were leveled by a convicted felon who is trying to get a reduced sentence on his conviction , " Steele told ABC .
In late February , WBAL - TV , a television station in Baltimore , reported that Steele 's 2006 campaign paid $ 64,000 to a company called Allied Berton , owned by a friend and a supporter of Steele's .
The station reported that Allied Berton is a commodities trading firm , dealing in minerals , metals , and agricultural products .
The report said that finance reports filed by the Steele campaign listed the services provided by Allied Berton as " political consulting . "
When WBAL tried to ask what kind of political consulting a commodities trading firm performed for the Steele campaign , a Steele spokesman declined to comment .
The allegations , which have n't received much national attention , have nevertheless rattled a number of RNC members across the country .
" This came out right after his election , " one member told me Wednesday .
" If people had known that when he was running , he would not have won . "
" The committee is split almost down the middle on this , " the member continued .
" The people who are concerned are very concerned .
These are very serious allegations . " ... [ H ] is handling of the question is just making already skeptical RNC members even more skeptical .
Despite Michael Steele 's grasping the third rail of Republican Party politics -- and refusing to let go -- Chris Cillizza offers the controversial -- some would say " clownish " -- RNC chair a glimmer of hope that he wo n't be out on the street looking for a job again -- at least not right away .
In hiscolumn today , Cillizza lists 5 reasons why Michael Steele wo n't be removed anytime soon .
But what Cillizza is n't taking into account are the implications of the FBI probe into Steele 's embezzlement of campaign funds to enrich himself -- and his role in an elite GOP prostitution service , some of whose big name clients are now in prison .
In his wingnut opinion column in yesterday 's Byron York was willing to shout about something other Republicans have only whispered about ; " There has been all but no discussion of this kind of thing , " said an RNC member .
" People are terrified that discussing it can make it a reality . "
It 's the elephant in the room though -- and everyone knows about it now .
York : " [ T ] here is another issue about the new chairman that is the topic not of public discussion but of worried private conversation among some of the RNC 's 168 members .
That topic concerns the allegations of financial irregularities in Steele 's 2006 run for Senate from Maryland .
While some RNC members , including the chairman himself , view those accusations as completely unfounded , others worry they could dog the Republican party for months to come , even as Steele tries to remake it .
" And in the background is the race to replace Kirsten Gillibrand in one of the only Republican - leaning districts left in New York State .
Replacing moderate Democrat Gillibrand -- who is now a U.S. Senator -- with a well known , if inept , local Republican Party hack , Jim Tedisco , was supposed to be Steele 's cherry on the cake of the GOP resurgence his election as RNC chair was symbolized .
But now Tedisco , once seen as a shoe - in , is blaming the RNC ( and the equally inept NRCC ) for blowing his 21 - point lead , a lead that is down to 45 % - 41 % ... for an election on March 31 .
Independent voters looked at the two candidates and at the obstructionist behavior of the national Republican Party and its bizarre leaders and moved firmly out of Tedisco 's camp and into Murphy 's .
Many observers say that if Tedisco manages to lose the race , it will be another nail -- perhaps the final nail -- in Steele 's coffin .

( Update December 2014 – for more on this subject , answering several questions , see here )
Bang , bang , another beery myth hits the floorboards , or at least staggers back badly wounded , after excellent work by Kim Cook in an article called “ Who produced Fuggle ’s Hops ” just published in the latest ( Spring 2009 , issue 130 ) edition of Brewery History magazine .
The story repeated everywhere about Fuggles , one of the two classic English hop varieties , first appeared 108 years ago in an article called “ The Hop and its English Varieties ” , by John Percival ( 1863-1949 ) , then professor at the agricultural college in Wye , Kent , in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England , vol 62 , and reprinted in the Brewers ’ Journal March 15 1902 edition , pp 10 - 16 .
Percival wrote of the Fuggle hop that
“ The original plant was a casual seedling which appeared in the flower - garden of Mr George Stace , of Horsmonden , Kent .
The seed from which the plant arose was shaken out along with crumbs from the hop - picking dinner basket used by Mrs Stace , the seedling being noticed about the year 1861 .
The sets were afterwards introduced to the public by Mr Richard Fuggle , of Brenchley , about the year 1875 .
( Letters from Mr John Larkin , Horsmonden , Mr W.J. Noakes , Goudbury and others . ) ”
Horsmonden and Brenchley are two villages in the Kentish Weald , about a mile apart .
The Fuggles variety grows well in the stiff , damp , clayey soils of the Weald , and better than hops such as Goldings do in such soils .
If a new , hardy , heavy - cropping hop , comparatively very rich in lupulin , and well - suited to Wealden conditions suddenly popped up in the district , a Wealden hop farmer was indeed likely to spot it and introduce it commercially .
So do the records support Percival ’s account of the birth of Fuggles ?
Unfortunately , Kim Cook ’s investigations show , they do n’t .
There was nobody living in Horsmonden in 1861 called George Stace : the census returns that year show no families called Stace , or anything like it , in the village at all , nor any Georges whose surname bore any possible resemblance to Stace .
A wide - ranging search uncovered several people called George Stace living in and around the Wealden area at the right sort of time , but none with any good connection to Horsmonden .
( Update – it turns out that the reason why no one can find George Stace is because his name was actually George Stace Moore– see comments below . )
What about Richard Fuggle ?
More problems .
Later narratives than Percival ’s specifically identified Richard Fuggle as being of Fowle Hall , then in Brenchley but later assigned to Paddock Wood .
The Fuggles certainly lived at Fowle Hall , but in the period 1861 - 1879 the head of the household was Thomas Fielder Fuggle , not Richard .
Thomas Fielder Fuggle did have a son called Richard , his seventh child , but he was only 13 in 1861 , and he emigrated to Ontario around 1871 - 72 , aged 23 or so , and thus was n’t around in 1875 to promote the Fuggle hop .
There WAS a Richard Fuggle farming in the area , at the right time , at Old Hay , about a mile or so north of Brenchley village proper ( and brother to Thomas Fielder Fuggle – see comment below ) .
Old Hay was then a detached part of the parish of Mereworth , seven miles further north .
Kim Cook ’s provisional family tree for the Fuggles of Old Hay shows Richard Fuggle senior was born around 1806 , dying in 1864 , and his son Richard junior was born in 1841 , inheriting the running of the farm at Old Hay from his father .
Some time between 1874 and 1878 , however , just the time when the Fuggles hop was supposedly being introduced , Kim Cook shows that this Richard Fuggle moved from Old Hay to Owley Farm , Wittersham , around 20 or so miles to the south .
By 1891 he was living in Wittersham village and working as an overseer for someone else , and he died in 1913 .
His son , another Richard , born 1872 , emigrated to Australia , where his wife died only in 1962 .
One little piece of evidence Kim Cook did n’t have was a notice in The Times from July 6 1871 about the sale of West and East Old Hay farms , with East Old Hay “ in the occupation of Mr F. [ sic ]
Fuggle ” , presumably a typo for R. Fuggle .
Both farms had hop kilns attached and were “ proverbial for their excellent growth of hops and corn ” , according to the sale notice .
Strangely , the two people Kim Cook has been able to definitely identify are Professor Percival ’s two named informants .
John Larkin was a farmer at Ashdown , Horsmonden in 1901 , the village of his birth in 1843 , while William John Noakes had been at Burr ’s Hill , Brenchley from at least 1861 to around 1890 .
They ought to have been good witnesses , and it is very strange that little or no evidence can be found to stand their story up .
Kim Cook suggests the true originator of the Fuggles hop might have been Ann Fuggle , half - sister , it seems of Thomas Fielder Fuggle and daughter of John Fuggle , of Gatehouse Farm , Brenchley , who was the largest hop farmer in the Fuggle family in Brenchley before she married William Durrant in 1848 .
This is too far a stretch for me : if I had to bet , I ’d put my money on Richard Fuggle senior and / or junior of Old Hay farm ( and besides , Ann Fuggle evidently died in 1868 : see , again , note below ) ..
But if this Richard was the originator of the Fuggle hop , why did n’t he make enough money from introducing the new variety to not have to end up working for someone else 20 miles away from the family home ?
And since this Richard was still alive in 1901 , why did n’t Professor Percival contact him to find out about the hop ’s origins , rather than having to rely on Larkin and Noakes ?
Certainly the new variety caught on quickly .
The earliest mention of Fuggles hops I have been able to find comes from the Brewers ’ Journal of September 1883 , where a reprint of a talk given a year earlier by Dr H. Braungart of Weihenstephan to the Swiss Brewers ’ Congress in Geneva mentions ( twice ) “ Juggles Goldings [ sic ] ( Weald of Kent ) ” being grown in 1881 , six years after the variety ’s supposed introduction .
Juggles is obviously a typo for Fuggles ( the same article also talks about “ Brambling ” hops , when Bramling is meant ) , and Fuggles were occasionally regarded as a type of Goldings in the variety ’s early decades .
Brewers eventually began to value the variety as well .
A report on the hop market in The Times on November 13 1895 said : “ The attention of brewers is being more and more centred upon Fuggles , of which the best and medium sorts passed off very well . ”
Ten years later , in a monograph on The Hop and its Constituents , Professor Percival wrote :
In the less favoured districts with damp , stiffish soils , or where the climate is against the production of the finest quality , Fuggle ’s Hop is a variety extensively grown , and its cultivation is spreading .
It is a heavy cropper , hardy , with a green bine .
The hops are somewhat large , square in section , pointed at the tip , with thickish petals .
The basal petals of the “ cone ” are dirty green in colour .
The hops are rich in lupulin , but their aroma is second rate .
For use in the copper this variety is as good as any , and , when well managed , gives a remunerative yield to the grower . ”
Three decades later , when the variety was , if the story of its origins is correct , getting on for 80 years old , The Times wrote on February 1 1938 that “ The Fuggle … is more largely grown than any other variety in this country .
It is at present practically the only variety grown in the Weald of Kent and Sussex and is also grown in Herefordshire . ”
Even in 1949 Fuggles hops made up 78 per cent of the English hop harvest , but the variety proved particularly susceptible to a virulent strain of the fungal infection Verticillium wilt that started to hammer the hop gardens of Kent and Sussex from the 1940s .
This , together with the development of varieties of hop with higher levels of alpha acids , saw Fuggles crash to only some nine per cent of total hop acreage in England .
Fortunately committed brewers have kept the variety alive because they desired to maintain the traditional flavours of British beers , particular bitter : there does n’t seem to be another hop that gives the mouth - filling rotundity of Fuggles to a comparatively low - strength ale .
The classic combination is the grassy Fuggles and the more citric Goldings .
My local Sainsbury ’s supermarket has been selling cheap bottles of Harviestoun ’s Haggis Hunter , 4.3 per cent abv , which is brewed solely with masses of Fuggles and Goldings , far more , I suspect than usually go into a British beer .
The result is revelatory : brisk , uplifting , tangy , a marvellous rejoinder to anyone who thinks that super - hoppy beers need to have American hops in them .
Whoever really first spotted that little hop plant supposedly grown from a seed thrown out of a hop - picker ’s dinner basket , we ’re all very grateful .

One must give a tip of the hat to the Wall Street conmen for engineering a reasonably robust stock rally .
The Dow and S&P were led by financials .
The Financial Times out of London claims �no real money � was behind the stock rally of over 20 % .
They must mean huge short covering , enhanced by pressure tactics from Wall Street brokerages themselves .
They must mean Working Group For Financial Markets putting to work some of their � Black Bag� money .
They must mean influenced arbitrage games from preferred versus common shares , which harmed the public but enriched the insiders .
Amazing how a better financial journal on US topics comes from outside the Untied States .
A movement pervaded Lower Manhattan offices to formally call in all Citigroup shorted shares on loan .
Whether legal or not , it helped cause a big bank stock rally .
Other � C � share games were played that enabled preferred shares to serve as collateral on common share shorts , as the plebeian shares descended to $ 1 / share value .
Never lose sight of the fact that Plunge Protection Team funds came in large part from missing $ 1.5 billion in Fannie Mae funds from 1988 to 2000 , specifically out of the HUD offices in Houston ( Papa Bush regional home ) and in Oklahoma City ( Clinton home region ) , whose funds keep America strong .
Then you have all the absurd giant steps backwards to permit big banks to ignore Mark - to - Market and just conjure up asset values from indefensible models , with blessing from Financial Accounting Standards Board and the USCongress .
This reform ?
As citizens pay their income taxes , and observe the � Tea Parties � around the nation , think deeper than the many plain shallow placards with great intention .
The original Boston event prompted a Revolutionary War .
The battle cry was over taxation without representation , a tax levy on tea to the colony , without a voice in the King George court .
With the USCongress taking orders from Wall Street and having votes bought by lobbyists , the focus should be not on high taxes or low taxes , but taxation without proper representation by members of the USCongress .
The august body in the USCongress has received countless million $ from Wall Street firms and Fannie Mae , along with dozens of other firms embroiled in the banking crisis that has destroyed the US banking system .
Thousands of lobby groups have taken control of the USCongress , including the Council on Foreign Relations and AIPAC .
My firm belief is that bribery is the way of the House & Senate .
The people have little or no voice anymore , which is the basis of any charge of tyranny .
In order to remedy the banks and recapitalize them , our banking and government leaders must find more intricate methods with greater confusion and more hidden requirements to enable the big banks to be replenished at federal expense , while the public remains ignorant , and Main Street is directly and plainly neglected .
The TARP congame has been discredited .
The Public Private Partnership Investment Program is a revamped TARP sham .
Listen to the Jackass on a radio interview ( CLICK HERE ) , that covers many aspects of this disguised carry trade program , criticism from watchdog and Nobel Prize winner Stiglitz , the interior battle between the FDIC and Dept Treasury , and how the requirements for its official � Fund Manager � are only met by the five Wall Street banks that committed the majority of the bond fraud .
Geithner plans to build a bus to transport capital to big banks , called � The Geithner Summers Structured Investment Vehicle� after the infamous SIVs .
Forget economist forecasts , both inaccurate and old - fashioned .
New research shows corporate bonds have been far better at predicting where the USEconomy is headed than one might expect .
The great churn to subsidize and redeem the Wall Street banks has brought them off their knees , now ready to lend again at a minimal level after their fraudulent chapter .
Their insolvency will remain for another year or more .
Signals from the corporate bond spreads suggest strongly that the USEconomy will falter worse .
In the autumn of 2007 , before conditions began to falter , corporate bond prices raised the red flag .
The spread between corporate bond yields and USTreasury yields had begun to widen as the mortgage crisis showed its subprime prima facie that summer in 2007 .
More declines are coming , signaled by current corporate bond spreads .
GOLD TO RISE ON FURTHER MONETARY DEVALUATION
Staggering additional monetary inflation comes , initially from programs by the USGovt and USFed to date .
More monetary debauchery is right around the corner , to be extremely clear by summertime .
Bank losses will become a national nightmare , seemingly never ending .
Only deception buttresses the bank sector now , their specialty .
Both central bank and USGovt funds will become an absolute torrent when they finally come to grips with the bank losses upcoming and the momentum for USEconomic downturn toward depression .
Vicious feedback loops at finally in high gear .
When the printing press becomes more heavily relied upon , the clarity of USDollar support also coming from USMilitary actions will render the gold & silver assets more desirable safe haven investments .
Furthermore , USFed authorities must be deeply worried about the seeds they are planting for future price inflation .
The USFed just purchased $ 1.5 billion in Treasury Inflation Protection Securities ( TIPS ) in an unprecedented maneuver .
No longer does the TIPS tell of inflation expectorations .
What on earth is going in on their tiny minds ?
The story not told often enough is the utterly huge short gold futures contract positions put on by JPMorgan immediately when the USFed announced its $ 1 trillion monetization plan in mid-March , and the additional batch of gold short contracts they put on during the G20 Dollar Funeral event in early April .
Perhaps the USDept Treasury can access some of the $ 1.9 billion from the AIG car insurance business unit sale to Zurich Financial to fund more market corruption and interference , with a simple handoff from to their free market brothers at JPMorgan .
Still , despite all the harmful , unregulated , and relentless pressure put on precious metals , their prices refuse to be pushed down .
The gap between the physical gold price and paper COMEX price continues to widen .
The story behind the scenes that captured my attention centered on German demands to return all their gold bullion held in custodial accounts on US soil .
The deep source contact said something like , � the German demand is making the US bank nazis sweat bullets .
Pressure on COMEX will get much worse .�
Expect even more pressure on the June gold contract than was seen with the March gold contract , as far as delivery default is concerned .
Deutsche Bank saved the COMEX bacon with a last minute 850,000 ounce delivery , courtesy of the Euro Central Bank at the eleventh hour .
Such are the games not told on national financial networks , but which are central to Hat Trick Letter analysis .
The gold price is busy carving out the Right Side Handle to a messy Cup & Handle reversal pattern , one which is testing the patience of yellow metal investors .
When the weekly stochastix cycles down a little farther , the consolidation should be at an end .
We observe not so much a battle of monetary inflation versus asset deflation , as with free market pricing structures versus disruptive USGovt custodial management that will someday be chronicled as the most corrupt in modern history .
Asian and Arab creditors to the USTreasury Bonds are not pleased with what the management of either the USGovt bond securities or gold , and they hold both in great volume .
The target for gold remains almost 1300 , with a breakout inevitable .
The silver chart looks even more bullish .
Instead of a clear reversal pattern , it shows a recovery pattern that struggles to find strong footing on the less stable 20 - week moving average .
Its move to reach old highs will be easier , once near - term resistance is overcome .
The 50 % retracement of the long run from last October to February would paint a line at the 12.3 level for Fibonacci support .
He was a friend of Botticelli , Lambourghini , Zepharelli , and great grandfather to Roubini , surely good company to keep .
Look for an upcoming crossover of the 20 - wk MA ( in blue ) above the 50 - wk MA ( in red ) , a powerful technical bullish signal for moves to approach the July and March 2008 highs .
It is also inevitable .
ROOT CAUSE OF BANK LOSS
The two root causes of the deep historically unprecedented US bank losses from bond assets and credit portfolios are housing price declines and home foreclosures .
For to claim the banks have stabilized without the home prices or forced foreclosures is absurd on its face .
What has changed would please US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , market psychology .
He favors inflation expectorations for USTreasury Bonds over monetary growth , as the USDollar is debauched into oblivion .
He favors consumer sentiment for the USEconomy over retail store shutdowns and shopping mall vacancies .
The Wall Street maestros sold the investment community a bill of phony goods that will be evident by summer .
They engineered a bank sector rally based on falsified earnings reports , orders by the USFed to keep the Bank Stress Tests secret until May , a return of the uptick short stock rule , and a return to valuing bank assets by creative methods based upon valuation models .
Those hidden proprietary models contain a scad of silly assumptions like a 7.0 % jobless rate .
The March data already gave us 8.5 % on that meter , but the reality - based Shadow Govt Statistics claim the jobless rate ( when people without jobs are counted ) is 17.0 % actually .
Housing prices continue down .
The January Case - Shiller housing index for 20 cities showed a minus 19.0 % change from a year ago , a statistic remarkably free of USGovt garbage adjustments .
It is just the change from Jan 2008 to Jan 2009 , no frills , no deception .
The key point of the C - S housing index is that it has been in decline for consecutive months going back to the beginning of the officially recognized recession in December 2007 .
The other key point is that all 20 cities are in price decline , all of them .
My forecast in the Hat Trick Letter , given in year 2005 and repeated in 2006 , was for a seemingly endless housing decline in a powerful unprecedented bear market , in essence a double correction since Greenspan diverted the expected bear from its path in 2001 , denying him his due .
The price decline dictates impossible conditions to refinance under - water home loans , which applies to almost 30 % of US homes with mortgages ( loan balance exceeds current home price ) .
Falling home prices encourage homeowners to stop making mortgage payments , viewed as throwing away money down a toilet .
Although repossessed bank - owned ( real estate owned ) REO liquidation sales make up 60 % of total sales in the gogo states , REO listings make up only 33 % of total listings .
Banks are holding back inventory , amidst a flood .
In doing so , they hide losses .
Incredibly , exactly half of ordinary home sales outside bank liquidations are short sales , meaning sellers must produce cash above the sale price in the lawyer�s office .
Individuals who own homes falling in value , whether sapped of equity or running negative equity , are unable to tap credit lines from Home Equity Lines of Credit ( HELOC ) .
Worse , as a household with negative home equity usually contains people who stop spending in normal fashion .
The USEconomy is thus deeply affected by declining home prices .
Banks in particular stand at the apex of losses , since their borrowers lose credit worthiness , and loan instruments are leveraged .
More data and analysis is provided in the April Hat Trick Letter macro economic report just posted .
Sweetheart analyst Meredith Whitney expects home prices to fall another 30 % .
US banks and mortgage lenders would have much worse crippling losses ahead .
She expects such losses would finally kill a long list of US banks , large and mid-sized .
She makes a great point , saying � Home prices cannot bottom while liquidity is still contracting from the economy .�
She predicts that peak - to - trough home price declines will average 50 % nationally before the US housing crisis ends .
We are halfway to the bottom , and likely have seen half of the bank losses to come .
Whitney is known for her bearish calls , largely correct to date .
Home foreclosures continue up .
The biggest single factor behind a home foreclosure is job loss with discontinued income .
The second biggest factor is unexpected medical expenses , which extends to other family members like parents .
RealtyTrac just reported today that home foreclosures for the first quarter of 2009 are up 24 % from a year ago .
In California , where the moratorium has lifted , foreclosures rose by 80 % from February to March , hitting 50 thousand !!!
The April increase could be well above 100 % in makeup mode .
JPMorgan , Wells Fargo , and Fannie & Freddie each lifted their moratorium .
Incredibly , prime mortgages delinquent over 60 days more than doubled in 4Q2008 to 2.4 % , when compared to the first quarter 2008 .
A uniform upward uptrend in the delinquency rates has occurred over the last several months .
Nobody in Bank Land prefers to discuss the rising defaults of the prime mortgages , which include Pay Option ARMs , Intermediate term ARMs , and more .
The prime default rates are much lower than the subprime and Alt - A garbage loans ( often with no income , no documentation , no assets , and no verification ) , but the volume of prime home loans is huge , resulting in great potential for future bank loss .
The adjustable rate mortgage default flood has begun , with full warning given to Hat Trick Letter subscribers several months ago .
Mark Hanson has been indispensable source of great information .
Mr Mortgage , as he is known , has a great website ( CLICK HERE ) chock full of relevant timely data that is well ahead of the pack .
His work is often quoted on national financial networks .
He points out that Jumbo loans now comprise 31 % of all fresh loan defaults .
So the foreclosure problem has hit the high end , where losses per loan to banks will be much greater .
All the delay in lifting the conforming Fannie Mae loan limit from $ 417 k to $ 729 k led to severe damage to high end property prices .
Then you have the � Revolving Door� of federal modified home loans .
The 1Q2008 vintage modified loans defaulted 41 % of the time after eight months .
The 2Q2008 modified loans had a 46 % default rate down the road .
The third quarter trends are worsening , according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) and the Office of Thrift Supervision .
Data is not yet available .
The Federal Housing Admin is the new subprime slime lender , under the USGovt leaky roof .
At end of February , a huge 7.5 % of FHA loans were deemed �seriously delinquent� , up from 6.2 % a year earlier , typically with under 3 % to 5 % down payments .
The FHA share of the US mortgage market soared to nearly 33 % of loans originated in 4Q2008 , from about 2 % in 2006 .
More data and analysis is provided in the April Hat Trick Letter macro economic report just posted .
THE NEXT SHOE � COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES
The bank sector is debating this topic now , complete with considerable denial and departures from reality ( what the facts state ) .
Inside reports speak of grand internal sandbag projects by big banks to brace for the coming storm expected .
The delinquency rate for commercial mortgages has more than doubled since September to 1.8 % this month , on $ 700 billion in securitized loans , according to Deutsche Bank .
This market is usually highly stable .
The current delinquency rate is just below the peak in 2004 .
Some experts anticipate the current commercial slump will exceed that seen in the early 1990s .
Foresight Analytics of Oakland California estimates the US banking sector could suffer as much as $ 250 billion in commercial real estate losses in the current crisis .
They project that over 700 banks could fail as a result of their exposure to commercial real estate .
That is five times the charges on commercial real estate debt between 1990 and 1995 .
Deutsche Bank estimates the default rates on the $ 700 billion of commercial mortgage backed securities could reach 30 % , and aggregate loss rates could reach 10 % .
Besides securities backed by commercial real estate loans , about $ 524.5 billion of whole commercial mortgages held on portfolios by US banks and thrifts will come due between 2009 and 2012 .
Nearly 50 % would not qualify for refinancing in today�s credit environment , estimates Matthew Anderson at Foresight Analytics .
Lenders generally reject loans over 65 % of a commercial property value .
General Growth was a victim today of inability to refinance and roll over their debt .
They had strong fundamentals , but unfortunately bankers do not .
More data and analysis is provided in the April Hat Trick Letter macro economic report just posted .
BANKS ARE NOT READY FOR MORE LOSSES
The official FDIC Banking Profile report from the fourth quarter of 2009 reveals that failing loans have risen faster than reserves .
The big banks cannot bring in new capital ( from TARProgram , USGovt - sponsored carry trades , or equity investors in Saudi Arabia ) to match growth in their losses .
This has caused the �coverage ratio� to plunge below 100 % , cut in half since 2005 .
It is below 80 % actually ( shown in red ) .
The big banks must dig into earnings to build loan loss reserves .
Case in point JPMorgan today , adding $ 4.2 billion into loss reserves .
Case in point Capital
One yesterday , reporting credit card charge - offs of $ 526.5 million .
Banks remain behind the curve .
Banks face multiple fronts for profound losses , as mortgages are but one factor .
Recall the Bernanke claims in 2007 that subprimes would be contained , no broad contagion to bonds would occur , the USEconomy would be insulated , and the total bank losses would be under $ 200 billion .
What a hack !
But then again , he is just a dumb professor , now a full - time lithographer .
It seems the gold journals contain numerous better bank analysts and economic forecasters than the good chairman .
Michael Mayo of Calyon Securities gave warning of broadening bank losses , which actually roiled the stock market when released .
He said , � Mortgage related losses are about halfway to their peak , while credit card and consumer loan losses are only a third of the way to their expected highest levels .
The nation�s largest banks may be transitioning from a financial crisis marked by write - downs of capital , to an economic crisis featuring large loan losses . �
And then the headline catching report from Calyon Securities suggesting that total bank loan losses could reach 5.5 % by the end of year 2010 .

Differentiation is a big challenge for everyone and it is an even bigger challenge for PLM vendors .
The reality of developing solutions for engineering and manufacturing is that it is really hard to find how to differentiate yourself from others .
In the end , all manufacturing companies are doing the same …
Editor 's note : Paul Begala , a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor , was a political consultant for Bill Clinton 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House .

Paul Begala says Americans are looking to President Obama to solve problems left by the Bush administration .
( CNN ) -- I love Alex Castellanos .
Heck , somebody has to .
Truth is , we 've been known to break bread after our CNN gigs .
He is engaging and amusing and whip - smart .
But when he said Tuesday night on CNN that President Obama is already looking like a one - term president , he 's full of more beans than a burrito at Matt 's El Rancho back home in Austin , Texas .
Obama inherited an ungodly mess : a $ 1.2 trillion deficit , an economy that was careening from recession into depression , a collapse in effective demand , the disintegration of the real estate market and a financial meltdown that spanned the globe and brought multibillion - dollar institutions to their knees .
That 's not to mention Iraq , Afghanistan , Iran , North Korea and the Mexican drug war .
If this were " Sesame Street , " the announcer would be saying , " This program brought to you by the letters G , O and P. "
None of the crises the president is addressing were of his creation .
All of them were created or worsened by the Republicans who ran the House of Representatives , Senate and White House for years .
And so the American people turned to Obama to bring change -- and change he has brought .
He 's moving on all fronts : addressing the housing foreclosure crisis , the banking crisis , the unemployment crisis .
Did I mention that all of these crises were courtesy of the Republicans who ran this country for years ?
Good .
Now the Republicans have what we Texans call the chutzpah to criticize Obama for doing too much .
Maybe , just maybe , he would n't have to be fixing so many problems if the Republicans had n't created so many problems .
The Republicans are like an arsonist who complains that the fire department is wasting water .
Obama is trying to handle an immediate crisis while also laying the foundation for long - term growth .
The Republicans are doing neither .
They have no plan to stop the loss of jobs or to get capital markets functioning properly -- and they certainly have no plans for health care , education or energy , which are the keys to both long - term economic growth and long - term deficit reduction .
All the energy -- indeed all debate -- is on the progressive side of the aisle .
The Obama administration 's only intellectual challengers are on the left , where economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman and others are offering a vigorous critique and proposing alternative solutions .
But where are the Republicans ?
Doing nothing but complaining .
Unless and until they do offer an alternative , they really have no right to whine about the president .
For now at least , GOP stands for " Got 0 Plans . "

To further ease A.I.G. ’s debt burden , some of its other debt to the government would be converted into equity in two of the insurer ’s subsidiaries in Asia  American International Assurance and the American Life Insurance Company .
Both units are performing well .
This would give the government direct ownership in those subsidiaries and provide saleable assets to American taxpayers even if the A.I.G. holding company were to default on its loans .
The government stake in American International Assurance is likely to be controversial .
The unit had been put up for sale recently , without success .
That suggests that the government is giving A.I.G. better terms than private investors were willing to give , exposing the government to further accusations that it is providing a handout to A.I.G .
Also as part of the deal , the government would agree to lower the interest rate on all remaining A.I.G. debt to match the London Interbank Offered Rate , or Libor .
That would replace the previous rate , which was three percentage points higher than Libor .
That move would save A.I.G. $ 1 billion in interest payments .
The loss that A.I.G. is preparing to report on Monday would be the largest ever by any company in a single quarter .
Still , of the $ 62 billion loss being reported , only about $ 2 billion is a cash loss .
The rest is the result of noncash items like write - downs on the value of the company ’s assets .
The new cash commitment reached on Sunday represented the fourth time since September that the federal government has taken steps to keep A.I.G. from collapsing .
The previous rescues were intended to stabilize A.I.G. and buy it time to restructure .
But the rescues were insufficient , in part because A.I.G. has either invested in or insured so many assets that keep losing value as the economy sours .
In September , the Federal Reserve lent A.I.G. $ 85 billion when the company suddenly found itself unable to meet a round of cash calls .
To secure the emergency loan , A.I.G. issued the Fed warrants for slightly less than 80 percent of the company ’s shares .

Internet Explorer is used by the vast majority of computer users Microsoft is ignoring web standards and should use its position to promote competition among browsers , the chief technology officer at Opera has said .
The complaint comes as Mozilla , the makers of another rival web browser , declared the " browser wars " over at the South by Southwest festival in Texas .
Hakon Wium Lie , from Opera , said : " Microsoft has to make sure there is user choice when it comes to browsers . "
Internet Explorer 's newest version will be standards compliant , Microsoft says .
Mr Lie said Microsoft 's platform dominance gave them an " obligation to promote competition " .
His company has already complained to the EU that Microsoft is using its dominance to promote Internet Explorer over Opera and other browsers .
And Google has lent its support to the complaint .
Mr Lie said he was concerned that Microsoft would use its Windows Software Update System to distribute the forthcoming new version of Internet Explorer to users .
" That system should be used for other browsers too , to ensure users have genuine choice .
Opera says Microsoft needs to promote browser competition " We would be happy to channel Opera into that software update system , " he added .
Firefox down Mozilla 's chief technology officer , Brendan Eich , told BBC News they would support any move to incorporate Firefox into the Windows Update System .
But Chris Wilson , platform architect of the Internet Explorer platform team , said adding other browsers to the automatic updates could confuse users .
He told BBC News : " It could be jarring [ for users ] .
" The move form one browser to another is a bigger leap because they have different UI [ user interfaces ] , different tenets and different missions , " he said .
He pointed out that all the other browsers had their own automatic update systems .
He added : " Microsoft does n't own the ecosystem - we do n't own the OEM [ original equipment manufacturer ] channel .
" Other people can install things on there .
I have had systems with other browsers pre-installed before . "
Hobson 's choice Mr Lie said : " There is a choice for people who are conscious about it - they can download and install them .
" But there is still one dominant browser , Microsoft 's Internet Explorer and most people do n't care or do n't know how to get other browsers .
" There is still room for more competition .
Why does Internet Explorer have so many users when in the past it has been such a terrible browser .
" There are so many better options there , " he added .
Mozilla Firefox has steadily increased its share of the web browsing market Mr Lie said Microsoft had backtracked on a commitment to be standards compliant with Internet Explorer 8 , because the browser would not use default support standards when used on intranets .
Mr Wilson said the company had done this to ensure web developers could continue to use Internet Explorer 7 on their pages while they updated them to Internet Explorer 8 .
Mr Eich said the imminent release of Internet Explorer 8 would see an end to the " browser wars " with users split between the last three versions of Internet Explorer , Firefox 2 , Firefox 3 , Safari , Chrome and Opera .
Mr Wilson agreed the " wars " were shifting into an era of co-operation .
" It 's certainly fair to say there is a lot better co-operation and focus on interoperability across all the browsers . "
Microsoft has faced criticism for " going it alone " in areas such as security and when it acted to fix the problem of so - called click - jacking , which is a cross- scripting method of shifting users from one URL to others without their knowledge .
While the problem affects all browsers , Microsoft implemented a solution on its own .
Mr Wilson said : " You need to respond very quickly otherwise you are leaving users to hang out to dry .
We looked at where we were in the [ development ] cycle and could n't wait for another cycle to address click - jacking . "
He told BBC News : " In security issues you have to get solutions deployed quickly .
We are perfectly happy for other browsers to take that solution and build on it . "

Longstanding tensions among parishioners at the renowned Riverside Church erupted again this week as a group of congregants went to court to stop the installation of a new senior pastor whose compensation package , they say , exceeds $ 600,000 a year .
In a motion filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan , the group said that the new pastor , the Rev. Dr. Brad R. Braxton , and the church board that selected him last September after a yearlong search , had dismissed their calls for transparency in financial matters .
They also complained that Dr. Braxton was moving Riverside away from its tradition of interracial progressivism and toward a conservative style of religious practice .
On Tuesday , a Supreme Court judge , Lewis Bart Stone , effectively denied the motion by adjourning the case to the end of May , a month after Dr. Braxton ’s installation , which is scheduled for Sunday .
The judge urged both sides to reach an accommodation in the case , which was reported on Wednesday by The Daily News .
The church , a Gothic cathedral built in 1930 by John D. Rockefeller at 120th Street and Riverside Drive in Manhattan , stood for many decades at the most heavily trafficked juncture of religious faith and social activism in the United States .
Its pastors were early civil rights advocates who marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and invited him to speak in the pulpit .
Its best - known leader was the fervent civil rights and anti-Vietnam War activist , the Rev. Dr. William Sloane Coffin Jr.
From Second Life Wiki
Summary and Overview
One of the infrastructure tools that we 've identified for the future internal architecture of Second Life is messaging .
Message queuing systems allow systems that send messages to not have to worry about how they will be delivered , and allow consumers of messages to gather whichever ones interest them , at their own pace .
Ideally we'd have a completely scaleable system that clients could treat as singular black box .
It would act as a well - known cluster to which senders or receivers of messages could connect , and be able to communicate asynchronously to or from anywhere else on the grid .
Unfortunately it seems as though this dream , like so many others , is unattainable by any currently available software .
We investigated around 15 open source systems that were explicitly designed for message queueing and found that none of them achieved this ideal .
Our use cases mostly involve very large numbers of queues ; the smallest number we 're even considering is double the number of concurrent users .
Our largest use case would be of the same order of magnitude as registered users .
This means that we have to plan for millions , and probably tens or hundreds of millions , of message queues , since we want whatever system we choose to last us until then .
Pretty much all of the message queue systems we investigated are intended to maximize message throughput rather than number of consumers .
The clustering that they implement mainly serves as additional horsepower to deliver more message throughput .
In particular the clustering we 've seen replicates all state to every machine in the cluster , meaning that the cluster cannot add queues beyond the capacity of an individual node .
In order to have a solution that scales in terms of number of queues , each node will have to be able to contain a subset of the global state -- it actually seems as though such a message system would want to be coupled with a distributed storage system .
In any case , given that we expect that we'd have to develop our own queue scaling solution that involves partitioning , which may or may not be a task we are interested in taking on , the strongest candidates are RabbitMQ and Apache QPID .
Both are mature products that support AMQP ( though they support different versions ) .
Both have strong vendor support , and both have good single - host performance numbers .
There is some more investigation to be done -- we'd like to know their true maximum capacity when clustered , to evaluate whether it 's worth clustering at all , given that we have to implement partitioning ourselves anyway .
We 're unfortunately pretty far from having closed the case on which technology to choose , or even if we can use any of these at all .
Investigation will continue !
Criteria
Questions
Support for consuming messages in our two main languages , Python and C++
Support for producing them in all of our main languages ( or , e.g. , an HTTP gateway )
What 's the raw message rate that a single server can handle at different message sizes ( e.g. 1 byte , 128 bytes , 1 K , 128K ) ?
What are the latency figures for these message rates ?
What are the server 's clustering characteristics ?
HA / failover
scalability for message quantity
scalability for number of clients / queues
What about cross -colo traffic ?
Does it do SSL , does it need tunneling , is it designed to deal with interrupted communications ?
How do the health of the protocol standard , the software , and the community look ?
Can we engage people on support and development contracts if necessary ?
Is it possible to set up persistent queues , where undelivered messages will survive server restarts ?
For some interesting perspectives , see " What Matters in an Asynchronous Job Queue " and this discussion on persistence and failure scenarios .
The major use cases that we believe could be implemented with message queues are these :
IM
blue box notifications in the viewer
group notices
group chat
group votes
presence notifications
anything else that currently is an ImprovedInstantMessage
friendship
details of registration such as initial inventory
requests to regenerate map tiles
Many other uses that we have n't put up there would arise when developing various applications .
Note that we do not intend to expose the message queue system directly to the viewer ; we would use it instead for behind - the - scenes implementation of the above use cases .
Discussing the protocol by which the viewer sends and receives messages with the server is far outside the scope of this research .
Group Chat Use Case
The primary use case that we examined was that of group chat .
This is the most obvious use that we'd put message queues to , and it's also one of the only use cases up there that is a current pain point for Residents .
Here are some numbers describing group chat , which were captured at 11 am one day :
online residents : ~68,000
number of group chats : 131953
number of memberships : 629637
avg number of groups / resident : 9.3
average group size : 4.8
most online members in a group : 785
stdev group size : 13.1
group churn / second : 23.2
membership churn / second : 260
messages sent / second : 8.6
Please note : this data was measured some time ago , and every value you see has increased by today , and will continue to grow for the forseeable future .
It was not enough for us to pick a technology that could just barely handle the current load ; we have to pessimistically assume that whatever we pick will be used for many years hence , and will therefore have to deal with at least an order of magnitude more of everything .
Our minimum hurdle for a platform is 4 x the above values , and ideally could horizontally scale nearly infinitely across the most important axes to us : number of group chats , number of memberships , and messages / second .
Group churn represents the number of groups added or removed from the system every second .
In an AMQP - based system a " group " would be added when someone binds the first queue to the a key representing the group 's id , and the group would be dropped when the last binding to the key is removed .
In any routing system of this nature , there will be two data structures that are the inverse of each other : one is queuename -> keys table and the other is the keys -> queuenames table .
Group churn would primarily affect the keys -> queuenames table .
Membership churn comes from agents joining and leaving groups , and is indirectly related to group churn .
There is vastly more membership churn because each agent is in roughly 9 groups -- one agent logs in for 15 seconds and then logs out , that 's 18 points of " churn " .
In an AMQP - based system this churn would be visible as bindings being added and dropped , which would thus affect the queuename -> keys table .
Both types of churn are substantially higher than messaging rate .
Even if we successfully implement a feature that will allow residents to opt out of joining group chat on login , I 'd guess that we'd see at most a 75 % reduction in churn as a result , which would still leave membership churn nearly an order of magnitude larger than messages sent .
The group size metrics are interesting because it implies that most groups are pretty small .
The downside is we have roughly 2 unique groups for every concurrent resident , so our group system has to scale along that axis very well .
Overall , these numbers are a real whack upside the head because they reveal that for our particular use case , we worry far more about number of queues , and ability to handle high churn , than we do about message delivery rate .
Most of the benchmarks regarding the software we evaluated optimize for message rate rather than churn or quantity of queues .
Note that Twitter has a similar set of requirements ( complete with startlingly low message rate ) , though they do n't have such tight latency requirements as we do .
Scaling
Given that we have n't found any system that provides seamless scaling along the axis of queues , we have come up with some designs for how the system could be partitioned .
Any partition scheme is a bit of a downer because then the clients have to know about the partitioning .
The best way to partition is probably to partition on routing key .
When a client wants to receive messages for a routing key , or when a sender wants to send to a routing key , the first thing it does is ask a redirector which slice to talk to .
The system would look like :
This system has the property that each client will be talking to as many slices as routing keys of interest ( proportional , anyhow ) .
This may be acceptable for an application where there 's only a finite number of routing keys that any particular client may be interested in ( such as group chat , where there 's an upper limit on the number of groups a resident may be in ) .
We could cut down on the sheer quantity of connections by using clustering to reduce the number of slices .
The messaging technologies we looked at support clustering in a way that would allow us to create clusters of 2 - 3 nodes that have roughly 1.5 - 2 times the quantity of queues as a single node .
This would be a more complex system than not using clustering at all , but it would reduce the number of slices , and thus connections , by a factor of 1.5 - 2 , which may be important .
The clustered partition scheme is n't fundamentally different than the unclustered partition scheme , it 's just a constant - factor optimization .
However , if the cluster added high - availability properties ( such as being able to continue running even when one node fails ) , then it would be worth it .
Currently Available Software
AMQ Protocol
AMQP is a developing standard that is aimed pretty squarely at our use cases : high - performance , flexible , message routing and delivery .
The standard is being iterated upon and is not finalized yet .
This is a risk factor because it's a moving target and all current editions are mutually incompatible -- the 0 - 10 edition is nontrivially different from 0 - 8 , and I 've read some rumors that the next edition removes or changes some of the core concepts in a dramatic way .
We believe that AMQP is the appropriate standard for our use cases ; therefore we investigated the AMQP servers much more heavily .
Here 's a decent example of how to apply AMQP to a particular use case ( with emphasis on Rabbit ) .
RabbitMQ
Rabbit Home
RabbitMQ is already installed in our image and is currently being deployed by the data warehousing team ( Ivan in particular ) to handle syslog message delivery .
Support for consuming messages in our two main languages , Python and C ++?
Yes , many python clients and carrot - rabbit Support for producing them in all of our main languages ( or e.g. an HTTP gateway ) Yes , they have HTTP and Stomp gateways .
What 's the raw message rate that a single server can handle at different message sizes ( e.g. 1 byte , 128 bytes , 1 K , 128K ) ?
Not investigated because widespread reports indicate that this number is very high ; this will not be a bottleneck .
What are the latency figures for these message rates ?
Latency is in tens of microseconds .
What are the server 's clustering characteristics ?
HA / failover Weak .
If clustered , the cluster behaves poorly when nodes go away , until their data is restored ; see [ 1 ] .
The developers suggested setting up two queues on two hosts and doing client - side duplicate removal , but this seems like we'd be doing work that the message queue system should be doing for us .
scalability for message quantity Untested but theoretically clustering improves this .
scalability for number of clients / queues
Not supported .
Currently a single Rabbit node will support up to 250,000 queues before consuming all available memory .
If clustered with a second host , the second host will have 800 MB of its memory consumed as well even though it 's not doing any work .
This is because all hosts in a cluster contain a complete copy of the routing tables .
The data structures required for queues themselves are stored on the first host , and consume the other 1200 MB available .
This implies that if queues were evenly added to both hosts , we could probably get up to around 400,000 queues total .
We 'd like to test that hypothesis .
What about cross -colo traffic ?
Not if hosts in a cluster are cross -colo from each other .
There 's a plugin called shovel that is explicitly designed for cross - colo situations , though .
However , if clustering does n't support the number of queues we want , there 's little reason to worry about clusters that span colos .
The wire protocol is believed to be robust against flaky connections ; it 's hard to test that though .
Does it do SSL , does it need tunneling , is it designed to deal with interrupted communications ?
Supports SSL , however this appears to be both outside of the spec and a bit of a hack .
AMQP as a whole does n't yet have an ssl story , so we'd have to go outside the spec to achieve security .
How do the health of the protocol standard , the software , and the community look ?
Strong .
Rabbit in particular has a relatively strong community -- ~500 messages per month on mailing list and key developers respond frequently .
Can we engage people on support and development contracts if necessary ?
Yes , we already have contacts with them and have already gotten enhancements .
Is it possible to set up persistent queues , where undelivered messages will survive server restarts ?
Yes .
These are not replicated .
Notes :
~5000 lines of code ( i.e. not many places to hide bugs )
Queues can fill up available memory if clients can't consume non-immediate messages quickly enough ( immediate messages get discarded if a client can't consume them ) .
RabbitMQ Performance Testing and Troubles
Even in clustered configuration , queues only reside on a single machine .
Blog oriented towards Rabbit
http://everburning.com/news/tag/amqp/
Ruby - oriented but examples are pretty clear

http://somic.org/2008/11/11/using-rabbitmq-beyond-queueing/
http://www.lshift.net/blog/category/lshift-sw/rabbitmq/
In our tests , if you create a bunch of auto - delete queues ( ~100 ) , the rabbit server becomes unresponsive for 2 minutes after you remove the clients ( presumably because the server starts deleting the queues when you remove the clients ) .
We generally have to restart the server .
This may be problematic in production ; we should generate a test case that repros this .
py - amqplib requires Python > 2.4

Restarting individual hosts in a cluster is seamless -- it totally comes back together without any extra work , yay .
Rabbit ( and mnesia ) is very sensitive to DHCP / DNS failures .
We had a DHCP failure on our host , and it corrupted everything , leading to rogue beam processes and messed up mnesia files .
Had to nuke everything .

Apache QPID / Red Hat MRG
http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/qpid/Index
http://www.redhat.com/mrg/
QPID is sort of a compilation project from Apache .
They have a pile of clients , and two brokers that each support different versions of the AMQP standard .
The C++ broker appears to be where the good stuff is at .
Installing it was not difficult -- it only required a few additional Boost libraries to be installed .
Support for consuming messages in our two main languages , Python and C++
Yes , comes bundled with clients in both .
Support for producing them in all of our main languages ( or e.g. an HTTP gateway )
No , only python and C ++.
What 's the raw message rate that a single server can handle at different message sizes ( e.g. 1 byte , 128 bytes , 1K , 128K ) ?
Untested ; again , not likely to be a bottleneck .
What are the latency figures for these message rates ?
Untested , it comes with a perftest tool that we should run .
What are the server 's clustering characteristics ?
HA / failover Queue Replication could be used in conjunction with client failover to implement HA queues .
Untested .
scalability for message quantity Unknown .
scalability for number of clients / queues The C++ broker tops out at around 500,000 queues per host .
We have n't yet determined whether this number can be increased by clustering / federation .
What about cross -colo traffic ?
Does it do SSL , does it need tunneling , is it designed to deal with interrupted communications ?
Same as rabbit ; these questions are properties of AMQP .
How do the health of the protocol standard , the software , and the community look ?
Relatively small community , though active .
721 messages to qpid-dev list in December 2008 , though 90 % seem to be JIRA spam ; only 71 to qpid-users .
Can we engage people on support and development contracts if necessary ?
Red Hat supports a version called MRG -- unknown whether we could get them to help us use it on Debian . ;-)
Is it possible to set up persistent queues , where undelivered messages will survive server restarts ?
Yes .
Notes :
MRG is based on QPID , per this page .
Client libs : C++ , Java , Ruby , Python , C# . Only the C++ client appears to have any documentation .
http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/qpid/Documentation
<-- this link was surprisingly hard to find
Python client is annoying to use .
Before even getting started you have to set an environment variable pointing at the spec ( export AMQP_SPEC=/tmp/qpid/qpid-M4/specs/amqp.0-10.xml ) and modify the spec file itself to point at the DTD because relative paths do n't work for some reason .
The code is written poorly ; no comments , run-on functions , uses long - deprecated things like raise " string " everywhere .
Also , it 's slow as hell starting up and at runtime .
Finding another 0 - 10 compatible python client would be important .
OpenAMQ
http://www.openamq.org/
This product has been eliminated from the race
http://www.openamq.org/doc:user-3-advanced
Supports HA via primary / secondary failover , EXCEPT " What we do not attempt to do includes : ...
The handling of persistent messages or transactions in any way ..... Replication of exchanges , queues , bindings , or messages between servers .
All server - side state much be recreated by applications when they fail over . "
HA support is mutually exclusive from federation support .
Supports federation ; we 'd want to use the " locator " federation type .
Seems immature ; few docs , not a strong community -- however , it 's actually pretty old .
Implements a subset of AMQP 0.9
http://amqp.wdfiles.com/local--files/deleted:library:cluster/clustering.pdf
Java centric , no bindings for other languages we love to use .
XMPP
ejabberd
http://www.ejabberd.im/
This product has NOT been eliminated , but we did not evaluate it for want of time .
Clients : http://www.jabber.org/web/Clients
Widely deployed and super - popular .
XMPP seems to not be the best fit for generic applications -- it seems that it could at best solve the group - chat and person - to - person IM cases , if at all .
AMP Extension
http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0079.html
Message queue extension , available for ejabberd via this patch .
This extension adds :
Reliable data transport -- the sender requires notification ( positive and / or negative ) of message delivery .
Time - sensitive messages -- the message is valid only until a certain date and time .
Transient messages -- the message should not be stored offline for later delivery .
The AMP extension is immature and has no client support -- we'd be going it ourselves if we wanted to use that .
We might decide that we do n't need the AMP extension 's semantics .
PubSub Extension
http://www.ejabberd.im/mod_pubsub-usage
http://ppolv.wordpress.com/2007/11/28/managing-a-jabber-pubsub-service/
Does n't seem to be client support for this , but it 's probably better than AMP extension client support and I have n't looked especially hard yet .
Stomp
Products that support primarily the Stomp protocol .
http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol
Stomp is a message passing scheme that is tremendously simple .
It kinda looks like HTTP , but it 's actually even simpler .
The simplicity is both a strength and a weakness .
Human - readable
Requires null - termination of message bodies ; the spec implies that it 's OK to include nulls in the message body if a content - length header is included , but if the header is not supplied nulls are not acceptable .
This article and subsequent discussion is interesting .
Underspecified header syntax means implementations might differ w.r.t. all - dashes , spaces between : and header body , capitalization , etc .
There are stomp clients written in nearly every language ; since the protocol is so simple it seems as if people write new clients whenever they encounter even the slightest problem with someone else 's client .
stomp.py -- nicely written , but seems to be just barely maintained by a guy who does n't really use it any more .
Its error reporting sucks ( prints java exceptions to stdout , does n't give any feedback to python program ) .
But it works !
ActiveMQ
http://activemq.apache.org/
This product has been eliminated from the race
Related Jira : < jira>DEV-19958</jira >
HA via master / slave failover built - in : http://activemq.apache.org/masterslave.html
It 's not great , but it 's better than " you lost all your shit ! "
Does not support AMQP ( how did we miss this earlier ? )
Clustering built - in with autodiscovery .
It 's very nice to start up activemq on two machines and see them find each other automagically .
Broker fails after opening 700 queues on a node due to too many open files -- apparently it has a tempfile for each queue , and an open file for each JAR ( of which there are 124 ! ) , and 60 miscellaneous filehandles .
The number of open files does not decrease when the client quits .
Some googling implies that there are numerous bugs in ActiveMQ relating to leaked filehandles .
Even if you cluster two nodes together , each created subscription opens a new filehandle on both nodes in the cluster !
This means that the total number of queues creatable in a clustered system is very small .
Sprinkle
http://www.thuswise.org/sprinkle/index.html
This product has been eliminated from the race
Consumes 100 % of CPU when idle .
Requires an external process to create a new directory for each queue -- no way to create queues by talking to the server ( unless you hook up a demon listening to a special meta -queue for messages to create new queues ... an approach that is appealing in its purity , but ... no )
JMS
JMS is a Java API for asynchronous messaging .
In a charming bit of java - centrism it specifies the API that a java program sees , but not a wire protocol or anything like that ; I can only assume that each client is intended to develop its own custom wire protocol for talking to the broker , but there is n't much information about this out there .
Some of the clients that support Stomp or AMQP also support some subset of JMS , and presumably the JMS API simply uses Stomp or AMQP as the wire protocol .
The development of the wire protocols have been influenced somewhat by the needs of JMS .

Other
Products that have their own protocol .
These are generally less interesting to us because they are already at a disadvantage relative to implementations of a particular protocol in terms of community size , possibility of paid support , and being able to replace them with a different implementation if the need arises .
However , we still take these into consideration in the hopes of finding a diamond in the rough .

The argument that we should be using a message queueing protocol rather than a key - value protocol is convincing to us .
The impedance mismatch between what the memcache protocol is trying to do and what we want out of a message queue system is quite large and it seems our effort is better spent trying to find something that is designed for the purpose .

A love forged in flames :
The awe - inspiring story of how a badly - burned soldier married his sweetheart
Martyn Compton , a headstrong young soldier , met Michelle Clifford in a Kent pub in January 2006 , and at their very first meeting he knew she was ' the one ' .
From that day on , the couple were virtually inseparable and , in June , Martyn picked a gold and silver engagement ring and asked Michelle to marry him .
She lost no time in saying ' yes ' .
The only cloud on their blissfully happy horizon was that Martyn - then aged just 22 - was about to be posted to Afghanistan for his first tour of duty with the Household Cavalry .
Michelle , a teacher three years his senior , was characteristically practical .
' Well , it 's your job , ' she told him .
Five weeks later , Martyn and his colleagues drove into a Taliban ambush .
Three of his friends died instantly when a rocket propelled grenade slammed into the armoured vehicle that Martyn was driving .
Proud moment : Against all the odds , Martyn finally fulfilled his dream of walking down the aisle to marry Michelle
Martyn , however , survived both that and a second grenade attack , but was appallingly injured in the subsequent explosions and fighting .
Hovering on the brink of death , he was flown back to Britain with 75 per cent burns to his body and a badly broken leg shattered by a Taliban bullet .
No one knew whether he would live .
But equally , no one knew whether the couple 's still very new love would survive .
The handsome young man Michelle had waved a tearful goodbye to only a few weeks earlier had gone for ever ; no one would have blamed her if she 'd walked away from the almost unrecognisable figure who , swathed in bandages and dressings , now lay in a coma in an Essex military hospital .
Told in their own words , Home From War is the truly inspiring story of what happened next - although their story begins with Martyn's recollection of the day that was to change their lives utterly .
Martyn : Helmand Province Afghanistan August 1 , 2006
The Taliban fighter peered over the wall .
I recognised the unmistakable warhead of his rocket - propelled grenade .
He was close and I was going nowhere .
Stuck inside the ruined hulk of my wagon , I was a sitting duck .
Fire and smoke were pouring everywhere - the machine - gun turret had dropped into the tank .
The roof was gone .
The back door was gone .
The floor was gone .
And my crew was gone .
All I could do was hope for the best .
I 'd survived the initial attack after we 'd driven into this seemingly deserted village , so maybe my luck was in .
Love at first sight : Martyn , with Michelle , before the grenade attack in Afghanistan
The Taliban tilted his head , aimed his launcher right at me and fired .
The grenade hurtled towards me , trailing a plume of smoke .
It shot past my shoulder and hit the Spartan 's engine .
The engine exploded .
The fireball swallowed me .
Michelle : Frittenden , Kent , August 1 - 2 , 2006
I felt a buzzing in my handbag and signalled to Ella , the hairdresser , to switch the dryer off .
I pulled the phone out of my pocket ; it was Martyn 's dad .
' Michelle there 's been an accident , ' Rob said .
I caught my breath .
In an instant , the world shrank to nothing apart from Rob 's voice .
' Martyn 's seriously hurt . '
When I arrived at Rob's , two officers were there - one in uniform , one in civvies .
Rob , Martyn 's devoted dad , sat in his armchair .
Sarah , my best friend , was there and so was Tom , one of Martyn 's closest Army pals who was now married to his stepsister , Sophie .
I sat next to them , silent , still , intent .
' There was an ambush this morning , ' said the one in uniform .
' Three soldiers were killed and Martyn suffered serious burns .
He 's very seriously injured . '
' When can I see him ? '
That was the only thing that mattered : seeing my man .
' Martyn will be flown into the UK as soon as he 's stable .
We 'll keep in touch . '
When the officers had gone , Tom put his arm round me .
' You can cry if you want to ; no point bottling things up . '
I shed a few tears and then I thought of Martyn .
What was he going through , while I was sitting there crying ?
I made a decision there and then : I would be strong for Martyn .
I would n't cry again .
I needed to hold things together , for Martyn 's sake .
On the evening of the next day , Martyn was flown home and Rob and I drove to Broomfield Hospital , near Chelmsford , to meet him .
What none of us knew was that Broomfield was to become the centre of our lives for the next four months .
Michelle : Broomfield Hospital , August 2 , 2006
At 11.30 pm , the moment came .
Rob was taken in first .
He was only in with his son for a few minutes , but it seemed like an hour .
He came out , looking as if someone had stolen his soul .
He struggled for the right words .
' Michelle , prepare yourself .
He looks awful .
You wo n't know it 's Martyn . '
' I will , ' I said , ' I will recognise Martyn . '
I was taken into a gowning room and given a blue plastic gown and mask .
My hands shook as I tied the mask .
I could feel my heart banging against my ribcage and hear my blood throbbing in my ears .
The happiest moment : Martyn and Michelle struggled to hold back tears of joy on their wedding day
Everything went into slow motion as the door swung open and there , amid a macabre nest of ominous wires and machinery , was Martyn .
He was bandaged from head to toe .
His body was abnormally huge and metal rods pierced his thigh .
All I could see was his face , which , although it was grotesquely swollen , I still recognised as Martyn's .
There were two holes where his nose had been , with a tube disappearing into each one .
A large black nozzle plugged his lips , which were enormous .
His eyebrows were black and singed ; his cheeks were black and cracked .
His eyes were slightly open , staring but vacant .
I shuddered at the violence .
Then I looked at his neck , which was as wide as his head and had a large gash in it , several inches long .
Deep and red , it was horrific .
I wanted to scream .
In my head , I said : ' I love you .
Please live , ' and hoped he would somehow hear me .
The doctors kept Martyn heavily sedated for weeks , during which he underwent many operations and skin grafts .
Over that time , Michelle and Rob maintained an almost constant vigil by his bedside , with Michelle taking a growing interest in understanding Martyn 's medical condition and the future care he would require .
Eventually , however , his sedation was gradually decreased and , from the increased activity on his heart monitor , it was clear he was beginning to respond to outside stimuli around him and , in particular , to Michelle 's voice .
Michelle : Broomfield Hospital , August 29 , 2006
It has been good talking to you for the last few days ; I can't wait for the day when you can talk to me again .
You had another nine - hour operation today , so Sarah took me shopping , which was nice of her .
By the way , I booked our wedding today .
It will be at the Port Lympne Wild Animal Park on July 12 , 2008 .
So you have something to aim for now .
And I tried a wedding dress on ; it was lovely .
Michelle was never in any doubt that she would not marry Martyn
This August has been the most dreadful month of my life and I 've been willing it to end on a positive note .
And tonight it did .
We were in intensive care after they 'd closed your tracheotomy to see if you could breathe for yourself .
As I watched your chest rise and fall , I knew it had been a success .
' Do you love me ? ' I asked .
You slowly nodded your head .
' Ca n't you tell me ? '
Then you said it ; a tiny , imperceptible breath that sparked a bonfire in my heart : ' I love you . '
Michelle : Broomfield Hospital , September , 2006
I dipped my little fingers in the orange juice , placed them into the corners of Martyn's mouth and pulled his mouth open .
I grimaced .
I knew it hurt him but that 's scar management : if it 's not hurting , it 's not working .
It also occurred to me that I was now doing for Martyn things I would expect to do at the end of his life , not in his 20s .
But when you plan to take someone in sickness and health , there are n't any regulations on timing .
But there were rewards , as an urgent call from Rob one day proved .
' We 've got some news , ' was all he said .
I rushed back to the hospital , holding my breath as I walked into Martyn's room , not knowing what I would find .
' Hello , babe , ' he said , ' Are you all right ? '
Elation washed over me in waves , tears threatened to gush down my face .
I could n't believe the joy I was feeling .
Martyn's voice may have been quiet and weak but it was back and , this time , it was back to stay .
' Yes , darling , I 'm all right , ' I said .
' You ? '
Martyn : Broomfield Hospital , September 2006
I had an urgent question to ask someone but it could n't be just anybody .
I waited until I was on my own with a male doctor .
' How are you today , Martyn ? ' he asked .
' Fine , ' I replied .
I always said I was fine .
' Erm ..?'
The doctor lifted his head , as I tried to look in the direction of what was concerning me .
' Everything 's all right , is it - down there ? '
I asked .
' No bits missing ? '
The doctor smiled .
' Everything 's fine down there , Martyn .
You 've been lucky . '
' Nice one , ' I said .
I looked around my hospital room , at all the pictures Michelle had pinned up - family and friends , all grinning , all posing .
And then I saw the pictures of Port Lympne and I felt something churn in my guts .
We were getting married there in a couple of years .
But would Michelle want to marry me now ?
My fears were allayed when I heard her voice , when she told me she loved me .
And I loved her so much .
I made a decision .
I did n't know how I was going to do it but I 'd die trying .
I was going to walk Michelle down the aisle .
I was going to be the best bridegroom I could be .
And after that , I 'd be the best husband .
Martyn : Broomfield Hospital , October 31 , 2006
Joanna , my occupational therapist , entered the room , carrying a mirror .
It was pressed against her , the glass turned away from me .
Michelle gripped my hand .
' I know you want to go outside , Martyn , and we 've got a wheelchair ready .
But before you do , you need to know what you look like .
Are you ready ? '
Michelle and I looked at one another and I turned towards Joanna and nodded .
It was three months since the incident .
I knew that 75 per cent burns meant I could n't look good but I had no idea what to expect .
Martyn Compton thought Michelle would no longer want to marry him with his badly - scarred face
But Joanna gave me a pretty good idea , verbalising what I would see to lessen the shock : ' You look very different but you are the same person underneath .
Your mouth is tight and you 've lost the tip of your nose and your ears . '
If this was lessening the shock , I was n't sure it was working .
' Your eyelids are turned slightly inside out and the texture of your skin is red and wrinkled . '
She looked at me .
' Call me if you need me , ' and then she left Michelle and me alone .
Slowly I brought the mirror up .
I knew it was me but the Martyn I remembered had gone .
My skin was red raw and scarred .
The fire had sliced me open and given me a good kicking .
Shock washed over me .
I began to cry and so did Michelle .
Eventually , I spoke .
' I look horrible . '
Could Michelle really imagine a life with me ?
With this face ?
' Are you sure you still want to be with me ? '
I asked .
' If the situation was reversed , would you still want to be with me ?'
' Of course , ' I replied .
' There 's your answer .
But I 'm telling you straight , if you 're going to become a recluse and stay in the house and hide , then I 'll walk away because that 's not you .
But if you stay the same Martyn I fell in love with , then I 'll always be with you - always . '
Martyn was eventually discharged from Broomfield on December 11 , 2006 , but he still faced many more operations and months , if not years , of physiotherapy and rehabilitation .
As Peter Dziewulski , his consultant at Broomfield , had told him : ' A burn is for life . '
He went to live with Michelle and her parents , who widened doorways to accommodate his wheelchair and converted a downstairs room into a bedroom for the couple .
Martyn : Frittenden , Kent , December 2006
I left Broomfield more grateful than I could ever express and on good terms with everyone , except , possibly , the nutritionist who did n't think I was eating enough .
I just knew I needed to get back to some good old home cooking and that first night at Michelle 's parents , Rosie and Brian , was a great start to my new eating regime , which basically meant scoffing anything put in front of me .
I was tired .
It had been a long day .
It was time I was in bed .
But I 'd not slept in a normal bed for five months and I 'd not shared a bed with Michelle in all that time , either .
My heart thundered .
I did n't know what it would be like .
But lying next to her was wonderful .
Feeling her body next to mine , for the first time since I 'd left for Afghanistan , was a moment I treasure and keep in my heart .
My skin was ravaged and I could n't move much or shift towards her but the sensation of Michelle snuggling up to me was magical .
It was everything .
I closed my eyes and felt calmness wash over me .
I was home .
I was with Michelle .
There was nothing else .
Friends and family were never far away , there were regular visits from mates from the Regiment , including one from Andrew Radford , the father of four who risked his life to rescue Martyn under heavy Taliban fire and was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for bravery .
There were also morale - boosting visits from Simon Weston , the Welsh Guardsman who was badly burned during the Falklands War and an introduction to the Household Cavalry 's best - known recruit , Prince William , who has taken a personal interest in Martyn and Michelle ever since .
But , best of all , in the complex trauma gym at Headley Court rehabilitation centre , between two hand height parallel bars , Martyn took his first faltering and excruciatingly painful , steps .
His dream of walking Michelle down the aisle was very much alive .
Martyn : Headley Court , August , 2007
A year from the incident and six months into rehab , I was making incredible progress - eating with normal cutlery , building up my strength and even walking quite well .
But now I faced a new challenge : stairs .
The Household Cavalry had been with me through all my highs and lows , so it was appropriate that Will , the commanding officer of D - Squadron , and Alistair , my brilliant liaison officer , were there for the occasion .
I made it up those seven steps but it was bloody hard work , with Will and Al there cheering me on .
I felt like Rocky when I got to the top .
If we'd had a bottle of champagne , I 'd have cracked it open there and then .
But we did n't , so we had a cuppa instead .
Martyn : Westfield , East Sussex , June , 2008
Suddenly , in our house there was blood everywhere .
I 'd cut my finger slicing some bread , so off I went to hospital to have it stitched .
It felt ridiculous , really - me with all my injuries waiting to be treated for what I 'd consider a scratch .
So , when I 'd been waiting around for a while , my impatience got the better of me and I told the nurse I was going home , bleeding finger and all .
' You ca n't go home , ' she told me briskly , ' you 'll need to have that stitched or you 'll have a nasty scar . '
She stopped dead and gawped at me , her mouth open .
She realised what she 's said .
Nasty scar .
I did n't have any ears , for God 's sake .
Embarrassment flushed her cheeks but I smiled and showed her that I did n't mind .
People have just got to get used to me .
This is how I am .
I 'm a peace with it now .
Martyn : Blackpool , July 4/5 , 2008 .
The Stag Night
What a night .
I did n't buy a beer all night .
The club was packed and people kept coming up to me and asking if I 'd like a beer .
And I kept saying I would .
I think it was down to the T - shirt that my mates had made especially for the occasion .
On the front was a picture of me and Michelle and the words : ' Blown Up , Set Alight And Shot By The Taliban ' , while on the back it read ' I Survived Death To Walk My Fiancee Michelle Down The Aisle ' .
It was a brilliant night .
Michelle : Port Lympne , July 12 , 2008 .
Wedding Day
' Dad , slow down . '
I wanted to savour the moment .
Two cavalrymen trumpeted their fanfare ; it was amazing to have such a salute at my wedding .
I could n't have dreamed of this .
I was almost there .
It had been a long hard journey but I was about to stand beside the man I loved , the man I had seen lying torn and broken and burned in a hospital bed less than two years before .
The man who'd said he'd walk me down the aisle , despite some people doubting he'd ever stand again .
And now , here he was waiting for me at the top of the steps lined by our guard of honour .
He looked so handsome in his morning suit and black headscarf .
He smiled down at me and my heart leapt .
I felt a tug on my dress .
' Dad , do n't stand on my dress . '
And with that dad walked me up the steps , past the guard of honour , to Martyn , the man I was about to marry .
When I got to his side , I held his hand and looked him in the eye .
We smiled at each other and I could n't believe how lucky we were to be standing there .
Martyn : Port Lympne , July 12 , 2008
I waited on the terrace with my two best men , nervous as hell .
I heard the ' oohs ' and ' ahs ' that signalled Michelle 's arrival .
By this time , I could hardly stand .
My stomach churned with anxiety .
The wait seemed like for ever .
The Household Cavalry trumpeters started playing the Knightsbridge Fanfare I turned around and , suddenly , there she was , gliding round the corner , the girl who meant everything to me .
My heart sang and the tears came easy .
And yes , later , after the ceremony , I did walk my bride ' down the aisle ' as I 'd promised myself , but when the big moment I was so overcome by the joy of the occasion that I 'd forgotten all about my pledge .
You see at that moment , I was n't Martyn , the injured soldier , I was just Martyn .
Martyn the husband who had just married Michelle , the most beautiful bride in the world .
Open source software allows users to read and alter code
The UK government has said it will accelerate the use of open source software in public services .
Tom Watson MP , minister for digital engagement , said open source software would be on a level playing field with proprietary software such as Windows .
Open source software will be adopted " when it delivers best value for money " , the government said .
It added that public services should where possible avoid being " locked into proprietary software " .
Licences for the use of open source software are generally free of charge and embrace open standards , and the code that powers the programs can be modified without fear of trampling on intellectual property or copyright .
According to some in the open source industry , the shift from proprietary standards could save the government £ 600 m a year .
Simon Phipps , chief open source officer for Sun Microsystems , said the UK government 's stance was part of a " global wave " of take up for open source in governments .
Open source can help avoid many of the hidden costs of proprietary software
Steve Shine , Ingres " We waste a fortune on proprietary computer software because of paying for licences and promises up front and not demanding value , " he said .
Mr Phipps said schools , government departments and public services would have a " crucial freedom " because of the choice of whether to pay for support and training when using open source software .
The government 's action plan could see a wave of open source software being deployed in areas such as office applications ( word processing and spreadsheets ) , document management and database infrastructure , the backbone of many large - scale IT systems .
' More teeth ' Steve Shine , European vice president of Ingres , an open source support vendor , said the government 's action plan had " more teeth " than policies being adopted in other countries because the plan was tied into policies regarding how IT managers procure new software .
He said the move had partly been driven by a series of high - profile IT failures in recent years that had relied on proprietary software .
He said : " Open source can help avoid many of the hidden costs of proprietary software such as making organisations re-pay for licences if they want to shift use of a particular piece of software from one place to another .
" This is irrelevant in the open source world . "
Announcing an open source and open standards action plan , the government said it would : ensure that the government adopts open standards and uses these to communicate with the citizens and businesses that have adopted open source solutions
ensure that open source solutions are considered properly and , where they deliver best value for money are selected for government business solutions
strengthen the skills , experience and capabilities within government and in its suppliers to use open source to greatest advantage
embed an open source culture of sharing , re-use and collaborative development across government and its suppliers
ensure that systems integrators and proprietary software suppliers demonstrate the same flexibility and ability to re-use their solutions and products as is inherent in open source .
Government departments will be required to adopt open source software when " there is no significant overall cost difference between open and non-open source products " because of its " inherent flexibility " .
Expected backlash Mr Phipps and Mr Shine said they expected a backlash from proprietary software firms .
" I am absolutely certain there have been communications extremely high - up in proprietary vendors with management high up in government , " said Mr Shine .
Mr Phipps added : " Measured over the short term traditional vendors will cut prices back , end load contacts and do everything to appear cheaper .
" But the real value with open source comes from giving users a new flexibility . "
He said the widespread adoption of open source software in public services could also have a knock on effect to the ordinary consumer .
" It 's already happening to significant extent in the UK .
Lots of homes are using Firefox and OpenOffice.org .
" It is becoming acceptable and expected . "

Dear Reddit :
I love you .
You are my sexy internet significant other .
But this madness with the subreddits has got to stop before it destroys your relevance and usability .
Subreddits became a sexy solution when Reddit became overpopulated and divided among tastes and preferences ( Namely the : I hate politics / Why is n’t every post about Ruby on Rails community ) .
But the sexiness quickly died down because subreddits became so dichotomous — where the hell are you supposed to put up content that is funny , a picture , and a WTF ?
You ca n’t cross post to three subreddits , and you ’re likely to get your posted deleted if it has anything political injected into the post .
A lot of content has no home on the current Reddit set - up , which is both frustrating and debilitating to someone new to the community .
Further , the subreddits have led to an oligarchy of power and moderation .
If you look at the top 10 most popular subreddits , they are moderated by the same 3 or 4 individuals .
What ’s worse is its become common practice to ban users and domains from subreddits without any cause or communication .
So , if you become the target of one uber - moderators vindictive wrath ( and trust me , there are some very spiteful fucks running the show ) , your chances of Reddit accessibility are dismal .
So , what is the outcome ?
The most popular subreddit , Pics , is somehow both over - moderated and yet the biggest purveyor of crap and duplicates on Reddit .
Cross-posts and repeats become common place , thus increasing the homogeneity of content across the board .
Likewise , the same couple of individuals are able to dictate content and control over the majority of Reddit .
This situation reminds me of Slashdot in 2002 .
At the height of its popularity , it decided to reign in its community system using a surface level democratic system of moderation and karma .
But what really happened was more of a virtual feudal state , where the nobles of moderation debilitated creative content and destroyed the fabric of the community , driving off users in droves .
I fear Reddit is on the verge of repeating Slashdots mistakes .
Ever since Governor Mark Sanford said he might refuse all or part of the $ 2.8 billion in stimulus money the Obama administration wants to give South Carolina , I 've been calling his office every week .
I could n't wait to hear how he was going to weasel out of it .
After all , that 's what Bobby Jindal did down in Louisiana .
After denouncing the stimulus as " irresponsible " and making the same noisy threats about rejecting his state 's $ 2.4 billion , Jindal ended up accepting $ 2.3 billion .
And Sanford was in my sights .
After I wrote a column ridiculing him for calling the bailout " a total gut - check of where we are as a civilization , " he retaliated right here on Esquire.com with an op - ed blaming the economic crash on the Democrats and saying that Franklin Roosevelt made the Great Depression worse .
My response eviscerated those feeble arguments in a bold rhetorical onslaught that left women weak in the knees and onlookers gasping in admiration .
But I have to give Sanford credit .
Right after he announced that he was also going to take most of the money , he had the guts to pick up the phone .
" I appreciate you doing this , " I said , " especially since I was mean to you on first acquaintance . "
" I 've dealt with more than my share of sticks and stones over the last fifteen years of politics , " Sanford answered , his voice soft and wry .
After reading up on his years as a congressman in Washington , I admitted , I had to give him credit for being so stingy that he slept on his office sofa .
" You 're not a hypocrite , I 'll give you that . "
He chuckled .
" That 's about the only thing I 've got going for me , but I 'll take that one . "
" We 've got to find common ground where we can . "
" Exactly . "
Cordiality achieved , we got down to it .
In his announcement , Sanford said he was taking $ 2.1 billion only because he had no choice — it went direct from the feds to wasteful pork - barrel spending like Medicare payments for the sick and elderly , aid to the state 's most troubled schools , and relief payments for hardworking people thrown out of their jobs by global forces beyond their control .
But he was only going to take the remaining $ 700 million if Obama would let him use it to pay down the state debt — even though South Carolina taxpayers are still going to have to pay for that stimulus money in their federal taxes .
So the first question was obvious :
Is Mark Sanford really going to make South Carolina $ 1.4 billion poorer just to make a point ?
His answer began in general principles .
Sanford believes " to the core " that you can't spend money you do n't have .
And $ 2.8 billion was just too much money to spend wisely .
If a real person got a windfall that big , he'd pay off the mortgage or put some aside for a rainy day .
" But the money is intended as a stimulus , " I pointed out .
" I hear you , but I think that a strong financial statement at the state level has everything to do with future borrowing costs , which impact what we can spend on other things .
It has everything to do with ... "
Stop right there , governor .
Future borrowing costs ?
Is n't deficit spending just more " generational theft ? "
But Sanford was on a roll , talking about the GM bailout and good money after bad and structural reforms that make you competitive in the global economy .
It soon became clear that his immediate , practical goal was winning his endless fight against — and here 's our first irony — the Republican - dominated South Carolina legislature .
" The silver lining to the very gray clouds we 're dealing with in the national economy is , it may force some changes in our state , " he went on .
" When times are great , people are not going to take tough medicine .
They will take it in this environment . "
Specifically , Sanford is concerned about something called an " annualization hole . "
The South Carolina legislature wants to put a big chunk of that $ 700 billion into education , which would create new programs that would need continuing funds when the federal money ran out .
" In our state , everybody wants to be captain of the ship — you got technical schools trying to be two - year colleges , two - year colleges want to be four - year colleges , four - year colleges want to be research universities .
It 's an incredibly duplicative system . "
" That 's because you can't control your legislature , right ? "
" Right .
But all you can do in life is what you can do . "
And why can't you control your legislature ?
Here 's irony No. 2 : " We have an incredibly weird constitution built around the fear that a black man would be the governor of Carolina , " Sanford said .
" In 1895 , we took the traditional functions of the executive branch and diffused them into the wind — it 's an insane model with which to run your government in the twenty - first century .
It causes us to be 130 - percent the U.S. average in the cost of our state government , not because we have evil house and senate members but because we have this Balkanized political system that causes us to be sort of feudal in nature . "
So he proposes to Balkanize the federal response to the greatest economic crises of our lifetimes !
Oh , the irony !
But Sanford kept surprising me .
At one point , he preemptively conceded some ground in the FDRgument : " If you look at the numbers , I would n't disagree with some of what happened in 1930s .
But we 're in a very different position financially in the 1930s .... "
Then I started to question his jihad against debt .
If spending money you do n't have is so terrible , is it bad to have a mortgage ?
" Unsustainable debt is bad .
Debt is n't bad .
I 've got a mortgage on my house too . "
And Sanford seemed sincere — genuinely sincere — when he said he took no pleasure in battling the president .
" In raw human terms , I sat there on the couch of my sofa with tears in my eyes and my four boys gathered around me watching that speech he gave in Grant Park .
Talk about Horatio Alger and overcoming incredible odds .
I mean , the guy went against the biggest Democratic fundraising machine our country 's ever known , humble beginnings , and here he is the president of the United States .
I talked to the boys at length about that lesson .
So I do n't want to be making this stand , particularly against a guy in the first hundred days in office . "
And what about all those socialistic activities that suddenly offend so many Joe - the - Plumber Republicans ?
Does he want to do away with the public school system , Social Security , the national park system , the interstate highway system , and on and on ?
" I 'm not an anarchist , " Sanford said .
" If you 're truly a conservative — keep in mind many people in the Republican party these days are not — you absolutely believe in the role of government , because , one , you believe ... "
The governor paused for several long beats .
" ... that man is fallen — that man will , if unchecked , try to grab more than his or his share , and there is a legitimate role of government in checking those selfish proclivities . "
None of this means that Sanford is a secret Democrat .
But it does mean there 's more to him than the inflammatory quotes that make the headlines and shrink our dwindling patch of common ground .
As he continued , he mentioned how a chemical plant polluted the creek where he and his brothers used to play .
" And I 'm thinking , wait a minute , this is my water , too , just as much as it is theirs .
Why do they dump this stuff in the creek and you can't go oyster where you oystered as a boy ? "
He also said that government has an obligation to " do things that people can't do for themselves , " that he had " no problem with government mandating we have Social Security , " and praised a state program that helps students get tuition grants to college .
He concluded with a sentiment we can all agree on :
" Would I redesign the system ?
Yeah .
Does that mean I want to end it ?
No . "
So there 's your final irony :
In today 's Republican party , the most conservative governor in the country sounds almost liberal .

Emergency wreck - pick - pry tool
Wielded by fire and rescue workers everywhere , the Halligan Bar is the best door - smashing , get - me - the - heck - into / outta - here , zombie - fightin ’ tool in the world .
The deluxe 30 - inch one I have ( pic above ) is made of high tensile strength titanium , so it will never rust and , despite its imposing appearance , weighs just 5.25 lbs .
It even has eyelets for a strap !
( note : less exorbitant Halligans are available in alloy steel ; my titanium bar was a gift ) .
So far I ’ve only used mine to do three things : hook one end over a bathroom stall to do pull ups , carry it as a hobo ’s bindle stick and impress people on my walk home from work .
Nevertheless , I live in a 17 - story apartment building ( technically 16 ) .
Simply knowing I own one puts my mind at ease .
Did you ever hear the story of the maintenance guy on 9/11 who hacked his way through a wall using a squeegee ?
With something as obscenely strong and useful as a Halligan Bar , he ’d have been out in seconds .
I keep mine leaning against the wall in the corner , where it waits for the day when I need to smash into or out of something … or I hear screams of “ He ’s trapped inside ! ” or “ The Zombies are here ! ”

On March 2 , an asteroid whizzed past the Earth at a distance of just 41,000 miles -- a near miss by cosmic standards ( most communications satellites orbit at a distance of about 22,300 miles from Earth ) .
Headlines around the world proclaimed that Earth had dodged a bullet , and many mentioned that if the space rock had hit our planet , it might have packed a punch comparable to the Tunguska impact in 1908 that flattened trees over an 800 - square - mile area in Siberia .
But some fast - tracking observations by MIT Professor of Planetary Sciences Richard Binzel proved that this rock was actually much smaller than that .
Likely just 19 meters ( about 60 feet ) across , it would probably have disintegrated high in the atmosphere , with only a few small fragments making it to the ground .
Discovered just two days before its closest approach to Earth , the asteroid , called 2009 DD45 , was initially estimated as between 20 and 40 meters across .
At the high end , that would have made it comparable to the devastating Tunguska bolide .
Binzel , on sabbatical at the Paris Observatory , decided to try to make observations of the fast - moving asteroid , aided by MIT planetary science alum Francesca DeMeo '06 SM '07 , who is currently completing her doctoral research in Paris on a Fulbright scholarship .
The asteroid 's close pass was on the opposite side of the planet from Paris -- over the Pacific Ocean .
No problem for Binzel :
He and his students have routinely made observations using a remotely controlled telescope in Hawaii ( See News Office story from last year : / newsoffice/2008/asteroids-tt0319.html ) .
The telescope can be run from a number of different locations , including a control room on the MIT campus and the Paris Observatory .
But following such a nearby encounter with a large telescope is a technical challenge .
" The object was moving about 100 times faster than the ' normal ' rate of objects we track as they cross the Earth 's orbit , all on account of its very close passage , " Binzel explains .
Despite that challenge , Binzel says , " All told , we stayed on the target for about two hours , before sunrise in Hawaii brought our observations to a close . "
And it was well worth it , because this enabled detailed spectroscopic measurements that determined the object 's composition , which matched that of an S - type asteroid -- the most common type .
That , in turn , allowed a more accurate estimate of how reflective it was , essential to being able to determine its actual size based on measurements of its apparent brightness .
After completing the observations at the observatory 's facility in the Paris suburb of Meudon , Binzel headed back in to the city .
" Final calculations for the size were made on the train ride home , " he says , " where it occurred to me that the 19 meter size was about the same as the train car I was riding in , except the asteroid was going much faster . "

CARSON CITY – Sen. Bob Coffin , D - Las Vegas , proposed a tax on prostitution today that he says could raise $ 2 million a year for the state .
Patrons of prostitutes — both legal and illegal — would pay an extra $ 5 tax per session under the bill , which Coffin said was his idea alone .
In the runup to the legislative session , a lobbyist for the state ’s legal brothels volunteered to be taxed , an effort that some said would guarantee their continued survival .
Assembly Speaker Barbara Buckley turned down the industry , effectively killing the effort .
“ I think we will support it , ” George Flint , a spokesman for the state ’s brothel industry , said of Coffin ’s bill .
There are eight “ major ” brothels in the rural counties , where they are legal , and 17 smaller houses of prostitution , said Flint .
The minimum charges range from $ 100 to $ 200 .
Coffin said he had considered applying the state ’s live entertainment tax to prostitution , but encountered some constitutional questions .
Information received by the state Department of Taxation in collecting the proposed tax would be confidential , he said .
The department could publish how much it took in , so long as it did n’t identify an individual business .
Part of the receipts would be used to finance an “ ombudsman for sex workers ” who would help prostitutes who have complaints or want to leave prostitution and enter another profession .
Asked how the state could collect the tax from the independent street walkers , Coffin said that the business tax , when first imposed , was n’t collected from all of those who were required to pay it .
As a new tax , the bill would require a two - thirds vote for passage .
' I 'd never report it again , ' says female lawyer who accused a chef of rape when she was too drunk to remember
Peter Bacon was acquitted of rape by a jury of seven women and four men
The woman who accused a chef of rape after a drunken one - night - stand has admitted that if the same thing happened to her again she would not report it .
The 45 - year - old , who can not be named of legal reasons , said she felt ' let down ' by the judicial system after Peter Bacon was acquitted last week .
A jury of seven women and four men took just 45 minutes to find Mr Bacon not guilty , after hearing three days of evidence .
The accuser told the News Of The World : ' My experience has taught me there is nothing to be gained by going through the criminal justice system .
I could n't go through what I have again . '
Winchester Crown Court had heard the woman claim that she must have been raped because she was too drunk to have consented to sex .
The jury heard she drunk up to six bottles of wine before the pair had sex in her flat in Canterbury , Kent , in February last year .
The woman , who described herself in court as a ‘ recreational binge drinker ’ , said she found Mr Bacon lying in her bed one morning with no memory of what had happened .
She immediately accused the university student - who was her friend 's housemate - of taking advantage of her , shouting that the law had been changed because of ‘f****** like you ’.
Mr Bacon had insisted that he believed the woman had given him a ‘ come - on ’ and had flirted with him before they had sex .
In her interview , the woman said she would never have consented to sex with Mr Bacon because he was ' not her type ' , and she did not feel the need to ' chase after a 20 - something man ' .
She told the newspaper : ' I 'm fussy about the men I date , I 'm quite a snob .
For example , I would never date a brick - layer . '
She said she did not blame herself for what happened and did not regret the drinking .
' I concede I was drinking far more than I should have been - far more than was good for me - and as a result I 've since cut back on my drinking .
But what happened was n't my fault . '
She said she she cannot accept Mr Bacon 's version of events .
' Our mutual friend said in court he had n't noticed me giving Mr Bacon the come - on at all , and as far as he was concerned my interest in Mr Bacon was purely platonic .
' So I just cannot accept that in the space of 10 minutes , a person can go from being extremely platonic to engaging in sexual intercourse in a number of different positions with a stranger where neither party pays any heed to preventing a potential pregnancy . '
She claimed she would never willingly have sex in such a drunken state , and could not understand why Mr Bacon had not noticed how inebriated she was .
Mr Bacon , seem with friends Jodie Bradley ( right ) and Laura Dowling ( left ) , outside Winchester Crown Court
' My nickname is Baggy because , when I drink , my face drops and sags very obviously , ' she told the newspaper .
The woman admitted that she knew her story was weak and that , were she defending such a case in court herself , she would be confident of getting the defendant acquitted .
But she reported the incident to police out of ' a moral duty to other women ' .
She believes the acquittal was due , in part , to the fact that seven of the 11 jurors were female .
' In date rape trials , women tend to side with men .
That is their inherent nature .
They judge other women more harshly .
That is my experience .'
Despite her disappointment at the verdict , the woman admitted that she felt sorry for Mr Bacon , and did not condone the fact that he was named publicly as soon as he was charged .
She said she does not condone the vilification and vigilante attacks to which men accused of sexual violence are sometimes subjected .
The woman also fears the outcome of her case will put off other women from going to the police to report rapes .
' In certain circumstances drunken sex quite clearly is n't rape .
But when people are incapable of making a decision then , in a civilised society , you have to be protected by the law .
' And , like it or not , young women do get themselves into this situation all the time because we have a binge culture .
The implication of the judgement is that , if a woman is drunk and something happens to her , it 's her own fault for getting into that state . '
WASHINGTON , March 16 ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama told Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to take all legal measures to block hefty bonuses awarded to employees of AIG AIG.N , the insurance company that received up to $ 180 billion in bailout money , a White House adviser said on Monday .
“ The president told Secretary Geithner ... to take every legal means that he has to push back against this , to figure out who put this in the contracts and when , and to make sure this does n’t happen again , ” Austan Goolsbee , a member of Obama ’s Council of Economic Advisers , told Reuters Financial Television .
“ Obviously we ’re not going to break the law , but there are a number of legal means that we have to push back , and the president instructed Secretary Geithner to do so , ” he said .

There are a few posts I ’ve written in my career where I think to myself , “ this probably is n’t going to go well .
I should just shut up . ”
This is one of them .
Only I ’m not going to shut up .
Not that this should surprise you .
As people often like to lovingly point out to me , I ’m not an SEO .
And that works for me .
Because I frequently find SEOs to be quite the whiny bunch .
Even the ones I like .
( See my next post on “ How to Win Friends ” to be published once I learn how ! ) .
They do n’t mean to annoy me , they just ca n’t change who they are and how they see things .
Let me try and explain my recent frustrations .
Aaron Wall , who I happen to think is one of the smarter people on the planet , announced he is giving up social media for a year because it builds no value and wastes links .
Andrew
Wee uses coined the term “ blackhole SEO ” for sites like Twitter and eBay that pass no link juice .
( Thanks to Streko for pointing out that BlueHatSEO may have coined the term .
Not Andrew .
Apologies . )

I went to bed last night listening to people all in an uproar about how Craigslist now nofollows their links as well .
And that ’s all happened in only the past day or two .
Guess what , SEOs , it ’s time to grow up .
The search engines are placing less weight on links and its time you start doing the same .
I ’m not saying to abort link building practices .
That would be suicidal .
But the PageRank - like obsession needs to stop .
The obsession that drives you to pay for links , to create lists of sites that are still dofollow , and the time you spend bitching about how dare Site X not give you credit for your work needs to come to an end .
Let me add this disclaimer : I do n’t think sites should nofollow links .
I think the Web was based on linking .
I think links are sexy and that in a perfect world a link would actually mean something .
However , life is n’t fair and you ca n’t trust your next door neighbor .
Yesterday , Aaron
Wall went on the record to say this :
I am going to cut back on social media for the next year or two…its not worth the effort .
It builds no real value .
It wastes opportunity .
It wastes links .
It wastes life . :)
That made me wince .
Social media does build value .
It ’s not a wasted opportunity .
Whether or not certain sites pass link juice , they ’re still valuable .
All this talk about how sites like Twitter “ come at a high cost ” because they do n’t pass Page Rank makes me want to start denting walls again .
Just like there ’s more to a relationship than just sex .
There ’s more to SEO and Internet marketing than just links .
Even good sex , er , links .
Last week , we mentioned a recent Google algorithm update that seems to focus on rewarding brands for being a brand .
I ’ve heard from other SEOs who have reported seeing major changes with how their sites are ranking based on that update .
And if that ’s true , then it ’s not links you need to be obsessed with .
It ’s building your company into a brand .
People may disagree with me on this , but I do n’t think brands are built through links .
I think they ’re built through people .
The kind of people that you find on Twitter and in social media .
The kind of people who do n’t give a shit if a link is nofollowed or not because they ’re still going to click on it .
They ’re still going to spend time on your site ( something else Google is watching ) .
And they ’re still going to learn about you and talk about you and whore you out to their friends .
If you want to serve your clients , it ’s time you start thinking about what ’s important to them .
Stop thinking only links .
Links are not your salvation .
Not long term .
And I know that as I ’m writing this and Rhea ’s reading it , she ’s shaking her head secretly wanting to lock me in a closet .
I know this because we have constant battles about how things should be done .
She sees things like an SEO .
She sees links .
And link equity .
I see user experience .
I see community .
I see brands .
And that ’s what makes us perfect complements and why we create great experiences for our clients and their visitors .
It ’s also what makes us take turns wanting to dump cups of coffee over one another ’s heads .
But the battles teach us a lot about the other person ’s perspective .
It teaches us a lot about SEO and what matters .
Search is growing up .
A few years ago , links represented relationships on the Web .
If you liked something , you linked to it .
The search engines caught on to that and it was a rewarded behavior .
Then we manipulated it to all hell .
Today ’s relationships are n’t solely based on links .
Today relationships are based on actual relationships .
They ’re based on the relationships that things like Twitter and Sphinn and social media create .
They ’re far more trusted .
They ’re more real .
I may not get my hands dirty with SEO , but I like to think I understand it .
I understand that links are not the end all , be all of everything .
I understand that as an SEO you better be looking deeper than that if you want to do right by your clients and get them to the point of being outspoken .
I ’m sorry that Aaron Wall thinks that social media is a waste of his time and that it builds no value .
I do n’t agree .
Not even a little .
But I ’m sure y’all will educate me in the comments . :)

Why Science Fiction Rules the World ( but not enough !!!)
In many important ways , science fiction rules the world , but is regularly dismissed by the public at large .
I ’m going to use an expansive definition of science fiction , as opposed to my usually more rigid definition that demands some adherence to science , and open this up to speculative fiction in general and nearly all novel , creative thinking that gets called “ science fiction ” by mainstream people .
I know some English professors who call Harry Potter science fiction , for instance .
All this stuff , all this “ sf , ” is considered weird to normal mainstream people , the mundanes .
Until it becomes popular or important , then the ignorant and arrogant bastards seize it as their own .
This is most obvious when it comes to movies .
Here ’s one list from the 1980s that is totally dominated by sf movies , including Blade Runner , Aliens , The Terminator , The Empire Strikes Back , E.T. , Back to the Future , Raiders of the Lost Ark , The Princess Bride , etc. , etc .
These films are spectacularly great and exploit the special effects of movies in a way that real life rarely demands .
A movie like Forrest Gump benefits from special effects , too , but sf thrives on it .
And people love it .
It makes sf accessible .
Because the truth of it is that we fans of science fiction have capabilities that the general public lacks , to enjoy novelty and think about difficult concepts .
To enjoy things that blow our minds , and seek that regularly .
The general public needs it dumbed down and shown to them in very clear terms .
To make it real .
And movie special effects make that easier to do .
Then everyone can enjoy it as mainstream entertainment and not consider themselves as weird novelty seekers , and then flock to sequels and just treat it as normal stuff .
Books do n’t fare as well because they ’re harder work .
Still , Stephen King and J. K. Rowling manage .
The science fiction not so much , falling into the cracks as it requires too much thinking usually in book form .
The public at large waits until science catches up before it worries about anything from the realm of science fiction .
Cloning was a scary fantasy , but not more , in movies and books , before the reality of Dolly the Sheep .
Then to make sense of this development for public policy they called in experts like … doctors and clergy ?
Dumb , dumb , dumb .
The science fiction community had been talking about this for decades in serious ways and had a grasp of it better than even the people involved with the actual research .
I mean , the creator of Dolly thought that cloning humans was a bad idea because if a couple cloned the father , say , to have a child , the mother would then find the child sexually attractive when he grew up .
WTF ???
Seriously , this was his position .
What I am trying to say is that the average person , the practical person , the people who live in the real world , are basically clueless when it comes to novelty and the things we think about and talk about on a daily basis , and somehow we get regularly excluded when the issues become relevant .
I ’m trying to figure out why that is , and I think everyone is to blame .
It is part of our culture .
Something ridiculous is called “ science fiction ” until it become practical then it moves from our thing to their thing .
And we seem to let it happen too often .
To be fair , a lot of us prefer to look for the next interesting idea and refrain from getting involved with practical things .
There are figures from science fiction like David Brin , Larry Niven , Vernor Vinge , and Bruce Sterling who are viewed sometimes as more than “ just ” science fiction writers .
They have to be called futurists or something else to have legitimacy , it seems , even though it ’s the same side of the same coin .
The thing is , Singularity or not , technology is moving forward rapidly and the possibilities are expanding .
Our politicians and pundits , our business leaders , ought to be well versed in science fiction and science fiction thinking , but if they are they hide it well .
Science fiction conventions are still covered on local TV news as a joke , a chance to laugh at the socially maladjusted people sitting in Denny ’s in their costumes .
Anyway , science fiction rules the world in the popular culture of our films and in the technology that dominates our every day lives .
The world today is more fantastic in many ways than any sf writer imagined in the 1950s .
We have test tube babies and are on the verge of human cloning and designer babies .
We have portable devices that give us world - wide telephones , GPS , libraries of books and music , and the internet .
An individual can post a movie online that tens of millions of strangers then watch , just for fun .
One of the dominant issues of our era is global warming , and we worry about protecting ourselves from killer asteroids .
Science fiction stories about alien contact certainly can have something to teach us about interacting with alien human cultures , which seems to be a regular problem of great importance today .
My point here is that the people who need to know about this stuff do n’t think about it much until it is already well past real .
Those of us who do think about this stuff tend to focus on the unreality as it is more interesting to us as novelty seekers , and we let ourselves be marginalized as weirdos .
Things have improved somewhat in recent years with some sf geeks coming out of the closet , so to speak , like Paul Allen of Microsoft and Newt Gingrich in congress , but too little .
Science fiction is important , practical , every day business .
Global environment and survival , the future of energy , the future of the human species and how we reproduce and alter ourselves , our technological devices and their effects on our culture , the clash of ancient tradition and the changing reality , these are the stomping grounds of science fiction .
Those of us into novelty and difference for the sake of difference have a lot to offer .
We have to find ways of communicating these ideas to those who think they live in the real , practical world , which is n’t the one they grew up inside .
How are we to do this ?
Well , we have to be more confident and assertive in our identities .
We have to be polite but persistent , and dismissive of efforts to dismiss us .
We have to remind people of how the vision of science fiction is our present and near - future , from cell phones to computers to people ’s babies .
It is amazing how people swallow this stuff and adopt it when it is on the big screen and the director has made it visual and easily assimilated .
We have to strive to do the same things when we talk with our friends and neighbors , our co-workers and politicians .
Egg - head and geek and nerd have to be empowering terms .
Everyone has to feel like they need one of us to talk with , or have resources to read or hear what we think about things .
And we have to be willing to do it .
A lot of us are elitist and just as dismissive .
We have to communicate dangers and possibilities of new concepts and not just discuss them amongst ourselves .
We have to make an effort and find ways of doing this .
Movies remain one possibility , but just as people dismiss ideas as “ that ’s science fiction ” they also do so with film saying “ it ’s just a movie . ”
More and more often these things are aspects of our modern reality that have no precendence in human history .
Somehow history gets respect and people say it “ repeats itself ” even though that is not true .
Science fiction is n’t exactly great at prediction , but the process is very useful for meeting the future with open eyes .
Anyway , I ’d like to see suggestions for things we can do to open better communications and bring more people into the sf tent .
It ’s healthy for a civilization to have its conservatives , but it is n’t healthy when such a large fraction of everyone can really be counted as conservatives in a fast - changing world .
Here ’s my short list of tactics , starting with things that already work and getting more speculative : movies , TV shows , books ( fiction and non-fiction ) , blogs , futurist activities ( various foundations , conferences , reports , and more ) .
Seems too traditional and inadequate .
The rest of the world gets things from TV talk shows and news ( who seem to take joke approaches and are cutting their science staff ) , churches , friends , popular magazines … how do we break in there ?
How do we get a Vernor Vinge or Bruce Sterling sitting there next to Chuck Todd or Ben Stein on a political talk show ?
Maybe it ’s through the pundits who are already one of us , like Paul Krugman .
Maybe we can press writers like Bill Bryson into more sf - oriented work .
Hell , even just getting the Sci-Fi channel to stop making cheap crap movies that are dumb would help the cause —
I ’m not above some light escapism but it seems like giant - snake - of - the - week movie is n’t putting our best foot forward .
What is our best foot , and what high - tech materials do we build it out of ?

The persistent neglect of our 401 ( k ) s , battered stock market notwithstanding , will catch up to us someday .
But in retrospect , it 's clear that we did something right .
We lived a smaller life , a life we could afford .
And as the country rebuilds the economy , as it tries to replace it with something more sustainable than a leaning tower of subprime mortgages and consumer binging , it is time to reevaluate that much - maligned Gen X archetype : the American Slacker .
" Slacker , " like most labels , has always been a crude and misleading shorthand .
We were a bit aimless , us urban , liberal - arts types .
We were a little too enamored of irony , perhaps .
A little too frivolous .
But there was something to be said for a life in the moment ; for a dalliance in California , for concerts and failed screenplays , for a little fun before the fall .
And the truth is , we were always more purposeful - more responsible - than our fathers and uncles and grandmothers realized .
Those of us who took low - wage jobs were not just marking time .
Not all of us , anyway .
We were doing work we cared about , as journalists and teachers and social workers .
All that job - hopping and freelancing ?
We were dilettantes , on some level , it 's true .
But we also understood , before most , that something had shifted - that we were moving to an economy of telecommuters and independent contractors and less - than - loyal employers .
And while the best minds on Wall Street cooked up the real estate mess that destroyed a global economy , we were sensible enough to steer clear of that overpriced condo and move into a dingy , three - bedroom rental with a few of our meathead friends .
You see , while Alan Greenspan and Countrywide Financial were creating a capitalism of disastrous excess , we were busy working on a more workable model .
Not without its indulgences , of course .
The exuberance of the dot - com bubble was undoubtedly irrational .
But we did pretty well , this little slice of Generation X .
We brought you the Internet , worked on green technology , and filled the ranks of Teach for America .
We crossed the color line , ate local produce , and bought secondhand clothing .
We lived in smaller spaces , drove smaller cars , and took the subway to work .
It all seemed like a quaint liberal fantasy at the time .
And on some level it was .
But now , with a creaking economy and an overheated planet , it reads more like a survival manual : a guide to multicultural living in an increasingly diverse society , an incubator for the technology that might save the American auto industry , an antidote to our awful adventures in sprawl .
Of course , we could abandon this life as we get older , I suppose .
We could grow impatient with our little apartments and cramped hatchbacks .
We could set our sights on the kind of suburban existence we 've forsaken .
But I 'd like to think we 're smarter than that .
We created something worthwhile - a sustainable neighborhood , a tech future , a life we can manage .
And we wo n't let it go too easily .
At least I hope not .
As the nation rebuilds a crumbling capitalism , it could use a little perspective , a little wisdom .
Bet you did n't think you 'd get it from us .

Here at Classes and Careers , we like to do something crazy every now and then ( call me wacky , and I hope this does n’t offend anybody , but nobody talks about education all the time ) .
We have our contigent here of Star Wars fans .
One day , we began to muse about the advantages of having Jedi powers in the modern workplace .
Then , we regret to admit , we ventured into the Dark Side .
" What if , " we asked , " one of those socially challenged programmer guys was actually a Sith apprentice , a la Darth Maul or Anakin Skywalker ?
And what if his bullying supervisor overstepped his boundaries ? "
In this Star Wars parody , the Emperor ’s latest apprentice , Herbert , uses the Dark Side of the Force to get rid of his supervisor .
For anyone who ’s ever wanted to cut loose on their boss , this one ’s for you .

As many have pointed out , we are in the midst of a transformation in the way news is created , distributed , and monetized – all brought on by the internet .
Access to information has dramatically increased , while the traditional news outlets are fading away .
The new internet - based outlets that are cropping up are often hybrids that do not fit into any existing definition .
Science - based medicine itself is such an outlet – it ’s primarily a group professional blog , but we have editors and take submissions .
We also plan to expand the type of resources available on SBM .
We ’re experimenting .
Others , like Plos ONE , are experimenting with open - access peer - reviewed journals .
And there are online newspapers that are part blog , part news feed , part something else .
While we are in this phase of experimentation it is important to monitor quality control , as the old institutions lose their grip on the flow of information .
Health information in particular , now the most common type of information on the internet , suffers from poor quality control , leading the average consumer with too much information of too low quality .
The Huffington Post , which bills itself as “ The Internet Newspaper : News Blogs Video Community ” is a hybrid news outlet .
While it contains traditional news articles , as one would expect from any newspaper , it also has developed a reputation for publishing consistently anti-scientific blogs and articles , particularly in the area of medicine .
Some of these articles would make a Weekly World News editor blush .
From one point of view , these are just personal blogs , and therefore they are the opinions of an individual published without any filter .
But they are packaged as part of something that calls itself a newspaper , and this raises the question of editorial responsibility .
What is the responsibility of the Huffington Post when they publish gross health misinformation on their site ?
Two recent posts illustrate the problem .
But to first put them into context , the Huffington Post has long been a home to anti-vaccinationists such as David Kirby and RFK Jr . It has also been an outlet for Deepak Chopra to promote his unscientific medical claims .
In fact it does not seem that the problem is a lack of a quality filter for health informtion , but that there is a specific editorial policy at the Huffington Post to promote anything that goes against the scientific medical mainstream .
Antibiotics Cause Cancer ?
Perhaps the single worst article I have ever read on the Huffington Post , which is saying something , is a recent article by Kim Evans in which she claims that antibiotics cause cancer .
She starts off with some reasonable premises , that antibiotics are being over - used – a problem recognized by mainstream medicine , although she is sloppy in her use of terminology .
For example , she refers to the normal friendly bacteria that colonize our bodies as “ probiotics ” .
Actually , probiotics refers to products that include live bacteria that are meant to support the normal bacterial flora in our bodies – not the bacteria themselves .
This is a small point , but reflects the intellectual laziness that Evans brought to this post .
Then she launches into her ridiculous claims :
These healthy bacteria , which should be in abundance in our guts , dine on unhealthy bacteria and yeasts in our bodies , serving to keep these problems in check for us .
Actually , these healthy bacteria form the basis of our immune system — or they did until we took antibiotics because antibiotics regularly kill our healthy bacteria .
And that can set you up for numerous problems down the road — including some very serious problems .
This is factually wrong , and betrays a level of ignorance of basic human biology that should preclude Evans from writing about any medical topic .
Healthy bacteria do not form the basis of our immune system .
Specialized human tissue and cells form the basis of our immune system .
Our skin also provides an important barrier and can be considered part of our immunity .
Healthy bacteria are not part of our immune system .
It is true that they play a role resisting infection because they form a stable ecosystem of bacteria and they crowd out harmful bacteria or fungus .
It is also true , however , that under physiological stress healthy bacteria can become infectious .
Also , healthy bacteria do not “ eat ” other bacteria or fungus – again , their function is simply to crowd out infections organisms .
While overuse of antibiotics is a problem because of the rise of resistant bacteria , antibiotic use has not altered the role healthy bacteria play for our digestion and resistance to infection .
Most people still have healthy bacterial ecosystems .
It is true that broad - spectrum antibiotic used to treat serious infections can also kill off some of the healthy bacteria , and this can result in certain bacteria or funguses growing out of control and creating an infection .
These infections can then be treated themselves , and the bacterial flora will eventually recover to normal .
There may also be a role for probiotics if taken early enough , but the effects are modest and symptomatic only .
Probiotics do not restore a healthy bacterial ecosystem , and are not needed for maintenance .
( Mark Crislip wrote an excellent review of this topic here . )
Evans then builds her case with this falsehood :
First , an estimated 90 percent of the population has a problem with candida overgrowth , although most do n’t know it .
And second , candida overgrowth can be the root cause of literally hundreds of different problems in the body .
Wrong .
Candida does colonize about 90 % of the population , but as part of the normal ecosystem .
Most people do not have a problem with candida overgrowth .
There is also no evidence that candida causes hundreds of health problems .
This is a pseudoscientific claim that is not uncommon among sectarian practitioners .
Candida overgrowth is a popular “ fake ” diagnosis that fits the common pattern – claims that it causes common non-specific symptoms and hundreds of real health problems , so that it can be diagnosed in anybody .
While candida can cause real infections , it can be treated with antifungals and usually presents only an acute illness that can be cured .
Some people do have problems with recurrent infections .
But there is no evidence that chronic candidiasis is an epidemic or can cause many disparate conditions .
This concept of candidiasis is used as a “ theory of everything ” , popular among medical pseudosciences .
Evan then brings it home with this astounding claim :
It ’s also fascinating that an oncologist in Rome , Dr. Tullio Simoncini , says that cancer is a fungus and actually an advanced form of candida overgrowth .
You can read more in his book , Cancer is a Fungus , in which he scientifically explains that the cause of cancer “ is always and only candida . ”
Because Dr. Simoncini is having a great deal of success eliminating cancer in the body very quickly , I believe he ’s one to listen to .
Dr. Simoncini is a notorious cancer quack with bizarre claims that have not been demonstrated scientifically .
In fact , they are demonstrably false .
That is what Evans was leading us too with her sloppy journalism and medical falsehoods – the promotion of a typical cure for all cancers scam .
Intuitive Scanning
Next up is Margaret Ruth who recently informed Huffington Post readers about medical intuitives .
She writes :
Just as an X - ray machine scans a body in order to gain specific medical details , an intuitive scan works to provide an energetic portrait of the client .
The premise is that the physical body has an energy blueprint and so the intuitive scan will look for energy blockages and areas of stress .
Good health is , in general , considered to be clear flows of energy between all the chakras and easy , free functioning of all organs and body systems .
Because this is an intuitive technique , scans can be done in person or from a distance with equal accuracy .
This is pure magical thinking .
A couple centuries of biological science has failed to either discover a human ” energy blueprint ” nor the need for any such hypothesis .
The vitalists ( those who believe in a life force ) lost the scientific battle in the 19th century .
No one who currently claims to be able to detect or manipulate vague human energy fields has been able to demonstrate that they can do so .
Yet Ruth writes about medical intuitives as if they were as established as X - rays .
She does n’t even try to achieve the “ false balance ” typical of the journalistic approach to controversial scientific topics .
Most journalists at least know they should cover both sides of an issue .
This becomes problematic when they balance an issue that is inherently asymetrical .
For example , they may give equal weight to a lone crank as they do the the solid scientific consensus of opinion .
Ruth is not even doing that – she writes as if there is no controversy at all , let alone that the scientific evidence is heavily against any notion of human energy fields or intuitive diagnosis .
There is no attempt to put these claims into any scientific context – Ruth ’s article is pure promotion .
She follows with an interview of two nurses who claim to be medical intuitives – without asking any inconvenient questions about science or evidence , of course .
I am curious as to why Ruth only gave their first names , without any comment .
This betrays a lack of transparency necessary to good journalism and good science .
Conclusion
Evans article was nothing more than a thinly veiled promotion of her book on “ cleansing ” , devoid of anything that can be considered journalism or even basic scientific knowledge .
Ruth ’s article was a promotion of a dubious pseudoscientific medical claim .
The readers of the Huffington Post were not well - served by either article .
Readers were not given enough information to make an informed decision about the claims that were being promoted , nor even of the controversial status of the claims .
They were also fed demonstrable medical falsehoods and misinformation .
This is now what I expect from the Huffington Post , which is also one of the main outlets of the anti-vaccination movement .
This fatally compromises the credibility of the Huffington Post in my opinion , and raises the bigger question of what we can expect from the new breed of online blog / news hybrids .
Last night I sat with a small armful of Romney wool , picking tiny yarrow seeds and spent flower heads , from yellow dyed locks .
Edward had settled in for the night , was on his side attempting to snore when a wave of heartfelt concerns engulfed me .
Do you think she misses us like we miss her ?
Is she lonely ?
We have each other , but she is alone .
I miss caring for her , being there , in the hospital .
Do you miss caring for her , too ?
Do you think she thinks about us ?
I wonder what she thinks about all this , I continued .
I wish I could ask her what to do , what she thinks .
Is she sad ?
Was she ever sad ?
Did you see her cry , ever ?
Grief is a clever , brilliant whiff of a thing .
How it weaves itself around you , and manages to blow you into fragments of yourself .
There is no touching it , it seems , yet the weight of it is all I manage to feel .
In the past few weeks I have felt so hallow , so deeply cleaved that every morning , every today , is an exercise in gathering up the scattered fragments , and cobbling them all together for some small semblance of myself .
Some mornings the gathering is rather easy , my arms are light and strong , I 'm quick - witted and nimble , and I patch myself together rather well .
Others find me slow and clumsy , trying to sort the pieces before I am ready to rebuild .
Those are the days where I turn each memory in my hands like a mason carefully inspecting every brick , every stone before building a new road .
Those days when I am most careful , most slow , most deliberate about the fragments scattered , those are the hardest of days .
The oddity is that in some way , each today is cobbled and clumsy , yet pieced into some bit of myself .
And , not just myself , but ourselves , because everyone I love most dearly is grieving , too .
Everyone is tinged with a bit of regret , a bite of sad , a mouthful , or rather a life - full of missing her .
It occurs to me as I write this , the question is not whether I am cobbled together each day or not , but when and how do I scatter back into fragments .
Where does my voice break today ?
With whom will my heart split ?
I 'm an old hen , an old hand at loss and grief .
Yet somehow , this life never prepared me for grieving my mom .
There are so many tiny mental questions , negotiations I have n't quite figured out yet .
And when I try to approach them , try to answer the questions , I break .
I do n't know if I 'll every speak Spanish fluently again .
She was the only person alive I was fluent with .
I do n't know if I 'll every make Albondigas or Chile Rellenos again .
She was my recipe source .
I do n't know if I 'll ever learn to be slow to anger .
She was my mentor .
I do n't know .
I do n't know .
I do n't know .
Yet I do .
This morning I awoke twice .
First , to the feeling of Edward wrapping blankets around me and kissing my cheek before he left to work .
Second , to the sound of morning birds chirping outside my window .
Each of those awakenings , I remember , are gifts from her .
Let me explain .
I have tried to describe the kind of man Edward is for twenty years -- manly and strong , yet gentle and nurturing , corny and witty , light - hearted , unbothered , child - like , innocent and giving , fully loving and devoted .
He is a man 's man , this kind of a human , where , no matter how you turn him , no matter what light you shine on him , or where you place him -- he shines .
I do n't say this because I carry his last name , proudly , but he is a very special person .
Edward is the kind of man you are happy to have in this world -- he is peaceful , calming , and so generous with his heart .
And I know , I know , I 've said already he is child - like and corny , but he is this surprisingly funny , easy - going kind of person .
He makes you laugh with a sort of surprise , a kind of despite himself way .
Perhaps you know what it 's like to be woken by the song of birds ; I pray you do .
Though my bird friends can be quite mischievous , and slightly thieving in my garden , they are the song of joy .
Their song whiffs in with an intent , a will of peace I only know as birdsong .
It 's pure , of the heavens .
I often find myself thinking of one of my favorite verses when I hear them sing ,
Consider the birds of the air ; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns , and yet your heavenly Father feeds them .
Are you not much more valuable than they ?
- Matthew 6:26
That close connection with God , that lack of need to sow or reap , that utter dependance and abiding in God -- that is their song .
Spiritually , that is why all birds , whether caged or free , sing .
Birds , like sheep , are rife through the Bible .
Personally , they remind me of God 's presence , of His love and care for all , His nurturing of all life .
Edward is fully his mother 's son .
He is so much of her -- nurturing , loving , strong , corny and witty , light - hearted , devoted , peaceful , kind .
So many adjectives it reads as though I am stringing together pearls of cliches to adorn simply for the feel or sound of it .
But she was all of those many things and more , and he got those things of her .
The off the cuff silly jokes .
The ability to join into laughter whether he knows the joke or not .
I often tell people I knew I wanted to marry Edward when I realized I wanted my son to know him , to be like him , to have him as a role model .
I remember thinking , what a man , I want my son to grow up to be just like him .
Here I am , twenty years later , learning that not only did I want my son to be like him , but that he was because of her , and I want to be like her .
Fun-loving and light .
Selfless and loving .
Courageous and brave .
Ironclad faith .
In the two months she ( knowingly ) lived with cancer we lived our very best lives .
We were n't galloping around the world in airplanes or trains , seeing places or buying things .
We were n't auditing bank accounts or counting what possessions would remain , and who will take them .
We were n't talking what - ifs , why me's , or asking why God .
We were praying .
We were laughing .
We were holding hands .
We were sitting quietly .
We were listening to the birds sing .
We were walking hospital halls arm and arm .
We were talking .
We were hugging .
We were loving .
We were joyful for sunshine .
We were faithful .
We were prayerful .
We were together .
We were peaceful .
We were joking .
We were love .
One of my pastors came to the hospital and prayed for us in the very early days , the day after the first and only chemo .
After we prayed bedside , he took me and Edward to the hall , his wife crying though she did n't know mom , held our hands and told us , " this will be the hardest , but most important thing you will do in your life . "
Jim told us that though it will be painful , and at times will feel impossible , trust that it will be a gift , and perhaps the greatest comfort and blessing to our lives .
He encouraged us to stay the course , to steady ourselves in faith , to be present and to continue through as we were .
When I wake up twice to fragments of her - - her son , the birds she told me she 'd fly with -- when I wake to the legacy she left me of being Mrs. Jimenez , of being wife to her son , mother to her grandkids , daughter to her beloved , kin to her family , when I wake to the life she lived so fully , so fervently and passionately with faith and joy , when I wake earthside , without her , without having the honor to care for and nurture her during her transition , without her corny jokes , without her laugh , without her hand in mine -- I find it impossible to see the gift , yet , like grief , she is clever , a brilliant kind of a woman .
She weaves herself around me , us , and manages to blow into us fragments of herself .
There is no touching her , it seems , yet the weight of her is all I manage to feel .
I do n't know how to live this life without her .
None of us do .
Not her nine brothers and sisters .
Her dozens and dozens of nieces and nephews , her hundreds of cousins .
Not her husband , or her sons .
Her grandchildren .
Not her friends .
Not her birds .
Not her plants and garden .
Not her home or her kitchen .
This morning I think the point is not to figure out how to live life without her , there is no way .
She is in me .
In my hands when I hold Edward 's hand .
In my daughter 's smile and the wrinkle in her nose when she 's making a funny face .
She 's in my son's wit and humor .
She 's Edward 's nurturing love .
She 's scattered in my garden , her plants and mine , getting on well this mild May .
She 's around my wrist in the jingle of her bracelets , which sound oddly like her laugh .
She 's the morning song of the birds .
She 's my second mama , as she told me again and again - - tu eres mi hi'ja .
She is in the always of love .
The forever is her .
Last night , while I picked my wool and questioned Edward again and again , something I seem to need to do regularly -- did we do enough , did she know how much I loved her , did I tell her every day I loved her -- he was drifting in and out of sleep , but heard and responded to only one question .
Is she sad ?
- No , she is n't sad , she would never be sad .
Ahh , I calmed .
Ahh , I remembered who she was .
I remembered her holding my hands , soothing me as I cried on her frail chest , " awww ... mi'ja " she rubbed my head , do n't be sad , do n't cry .
She told me to look to the heavens , she'd be there , waiting for us .
She 'd be flying with the birds , she said , and we 'd all soon be together again .
And here I am , sad , crying , yet comforted that she is flying with the birds , waiting for us to all be together again .
I wonder what jokes she 's telling , how many times she 's had heaven in stitches , or what kind of garden she 's started .
We are never lonely in the presence of the God .
Never sad or forlorn .
Never worried or overly pensive .
We are like the birds of the air - - full of song , never sowing or reaping , but abiding in the peace and love God gives .
Every today my fragments are cobbled with the gift of her legacy .
And I am so grateful she was and is .
I am so deeply grateful God gave me the time to care for her , to love on her with all I have , to be there daily , walking with her through pain .
Yes because I loved her so deeply , and that 's what daughters do , but because she gifted me the ability to watch God care for and love her , she gifted me the legacy of her courage and faith , as she bravely walked headfirst into God 's will -- though it was filled with pain and unending sickness , with grace and beauty , love and faith .
Yes , every morning , and sometimes throughout the day I have to process her death again .
And , yes , I am having a rough go of it .
But , also , yes , I am so fully grateful and feel her love so deeply , I am do fundamentally changed , I know peace in the heartache .
I know joy .
I know love .
It is so very easy to love those born of your body , and those whose body you are born from .
But what love it is to love someone so completely , so deeply that is not of your flesh .
What love it is to have been loved so well , to have been so mothered , and cared for by her .
She 'd tell me she got lucky with me , and I 'd respond , no , I got lucky with you .
We 'd always be holding hands , and we 'd settle on we got lucky together , with each other .
God gives so fully in love .
I pray I can be an instrument of that love , as my mom was God 's song of love in my life .
May you be blessed to know love as I have .
May you give it as my mom did .
May we all laugh ( and eat ) with passion like her .
* Written on Thursday , 5/25 *
Imagine you had a really smart bomb - a genius bomb - that could blow up the leaders of every drug cartel in Mexico .
By the time the smoke cleared , a new pusher would be sitting in every cartel 's big chair and the distribution networks would continue satisfying the demand of every junkie and recreational - drug user in America .
Mexico 's drug cartels would continue to be , in the words of the Justice Department 's National Drug Threat Assessment for 2009 , " the greatest drug - trafficking threat to the United States . "
Now , imagine a different weapon .
Consider the impact of eliminating the most profitable product the cartels sell .
All we have to do is legalize marijuana .
" Marijuana is the ( Mexican cartels ' ) cash crop , the cash cow , " says Brittany Brown of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 's Washington office , which does not advocate legalizing pot .
Marijuana is cheap to grow and requires no processing .
More than a million pounds of it was seized in Arizona in each of the past two years , according to figures provided by Ramona Sanchez of the DEA 's Phoenix office .
But those seizures were just a cost of doing business for multibillion - dollar drug lords .
Marijuana continued to be widely available - and not just to adults .
Teens tell researchers that buying pot is easier than getting cigarettes or booze , says Bill Piper , director of National Affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance , which does advocate legalizing marijuana .
Cannabis vs. alcohol
Some argue that if you legalize marijuana there would still be a black market .
They say that because the product is so cheap to produce , the black market could underprice legal pot and sell to kids .
But consider what we know about alcohol .
��First , Prohibition did n't work .
��Second , even though alcohol sales are regulated , back - alley or school - yard sales of moonshine is not a billion - dollar problem .
��Third , alcohol , like its addictive killer - cousin tobacco , is taxed , which helps cover its costs to society .
Not so with marijuana .
After decades of anti-pot campaigns , from Reefer Madness to zero tolerance , so many Americans choose to smoke marijuana that the Mexican cartels have become an international threat to law and order .
Instead of paying taxes on their vice , pot smokers are enriching thugs and murderers .
" People who smoke pot in the United States do n't think they are connected to the cartels , " Brown says .
" Actually , they are very connected . "
American drug users help sharpen the knives that cartel henchmen use to behead their enemies and terrorize Mexican border towns .
Even marijuana grown in the United States , increasingly in national parks and on other public lands , is often connected to Mexican cartels , Brown says .
According to the Justice Department 's 2009 assessment , cartels have " established varied transportation routes , advanced communications capabilities and strong affiliations with gangs in the United States " and " maintain drug - distribution networks or supply drugs to distributors in at least 230 U.S. cities . "
Including Phoenix and Tucson .
The DEA says cartels are " poly - drug organizations " that routinely smuggle cocaine , methamphetamine , heroin and precursor chemicals through our state .
" ( But ) marijuana generates the most profit , " Sanchez says .
Removing a cash cow
Legalizing marijuana would not stop pushers from selling other , more lethal poisons .
But taking away their most profitable product would hurt criminal organizations that have grown richer , more powerful and better armed during the so - called war on drugs that was first declared by President Richard Nixon .
Today 's Mexican cartels " are as ruthless and brutal as any terrorist organization , " says Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , who is opposed to legalizing marijuana .
Their brutality is destabilizing Mexico .
Several years after Mexican President Felipe Calder�n bravely decided to take on the cartels , Mexico ranks with Pakistan as " weak and failing states " in a recent report by the United States Joint Forces Command .
Why ?
Because Mexico's " government , its politicians , police and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels , " the report says .
While U.S. drug users enrich the cartels , the U.S. government pours huge amounts of money into defeating them .
The Bush administration sold Congress on the Merida Initiative , a multiyear , $ 1.4 billion aid package designed to provide training and high - tech assistance to help a besieged Mexican government combat the cartels .
Even in these days of gazillion - dollar bailouts , that 's a chunk of change .
But consider this : According to a report last fall from the Government Accountability Office , the United States has provided more than $ 6 billion to support Plan Colombia since fiscal 2000 .
The goal of reducing processing and distribution of illicit drugs ( mostly cocaine ) by 50 percent was not achieved , the GAO found .
A GAO report from July 15 , 2008 , says that since fiscal 2003 , the United States has provided more than $ 950 million to counternarcotics efforts in the 6 million square - mile " transit zone " that includes Central America , the Caribbean , the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern Pacific Ocean .
What did this buy ?
" Despite gains in international cooperation , several factors , including resource limitations and lack of political will , have impeded U.S. progress in helping governments become full and self - sustaining partners in the counternarcotics effort - a goal of U.S. assistance , " the report said .
Weary of the drug war
Our southern neighbors are getting tired of fighting our drug war .
Last month , the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy called for a shift from the " prohibitionist policies based on eradication , interdiction and criminalization . "
Former Latin American Presidents Ernesto Zedillo ( Mexico ) , Cesar Gaviria ( Colombia ) and Fernando Henrique Cardoso ( Brazil ) said the drug war has failed .
It was a tragically costly failure .
In testimony before Congress last June , Peter Reuter of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy and department of criminology , said , " It is likely that total expenditures for drug control , at all levels of government , totaled close to $ 40 billion in 2007 . "
He said about 500,000 people are in prison in the United States for drug offenses on any given day .
Piper says 800,000 people a year are arrested on marijuana charges , the vast majority for simple possession .
Now , consider the possibilities of a new approach .
In 2005 , economist Jeffrey A. Miron put together a report suggesting that if marijuana were taxed at rates similar to alcohol and tobacco , legal sales would raise $ 6.2 billion a year .
California Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , a Democrat from San Francisco , is trying to get his state to legalize marijuana for adult use , set up a state licensing system and levy a tax that some say could raise $ 1 billion a year .
Let 's be clear : Marijuana can cause dependency .
It saps initiative and energy .
It is unhealthful and smelly .
I do n't use it .
But a lot of people do like the effects of this intoxicant , and they believe they can control its addictive properties .
This is exactly why people drink margaritas during happy hour .
This is also why a war on drugs is unwinnable .
You'd think a country built on capitalism would understand basic laws of supply and demand .
Instead , a failed and irrational national policy blunders forward , costing billions , incarcerating large numbers of people and enriching ruthless crime syndicates .
The cartels are not stagnant .
They are growing in power and influence .
In Phoenix , Mexican cartels are blamed for a dramatic rise in kidnapping and other violence .
Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard says it may be only a matter of time before the kind of turf battles that are common in Mexico erupt along drug - transit corridors in Arizona .
Goddard , who does not support legalization , says , " I do support an intelligent dialogue ( on legalization ) . "
Brave but hopeless fight
Law enforcement has a smart - bomb approach to eliminating the bad guys .
Last month , the DEA announced Operation Xcellerator , a 21 - month multi-agency effort aimed at the Sinaloan cartel .
It culminated in more than 750 arrests and the seizure of 23 tons of drugs and $ 59.1 million in cash .
The police work involved was smart and courageous .
After all , cartels torture and kill cops .
But while police were putting their lives on the line for the war on drugs , U.S. drug users were helping the cartels make up for any economic losses .
It 's time to hit the bad guys where it really hurts .
Take away their cash cow .

Janet Jagan , a daughter of a middle - class family from Chicago who became enmeshed in anticolonial politics in Guyana and rose to become the first woman to be president of that South American nation , died Saturday in Georgetown , the Guyanese capital .
She was 88 .
Mrs. Jagan died at a government hospital after suffering an abdominal aneurysm , Guyana ’s health minister , Leslie Ramsammy , told Reuters .
Born Janet Rosenberg in 1920 , she was a student nurse at Cook County Hospital in Chicago when she met Cheddi Jagan , a dentistry student at Northwestern University and the eldest of 11 children of an Indo - Guyanese family of sugar cane workers .
His grandparents had arrived in British Guiana from India as indentured laborers .
They married , despite the fierce opposition of her parents , who were Jewish , and in 1943 they moved to British Guiana , where he established a dental practice and they both became involved in radical politics .
In 1950 , they founded the People ’s Progressive Party , and in 1953 , in elections under a new Constitution providing greater home rule , Dr. Jagan became chief minister .
But the Jagans ’ Marxist ideas aroused the suspicions of Prime Minister Winston Churchill , who sent warships and troops to topple the new government .
The Jagans were jailed .
Can a blog force a university to close a degree course ?
David Colquhoun , the University College London pharmacology professor behind the " Improbable science " blog would like to think so .
Since 2003 , Colquhoun has used his blog , along with freedom of information requests , to draw attention to universities running courses in complementary and alternative medicine ( Cam ) .
He argues that the treatments are unproven , degree courses unscientific , and universities wrong to award students bachelor 's or master 's of science qualifications .
" It 's particularly offensive that they 're called BSc , " he says .
" You have to address the question : ' Is it worth lying to patients to get that placebo effect ? ' .
They keep publishing what they call trials but are actually customer satisfaction surveys - you have no means of knowing how many people would have got better anyway .
Students are learning the very opposite of critical evaluation .
And they have to believe the homeopathy story in the end in order to go out and practice . "
Disappearing courses
The long and time - consuming campaign by Colquhoun and fellow scientists may finally be making a difference .
Last month , Salford University dropped its course in homeopathy for which the vice - chancellor , Professor Michael Harloe , won the praise of big - name scientists in a letter to the Times .
Westminster University is strengthening the " science base " of its courses , while the University of Central Lancashire ( Uclan ) suspended its homeopathy degree last year and is now undertaking a review of other courses .
No one from Salford would comment .
But a university statement acknowledges the criticism of the scientific establishment .
It says , however , that the decision was made for " financial and strategic reasons " , and it will " continue to encourage and promote research into complementary and alternative medicine " .
Uclan declined to comment until after its review ends in April .
But a course leader last year said the university had been " the subject of many attacks by the anti-homeopathy league " .
For Colquhoun , the VCs are the ones at fault .
" We 'd been contacting Harloe since spring last year and I 'd given up hearing anything back .
It really does show that a bit of persistence makes things happen . "
In the case of Westminster , the " idea you can put science into courses when they are simply anti-scientific is completely barmy " , Colquhoun adds .
" If they recruit more scientifically rigorous staff who are supposed to understand science , then the courses would crumble . "
He claims research to prove the effectiveness of Cam treatments is not done because academic practitioners " know that they would fail , but they say it 's because the methods of randomised clinical trials are unsuitable " .
As well as Salford , Uclan and Westminster , the anti-Cam lobby has so far focused on the universities of Middlesex , Thames Valley , West of England , London South Bank , Napier and Southampton .
But , in all , 16 universities across the country run a mixture of courses in subjects ranging from aromatherapy and herbalism to ayurvedic medicine and homeopathy .
Those teaching the courses insist they are academically rigorous and scientific .
Dr Peter Davies , dean of Westminster 's school of integrated health , says : " There 's been a certain amount of pressure [ from lobbyists ] but it has n't fazed us because we believe in what we 're doing .
And clinicians are referring people to complementary medicine therapists .
Our job is to make sure practitioners are practising safely , competently , know their limitations , and can converse with healthcare professionals . "
Davies says he welcomes the debate but it is n't as open as he would like .
" The views expressed are intransigent , whereas practice on the ground is very different , " he says .
" There 's no doubt that particular herbal remedies , Chinese or western , are extremely efficacious .
The anti-science lobby has put most attention on homeopathy .
But there are upwards of 450 medical doctors who practise it - I do n't believe they are all wrong or this is just a placebo effect .
Large numbers of people feel better having been treated by homeopathy .
" We need to understand these therapies in a much more critical way and that 's what we 're attempting to do .
We encourage our students to be research - minded and deliberately set them assignments where results may look positive , but if they dig deeper they 'll realise the methodology is flawed .
Intrinsic is the notion of reflective practice .
Half of orthodox medicine has not necessarily got an evidence base but it 's observed that people get better - that does n't remove the need to research thoroughly .
We 're attempting this by doing a clinical audit to establish a little more clearly what 's going on .
We 're running a trial on Chinese herbs in the treatment of menopause supported by the Department of Health .
We 're trying to offer patients other choices . "
George Lewith , professor of health research at Southampton University , has also felt under pressure .
" A formal complaint of academic fraud made about me to my university and ethics committee was investigated for two years and dismissed , " he says .
" My VC was n't sure whether to give me a personal chair because of what people might think , but our academic unit at Southampton received a 4 * [ top ] rating in the research assessment exercise and was the third best in primary care in the country .
There 's considerable suspicion about Cam and it's completely unfounded . "
Academic intent
All universities run courses in research methodology as part of their training , Lewith claims .
" The quality of degrees is an open joke but there 's academic intent in most of the new universities in relation to their degrees .
There 's little to choose between the clinical training of medics and practitioners .
The anatomy , physiology and pathology chiropractors learn is of a similar standard .
The courses of which I have personal experience are academically rigorous enough and turn out safe and sensible practitioners , " he says .
But Professor Edzard Ernst , director of the complementary medicine centre at Exeter University 's Peninsula medical school , which tests Cam therapies , says most of the subjects are so far removed from science they should not be taught as scientific courses .
" BScs in energy healing or homeopathy are not only out of line with science but profoundly the opposite of science .
They could be taught in a scientific fashion but , as far as I can see , they are n't and that 's disturbing .
People are very cagey about disclosing the contents of courses .
To teach at academic level , these courses need critical evaluators as teachers rather than promoters of it , " he says .
" Academics could present the claims and then look at the evidence and plausibility of the concepts , and do this with scientific rigour .
But the sad truth is that that 's not happening .
Students are unsuspecting victims of brainwashing , if you take it to the extreme , which is the exact opposite of an academic training . "
So why are the courses taught ?
" To put it bluntly , there 's a market for it , " Ernst suggests .
" This begs the question - what 's more important , academic rigour or market forces ?
Sadly , I think the abundance of these courses seems to indicate that it 's going the wrong way . "
Colquhoun , however , is more optimistic .
He believes the climate is starting to change after the Bush / Blair era where people believed in things because they wished they were true .
" This has been going on for a generation and it's about time for a swing in the other direction , " he suggests .
" Salford has set an example and it seems likely others will now follow .
If Uclan does stop courses , that would be a big deal . "

She designs unique handcrafted jewelry items representing all Barbie body parts .
In my view , Barbie remains the world ’s most beautiful doll with perfect body details , and if some do n’t have enough time to play with dolls anymore , at least they can proud themselves with the impressive Barbie limited editions from Mattel .
At the Margaux Lange online shop you can find lots of jewelry models that you ’ve never seen before , ranging from bracelets with Barbie lips and earrings with Barbie legs , to Necklaces with Barbie eyes and hands .
“ My childhood spent with Barbie cultivated my interest in adornment .
Extensive play with the doll and her miniature world strengthened my dexterity .
This is a skill imperative to the art of jewelry making .
Hence it feels natural for me to make art on a small scale .
I enjoy the funny juxtaposition of wearing the body , on the body .
Barbie has become the accessory instead of being accessorized .
I take pleasure in the contrast and contradiction of something mass - produced being transformed and revealed as a unique , handmade , wearable piece of art . ” – Margaux Lange .

More and more , more and more scientists are ganging up to write research studies .
It 's no longer unusual to see a paper that lists more than 500 - that 's five hundred - co-authors .
The journal Science Watch tracks statistics about which scientists publish where , when and how often .
Every few years , Science Watch makes a brave plunge into the sea of so - called multi-author papers .
Its most recent look shows that increasing numbers of papers have 50 , 100 , 200 and even 500 authors .
The most gaudy , of course , are the papers credited to more than 500 co-authors .
During 2003 , only ( only ! ) 40 of these big group efforts were published .
Then came a growth spurt .
2005 saw the publication of 131 of them , and subsequent years have seen production hold about steady .
If there were a prize for the largest number of co-authors , it would have gone to the 2,512 people credited with writing Precision Electroweak Measurements on the Z Resonance , which appeared in the journal Physics Reports in 2006 .
That 's a mild elevation from the previous record of 2,458 co-authors , attained just two years earlier when the Circulation Journal published a paper called Design and Baseline Characteristic of a Study of Primary Prevention of Coronary Events with Pravastatin Among Japanese with Mildly Elevated Cholesterol Levels .
In fact , at least one prize has been awarded for the highest number of co-authors .
In 2003 , the Ig Nobel prize for literature went to the approximately 976 co-authors of a medical study published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
That paper also had the distinction of having 100 times as many authors as pages .
In the new record - holder , the list of 2,512 authors stretches over 19 pages .
These hard - writing individuals come from more than 100 different institutions in many countries - the UK , Germany , Canada , Italy , Hungary , France , Switzerland , Canada , Israel , Japan , Poland , China , Belgium , Australia , the Netherlands , the Czech Republic and Sweden among them .
They appear to be a sociable bunch .
The very first word in their paper is " we " , and the final section elaborates on that same theme : " We would like to thank the Cern accelerator divisions ...
The SLD collaboration would like to thank the Slac accelerator department ....
We would also like to thank members of the CDF , Dø , NuTeV and E - 158 collaborations ... "
And so on .
The paper 's " references " section lists 264 papers that in some way influenced the new research .
Nearly all of those referenced papers have author lists too long to be , well , listed in the new paper .
Each list is credited only in abbreviated fashion : " FJ Hasert , et al " , " G Arnison , et al " , " M Banner , et al " .
And so forth .
It seems cold to discuss a group of 2,512 authors without mentioning any of their names .
But space here is limited .
Space there is limited , too - no first names are given , only initials .
So suffice to say that the final author in the group is J Zhou .

The Article : The Big Takeover :
The global economic crisis is n’t about money – it ’s about power .
How Wall Street insiders are using the bailout to stage a revolution by Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone .
The Text :
It ’s over — we ’re officially , royally fucked .
no empire can survive being rendered a permanent laughingstock , which is what happened as of a few weeks ago , when the buffoons who have been running things in this country finally went one step too far .
It happened when Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was forced to admit that he was once again going to have to stuff billions of taxpayer dollars into a dying insurance giant called AIG , itself a profound symbol of our national decline — a corporation that got rich insuring the concrete and steel of American industry in the country ’s heyday , only to destroy itself chasing phantom fortunes at the Wall Street card tables , like a dissolute nobleman gambling away the family estate in the waning days of the British Empire .
The latest bailout came as AIG admitted to having just posted the largest quarterly loss in American corporate history — some $ 61.7 billion .
In the final three months of last year , the company lost more than $ 27 million every hour .
That ’s $ 465,000 a minute , a yearly income for a median American household every six seconds , roughly $ 7,750 a second .
And all this happened at the end of eight straight years that America devoted to frantically chasing the shadow of a terrorist threat to no avail , eight years spent stopping every citizen at every airport to search every purse , bag , crotch and briefcase for juice boxes and explosive tubes of toothpaste .
Yet in the end , our government had no mechanism for searching the balance sheets of companies that held life - or - death power over our society and was unable to spot holes in the national economy the size of Libya ( whose entire GDP last year was smaller than AIG ’s 2008 losses ) .
So it ’s time to admit it :
We ’re fools , protagonists in a kind of gruesome comedy about the marriage of greed and stupidity .
And the worst part about it is that we ’re still in denial — we still think this is some kind of unfortunate accident , not something that was created by the group of psychopaths on Wall Street whom we allowed to gang - rape the American Dream .
When Geithner announced the new $ 30 billion bailout , the party line was that poor AIG was just a victim of a lot of shitty luck — bad year for business , you know , what with the financial crisis and all .
Edward Liddy , the company ’s CEO , actually compared it to catching a cold : “ The marketplace is a pretty crummy place to be right now , ” he said .
“ When the world catches pneumonia , we get it too . ”
In a pathetic attempt at name - dropping , he even whined that AIG was being “ consumed by the same issues that are driving house prices down and 401K statements down and Warren Buffet ’s investment portfolio down . ”
Liddy made AIG sound like an orphan begging in a soup line , hungry and sick from being left out in someone else ’s financial weather .
He conveniently forgot to mention that AIG had spent more than a decade systematically scheming to evade U.S. and international regulators , or that one of the causes of its “ pneumonia ” was making colossal , world - sinking $ 500 billion bets with money it did n’t have , in a toxic and completely unregulated derivatives market .
Nor did anyone mention that when AIG finally got up from its seat at the Wall Street casino , broke and busted in the afterdawn light , it owed money all over town — and that a huge chunk of your taxpayer dollars in this particular bailout scam will be going to pay off the other high rollers at its table .
Or that this was a casino unique among all casinos , one where middle - class taxpayers cover the bets of billionaires .
People are pissed off about this financial crisis , and about this bailout , but they ’re not pissed off enough .
The reality is that the worldwide economic meltdown and the bailout that followed were together a kind of revolution , a coup d’état .
They cemented and formalized a political trend that has been snowballing for decades : the gradual takeover of the government by a small class of connected insiders , who used money to control elections , buy influence and systematically weaken financial regulations .
The crisis was the coup de grâce : Given virtually free rein over the economy , these same insiders first wrecked the financial world , then cunningly granted themselves nearly unlimited emergency powers to clean up their own mess .
And so the gambling - addict leaders of companies like AIG end up not penniless and in jail , but with an Alien - style death grip on the Treasury and the Federal Reserve — “ our partners in the government , ” as Liddy put it with a shockingly casual matter - of - factness after the most recent bailout .
The mistake most people make in looking at the financial crisis is thinking of it in terms of money , a habit that might lead you to look at the unfolding mess as a huge bonus - killing downer for the Wall Street class .
But if you look at it in purely Machiavellian terms , what you see is a colossal power grab that threatens to turn the federal government into a kind of giant Enron — a huge , impenetrable black box filled with self - dealing insiders whose scheme is the securing of individual profits at the expense of an ocean of unwitting involuntary shareholders , previously known as taxpayers .
I. PATIENT ZERO
The best way to understand the financial crisis is to understand the meltdown at AIG .
AIG is what happens when short , bald managers of otherwise boring financial bureaucracies start seeing Brad Pitt in the mirror .
This is a company that built a giant fortune across more than a century by betting on safety - conscious policyholders — people who wear seat belts and build houses on high ground — and then blew it all in a year or two by turning their entire balance sheet over to a guy who acted like making huge bets with other people ’s money would make his dick bigger .
That guy — the Patient Zero of the global economic meltdown — was one Joseph Cassano , the head of a tiny , 400 - person unit within the company called AIG Financial Products , or AIGFP .
Cassano , a pudgy , balding Brooklyn College grad with beady eyes and way too much forehead , cut his teeth in the Eighties working for Mike Milken , the granddaddy of modern Wall Street debt alchemists .
Milken , who pioneered the creative use of junk bonds , relied on messianic genius and a whole array of insider schemes to evade detection while wreaking financial disaster .
Cassano , by contrast , was just a greedy little turd with a knack for selective accounting who ran his scam right out in the open , thanks to Washington ’s deregulation of the Wall Street casino .
“ It ’s all about the regulatory environment , ” says a government source involved with the AIG bailout .
“ These guys look for holes in the system , for ways they can do trades without government interference .
Whatever is unregulated , all the action is going to pile into that . ”
The mess Cassano created had its roots in an investment boom fueled in part by a relatively new type of financial instrument called a collateralized - debt obligation .
A CDO is like a box full of diced - up assets .
They can be anything : mortgages , corporate loans , aircraft loans , credit - card loans , even other CDOs .
So as X mortgage holder pays his bill , and Y corporate debtor pays his bill , and Z credit - card debtor pays his bill , money flows into the box .
The key idea behind a CDO is that there will always be at least some money in the box , regardless of how dicey the individual assets inside it are .
No matter how you look at a single unemployed ex-con trying to pay the note on a six - bedroom house , he looks like a bad investment .
But dump his loan in a box with a smorgasbord of auto loans , credit - card debt , corporate bonds and other crap , and you can be reasonably sure that somebody is going to pay up .
Say $ 100 is supposed to come into the box every month .
Even in an apocalypse , when $ 90 in payments might default , you ’ll still get $ 10 .
What the inventors of the CDO did is divide up the box into groups of investors and put that $ 10 into its own level , or “ tranche . ”
They then convinced ratings agencies like Moody ’s and S&P to give that top tranche the highest AAA rating — meaning it has close to zero credit risk .
Suddenly , thanks to this financial seal of approval , banks had a way to turn their shittiest mortgages and other financial waste into investment - grade paper and sell them to institutional investors like pensions and insurance companies , which were forced by regulators to keep their portfolios as safe as possible .
Because CDOs offered higher rates of return than truly safe products like Treasury bills , it was a win-win : Banks made a fortune selling CDOs , and big investors made much more holding them .
The problem was , none of this was based on reality .
“ The banks knew they were selling crap , ” says a London - based trader from one of the bailed - out companies .
To get AAA ratings , the CDOs relied not on their actual underlying assets but on crazy mathematical formulas that the banks cooked up to make the investments look safer than they really were .
“ They had some back room somewhere where a bunch of Indian guys who ’d been doing nothing but math for God knows how many years would come up with some kind of model saying that this or that combination of debtors would only default once every 10,000 years , ” says one young trader who sold CDOs for a major investment bank .
“ It was nuts . ”
Now that even the crappiest mortgages could be sold to conservative investors , the CDOs spurred a massive explosion of irresponsible and predatory lending .
In fact , there was such a crush to underwrite CDOs that it became hard to find enough subprime mortgages — read : enough unemployed meth dealers willing to buy million - dollar homes for no money down — to fill them all .
As banks and investors of all kinds took on more and more in CDOs and similar instruments , they needed some way to hedge their massive bets — some kind of insurance policy , in case the housing bubble burst and all that debt went south at the same time .
This was particularly true for investment banks , many of which got stuck holding or “ warehousing ” CDOs when they wrote more than they could sell .
And that ’s were Joe Cassano came in .
Known for his boldness and arrogance , Cassano took over as chief of AIGFP in 2001 .
He was the favorite of Maurice “ Hank ” Greenberg , the head of AIG , who admired the younger man ’s hard - driving ways , even if neither he nor his successors fully understood exactly what it was that Cassano did .
According to a source familiar with AIG ’s internal operations , Cassano basically told senior management , “ You know insurance , I know investments , so you do what you do , and I ’ll do what I do — leave me alone . ”
Given a free hand within the company , Cassano set out from his offices in London to sell a lucrative form of “ insurance ” to all those investors holding lots of CDOs .
His tool of choice was another new financial instrument known as a credit - default swap , or CDS .
The CDS was popularized by J.P. Morgan , in particular by a group of young , creative bankers who would later become known as the “ Morgan Mafia , ” as many of them would go on to assume influential positions in the finance world .
In 1994 , in between booze and games of tennis at a resort in Boca Raton , Florida , the Morgan gang plotted a way to help boost the bank ’s returns .
One of their goals was to find a way to lend more money , while working around regulations that required them to keep a set amount of cash in reserve to back those loans .
What they came up with was an early version of the credit - default swap .
In its simplest form , a CDS is just a bet on an outcome .
Say Bank A writes a million - dollar mortgage to the Pope for a town house in the West Village .
Bank A wants to hedge its mortgage risk in case the Pope ca n’t make his monthly payments , so it buys CDS protection from Bank B , wherein it agrees to pay Bank B a premium of $ 1,000 a month for five years .
In return , Bank B agrees to pay Bank A the full million - dollar value of the Pope ’s mortgage if he defaults .
In theory , Bank A is covered if the Pope goes on a meth binge and loses his job .
When Morgan presented their plans for credit swaps to regulators in the late Nineties , they argued that if they bought CDS protection for enough of the investments in their portfolio , they had effectively moved the risk off their books .
Therefore , they argued , they should be allowed to lend more , without keeping more cash in reserve .
A whole host of regulators — from the Federal Reserve to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — accepted the argument , and Morgan was allowed to put more money on the street .
What Cassano did was to transform the credit swaps that Morgan popularized into the world ’s largest bet on the housing boom .
In theory , at least , there ’s nothing wrong with buying a CDS to insure your investments .
Investors paid a premium to AIGFP , and in return the company promised to pick up the tab if the mortgage - backed CDOs went bust .
But as Cassano went on a selling spree , the deals he made differed from traditional insurance in several significant ways .
First , the party selling CDS protection did n’t have to post any money upfront .
When a $ 100 corporate bond is sold , for example , someone has to show 100 actual dollars .
But when you sell a $ 100 CDS guarantee , you do n’t have to show a dime .
So Cassano could sell investment banks billions in guarantees without having any single asset to back it up .
Secondly , Cassano was selling so - called “ naked ” CDS deals .
In a “ naked ” CDS , neither party actually holds the underlying loan .
In other words , Bank B not only sells CDS protection to Bank A for its mortgage on the Pope — it turns around and sells protection to Bank C for the very same mortgage .
This could go on ad nauseam :
You could have Banks D through Z also betting on Bank A ’s mortgage .
Unlike traditional insurance , Cassano was offering investors an opportunity to bet that someone else ’s house would burn down , or take out a term life policy on the guy with AIDS down the street .
It was no different from gambling , the Wall Street version of a bunch of frat brothers betting on Jay Feely to make a field goal .
Cassano was taking book for every bank that bet short on the housing market , but he did n’t have the cash to pay off if the kick went wide .
In a span of only seven years , Cassano sold some $ 500 billion worth of CDS protection , with at least $ 64 billion of that tied to the subprime mortgage market .
AIG did n’t have even a fraction of that amount of cash on hand to cover its bets , but neither did it expect it would ever need any reserves .
So long as defaults on the underlying securities remained a highly unlikely proposition , AIG was essentially collecting huge and steadily climbing premiums by selling insurance for the disaster it thought would never come .
Initially , at least , the revenues were enormous : AIGFP ’s returns went from $ 737 million in 1999 to $ 3.2 billion in 2005 .
Over the past seven years , the subsidiary ’s 400 employees were paid a total of $ 3.5 billion ; Cassano himself pocketed at least $ 280 million in compensation .
Everyone made their money — and then it all went to shit .
II .
THE REGULATORS
Cassano ’s outrageous gamble would n’t have been possible had he not had the good fortune to take over AIGFP just as Sen.
Phil Gramm — a grinning , laissez - faire ideologue from Texas — had finished engineering the most dramatic deregulation of the financial industry since Emperor Hien Tsung invented paper money in 806 A.D.
For years , Washington had kept a watchful eye on the nation ’s banks .
Ever since the Great Depression , commercial banks — those that kept money on deposit for individuals and businesses — had not been allowed to double as investment banks , which raise money by issuing and selling securities .
The Glass - Steagall Act , passed during the Depression , also prevented banks of any kind from getting into the insurance business .
But in the late Nineties , a few years before Cassano took over AIGFP , all that changed .
The Democrats , tired of getting slaughtered in the fundraising arena by Republicans , decided to throw off their old reliance on unions and interest groups and become more “ business - friendly . ”
Wall Street responded by flooding Washington with money , buying allies in both parties .
In the 10 - year period beginning in 1998 , financial companies spent $ 1.7 billion on federal campaign contributions and another $ 3.4 billion on lobbyists .
They quickly got what they paid for .
In 1999 , Gramm co-sponsored a bill that repealed key aspects of the Glass - Steagall Act , smoothing the way for the creation of financial megafirms like Citigroup .
The move did away with the built - in protections afforded by smaller banks .
In the old days , a local banker knew the people whose loans were on his balance sheet :
He was n’t going to give a million - dollar mortgage to a homeless meth addict , since he would have to keep that loan on his books .
But a giant merged bank might write that loan and then sell it off to some fool in China , and who cared ?
The very next year , Gramm compounded the problem by writing a sweeping new law called the Commodity Futures Modernization
Act that made it impossible to regulate credit swaps as either gambling or securities .
Commercial banks — which , thanks to Gramm , were now competing directly with investment banks for customers — were driven to buy credit swaps to loosen capital in search of higher yields .
“ By ruling that credit - default swaps were not gaming and not a security , the way was cleared for the growth of the market , ” said Eric Dinallo , head of the New York State Insurance Department .
The blanket exemption meant that Joe Cassano could now sell as many CDS contracts as he wanted , building up as huge a position as he wanted , without anyone in government saying a word .
“ You have to remember , investment banks are n’t in the business of making huge directional bets , ” says the government source involved in the AIG bailout .
When investment banks write CDS deals , they hedge them .
But insurance companies do n’t have to hedge .
And that ’s what AIG did .
“ They just bet massively long on the housing market , ” says the source .
“ Billions and billions . ”
In the biggest joke of all , Cassano ’s wheeling and dealing was regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision , an agency that would prove to be defiantly uninterested in keeping watch over his operations .
How a behemoth like AIG came to be regulated by the little - known and relatively small OTS is yet another triumph of the deregulatory instinct .
Under another law passed in 1999 , certain kinds of holding companies could choose the OTS as their regulator , provided they owned one or more thrifts ( better known as savings - and - loans ) .
Because the OTS was viewed as more compliant than the Fed or the Securities and Exchange Commission , companies rushed to reclassify themselves as thrifts .
In 1999 , AIG purchased a thrift in Delaware and managed to get approval for OTS regulation of its entire operation .
Making matters even more hilarious , AIGFP — a London - based subsidiary of an American insurance company — ought to have been regulated by one of Europe ’s more stringent regulators , like Britain ’s Financial Services Authority .
But the OTS managed to convince the Europeans that it had the muscle to regulate these giant companies .
By 2007 , the EU had conferred legitimacy to OTS supervision of three mammoth firms — GE , AIG and Ameriprise .
That same year , as the subprime crisis was exploding , the Government Accountability Office criticized the OTS , noting a “ disparity between the size of the agency and the diverse firms it oversees . ”
Among other things , the GAO report noted that the entire OTS had only one insurance specialist on staff — and this despite the fact that it was the primary regulator for the world ’s largest insurer !
“ There ’s this notion that the regulators could n’t do anything to stop AIG , ” says a government official who was present during the bailout .
“ That ’s bullshit .
What you have to understand is that these regulators have ultimate power .
They can send you a letter and say , ‘ You do n’t exist anymore , ’ and that ’s basically that .
They do n’t even really need due process .
The OTS could have said , ‘ We ’re going to pull your charter ; we ’re going to pull your license ; we ’re going to sue you . ’
And getting sued by your primary regulator is the kiss of death . ”
When AIG finally blew up , the OTS regulator ostensibly in charge of overseeing the insurance giant — a guy named C.K. Lee — basically admitted that he had blown it .
His mistake , Lee said , was that he believed all those credit swaps in Cassano ’s portfolio were “ fairly benign products . ”
Why ?
Because the company told him so .
“ The judgment the company was making was that there was no big credit risk , ” he explained .
( Lee now works as Midwest region director of the OTS ; the agency declined to make him available for an interview . )
In early March , after the latest bailout of AIG , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner took what seemed to be a thinly veiled shot at the OTS , calling AIG a “ huge , complex global insurance company attached to a very complicated investment bank / hedge fund that was allowed to build up without any adult supervision . ”
But even without that “ adult supervision , ” AIG might have been OK had it not been for a complete lack of internal controls .
For six months before its meltdown , according to insiders , the company had been searching for a full - time chief financial officer and a chief risk - assessment officer , but never got around to hiring either .
That meant that the 18th - largest company in the world had no one checking to make sure its balance sheet was safe and no one keeping track of how much cash and assets the firm had on hand .
The situation was so bad that when outside consultants were called in a few weeks before the bailout , senior executives were unable to answer even the most basic questions about their company — like , for instance , how much exposure the firm had to the residential - mortgage market .
III .
THE CRASH
Ironically , when reality finally caught up to Cassano , it was n’t because the housing market crapped but because of AIG itself .
Before 2005 , the company ’s debt was rated triple - A , meaning he did n’t need to post much cash to sell CDS protection :
The solid creditworthiness of AIG ’s name was guarantee enough .
But the company ’s crummy accounting practices eventually caused its credit rating to be downgraded , triggering clauses in the CDS contracts that forced Cassano to post substantially more collateral to back his deals .
By the fall of 2007 , it was evident that AIGFP ’s portfolio had turned poisonous , but like every good Wall Street huckster , Cassano schemed to keep his insane , Earth - swallowing gamble hidden from public view .
That August , balls bulging , he announced to investors on a conference call that “ it is hard for us , without being flippant , to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing $ 1 in any of those transactions . ”
As he spoke , his CDS portfolio was racking up $ 352 million in losses .
When the growing credit crunch prompted senior AIG executives to re-examine its liabilities , a company accountant named Joseph St. Denis became “ gravely concerned ” about the CDS deals and their potential for mass destruction .
Cassano responded by personally forcing the poor sap out of the firm , telling him he was “ deliberately excluded ” from the financial review for fear that he might “ pollute the process . ”
The following February , when AIG posted $ 11.5 billion in annual losses , it announced the resignation of Cassano as head of AIGFP , saying an auditor had found a “ material weakness ” in the CDS portfolio .
But amazingly , the company not only allowed Cassano to keep $ 34 million in bonuses , it kept him on as a consultant for $ 1 million a month .
In fact , Cassano remained on the payroll and kept collecting his monthly million through the end of September 2008 , even after taxpayers had been forced to hand AIG $ 85 billion to patch up his fuck - ups .
When asked in October why the company still retained Cassano at his $ 1 million - a- month rate despite his role in the probable downfall of Western civilization , CEO Martin Sullivan told Congress with a straight face that AIG wanted to “ retain the 20 - year knowledge that Mr. Cassano had . ”
( Cassano , who is apparently hiding out in his lavish town house near Harrods in London , could not be reached for comment . )
What sank AIG in the end was another credit downgrade .
Cassano had written so many CDS deals that when the company was facing another downgrade to its credit rating last September , from AA to A , it needed to post billions in collateral — not only more cash than it had on its balance sheet but more cash than it could raise even if it sold off every single one of its liquid assets .
Even so , management dithered for days , not believing the company was in serious trouble .
AIG was a dried - up prune , sapped of any real value , and its top executives did n’t even know it .
On the weekend of September 13th , AIG ’s senior leaders were summoned to the offices of the New York Federal Reserve .
Regulators from Dinallo ’s insurance office were there , as was Geithner , then chief of the New York Fed .
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , who spent most of the weekend preoccupied with the collapse of Lehman Brothers , came in and out .
Also present , for reasons that would emerge later , was Lloyd Blankfein , CEO of Goldman Sachs .
The only relevant government office that was n’t represented was the regulator that should have been there all along : the OTS .
“ We sat down with Paulson , Geithner and Dinallo , ” says a person present at the negotiations .
“ I did n’t see the OTS even once . ”
On September 14th , according to another person present , Treasury officials presented Blankfein and other bankers in attendance with an absurd proposal : “ They basically asked them to spend a day and check to see if they could raise the money privately . ”
The laughably short time span to complete the mammoth task made the answer a foregone conclusion .
At the end of the day , the bankers came back and told the government officials , gee , we checked , but we ca n’t raise that much .
And the bailout was on .
A short time later , it came out that AIG was planning to pay some $ 90 million in deferred compensation to former executives , and to accelerate the payout of $ 277 million in bonuses to others — a move the company insisted was necessary to “ retain key employees . ”
When Congress balked , AIG canceled the $ 90 million in payments .
Then , in January 2009 , the company did it again .
After all those years letting Cassano run wild , and after already getting caught paying out insane bonuses while on the public till , AIG decided to pay out another $ 450 million in bonuses .
And to whom ?
To the 400 or so employees in Cassano ’s old unit , AIGFP , which is due to go out of business shortly !
Yes , that ’s right , an average of $ 1.1 million in taxpayer - backed money apiece , to the very people who spent the past decade or so punching a hole in the fabric of the universe !
“ We , uh , needed to keep these highly expert people in their seats , ” AIG spokeswoman Christina Pretto says to me in early February .
“ But did n’t these ‘ highly expert people ’ basically destroy your company ? ” I ask .
Pretto protests , says this is n’t fair .
The employees at AIGFP have already taken pay cuts , she says .
Not retaining them would dilute the value of the company even further , make it harder to wrap up the unit ’s operations in an orderly fashion .
The bonuses are a nice comic touch highlighting one of the more outrageous tangents of the bailout age , namely the fact that , even with the planet in flames , some members of the Wall Street class ca n’t even get used to the tragedy of having to fly coach .
“ These people need their trips to Baja , their spa treatments , their hand jobs , ” says an official involved in the AIG bailout , a serious look on his face , apparently not even half - kidding .
“ They do n’t function well without them . ”
IV .
THE POWER GRAB
So that ’s the first step in wall street ’s power grab : making up things like credit - default swaps and collateralized - debt obligations , financial products so complex and inscrutable that ordinary American dumb people — to say nothing of federal regulators and even the CEOs of major corporations like AIG — are too intimidated to even try to understand them .
That , combined with wise political investments , enabled the nation ’s top bankers to effectively scrap any meaningful oversight of the financial industry .
In 1997 and 1998 , the years leading up to the passage of Phil Gramm ’s fateful act that gutted Glass - Steagall , the banking , brokerage and insurance industries spent $ 350 million on political contributions and lobbying .
Gramm alone — then the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee — collected $ 2.6 million in only five years .
The law passed 90 - 8 in the Senate , with the support of 38 Democrats , including some names that might surprise you : Joe Biden , John Kerry , Tom Daschle , Dick Durbin , even John Edwards .
The act helped create the too - big - to - fail financial behemoths like Citigroup , AIG and Bank of America — and in turn helped those companies slowly crush their smaller competitors , leaving the major Wall Street firms with even more money and power to lobby for further deregulatory measures .
“ We ’re moving to an oligopolistic situation , ” Kenneth Guenther , a top executive with the Independent Community Bankers of America , lamented after the Gramm measure was passed .
The situation worsened in 2004 , in an extraordinary move toward deregulation that never even got to a vote .
At the time , the European Union was threatening to more strictly regulate the foreign operations of America ’s big investment banks if the U.S. did n’t strengthen its own oversight .
So the top five investment banks got together on April 28th of that year and — with the helpful assistance of then - Goldman Sachs chief and future Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson — made a pitch to George Bush ’s SEC chief at the time , William Donaldson , himself a former investment banker .
The banks generously volunteered to submit to new rules restricting them from engaging in excessively risky activity .
In exchange , they asked to be released from any lending restrictions .
The discussion about the new rules lasted just 55 minutes , and there was not a single representative of a major media outlet there to record the fateful decision .
Donaldson OK ’d the proposal , and the new rules were enough to get the EU to drop its threat to regulate the five firms .
The only catch was , neither Donaldson nor his successor , Christopher Cox , actually did any regulating of the banks .
They named a commission of seven people to oversee the five companies , whose combined assets came to total more than $ 4 trillion .
But in the last year and a half of Cox ’s tenure , the group had no director and did not complete a single inspection .
Great deal for the banks , which originally complained about being regulated by both Europe and the SEC , and ended up being regulated by no one .
Once the capital requirements were gone , those top five banks went hog - wild , jumping ass - first into the then - raging housing bubble .
One of those was Bear Stearns , which used its freedom to drown itself in bad mortgage loans .
In the short period between the 2004 change and Bear ’s collapse , the firm ’s debt - to - equity ratio soared from 12 - 1 to an insane 33 - 1 .
Another culprit was Goldman Sachs , which also had the good fortune , around then , to see its CEO , a bald - headed Frankensteinian goon named Hank Paulson ( who received an estimated $ 200 million tax deferral by joining the government ) , ascend to Treasury secretary .
Freed from all capital restraints , sitting pretty with its man running the Treasury , Goldman jumped into the housing craze just like everyone else on Wall Street .
Although it famously scored an $ 11 billion coup in 2007 when one of its trading units smartly shorted the housing market , the move did n’t tell the whole story .
In truth , Goldman still had a huge exposure come that fateful summer of 2008 — to none other than Joe Cassano .
Goldman Sachs , it turns out , was Cassano ’s biggest customer , with $ 20 billion of exposure in Cassano ’s CDS book .
Which might explain why Goldman chief Lloyd Blankfein was in the room with ex-Goldmanite Hank Paulson that weekend of September 13th , when the federal government was supposedly bailing out AIG .
When asked why Blankfein was there , one of the government officials who was in the meeting shrugs .
“ One might say that it ’s because Goldman had so much exposure to AIGFP ’s portfolio , ” he says .
“ You ’ll never prove that , but one might suppose . ”
Market analyst Eric Salzman is more blunt .
“ If AIG went down , ” he says , “ there was a good chance Goldman would not be able to collect . ”
The AIG bailout , in effect , was Goldman bailing out Goldman .
Eventually , Paulson went a step further , elevating another ex-Goldmanite named Edward Liddy to run AIG — a company whose bailout money would be coming , in part , from the newly created TARP program , administered by another Goldman banker named Neel Kashkari .
V. REPO MEN
There are plenty of people who have noticed , in recent years , that when they lost their homes to foreclosure or were forced into bankruptcy because of crippling credit - card debt , no one in the government was there to rescue them .
But when Goldman Sachs — a company whose average employee still made more than $ 350,000 last year , even in the midst of a depression — was suddenly faced with the possibility of losing money on the unregulated insurance deals it bought for its insane housing bets , the government was there in an instant to patch the hole .
That ’s the essence of the bailout : rich bankers bailing out rich bankers , using the taxpayers ’ credit card .
The people who have spent their lives cloistered in this Wall Street community are n’t much for sharing information with the great unwashed .
Because all of this shit is complicated , because most of us mortals do n’t know what the hell LIBOR is or how a REIT works or how to use the word “ zero coupon bond ” in a sentence without sounding stupid — well , then , the people who do speak this idiotic language cannot under any circumstances be bothered to explain it to us and instead spend a lot of time rolling their eyes and asking us to trust them .
That roll of the eyes is a key part of the psychology of Paulsonism .
The state is now being asked not just to call off its regulators or give tax breaks or funnel a few contracts to connected companies ; it is intervening directly in the economy , for the sole purpose of preserving the influence of the megafirms .
In essence , Paulson used the bailout to transform the government into a giant bureaucracy of entitled assholedom , one that would socialize “ toxic ” risks but keep both the profits and the management of the bailed - out firms in private hands .
Moreover , this whole process would be done in secret , away from the prying eyes of NASCAR dads , broke - ass liberals who read translations of French novels , subprime mortgage holders and other such financial losers .
Some aspects of the bailout were secretive to the point of absurdity .
In fact , if you look closely at just a few lines in the Federal Reserve ’s weekly public disclosures , you can literally see the moment where a big chunk of your money disappeared for good .
The H4 report ( called “ Factors Affecting Reserve Balances ” ) summarizes the activities of the Fed each week .
You can find it online , and it ’s pretty much the only thing the Fed ever tells the world about what it does .
For the week ending February 18th , the number under the heading “ Repurchase Agreements ” on the table is zero .
It ’s a significant number .
Why ?
In the pre-crisis days , the Fed used to manage the money supply by periodically buying and selling securities on the open market through so - called Repurchase Agreements , or Repos .
The Fed would typically dump $ 25 billion or so in cash onto the market every week , buying up Treasury bills , U.S. securities and even mortgage - backed securities from institutions like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan , who would then “ repurchase ” them in a short period of time , usually one to seven days .
This was the Fed ’s primary mechanism for controlling interest rates :
Buying up securities gives banks more money to lend , which makes interest rates go down .
Selling the securities back to the banks reduces the money available for lending , which makes interest rates go up .
If you look at the weekly H4 reports going back to the summer of 2007 , you start to notice something alarming .
At the start of the credit crunch , around August of that year , you see the Fed buying a few more Repos than usual — $ 33 billion or so .
By November , as private - bank reserves were dwindling to alarmingly low levels , the Fed started injecting even more cash than usual into the economy : $ 48 billion .
By late December , the number was up to $ 58 billion ; by the following March , around the time of the Bear Stearns rescue , the Repo number had jumped to $ 77 billion .
In the week of May 1st , 2008 , the number was $ 115 billion — “ out of control now , ” according to one congressional aide .
For the rest of 2008 , the numbers remained similarly in the stratosphere , the Fed pumping as much as $ 125 billion of these short - term loans into the economy — until suddenly , at the start of this year , the number drops to nothing .
Zero .
The reason the number has dropped to nothing is that the Fed had simply stopped using relatively transparent devices like repurchase agreements to pump its money into the hands of private companies .
By early 2009 , a whole series of new government operations had been invented to inject cash into the economy , most all of them completely secretive and with names you ’ve never heard of .
There is the Term Auction Facility , the Term Securities Lending Facility , the Primary Dealer Credit Facility , the Commercial Paper Funding Facility and a monster called the Asset - Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility ( boasting the chat - room horror - show acronym ABCPMMMFLF ) .
For good measure , there ’s also something called a Money Market Investor Funding Facility , plus three facilities called Maiden Lane I , II and III to aid bailout recipients like Bear Stearns and AIG .
While the rest of America , and most of Congress , have been bugging out about the $ 700 billion bailout program called TARP , all of these newly created organisms in the Federal Reserve zoo have quietly been pumping not billions but trillions of dollars into the hands of private companies ( at least $ 3 trillion so far in loans , with as much as $ 5.7 trillion more in guarantees of private investments ) .
Although this technically is n’t taxpayer money , it still affects taxpayers directly , because the activities of the Fed impact the economy as a whole .
And this new , secretive activity by the Fed completely eclipses the TARP program in terms of its influence on the economy .
No one knows who ’s getting that money or exactly how much of it is disappearing through these new holes in the hull of America ’s credit rating .
Moreover , no one can really be sure if these new institutions are even temporary at all — or whether they are being set up as permanent , state - aided crutches to Wall Street , designed to systematically suck bad investments off the ledgers of irresponsible lenders .
“ They ’re supposed to be temporary , ” says Paul - Martin Foss , an aide to Rep. Ron Paul .
“ But we keep getting notices every six months or so that they ’re being renewed .
They just sort of quietly announce it . ”
None other than disgraced senator Ted Stevens was the poor sap who made the unpleasant discovery that if Congress did n’t like the Fed handing trillions of dollars to banks without any oversight , Congress could apparently go fuck itself — or so said the law .
When Stevens asked the GAO about what authority Congress has to monitor the Fed , he got back a letter citing an obscure statute that nobody had ever heard of before : the Accounting and Auditing Act of 1950 .
The relevant section , 31 USC 714 ( b ) , dictated that congressional audits of the Federal Reserve may not include “ deliberations , decisions and actions on monetary policy matters . ”
The exemption , as Foss notes , “ basically includes everything . ”
According to the law , in other words , the Fed simply cannot be audited by Congress .
Or by anyone else , for that matter .
VI .
WINNERS AND LOSERS
Stevens is n’t the only person in Congress to be given the finger by the Fed .
In January , when Rep. Alan Grayson of Florida asked Federal Reserve vice chairman Donald Kohn where all the money went — only $ 1.2 trillion had vanished by then — Kohn gave Grayson a classic eye roll , saying he would be “ very hesitant ” to name names because it might discourage banks from taking the money .
“ Has that ever happened ? ” Grayson asked .
“ Have people ever said , ‘ We will not take your $ 100 billion because people will find out about it ? ' ”
“ Well , we said we would not publish the names of the borrowers , so we have no test of that , ” Kohn answered , visibly annoyed with Grayson ’s meddling .
Grayson pressed on , demanding to know on what terms the Fed was lending the money .
Presumably it was buying assets and making loans , but no one knew how it was pricing those assets — in other words , no one knew what kind of deal it was striking on behalf of taxpayers .
So when Grayson asked if the purchased assets were “ marked to market ” — a methodology that assigns a concrete value to assets , based on the market rate on the day they are traded —
Kohn answered , mysteriously , “ The ones that have market values are marked to market . ”
The implication was that the Fed was purchasing derivatives like credit swaps or other instruments that were basically impossible to value objectively — paying real money for God knows what .
“ Well , how much of them do n’t have market values ? ” asked Grayson .
“ How much of them are worthless ? ”
“ None are worthless , ” Kohn snapped .
“ Then why do n’t you mark them to market ? ” Grayson demanded .
“ Well , ” Kohn sighed , “ we are marking the ones to market that have market values . ”
In essence , the Fed was telling Congress to lay off and let the experts handle things .
“ It ’s like buying a car in a used - car lot without opening the hood , and saying , ‘ I think it ’s fine , ' ” says Dan Fuss , an analyst with the investment firm Loomis Sayles .
“ The salesman says , ‘ Do n’t worry about it .
Trust me . ’
It ’ll probably get us out of the lot , but how much farther ?
None of us knows . ”
When one considers the comparatively extensive system of congressional checks and balances that goes into the spending of every dollar in the budget via the normal appropriations process , what ’s happening in the Fed amounts to something truly revolutionary — a kind of shadow government with a budget many times the size of the normal federal outlay , administered dictatorially by one man , Fed chairman Ben Bernanke .
“ We spend hours and hours and hours arguing over $ 10 million amendments on the floor of the Senate , but there has been no discussion about who has been receiving this $ 3 trillion , ” says Sen. Bernie Sanders .
“ It is beyond comprehension . ”
Count Sanders among those who do n’t buy the argument that Wall Street firms should n’t have to face being outed as recipients of public funds , that making this information public might cause investors to panic and dump their holdings in these firms .
“ I guess if we made that public , they ’d go on strike or something , ” he muses .
And the Fed is n’t the only arm of the bailout that has closed ranks .
The Treasury , too , has maintained incredible secrecy surrounding its implementation even of the TARP program , which was mandated by Congress .
To this date , no one knows exactly what criteria the Treasury Department used to determine which banks received bailout funds and which did n’t — particularly the first $ 350 billion given out under Bush appointee Hank Paulson .
The situation with the first TARP payments grew so absurd that when the Congressional Oversight Panel , charged with monitoring the bailout money , sent a query to Paulson asking how he decided whom to give money to , Treasury responded — and this is n’t a joke — by directing the panel to a copy of the TARP application form on its website .
Elizabeth Warren , the chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel , was struck nearly speechless by the response .
“ Do you believe that ? ” she says incredulously .
“ That ’s not what we had in mind . ”
Another member of Congress , who asked not to be named , offers his own theory about the TARP process .
“ I think basically if you knew Hank Paulson , you got the money , ” he says .
This cozy arrangement created yet another opportunity for big banks to devour market share at the expense of smaller regional lenders .
While all the bigwigs at Citi and Goldman and Bank of America who had Paulson on speed - dial got bailed out right away — remember that TARP was originally passed because money had to be lent right now , that day , that minute , to stave off emergency — many small banks are still waiting for help .
Five months into the TARP program , some not only have n’t received any funds , they have n’t even gotten a call back about their applications .
“ There ’s definitely a feeling among community bankers that no one up there cares much if they make it or not , ” says Tanya Wheeless , president of the Arizona Bankers Association .
Which , of course , is exactly the opposite of what should be happening , since small , regional banks are far less guilty of the kinds of predatory lending that sank the economy .
“ They ’re not giving out subprime loans or easy credit , ” says Wheeless .
“ At the community level , it ’s much more bread - and - butter banking . ”
Nonetheless , the lion ’s share of the bailout money has gone to the larger , so - called “ systemically important ” banks .
“ It ’s like Treasury is picking winners and losers , ” says one state banking official who asked not to be identified .
This itself is a hugely important political development .
In essence , the bailout accelerated the decline of regional community lenders by boosting the political power of their giant national competitors .
Which , when you think about it , is insane :
What had brought us to the brink of collapse in the first place was this relentless instinct for building ever - larger megacompanies , passing deregulatory measures to gradually feed all the little fish in the sea to an ever - shrinking pool of Bigger Fish .
To fix this problem , the government should have slowly liquidated these monster , too - big - to - fail firms and broken them down to smaller , more manageable companies .
Instead , federal regulators closed ranks and used an almost completely secret bailout process to double down on the same faulty , merger - happy thinking that got us here in the first place , creating a constellation of megafirms under government control that are even bigger , more unwieldy and more crammed to the gills with systemic risk .
In essence , Paulson and his cronies turned the federal government into one gigantic , half - opaque holding company , one whose balance sheet includes the world ’s most appallingly large and risky hedge fund , a controlling stake in a dying insurance giant , huge investments in a group of teetering megabanks , and shares here and there in various auto - finance companies , student loans , and other failing businesses .
Like AIG , this new federal holding company is a firm that has no mechanism for auditing itself and is run by leaders who have very little grasp of the daily operations of its disparate subsidiary operations .
In other words , it ’s AIG ’s rip- roaringly shitty business model writ almost inconceivably massive — to echo Geithner , a huge , complex global company attached to a very complicated investment bank / hedge fund that ’s been allowed to build up without adult supervision .
How much of what kinds of crap is actually on our balance sheet , and what did we pay for it ?
When exactly will the rent come due , when will the money run out ?
Does anyone know what the hell is going on ?
And on the linear spectrum of capitalism to socialism , where exactly are we now ?
Is there a dictionary word that even describes what we are now ?
It would be funny , if it were n’t such a nightmare .
VII .
YOU DON’T GET IT
The real question from here is whether the Obama administration is going to move to bring the financial system back to a place where sanity is restored and the general public can have a say in things or whether the new financial bureaucracy will remain obscure , secretive and hopelessly complex .
It might not bode well that Geithner , Obama ’s Treasury secretary , is one of the architects of the Paulson bailouts ; as chief of the New York Fed , he helped orchestrate the Goldman - friendly AIG bailout and the secretive Maiden Lane facilities used to funnel funds to the dying company .
Neither did it look good when Geithner — himself a protégé of notorious Goldman alum John Thain , the Merrill Lynch chief who paid out billions in bonuses after the state spent billions bailing out his firm — picked a former Goldman lobbyist named Mark Patterson to be his top aide .
In fact , most of Geithner ’s early moves reek strongly of Paulsonism .
He has continually talked about partnering with private investors to create a so - called “ bad bank ” that would systemically relieve private lenders of bad assets — the kind of massive , opaque , quasi- private bureaucratic nightmare that Paulson specialized in .
Geithner even refloated a Paulson proposal to use TALF , one of the Fed ’s new facilities , to essentially lend cheap money to hedge funds to invest in troubled banks while practically guaranteeing them enormous profits .
God knows exactly what this does for the taxpayer , but hedge - fund managers sure love the idea .
“ This is exactly what the financial system needs , ” said Andrew Feldstein , CEO of Blue Mountain Capital and one of the Morgan Mafia .
Strangely , there are n’t many people who do n’t run hedge funds who have expressed anything like that kind of enthusiasm for Geithner ’s ideas .
As complex as all the finances are , the politics are n’t hard to follow .
By creating an urgent crisis that can only be solved by those fluent in a language too complex for ordinary people to understand , the Wall Street crowd has turned the vast majority of Americans into non-participants in their own political future .
There is a reason it used to be a crime in the Confederate states to teach a slave to read : Literacy is power .
In the age of the CDS and CDO , most of us are financial illiterates .
By making an already too - complex economy even more complex , Wall Street has used the crisis to effect a historic , revolutionary change in our political system — transforming a democracy into a two - tiered state , one with plugged - in financial bureaucrats above and clueless customers below .
The most galling thing about this financial crisis is that so many Wall Street types think they actually deserve not only their huge bonuses and lavish lifestyles but the awesome political power their own mistakes have left them in possession of .
When challenged , they talk about how hard they work , the 90 - hour weeks , the stress , the failed marriages , the hemorrhoids and gallstones they all get before they hit 40 .
“ But wait a minute , ” you say to them .
“ No one ever asked you to stay up all night eight days a week trying to get filthy rich shorting what ’s left of the American auto industry or selling $ 600 billion in toxic , irredeemable mortgages to ex-strippers on work release and Taco Bell clerks .
Actually , come to think of it , why are we even giving taxpayer money to you people ?
Why are we not throwing your ass in jail instead ? ”
But before you even finish saying that , they ’re rolling their eyes , because You Do n’t Get It .
These people were never about anything except turning money into money , in order to get more money ; valueswise they ’re on par with crack addicts , or obsessive sexual deviants who burgle homes to steal panties .
Yet these are the people in whose hands our entire political future now rests .
Good luck with that , America .
And enjoy tax season .
Analysis : I ’ll leave it to James K. Galbraith : “ Today , the signature of modern American capitalism is neither benign competition , nor class struggle , nor an inclusive middle - class utopia .
Instead , predation has become the dominant feature — a system wherein the rich have come to feast on decaying systems built for the middle class .
The predatory class is not the whole of the wealthy ; it may be opposed by many others of similar wealth .
But it is the defining feature , the leading force .
And its agents are in full control of the government under which we live . ”

A groundbreaking new loudspeaker , less than 0.25 mm thick , has been developed by University of Warwick engineers , it 's flat , flexible , could be hung on a wall like a picture , and its particular method of sound generation could make public announcements in places like passenger terminals clearer , crisper , and easier to hear .
Lightweight and inexpensive to manufacture , the speakers are slim and flexible : they could be concealed inside ceiling tiles or car interiors , or printed with a design and hung on the wall like a picture .
Pioneered by University of Warwick spin - out company , Warwick Audio Technologies ' the ' Flat , Flexible Loudspeaker ' ( FFL ) is ideal for public spaces where it delivers planar directional sound waves , which project further than sound from conventional speakers .
Steve Couchman , CEO of Warwick Audio Technologies , believes it could entirely replace the speakers currently used in homes and in cars , as well as in public address systems used in passenger terminals and shopping centres .
He says : " We believe this is a truly innovative technology .
Its size and flexibility means it can be used in all sorts of areas where space is at a premium .
Audio visual companies are investigating its use as point of sale posters for smart audio messaging and car manufacturers are particularly interested in it for its light weight and thinness , which means it can be incorporated into the headlining of cars , rather than lower down in the interior . "
All speakers work by converting an electric signal into sound .
Usually , the signal is used to generate a varying magnetic field , which in turn vibrates a mechanical cone , so producing the sound .
Warwick Audio Technology 's FFL technology is a carefully designed assembly of thin , conducting and insulating , materials resulting in the development of a flexible laminate , which when excited by an electrical signal will vibrate and produce sound .
The speaker laminate operates as a perfect piston resonator .
The entire diaphragm therefore radiates in phase , forming an area source .
The wave front emitted by the vibrating surface is phase coherent , producing a plane wave with very high directivity and very accurate sound imaging .
" Another great application would be in PA systems for public spaces , " says Steve .
" The sound produced by FFLs can be directed straight at its intended audience .
The sound volume and quality does not deteriorate as it does in conventional speakers , which means that public announcements in passenger terminals , for example , could be clearer , crisper , and easier to hear . "
The FFL was first developed by Dr Duncan Billson and Professor David Hutchins , both from the University of Warwick , with early trials using just two sheets of tinfoil and an insulating layer of baking paper to produce sound .
Since then its design has significantly evolved and the technology is now ready for commercial exploitation
The company is currently in negotiations with a number of commercial partners and continues to welcome fresh approaches .
It expects to launch its first commercial product later this year .

Researchers have a new understanding of why a compound in red wine appears to retard aging in the same way as a very low - calorie diet .
Writing in the journal , Cell , Harvard Medical School professor of pathology David Sinclair and colleagues reported that increasing the levels of genes called sirtuin genes protects against aging by similar mechanisms in both very simple organisms like yeast , and in mammals .

Universal Mechanism
By Heather Mayer
“ This is the first potentially fundamental , root cause of aging that we ’ve found , ” Sinclair said in a Harvard press release .
“ There may very well be others , but our finding that aging in a simple yeast cell is directly relevant to aging in mammals comes as a surprise . ”
Ten years ago , Sinclair , working with Leonard Guarente , discovered a yeast gene , that reversed the effects of aging .
More recently , they gave mice an extra copy of the mammalian version of the gene , called SIRT - 1 , confirming their hypothesis that sirtuin , as well as caloric restriction , leads to a longer lifespan .
When stimulated by the red wine chemical resveratrol , or caloric restriction , sirtuins seem to have positive effects on aging and health , according to Sinclair ’s research .
The studies showed that sirtuins affect the aging processes in two different ways .
They help regulate gene activity , as well as help repair DNA damage .
Regulating gene activity is extremely important because if some genes are turned on at the wrong time , there can be damage done to cells or organs .
But , while a sirtuin is off repairing DNA damage — from UV rays or free radicals — it ’s not monitoring the genes .
This allows the 618 chromatin , which packages the genes , to come apart , allowing the unwanted gene expression .
As the mice aged , Sinclair ’s team found there is more DNA damage , forcing sirtuins to leave their cell posts more frequently , allowing more genes to be expressed when they should n’t be .
Once extra doses of sirtuins were administered to the mice , their average lifespan increased from 24 to 46 percent , according to the study .
Leonard Guarente , Novartis Professor of Biology at MIT , who is not an author on the paper , says in the press release : " This should lead to new approaches to protect cells against the ravages of aging by finding drugs that can stabilize this redistribution of sirtuins over time . "

Listen as Miss California stumbles through her answer during the Miss USA Pageant ; replying to Perez Hilton 's question regarding same sex marriage .
She says , " I think it 's great that Americans are able to chose one or the other . "
Oh , they are ?
Ummm , in how many states is that choice possible ?
" We live in a land where you can choose same sex marriage or opposite marriage . "
Really , you can ?
And what exactly is OPPOSITE MARRIAGE anyway ?
( lol )
She then goes on to say , " You know what ?
In my country and in my family , I think that I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman .
No offense to anyone out there ; but that 's how I was raised and that 's how I think , that it should be between a man and a woman .
Thank you . "
Ugh !
When the music labels unearth a file - sharer to prosecute , they apply the thumbscrews gently at first .
The accused infringer receives a letter asking him or her to settle , usually for $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 .
That 's a lot , but those who do n't settle face much worse .
Now , exposing oneself to certain kinds of new music might actually be worth that outrageous fee , but the people that the RIAA fingers generally turn out to have truly execrable taste in music — or perhaps the lawyers simply pluck out horrible songs on purpose to make the legal process as embarrassing as possible .
Case in point : Shaun Adams , a resident of Nebraska , who has just been named in a file - sharing lawsuit filed in an Omaha federal court this week .
Adams is accused of sharing nine songs , including " I Want Action " by 80s hair - metal band Poison , " Drug Ballad " by Eminem , and " I'm Real " from an album that someone actually had the temerity to call J To Tha L - O ! : The Remixes .
( And the less said about the song " Thuggish Ruggish Bone " the better . )
But , musical taste aside , what 's going on here ?
The RIAA said last year that it was abandoning its mass lawsuit strategy , focusing instead on inking voluntary graduated response deals with US ISPs .
It may have dropped the " mass " from its mass lawsuit strategy , but the music industry is still filing federal cases and still asking for statutory damages that have no necessary connection to real losses .
Rank hypocrisy ?
Evidence that the music business is stuffed to the gills with lying liars ?
Not quite ; reality has an unfortunate habit of being complicated , and the wind - down of this lawsuit campaign is no exception .
Let 's take a closer look at what 's going on .
Anatomy of a lawsuit
File - sharing lawsuits generally begin with someone being identified by an investigator like MediaSentry .
That 's what happened in the Adams case .
The complaint tells us that " plaintiffs identified an individual using LimeWire on the P2P network Gnutella at IP address 75.163.64.246 on March 8 , 2007 at 09:59:25 EST distributing 901 audio files over the Internet . "
For McSherry , the worries about pursuing and then abandoning lawsuits sound more like PR problems than legal ones .
Courts , she says , will look at each subpoena request on its merits , and wo n't simply refuse to grant future subpoenas because the RIAA had failed to fully act on one issued in a previous case .
Instead , she thinks the issue may be that a wholesale pullback from cases might make the RIAA look bad .
With that IP address in hand , the RIAA then shoots off an " evidence preservation notice " to the ISP controlling the assignment of that IP address .
The notice warns the ISP that a lawsuit is coming and that information on the IP address in question should be kept .
Music industry lawyers at this point still have nothing but a number , and ISPs wo n't generally supply any information without a court order .
So off the RIAA goes to court .
Music industry lawyers file a John Doe lawsuit with a federal court and ask the judge for approval to subpoena the ISP .
Such permission is generally granted , and a subpoena is sent .
The ISP , which has probably retained the necessary data , looks up the user account assigned to the given IP address at the time in question .
The name is finally turned over the music industry .
( Note that this process has raised plenty of questions about accuracy . )
This process takes time , so the alleged infringement detected on March 8 , 2007 , may not have a name attached to it for months .
Once the RIAA has a name and address , it sends out the dreaded settlement letters that promise a lawsuit if the accused does n't pay up .
This can also take time .
In some cases , people will call the settlement hotline , talk about the issue , make counteroffers , and in general keep the settlement process open .
As long as that 's the case , the RIAA generally does n't press the issue in court .
But once the settlement process breaks down , a complaint is prepared and filed in federal court .
This time , though , it 's not a John Doe complaint but a case filed against a named individual .
At this point , plenty of time has passed since the alleged infringement was detected , but from the RIAA 's perspective , the group is not filing a " new " lawsuit here .
It has simply converted an ongoing John Doe lawsuit into a named suit .
That 's what happened in the Adams case this week , and it's why the RIAA says that it's no hypocrite for continuing with the legal process ( remember that the group had always said it would continue litigating cases in progress , rather than dropping them ) .
So the interesting question here is n't about whether the group " lied " but about why it continues to press ahead with such cases .
Given that the music industry has collectively decided that the sue - 'em - all approach was n't working , and given that it costs money at a time when the RIAA is suffering layoffs and budget cuts , why bother with cases against individuals in Omaha ?
Surely the group could simply not file the newly - named case ; and while it 's at it , why do n't the labels just drop the drawn - out cases against Jammie Thomas in Minnesota and Joel Tenenbaum in Massachusetts ?
The RIAA speaks
We put that question to the music trade group .
Spokesperson Jonathan Lamy says that new cases were in fact no longer initiated after the summer of 2008 , but cases like the Adams one — which have been in process since early 2007 , remember — need to continue .
He casts the issue as one of fairness .
" We 're obviously pleased to transition to a new program going forward but that does n't mean we can give a free pass to those who downloaded music illegally in the past , " he told Ars .
" How fair would it be to the thousands of individuals who took responsibility for their actions and settled their case while others are let off the hook ?
We 're still in the business of deterrence and it must be credible . "
Well ... okay .
Maybe .
But how fair is it to the thousands of individuals who took responsibility for their actions and settled their cases while everyone else in the country was let off the hook after the summer of 2008 ?
In essence , many people paid up because they happened to infringe copyright at one particular time , while plenty of others who did the same thing at a later date faced no penalty .
For that matter , if fairness is the criteria , was it " fair " for 30,000 people to be put through the wringer while millions and millions suffered no penalty at all ?
And was it fair for the one court case that actually reached a verdict to award the labels more than $ 200,000 for a few songs ?
We 'll leave such questions to the ethicists and philosophers .
But more may be at play in the RIAA 's continuance of these cases than just a concern with treating everyone fairly .
Are there any legal principles that might make it problematic to drop cases that are already in process ?
The lawyers weigh in
Ars checked in with Ben Sheffner , an IP attorney who has done work for FOX , NBC Universal , and the John McCain campaign .
Sheffner agrees that no legal principle prevents the RIAA from dropping cases like the one against Adams , but he does think the labels " have a legitimate fear that if they abruptly drop actual ongoing suits , the courts will get annoyed at them , and could be sympathetic to motions for attorneys ' fees , counterclaims for abuse of process , malicious prosecution suits , and the like . "
Those sorts of countersuits are n't just a possibility ; numerous defendants have raised issues of process and malicious prosecution , including defendant Tanya Andersen back in 2007 .
It 's also not great form to seek subpoenas , use them to unmask people , and then not proceed with a trial .
As Sheffner puts it , " courts could then be less sympathetic to them in the future when they seek subpoenas — the courts may think that they 're using the subpoena process for something other than actually litigating a lawsuit through to its conclusion ( settlement or otherwise ) , and they wo n't like that at all .
These are debatable points , but the labels ' position is definitely grounded in legal reality . "
EFF attorney Corynne McSherry , on the other hand , is n't buying what the RIAA is selling .
" I 'm not seeing it , " she tells Ars. Dismissals happen all the time ; Tanya Andersen 's case , for instance , had actually been dismissed by the music labels before Andersen filed her own lawsuit against them .
If a defendant has not yet responded to a complaint , the plaintiff can dismiss the case voluntarily and simply ; if a defendant has responded , their permission is needed to dismiss .
It 's hard to see how people like Adams would n't be willing to provide that , and why courts would n't sign off on it .
For McSherry , the worries about pursuing and then abandoning lawsuits sound more like PR problems than legal ones .
Courts , she says , will look at each subpoena request on its merits , and wo n't simply refuse to grant future subpoenas because the RIAA had failed to fully act on one issued in a previous case .
Instead , she thinks the issue may be that a wholesale pullback from cases might make the RIAA look bad .
Whatever its reasons for continuing to litigate these cases , the RIAA at least appears to be sticking by the letter of the terms of its announcement last year ; the labels described what they were going to do and are sticking with it .
Whether that strategy is good , necessary , or fair is another question , and one that will probably keep Shaun Adams up at night through the course of his federal trial .
MBABANE
2008 was a difficult year for people living with HIV in Swaziland .
The cost of food and transport rose steeply , and supplies of antiretroviral ( ARV ) drugs and medicines for treating opportunistic infections ran low in public health facilities .
" Last year was a crisis , " said Maphangisa Dlamini , a home - care nurse at Swaziland Positive Living for Life ( SWAPOL ) , an AIDS support organization that joined demonstrations protesting the perilously low supply of ARVs .
" I think at this point there is improvement , " he told IRIN / PlusNews .
Government has more than doubled its health allocation , from 10 percent of the national budget in 2008 to 17.7 percent in 2009 .
Money has also been allocated to renovating the main referral hospital in Mbabane , the capital , and a special facility for treating patients with drug - resistant tuberculosis ( TB ) opened in January , although it is still operating at a fraction of its capacity .
Despite staffing problems , the roll - out of HIV / AIDS testing and treatment management from hospitals , which are usually located in urban centres , to local clinics has been proceeding .
The number of people on ARV medication increased from about 27,000 towards the end of 2008 to about 32,000 at present .
An estimated 60,000 Swazis are in need of treatment , but Sophia Mukasa Monico , the UNAIDS country coordinator , is confident that Swaziland will reach the universal access target of having 80 percent of people in need of ARVs on the drugs by 2010 .
Keeping people on treatment presents perhaps the most serious challenge for Swaziland where about 30 percent of patients drop out of treatment during their first year on medication , according to the National Emergency Response Committee on HIV / AIDS ( NERCHA ) , which coordinates Swaziland 's HIV / AIDS response .
Treatment barriers
Poverty is the biggest barrier .
Bringing treatment to patients helps reduce their transport costs , but some can scarcely afford enough food to take with their medication .
" People can't take pills every day when they do n't have food every day , " Dlamini pointed out .
People can't take pills every day when they do n't have food every day
Gcina Gwebu is an adherence officer working out of the Good Shepherd Hospital in Siteki , the main referral facility in the Lubombo Region in eastern Swaziland .
His job is to follow up on patients who have failed to come to the hospital for drug refills .
Today he is at the homestead of a young pregnant woman who has defaulted on her ARV treatment .
" When I saw her three weeks ago , she said she was n't taking her drugs because she did n't have food to take with them , " he told IRIN / PlusNews .
" They 're poor people . " Gwebu encouraged the woman to come to the hospital to pick up some corn-soya food supplement donated by the World Food Programme and restart her treatment .
According to the woman 's sister - in - law , she followed his advice , but on the day she came to the hospital there was no corn-soya .
She died a few days later .
Many patients start treatment too late to benefit from the drugs , partly because of stigma , but also because of persistent beliefs in the power of traditional medicine and faith healing , said Mukasa Monico of UNAIDS .
" By the time they realize that does n't work , they 've wasted time .
" Swaziland has no programme for providing HIV and AIDS education to traditional and faith healers , many of whom discourage people from taking ARVs .
Perhaps the most worrying news for those tasked with running the treatment programme was the publication in March of new government figures suggesting that Swaziland 's HIV epidemic , already the most severe in the world , has not yet peaked .
An antenatal survey found that the percentage of pregnant women infected with HIV had climbed from 39 percent in 2006 to 42 percent in 2008 .
Mukasa Monico pointed out that Swaziland 's epidemic was " still young " compared to countries like Uganda , where prevalence peaked in the early 1990s , but the need for more effective HIV prevention is clearly urgent .
Antoinette Malima , a gender specialist at the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , commented that awareness - raising and condom distribution were of limited use in the context of high levels of poverty , which drove many women into sexual relationships for economic reasons .
" People know [ about HIV risk ] , but they 're not taking the precautions , " she said .
" A woman who has seven children to feed may not be worried about contracting HIV , but about getting food on the table .

Ask yourself the following question : “ What do I know about climate change ? ”
If you answered “ very little ” or “ not enough , ” then the new guide Climate Literacy – The Essential Principles of Climate Sciences might be a good starting point .
It lays out seven principles that every person should know about climate science :
The Sun is the primary source of energy for Earths climate system .
Climate is regulated by complex interactions among components of the Earth system .
Climate is regulated by complex interactions among components of the Earth system .
Life on Earth depends on , is shaped by , and affects climate .
Climate varies over space and time through both natural and man-made processes .
Our understanding of the climate system is improved through observations , theoretical studies , and modeling .
Human activities are impacting the climate system .
Climate change will have consequences for the Earth system and human lives .
It ’s not appropriate to know these seven principles and believe them as a Christian believes the Ten Commandments .
These principles are based on information that someone who is climate literate has to know .
For example , to understand that “ life on Earth depends on , is shaped by , and affects climate , ” a climate literate person also needs to have a basic understanding of ecology , the physics of greenhouse gases , that extinctions have happened because of climate change , that human civilization occurred in a period of relative climactic stability , and that we have proof that life has , and continues , to change the composition of the atmosphere .
In other words , a climate literate person is pretty scientifically literate as well .
The information supporting the principles is mostly generic , but some of it is downright disturbing when you understand the ramifications .
For example , one of the consequences described is this :
Climate plays an important role in the global distribution of freshwater resources .
Changing precipitation patterns and temperature conditions will alter the distribution and availability of freshwater resources , reducing reliable access to water for many people and their crops .
Winter snowpack and mountain glaciers that provide water for human use are declining as a result of global warming .
In other words , permanent droughts , dust bowl - like conditions , and dried up rivers around the world are likely as as consequence of climate disruption .
Not a pleasant thing to think about , really , which is probably why the authors of this guide described it so carefully using neutral language .
Perhaps the largest challenge to making this guide available and improving climate literacy is in the introduction , before the guide officially starts .
It says , in part :
A climate literate person : understands the essential principles of Earth ’s climate system ,
knows how to assess scientifically credible information about climate ,
communicates about climate and climate change in a meaningful way , and
is able to make informed and responsible decisions with regard to actions that may affect climate .
( emphasis added )
“ Scientific credibility ” is probably the most difficult thing for a non-scientist to evaluate , especially given the state of anti-intellectualism and the media in the U.S.
But given the large number of voices claiming to know the truth , it ’s arguably the most important skill that the guide ’s authors could hope to teach a climate - illiterate public .
And those authors ?
Here ’s the list to date :
13 U.S. agencies : Department of Agriculture , Department of Commerce , Department of Defense , Department of Energy , Department of Health and Human Services , Department of the Interior , Department of State , Department of Transportation , Environmental Protection Agency , NASA , National Science Foundation , Smithsonian Institution , USAID
Other government groups : Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences , National Institute of Standards and Technology , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , The National Center for Atmospheric Research , U.S. Geological Survey , U.S. Forest Service
Other groups : American Association for the Advancement of Science Project 2061 , American Meterological Society , Association of Science - Technology Centers , Bowman Global Change , Challenger Center for Space Science Education , Climate Literacy Network , College of Exploration , Federation of Earth Science Information Parters , Lawrence Hall of Science , University of California - Berkeley , National Environmental Education Foundation , National Geographic Education Programs , National Science Teachers Association , North American Association for Environmental Education , Sally Ride Science , TERC , Inc. , The GLOBE Program
In my opinion , that list forms a pretty credible foundation upon which to build a program of climate literacy .

Synchronized chaos and natural climate variability
A new paper by two mathematicians from the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee titled “ Has the climate recently shifted ? ” was released a couple of weeks ago .
It asks whether there has been a climate “ shift ” in recent years and if so , how did it occur .
The authors , Kyle L. Swanson and Anastasios A. Tsonis , propose that the climate has in fact shifted recently and historically over the 20th century and they propose a mechanism for this shift known as “ synchronized chaos . ”
If you ’re unfamiliar with the term “ synchronized chaos , ” you ’re not alone .
In the Earth ’s climate , there are any number of short and long term cycles going on at the same time , ranging from several different types of orbital variations ( Milankovic cycles ) to the El Nino Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) to the 11 and 22 years solar cycles to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and more .
Over the Earth ’s recent geologic past , ice ages have been driven largely by the Milankovic cycles .
However , not all of these variations are cycles with a nearly constant period like the solar cycle .
If you look at the ENSO image below , you ’ll see that it varies pretty widely in the time between cold and hot cycles and how hot and cold each side gets .
Synchronized chaos is the idea that , when certain of these chaotic variations come together in a certain way and begin to couple to one another , the climate changes from one relatively stable mode to another – it “ changes gears , ” so to speak .
Swanson and Tsonis propose in their paper that the variations they ’ve been analyzing synchronized four times in the 20th century , specifically in 1910 - 1920 , 1938 - 1945 , 1956 - 1960 , and 1976 - 1981 .
In three of those periods there was also coupling , and the climate appears to have changed gears in those periods .
The climate transitioned from cooling to heating around 1910 , back to cooling around 1940 , and then back to heating again around 1975 .
The authors explain the difference between synchronized variations and coupled variations as follows :
Think of a bicycle team engaged in a team time trial .
The riders are all synchronized , with their motions carefully planned to maximize the teams overall speed .
However , if those riders were coupled together , for example by attaching their bikes together with a rope , the slightest misstep among one of the bikers would be communicated immediately through the team and would lead to a group crash .
Of more immediate interest , however , is the fact that the authors have uncovered a new point of coupling in 2001 / 2002 .
As the media has been reporting since about the middle of 2008 , this decade has been pretty much flat as far as global heating goes , and Swanson and Tsonis suggest that this may be because the climate changed gears again eight years ago , and that the change was driven by internal shifts in how the climate functions rather than by an external source such as anthropogenic carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) .
Swanson and Tsonis suggest that this change in function could be an unusually large amount of oceanic heat absorption or a change in how clouds are affecting the Earth ’s albedo .
While anthropogenic climate disruption skeptics and deniers are likely going to latch onto this paper as proof that the climate changes without the help of human industry , the authors specifically addressed this in their conclusion :
It is straightforward to argue that a climate with significant internal variability is a climate that is very sensitive to applied anthropogenic radiative anomalies ( c.f. Roe [ 2009 ] ) .
If the role of internal variability in the climate system is as large as this analysis would seem to suggest , warming over the 21st century may well be larger than that predicted by the current generation of models , given the propensity of those models to underestimate climate internal variability [ Kravtsov and Spannagle 2008 ] .
Put another way , if the climate truly is borderline stable under normal circumstances , it wo n’t take much to throw it completely out of whack .

First federal loan guarantee for solar energy issued
Last week , Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced that the Department of Energy ( DoE ) issued the first ever federal loan guarantee to a solar panel manufacturer .
Solyndra Inc. , makers of cylindrical solar cells , was granted $ 535 million in order to cover 73 % of the construction costs for a new panel manufacturing facility in California .
This was the first loan granted in a program that was passed four years ago and that has $ 38.5 billion dollars remaining that the Bush administration never spent .
The recently passed stimulus package has another $ 60 billion in loan guarantees that are yet to be distributed .
According to the Washington Post article , Secretary Chu hopes to cut down the time to process an application from years to several months , and in the process use the loan guarantees to create a large number of energy - related jobs .
The Solyndra guarantees are expected to employ 3000 construction workers , an additional 500 at the factory once it ’s operational , and another 500 employees at the companies that supply Solyndra with their raw materials and critical componets .

Stop drilling , baby !
STOP !
“ Drill , baby !
Drill ! ”
That was the refrain pushed by the GOP last summer during the run-up to the election .
And it was a powerful phrase , driven by frustration at the price of oil , rising electricity and natural gas prices around the country , and the irrational hope that new oil drilled today would make prices fall tomorrow .
But the NYTimes now reports that there ’s a new refrain being heard at drilling fields around the country as the price for oil and natural gas falls dramatically off it ’s 2008 highs : Stop !
With the price of gasoline 1/3 to 1/2 what it was last year , the lower prices are good for consumers hurt by the general state of the economy .
But with lower prices comes less pressure on oil and gas companies to produce more .
This in turn means that there ’s less reason for those companies to drill for relatively expensive U.S. oil and natural gas , especially when there ’s other places around the world where oil and gas are cheaper due to fewer and lower regulatory hurdles .
In addition , the NYTimes reports that the companies are also pumping less oil and gas from the wells that they ’ve already drilled .
The sudden drop in drilling has energy experts worried about what will happen when the recession turns around .
Not only are the drilling crews disbanding or moving overseas , the newly drilled wells will see drops in oil and gas productions by as early as 2010 , likely leading to yet another spike in oil and / or gas prices nationwide .
And if the economy recovers into another energy price spike , it ’s a pretty safe bet that the recovery will stall out or even reverse again .
And this is likely to be the case so long as the U.S. remains dependent on fossil fuels .

We 're not sure where this best fits into our many post - apocalyptic nightmare scenarios , but it 's practically begging for Mad Max to drive it through a field of vampire zombies .
Captured in Kansas , this bulldog - in - black is a purpose - built storm chaser with some seriously thick steel plate armor , bullet proof glass and a rotating turret up top .
We 're assuming it makes its home somewhere in Colorado — based on the plates on the support trucks — but that 's almost beside the point , it can live wherever it wants to .
But how to modify it ?
Good question .
Our thoughts after the jump .

Our first inclination is to add flame throwers , of course .
Then there has to be some form of chopping too , a couple buzz - saw blades right at head level .
Oh crap .

The long awaited details of Geithner 's " plan " for dealing with bad bank assets is finally out .
Githener 's plan is disingenuous at best .
If people want to be outraged at something , it should be over Geithner 's plan .
The Wall Street Journal has the story in Timothy Geithner : My Plan for Bad Bank Assets .
The American economy and much of the world now face extraordinary challenges , and confronting these challenges will continue to require extraordinary actions .
No crisis like this has a simple or single cause , but as a nation we borrowed too much and let our financial system take on irresponsible levels of risk .
My Comment
The depth of public anger and the gravity of this crisis require that every policy we take be held to the most serious test : whether it gets our financial system back to the business of providing credit to working families and viable businesses , and helps prevent future crises .
Today , we are announcing another critical piece of our plan to increase the flow of credit and expand liquidity .
Our new Public - Private Investment Program will set up funds to provide a market for the legacy loans and securities that currently burden the financial system .
The Public - Private Investment Program will purchase real - estate related loans from banks and securities from the broader markets .
Banks will have the ability to sell pools of loans to dedicated funds , and investors will compete to have the ability to participate in those funds and take advantage of the financing provided by the government .
The funds established under this program will have three essential design features .
First , they will use government resources in the form of capital from the Treasury , and financing from the FDIC and Federal Reserve , to mobilize capital from private investors .
Second , the Public - Private Investment Program will ensure that private - sector participants share the risks alongside the taxpayer , and that the taxpayer shares in the profits from these investments .
These funds will be open to investors of all types , such as pension funds , so that a broad range of Americans can participate .
Third , private - sector purchasers will establish the value of the loans and securities purchased under the program , which will protect the government from overpaying for these assets .
My Comment
The new Public - Private Investment Program will initially provide financing for $ 500 billion with the potential to expand up to $ 1 trillion over time , which is a substantial share of real - estate related assets originated before the recession that are now clogging our financial system .
Over time , by providing a market for these assets that does not now exist , this program will help improve asset values , increase lending capacity by banks , and reduce uncertainty about the scale of losses on bank balance sheets .
The ability to sell assets to this fund will make it easier for banks to raise private capital , which will accelerate their ability to replace the capital investments provided by the Treasury .
My Comment
Our approach shares risk with the private sector , efficiently leverages taxpayer dollars , and deploys private - sector competition to determine market prices for currently illiquid assets .
Simply hoping for banks to work these assets off over time risks prolonging the crisis in a repeat of the Japanese experience .

Moving forward , we as a nation must work together to strike the right balance between our need to promote the public trust and using taxpayer money prudently to strengthen the financial system , while also ensuring the trust of those market participants who we need to do their part to get credit flowing to working families and businesses -- large and small -- across this nation .
My Comment
This requires those in the private sector to remember that government assistance is a privilege , not a right .
When financial institutions come to us for direct financial assistance , our government has a responsibility to ensure these funds are deployed to expand the flow of credit to the economy , not to enrich executives or shareholders .
My Comment
We cannot solve this crisis without making it possible for investors to take risks .
While this crisis was caused by banks taking too much risk , the danger now is that they will take too little .
My Comment
Our nation deserves better choices than , on one hand , accepting the catastrophic damage caused by a failure like Lehman Brothers , or on the other hand being forced to pour billions of taxpayer dollars into an institution like AIG to protect the economy against that scale of damage .
Our goal must be a stronger system that can provide the credit necessary for recovery , and that also ensures that we never find ourselves in this type of financial crisis again .
We are moving quickly to achieve those goals , and we will keep at it until we have done so .
What Our Nations Deserves
Our nation deserves the Fed , the Treasury , and Congress to stop acting like socialist fools .
That 's what taxpayers deserve .
Geithner 's galling plan is as far removed from that ideal as possible .
Sample Investment Under the Legacy Loans Program
Step 1 : If a bank has a pool of residential mortgages with $ 100 face value that it is seeking to divest , the bank would approach the FDIC .
Step 2 : The FDIC would determine , according to the above process , that they would be willing to leverage the pool at a 6 - to - 1 debt - to - equity ratio .
Step 3 : The pool would then be auctioned by the FDIC , with several private sector bidders submitting bids .
The highest bid from the private sector – in this example , $ 84 – would be the winner and would form a Public - Private Investment Fund to purchase the pool of mortgages .
Step 4 : Of this $ 84 purchase price , the FDIC would provide guarantees for $ 72 of financing , leaving $ 12 of equity .
Step 5 : The Treasury would then provide 50 % of the equity funding required on a side - by - side basis with the investor .
In this example , Treasury would invest approximately $ 6 , with the private investor contributing $ 6 .
Step 6 : The private investor would then manage the servicing of the asset pool and the timing of its disposition on an ongoing basis – using asset managers approved and subject to oversight by the FDIC .

Geithner 's Plan " Extremely Dangerous
Tim Geithner has finally revealed his plan to fix the banking system and economy .
Paul Krugman , James Galbraith , and others have already trashed it .
[ We spoke with noted economist Galbraith this morning .
In the accompanying segment , he calls the Treasury Secretary ’s plan “ extremely dangerous . ” ]
Why ?
In short , because the plan is yet another massive , ineffective gift to banks and Wall Street .
Taxpayers , of course , will take the hit .
We think Geithner is suffering from five fundamental misconceptions about what is wrong with the economy .
Five Misconceptions
The trouble with the economy is that the banks are n't lending .
The reality :
The economy is in trouble because American consumers and businesses took on way too much debt and are now collapsing under the weight of it .
: The economy is in trouble because American consumers and businesses took on way too much debt and are now collapsing under the weight of it .
The banks are n't lending because their balance sheets are loaded with " bad assets " that the market has temporarily mispriced .
The reality :
The banks are n't lending ( much ) because they have decided to stop making loans to people and companies who can't pay them back .
: The banks are n't lending ( much ) because they have decided to stop making loans to people and companies who can't pay them back .
Bad assets are " bad " because the market does n't understand how much they are really worth .
The reality :
The bad assets are bad because they are worth less than the banks say they are .
: The bad assets are bad because they are worth less than the banks say they are .
Once we get the " bad assets " off bank balance sheets , the banks will start lending again .
The reality :
The banks will remain cautious about lending , because the housing market and economy are still deteriorating .
So they 'll sit there and say they are lending while waiting for the economy to bottom .
: The banks will remain cautious about lending , because the housing market and economy are still deteriorating .
So they 'll sit there and say they are lending while waiting for the economy to bottom .
Once the banks start lending , the economy will recover .
The reality : American consumers still have debt coming out of their ears , and they 'll be working it off for years .
The two charts below from Ned Davis illustrate the real problem :
An explosion of debt relative to GDP .
The first is Nonfinancial Debt To GDP .
The second is Total Debt To GDP .
In Geithner 's plan , this debt wo n't disappear .
It will just be passed from banks to taxpayers , where it will sit until the government finally admits that a major portion of it will never be paid back .
Total Credit Market Debt vs. GDP

Political Will vs. Consumer Psychology
What happens next depends somewhat on the political will of the central banks and politicians .
However , it depends more on the psychology of the borrowers .
If consumers and businesses refuse to spend and instead pay back debts ( or default on them along with rising unemployment ) , the picture simply is not inflationary , at least to any significant decree .
The credit bubble that just popped exceeded that preceding the great depression , not just in the US but worldwide .
Thus , it is unrealistic to expect the deflationary bust to be anything other than the biggest bust in history .
Those looking for hyperinflation or even strong inflation in light of the above , are simply looking at the wrong model .
At some point the market value of credit will start expanding again , but that is likely further down the road , and weaker in scope than most think .
Simply hoping for banks to work these assets off over time risks prolonging the crisis in a repeat of the Japanese experience .
FDIC Seeks $ 500 Billion Borrowing Power
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd is moving to allow the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to temporarily borrow as much as $ 500 billion from the Treasury Department .
The Connecticut Democrat 's effort -- which comes in response to urging from FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- would give the FDIC access to more money to rebuild its fund that insures consumers ' deposits , which have been hard hit by a string of bank failures .

Going to see the new Star Trek movie in a theater next weekend ?
Well , then we certainly hope you did n’t need your retinas for anything else ever again .
Those who ’ve seen it have complained of J.J. Abrams ’s egregious overuse of lens flare in the film .
Now , a reporter from io9 — presumably while sopping blood from his lens - flare - ravaged eye sockets — has asked the director himself to comment , and even Abrams says he may have gone a little overboard .
Says Abrams :
“ I know what you ’re saying with the lens flares .
It was one of those things … I know there are certain shots where even I watch and think , ‘ Oh that ’s ridiculous , that was too many ’ …
There is something incredibly unpredictable and gorgeous about them .
It is a really fun thing .
Our DP would be off camera with this incredibly powerful flashlight aiming it at the lens .
It became an art because different lenses required angles , and different proximity to the lens .
Sometimes , when we were outside we ’d use mirrors .
Certain sizes were too big … literally , it was ridiculous .
It was like another actor in the scene …
So it was this ridiculous , added level of pain in the ass , but I love … [ looking at ] the final cut , [ the flares ] to me , were a fun additional touch that I think , while overdone , in some places , it feels like the future is that bright .
Think you ’ll be safe watching Star Trek next weekend ?

The last few weeks have seen a number of posts about the health of open source office productivity software Open Office .
Michael Meeks , open office developer , started this controversy with his recent blog post on whether Open Office is a ‚ Äúdying horse .
‚Äù
OO .o peaked at around 70 active developers in late 2004 and is trending downwards , the Linux kernel is nearer 300 active developers
and trending upwards .
Time range – this is drastically reduced for the Linux kernel – down to the sheer volume of changes : eighteen months of Linux ‚
Äô changes bust calc ‚Äôs row limit , where OO.o hit only 15 k rows thus far .
Diversity : the linux graph omits an in - chart legend , this is a result of the 300 + organisations that actively contribute to Linux ; interestingly , a good third of contribution to Linux comes from external ( or un-affiliated ) developers , but the rest comes from corporates .
What is stopping corporations investing similarly in OO.o ?
Last week Sun formally responded with a post that details their own statistics that not surprisingly paint a different picture , even though they concede that issues being fixed are going down .
Let ‚Äôs start with the basics .
Does Open
Office matter to those of us who want to see and use free software exclusively ?
Michael says :
Everyone that wants
Free software to succeed on the desktop , needs to care about the true success of OpenOffice.org : it is a key piece here .
Leaving the project to a single vendor to resource & carry will never bring us the gorgeous office suite that we need .
He ‚Äôs right .
While I agree with him that OpenOffice is important , I worry even more about the alternatives if it were allowed to fail .
Google ‚Äôs office suite works increasingly well and supports open standards ; thus it ‚Äôs highly preferable to Microsoft .
Yet , are we coming down to a two horse race in the office productivity space , to a world dominated by Microsoft and Google ?
Since neither are open source solutions , I worry that we would be beholden to the same proprietary forces that have shaped the desktop market .
We shouldn ‚Äôt rely on Sun to save us here .
In fact it may be counter - productive to do so .
It ‚Äôs shown again and again that too much central control of an open source project by one entity impedes its growth , especially in the ranks of the development community .
But make no mistake : commercial support for open source is incredibly important .
As the paper we published last year on kernel development shows , a wide range of companies support the majority of Linux development ( IBM , Novell , Red Hat , etc ) .
Do those companies support Linux for charity ?
Absolutely not .
There are market incentives for them to pay developers to enhance the platform .
Instead of beating up on Sun , we should all thank them for their support for Open Office .
At the same time , we should urge them to make the structural , licensing and organizational changes needed for the widest number of individuals and companies to benefit from contributing to Open Office .
That means giving up control .
Some make the argument that Linus , Andrew and company assert a large amount of control on Linux development .
What ‚Äôs the difference ?
First of all , Linux development has clear rules of engagement that are well understand and tested .
( See Jon Corbet ‚Äôs How To Contribute to the Linux Development Community book . )
These rules are based on merit .
While some would argue that personal politics play a role , it ‚Äôs clear that a wide range of code gets merged into the kernel every release , and that a healthy discourse and analysis of the merits of that code are the contributing factors to its inclusion .
Linus is an engineer whose primary motivation was building good software .
He is a practical person and his organization reflects that , as well as his motivation .
Another important difference is that the Linux community is made up of individuals , not companies .
( Meaning : in the kernel community you gain standing through your own code contributions , not who pays your paycheck . )
Decisions are made by individuals , not by companies .
Why is this important ?
It ‚Äôs difficult to trust companies since you don ‚Äôt know who will be making the decisions in the future .
Companies are a vessel for shareholder value , and their motivations spring from protecting and growing that value .
This is why open source developers mistrust projects controlled by commercial entities .
Unless licensing and an organizational charter is strong enough to ensure its survival and operation outside of shareholder concerns , most developers won‚Äôt invest their personal capital in the project unless they are being paid to do so .
To be fair to Sun , perhaps building a large and thriving ecosystem and development community is harder to do with office productivity software than with infrastructure .
Many have said that the open source development model is best suited for infrastructure : software that runs closer to the machine like an OS or web server , software that is more abstract , modular and not as reliant on features and feedback from users .
As Thorsten Ziehm , developer from Sun says ,
But we need a lot of more people in all projects on OOo to increase the success of OOo in future .
Some people talk about code contribution only .
I talk about we need more people in all areas and projects ‚ Äì User Experience , QA , L10N , Development or any other project on OOo ‚ Äì to get dreams fulfilled .
He ‚Äôs right .
Open Office needs more involvement from those who care about its existence .
I think Open Office is far from a dying horse .
Their last release had 28 million downloads .
That is success by any measure .
Point by point comparisons with its community and Linux ‚Äôs are far from an ideal way to gauge Open Office ‚Äôs health , yet there are warning signs .
I am by no means an expert on their community ‚Äôs organization , yet it seems clear that the project may benefit from a lessening of control and organization and licensing changes that encourage and reward other parties to participate .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama kicks off a campaign on Wednesday to rein in corporate compensation with rules limiting executive pay to $ 500,000 a year for companies getting taxpayer bailout funds in the future .

Obama , who sharply criticized Wall Street chiefs for accepting billions of dollars in bonuses last year while the economy staggered toward collapse , had promised compensation reform as part of a package of stricter regulations on the financial industry .
The restrictions are a first step in a broad effort to overhaul pay practices and are likely to be popular with average Americans , potentially diverting attention from Tuesday ’s shock withdrawal of former Senator Tom Daschle ’s nomination to lead Obama ’s bid to expand healthcare insurance .
Obama and senior congressional Democrats are also seeking to push through an economic stimulus package of almost $ 900 billion despite Republican criticism that it focuses too much on government spending and not enough on tax cuts .
An Obama administration official said the new rules would require companies that get exceptional government funds in future to abide by the cap .
Additional compensation must be limited to restricted stock that does not vest until government money is paid back with interest , according to the new rules .
Companies that have previously received bailout money -- such as financial giant Citigroup and insurer AIG -- would have to agree to stricter oversight and prove they have followed already established limits on executive compensation , which are widely seen as being too lax .
The White House aims to hold banking executives accountable for the government money they receive , presenting the new rules as being in the interest of shareholders and taxpayers alike .
“ It ’s not a government takeover , ” Obama said when describing the restrictions in an interview with CNN on Tuesday .
“ Private enterprise will still be taking place , but people will be accountable and responsible and that ’s what we have to restore in the financial system in general . ”
Obama ’s move comes amid public outcry over $ 18.4 billion in bonuses paid out in 2008 at a time when taxpayer money was shoring up the financial system .
Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner were scheduled to discuss details during an announcement at the White House at 11:00 a.m. EST .
LONG - TERM RESTRICTIONS
ON BANKS
The rules will require banks to give shareholders greater say over the money paid to company chiefs , according to information provided by the administration official .
They will also put restrictions on golden parachutes -- the lavish severance packages common for senior executives -- and require more transparency for costs such as aviation services , big parties , office renovations and conferences .
Healthier financial institutions that receive more generally available government funds will also be subject to the requirements unless shareholders vote to waive them .
Obama , who views excessive compensation as symptomatic of the missteps that led to the financial and economic crises , will also set in motion a long - term process to rein in high salaries on Wall Street .
This includes steps to require all public financial institutions -- whether they receive government funds or not -- to disclose compensation arrangements and prove that they are compatible with sound risk management .
Measures to make corporate executives adopt a long - term approach to their business , such as requiring them to hold stock for several years before it can be cashed in , would also be considered .
To consolidate opinion , Treasury Secretary Geithner will hold a conference with shareholder advocates , investors , executives and other interested parties to discuss executive pay reform at banks and help set guidelines for the future , the official said .
Geithner said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that U.S. fiscal policy was about to turn “ very aggressive ” to battle the recession .
A charter - boat crew member choked to death Friday after swallowing a bait fish as a joke in front of elementary - school children during a field trip in the Port of Long Beach , authorities said today .
Jeff Twaddle , 54 , of Huntington Beach , “ was trying to be lighthearted when he put this thing in his mouth ” on Friday , said Long Beach Fire Chief Frank Hayes .
“ But it became an airway obstruction , and he lost consciousness and went into full cardiac arrest . ”
Other crew members on board the Gail Force , which had been chartered by the Los Angeles Unified School District to take 20 students on a fishing trip along the breakwater , tried to dislodge the fish and administer CPR but were unsuccessful , authorities said .
( An earlier version of this post incorrectly referred to the boat as Gale Force . )
Twaddle was transported to St. Mary Medical Center , where he was pronounced dead at 1:15 p.m. Friday , according to Los Angeles County Coroner Lt. Fred Corral .
An autopsy determined that “ this was an accident , ” Corral said .
“ The cause of death was listed as aspiration of fish . ”
School district officials sent letters home to parents about the incident and offered crisis counseling to the students who were on board the vessel , authorities said .

In the latest episode of the Blizzard podcast , Diablo III senior artist Mike Nicholson discusses organizing the inventory system by size and giving skill buttons a World of Warcraft makeover .

The Diablo series has always had inventory issues .
I 'd say 90 % of " Town Portal " scrolls are used to head back to town and offload your inventory with a merchant .
Diablo III was initially going to feature an inventory where all items were icons of the same size , but now they 've split them off , with a bag for small items , a bag for large items , and a bag for quest items .
It really is n't as confusing as it sounds .
Current design right now is to have bags .
You 'll get bags and they will expand , you know kind of like in WoW , except you 're not going to open up separate windows .
You 'll start off your inventory with say … you know , eight slots , right , and then you 'll get a new bag and that has ten , so two more slots will open up within that tab , but you 'll never have multiple tabs .
Like you wo n't have two or three " large " tabs .
Advertisement
Nicholson takes a great deal of inspiration from Blizzard 's massively multiplayer online game , citing it as the reason behind Diablo III 's more colorful skill system as well .
I am unabashedly a fan of WoW , I 'll probably catch flak " oh you 're making it look like WoW oh no ! " but I love them , I love the WoW icons .
And y'know what we 're trying to do is see , ok what works about the WoW icons ?
They 're illustrative ; is there a way to try to maybe bridge the gap .
You know what worked about the more symbolic DII icons , and what works with the WoW icons , and trying to find a way to put the two together .
And that 's really what I 'm trying to do is to try to make them more symbolic , so they 're not necessarily little murals , but they are painterly .
So they are colorful because you 're going to have a lot more of them than you would in DII .
So while it will definitely piss off those Diablo fans that have memorized power symbols using stacks of flash cards , the colored skills were necessary to keep track of all the new and different skills being packed into Diablo III .

TORONTO ( Reuters ) -
The government of the Canadian province of Ontario is set to announce a plan worth more than C$ 200 million ( $ 157.5 million ) later on Wednesday to drive investment into emerging technology companies amid a credit market crunch that has made it tough to raise venture capital .
A government spokeswoman said the initiative will target companies in the clean technology , life sciences , and digital media and communications technology sectors .
An official announcement is expected Wednesday afternoon .
News of the plan comes about a month after a report that found that financing activity in Canada ’s venture capital market dropped to its lowest level in 12 years in 2008 as the economic downturn choked the flow of funds to small start - up companies .
Venture capital financing is the lifeblood of many early - stage companies .
Without investors willing to shoulder the relatively high risk associated with start - ups , such companies can flounder long before delivering a product to market .
Last year , a total of C$ 1.3 billion in venture capital was invested , down from C$ 2.1 billion in 2007 , according to the report by Canada ’s Venture Capital and Private Equity Association and news and data company Thomson Reuters .
Aside from the drop in value of financings , the number of companies that received capital was also lower , falling to 371 from 412 in 2007 .
