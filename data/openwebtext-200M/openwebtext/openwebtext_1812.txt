GNU Bash is one of the most common shells in the Linux world , it 's also the default shell on Debian systems .
People who use it frequently and browse the manual usually learn something new , here I 'm going to share two tips I can not live without .
What are yours ?
autocompletion is literally what it 's name might suggest , you start to type something and it 's completed for you .
This is usually enabled for simple things such as file and directory names , and by default it will be activated by the " TAB " key .
For example if you wish to look at the system 's password file you might wish to run :
less /etc / passwd
To save keystrokes you can actually type :
lesTAB /eTAB / passTAB
As you proceed to type the words pressing TAB will automatically complete things for you .
In the Debian bash package there is a file installed called /etc / bash_completion , this adds a lot more useful behaviours to bash including :
Auto completion of hostnames , for SSH
Auto completion of Debian specific utilities
To cause your shell to use it run the following command , then login again :
echo '. /etc/bash_completion ' >> ~/.bashrc
This will now give you a lot more completions , most usefully I find the following :
apt - get upg TAB
This becomes the familiar " apt - get upgrade " , other apt - get , and dpkg commands suddenly understand completion too , so instead of typing " dpkg -- search " you can cut this down to " dpkg -- seaTAB " .
To be honest I do n't know the full extent of the completion offered as some of the code in the /etc / bash_completion file is pretty hard to follow , but I know it saves me time .
Why not have a look yourself ?

True Love Waits .
Wait Training .
Worth Waiting For .
The slogans of teen abstinence programs reveal a basic fact of human nature : teens , sex , and waiting are n’t a natural combination .
Over the last fifty years the wait has gotten longer .
In 1950 , the average first - time bride was just over 20 ; in 1998 she was five years older , and her husband was pushing 27 .
If that June groom had launched into puberty at 12 , he ’d been waiting more than half his life .
If he had been waiting , that is .
Sex is the sugar coating on the drive to reproduce , and that drive is nearly overwhelming .
It ’s supposed to be ; it ’s the survival engine of the human race .
Fighting it means fighting a basic bodily instinct , akin to fighting thirst .
Yet despite the conflict between liberals and conservatives on nearly every topic available , this is one point on which they firmly agree : young people absolutely must not have children .
Though they disagree on means — conservatives advocate abstinence , liberals favor contraception — they shake hands on that common goal .
The younger generation must not produce a younger generation .
But teen pregnancy , in itself , is not such a bad thing .
By the age of 18 , a young woman ’s body is well prepared for childbearing .
Young men are equally qualified to do their part .
Both may have better success at the enterprise than they would in later years , as some health risks — Cesarean section and Down syndrome , for example — increase with passing years .
( The dangers we associate with teen pregnancy , on the other hand , are behavioral , not biological : drug use , STD ’s , prior abortion , extreme youth , and lack of prenatal care . )
A woman ’s fertility has already begun to decline at 25 — one reason the population - control crowd promotes delayed childbearing .
Early childbearing also rewards a woman ’s health with added protection against breast cancer .
Younger moms and dads are likely be more nimble at child - rearing as well , less apt to be exhausted by toddlers ’ perpetual motion , less creaky - in - the - joints when it ’s time to swing from the monkey bars .
I suspect that younger parents will also be more patient with boys - will - be - boys rambunction , and less likely than weary 40 - somethings to beg pediatricians for drugs to control supposed pathology .
Humans are designed to reproduce in their teens , and they ’re potentially very good at it .
That ’s why they want to so much .
Teen pregnancy is not the problem Unwed teen pregnancy is the problem .
It ’s childbearing outside marriage that causes all the trouble .
Restore an environment that supports younger marriage , and you wo n’t have to fight biology for a decade or more .
Most of us blanch at the thought of our children marrying under the age of 25 , much less under 20 .
The immediate reaction is : “ They ’re too immature . ”
We expect teenagers to be self - centered and impulsive , incapable of shouldering the responsibilities of adulthood .
But it was n’t always that way ; through much of history , teen marriage and childbearing was the norm .
Most of us would find our family trees dotted with many teen marriages .
Of course , those were the days when grown teens were presumed to be truly “ young adults . ”
It ’s hard for us to imagine such a thing today .
It ’s not that young people are inherently incapable of responsibility - history disproves that - but that we no longer expect it .
Only a few decades ago a high school diploma was taken as proof of adulthood , or at least as a promise that the skinny kid holding it was ready to start acting like one .
Many a boy went from graduation to a world of daily labor that he would not leave until he was gray ; many a girl began turning a corner of a small apartment into a nursery .
Expectations may have been humble , but they were achievable , and many good families were formed this way .
Hidden in that scenario is an unstated presumption , that a young adult can earn enough to support a family .
Over the course of history , the age of marriage has generally been bounded by puberty on the one hand , and the ability to support a family on the other .
In good times , folks marry young ; when prospects are poor , couples struggle and save toward their wedding day .
A culture where men do n’t marry until 27 would normally feature elements like repeated crop failures or economic depression .
That ’s not the case in America today .
Instead we have an artificial situation which causes marriage to be delayed .
The age that a man , or woman , can earn a reasonable income has been steadily increasing as education has been dumbed down .
The condition of basic employability that used to be demonstrated by a high school diploma now requires a Bachelor ’s degree , and professional careers that used to be accessible with a Bachelor ’s now require a Master ’s degree or more .
Years keep passing while kids keep trying to attain the credentials that adult earning requires .
Financial ability is n’t our only concern , however ; we ’re convinced that young people are simply incapable of adult responsibility .
We expect that they will have poor control of their impulses , be self - centered and emotional , and be incapable of visualizing consequences .
( It ’s odd that kids thought to be too irresponsible for marriage are expected instead to practice heroic abstinence or diligent contraception . )
The assumption of teen irresponsibility has broader roots that just our estimation of the nature of adolescence ; it involves our very idea of the purpose of childhood .
Until a century or so ago , it was presumed that children were in training to be adults .
From early years children helped keep the house or tend the family business or farm , assuming more responsibility each day .
By their latter teens , children were ready to graduate to full adulthood , a status they received as an honor .
How early this transition might begin is indicated by the number of traditional religious and social coming - of - age ceremonies that are administered at ages as young as 12 or 13 .
But we no longer think of children as adults - in - progress .
Childhood is no longer a training ground but a playground , and because we love our children and feel nostalgia for our own childhoods , we want them to be able to linger there as long as possible .
We cultivate the idea of idyllic , carefree childhood , and as the years for education have stretched so have the bounds of that playground , so that we expect even “ kids ” in their mid-to - late twenties to avoid settling down .
Again , it ’s not that people that age could n’t be responsible ; their ancestors were .
It ’s that anyone , offered a chance to kick back and play , will generally seize the opportunity .
If our culture assumed that 50 - year - olds would take a year - long break from responsibility , have all their expenses paid by someone else , spend their time having fun and making forgivable mistakes , our malls would be overrun by middle - aged delinquents .
But do n’t young marriages tend to end in divorce ?
If we communicate to young people that we think they ’re inherently incompetent that will become a self - fulfilling prophecy , but it was not always the case .
In fact , in the days when people married younger , divorce was much rarer .
During the last half of the 20th century , as brides ’ age rose from 20 to 25 , the divorce rate doubled .
The trend toward older , and presumptively more mature , couples did n’t result in stronger marriages .
Marital durability has more to do with the expectations and support of surrounding society than with the partners ’ age .
A pattern of late marriage may actually increase the rate of divorce .
During that initial decade of physical adulthood , young people may not be getting married , but they ’re still falling in love .
They fall in love , and break up , and undergo terrible pain , but find that with time they get over it .
They may do this many times .
Gradually , they get used to it ; they learn that they can give their hearts away , and take them back again ; they learn to shield their hearts from access in the first place .
They learn to approach a relationship with the goal of getting what they want , and keep their bags packed by the door .
By the time they marry they may have had many opportunities to learn how to walk away from a promise .
They ’ve been training for divorce .
As we know too well , a social pattern of delayed marriage does n’t mean delayed sex .
In 1950 , there were 14 births per thousand unmarried women ; in 1998 , the rate had leapt to 44 .
Even that astounding increase does n’t tell the whole story .
In 1950 the numbers of births generally corresponded to the numbers of pregnancies , but by 1998 we must add in many more unwed pregnancies that did n’t come to birth , but ended in abortion , as roughly one in four pregnancies do .
My home city of Baltimore wins the blue ribbon for out - of - wedlock childbearing : in 2001 , 77 % of all births were to unwed mothers .
There are a number of interlocking reasons for this rise in unwed childbearing , but one factor must surely be that when the requirements presumed necessary for marriage rise too high , some people simply parachute out .
It ’s one thing to ask fidgety kids to abstain until they finish high school at 18 .
When the expectation instead is to wait until 25 or 27 , many will decline to wait at all .
We ’re saddened , but no longer surprised , at girls having babies at the age of 12 or 13 .
Between 1940 and 1998 , the rate at which girls 10 - 14 had their first babies almost doubled .
These young moms ’ sexual experiences are usually classified as “ non-voluntary ” or “ not wanted . ”
Asking boys to wait until marriage is one way a healthy culture protects young girls .
The idea of returning to an era of young marriage still seems daunting , for good reason .
It is not just a matter of tying the knot between dreamy - eyed 18 - year - olds and tossing them out into world .
Our ancestors were able to marry young because they were surrounded by a network of support enabling that step .
Young people are not intrinsically incompetent , but they do still have lots of learning to do , just like newly - weds of any age .
In generations past a young couple would be surrounded by family and friends who could guide and support them , not just in navigating the shoals of new marriage , but also in the practical skills of making a family work , keeping a budget , repairing a leaky roof , changing a leaky diaper .
It is not good for man to be alone ; it ’s not good for a young couple to be isolated , either .
In this era of extended education , couples who marry young will likely do so before finishing college , and that will require some sacrifices .
They ca n’t expect to “ have it all . ”
Of the three factors — living on their own , having babies , and both partners going to school full - time — something is going to have to give .
But young marriage can succeed , as it always has , with the support of family and friends .
I got married a week after college graduation , and both my husband and I immediately went to graduate school .
We made ends meet by working as janitors in the evenings , mopping floors and cleaning toilets .
We were far from home , but our church was our home , and through the kindness of more - experienced families we had many kinds of support — in fact , all that we needed .
When our first child was born we were so flooded with diapers , clothes , and gifts that our only expense was the hospital bill .
Our daughter and older son also married and started families young .
Things do n’t come easy for those who buck the norm , but with the help of family , church , and creative college - to - work programs , both young families are making their way .
Early marriage can’t happen in a vacuum ; it requires support from many directions , and it would be foolish to pretend the costs are n’t high .
The rewards are high as well .
It is wonderful to see our son and daughter blooming in strong , joyful marriages , and an unexpected joy to count a new daughter and son in our family circle .
Our cup overflows with grandchildren as well : as of July we have four grandbabies , though the oldest is barely two .
I ’m 49 .
It ’s interesting to think about the future .
What if the oldest grandbaby also marries young , and has his first child at the age of 20 ?
I would hold my great - grandchild at 67 .
There could even follow a great - great - grand at 87 .
I will go into old age far from lonely .
My children and their children would be grown up then too , and available to surround the younger generations with many resourceful minds and loving hearts .
Even more outrageous things are possible : I come from a long - lived family , some of whom went on past the age of 100 .
How large a family might I live to see ?
Such speculation becomes dizzying — yet these daydreams are not impossible , and surely not unprecedented .
Closely - looped , mutually supporting generations must have been a common sight , in older days when young marriage was affirmed , and young people were allowed to do what comes naturally .

There are concerns that such funds are wiping out the benefits which international debt relief was supposed to bring to poor countries .
Martin Kalunga - Banda , a Zambian consultant to Oxfam told Newsnight , " That $ 40 m is equal to the value of all the debt relief we received last year . "
Vulture funds - as defined by the International Monetary Fund and Gordon Brown amongst others - are companies which buy up the debt of poor nations cheaply when it is about to be written off and then sue for the full value of the debt plus interest - which might be ten times what they paid for it .
Mockery
Caroline Pearce from the Jubilee Debt campaign told Newsnight it makes a mockery of all the work done by governments to write off the debts of the poorest .
" Profiteering does n't get any more cynical than this .
Zambia has been planning to spend the money released from debt cancellation on much - needed nurses , teachers and infrastructure : this is what debt cancellation is intended for not to line the pockets of businessmen based in rich countries . "
Martin Kalunga - Banda says $ 40 m is equivalent to Zambia 's annual debt relief
Suing
In 1979 the Romanian government lent Zambia money to buy Romanian tractors .
Zambia was unable to keep up the payments and in 1999 Romania and Zambia negotiated to liquidate the debt for $ 3 m .
Before the deal could be finalised one of Debt Advisory International 's vulture funds stepped in and bought the debt from Romania for less than $ 4 m .
They are now suing the Zambian government for the original debt plus interest which they calculate at over $ 40 m and they expect to win .
Like the other vulture funds Debt Advisory International refuse to do interviews but reporter Greg Palast caught up with the company founder Michael Sheehan outside his home in Virginia .
Greg Palast ( right ) tracked down Michael Sheehan
Michael Sheehan : " No comment I 'm in litigation .
It 's not my debt . "
Greg Palast :
Are n't you just profiteering from the work of good people who are trying to save lives by cutting the debt of these poor nations ?
Michael Sheehan :
Well there was a proposal for investment .
That 's all I can talk about right now .
Five years ago Gordon Brown told the United Nations that the vulture funds were perverse and immoral : " We particularly condemn the perversity where Vulture Funds purchase debt at a reduced price and make a profit from suing the debtor country to recover the full amount owed - a morally outrageous outcome " .
But the vulture funds are still operating .
' We do n't do interviews '
The London case is just one of many which are running around the world .
Newsnight went to New York to try to interview Paul Singer - the reclusive billionaire who virtually invented vulture funds .
In 1996 his company they paid $ 11 m for some discounted Peruvian debt and then threatened to bankrupt the country unless they paid $ 58 m .
They got their $ 58 m .
Now they 're suing Congo Brazzaville for $ 400 m for a debt they bought for $ 10 m .
We did n't get our interview .
His spokesman told us , " We have nothing to hide ; we just do n't do interviews " .

Jubilee Debt Campaign told Newsnight that they are calling on Gordon Brown to turn his moral outrage about vulture funds into action

Debt Advisory International are very generous to their lobbyists in Washington .
They have been paying $ 240,000 a year to the lobby firm Greenberg Traurig - although recently they jumped ship to another firm after Greenberg Traurig 's top lobbyist was put in jail .
Paul Singer has more direct political connections .
He was the biggest donor to George Bush and the Republican cause in New York City - giving $ 1.7 m since Bush started his first presidential campaign .
Rudi Guiliani is the favourite to be the next Republican presidential candidate and a leaked memo from his campaign shows that Paul Singer has pledged to raise $ 15 m for Guiliani 's campaign .
Tactics
The vulture funds have teams of lawyers combing the world for assets which can be seized to settle their claims .
There have also been claims of dubious tactics .
Back in Britain the Zambian case has seen much legal discussion about allegations of bribery .
The Zambian legal team - led by William Blair QC - Tony Blair 's brother , has argued that a $ 2 m bribe was offered to the former Zambian President to make it easier for the vulture funds to claim their money .
They showed the court an email disclosed in the Zambia case saying that a payment to the " President 's favourite charity " had allowed them to do a more favourable deal .
When we caught up with Michael Sheehan outside his house in Virginia he told us it was not a bribe but a charitable donation .
He told us , " We offered to donate debt to a low income housing initiative which was a charitable initiative which did end up building several thousand houses " before adding " you 're contorting the facts , you 're on my property and I would ask you to step off " .
The Jubilee Debt Campaign told Newsnight that they are calling on Gordon Brown to turn his moral outrage about vulture funds into action if he becomes Prime Minister and change the law to make the Zambian case the last to appear in a British court .
Meirion Jones produced Greg Palast 's Newsnight report on vulture funds .
Newsnight would like to make it clear that Debt Advisory International are not linked to companies with similar initials , such as DAI and DAI Europe Ltd .
The patient at the hospital in the southern Urals who reported the case heard the children 's muffled cries .
She used her mobile phone to film a baby lying in a cot with his mouth taped , while others had dummies taped to their mouths .
They are all orphans .
The case , covered widely by Russian media , has caused deep shock .
Russians are used to scandals in the hospital , but this case has touched a raw nerve , says the BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow .
Criminal probe
The patient who reported the incident , Elena Kuritsyna , had been in the hospital with her own children .
Elena Kuritsyna spotted the babies during a visit to the hospital
She said she heard the suppressed crying of young children in the next ward .
" I heard that a baby was mumbling in a neighbouring room ; when I looked in , I saw the baby with plaster over his mouth ; he could not cry or do anything , was just mumbling , " she told Reuters television .
She approached the nurse in the ward and was initially told to mind her own business .
Children were crying too loudly , and distracting nurses from their work , she was told .
She eventually persuaded the nurse to remove the plaster , but she says that afterwards the nurse did it again .
The nurse has been suspended and on Wednesday the head doctor at the hospital was reprimanded .
Prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation , and say they have discovered that sticking plaster was used more than once .
" Children in the first year of life were systematically gagged with sticking plaster to make children behave quietly , " the prosecutors ' press service said .
It is alleged the babies were silenced because there were too few staff to deal with them .
Ruby 1.8.5 Released
By Peter Cooper
It 's not mentioned on the official Ruby homepage yet , but Matz has just announced the release of Ruby 1.8.5 on the Ruby mailing list .
He claims there are no big changes from 1.8.4 and cites stability as the main benefit of upgrading .
Unless you 're having problems with 1.8.4 , however , I 'd wait a few weeks to see how it pans out , but if you 're itching to try it out get it from http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.5.tar.gz
" After three years of being laughed out of meetings , the U.S. Marine Corps ' futuristic plans to deploy through space may finally be getting some traction , " notes Aviation Week 's spunky new spin - off , Defense Technology International .
Although the chuckle factor has n't altogether disappeared , the Air Force Research Laboratory and Darpa are beginning a study of options for a reusable upper - stage space travel vehicle -- the same kind of technology that the Marines might need for a ride halfway across the globe .
The effort is called " Hot Eagle , " and it could be the first step forward in the Marine Corps ' hopes for space travel .
Within minutes of bursting into the atmosphere beyond the speed of sound -- and dispatching that ominous sonic boom -- a small squad of Marines could be on the ground and ready to take care of business within 2 hours .
[ One presentation muses that the capsule might later be picked up by a Osprey or by a " balloon cable and C - 17 " transport plane .
Or , the Marines might " hike out , " and " leave [ the ] crew capsule behind . " -- ed. ]
The Marine Corps calls the concept the Small Unit Space Transport and Insertion Capability ( Sustain ) .
This plan , a growing group of Marine supporters say , is the natural evolution of the service 's proclivity for expeditionary warfare that began decades ago with amphibious landings ...
The concept is to deliver strategic equipment or a small squad of soldiers to any point on the globe -- even the most hard - to - reach location -- within hours of need .
Once on the ground , those soldiers can carry out strategically critical missions like reconnaissance or destroying a specific target .
At least , that 's their pitch .
PANGANDARAN , Indonesia , Wednesday , July 19 — Thousands of terrified residents in this coastal community huddled together in makeshift camps , parents clutching small children , on the crest of nearby hills Tuesday night , fearing a repeat of Monday ’s tsunami that has now killed more than 300 people and injured hundreds more .
Most villagers said they were taken by surprise when the six - foot wall of water pounded the shore , leveling seaside houses and hotels up to 500 meters inland .
Wood and debris blocked roads , while cars and small boats , carried inland by the waves , littered the many coconut groves dotting the shore .
A 7.7 magnitude undersea earthquake at about 3 p.m.
Monday set off the tsunami , but most residents said they barely felt the quake and only realized the danger after the ocean began to quickly recede — a sign of a coming tsunami .
“ The tremors were not strong , so I felt no need to worry , ” said Mumu , 42 , whose 15 tourist cottages were reduced to hollow frames .
“ But then I heard the screams of the people on the beach and when I looked over the fence the water was rushing toward me . ”
May thy dice chip and shatter
Introducing GameByEmail 's Dice - O-Matic .
Made from Legos , a USB camera , and a bit of software , it 's a home - grown , dice - rolling monster .
Do n't let it 's rickety looks deceive you ; this puppy can easily crank out the 50,000 rolls a day consumed by GamesByEmail .
In fact , at full speed it averages almost one roll a second , well over 80,000 a day !
Let 's take a close look at the hardware .
It has 5 major parts :
1 ) The Hopper
2 ) The Shoe
3 ) The Camera
4 ) The Throwing Wheels
5 ) The Catcher
The Hopper .
The hopper collects and stacks the dice vertically .
The cycle is fast enough that only three dice need to be in the system .
The dice I use are 15 mm , exactly fitting into a 2x2 brick space .
Sometimes the dice stuck though , so the hopper chute is 3x3 .
Dice in the hopper start out resting on the top surface of the shoe .
The Shoe , Part 1 .
The shoe moves back and forth at the bottom back of the hopper .
It is 2 wide , 1 & 1/3 tall with a bumpless top , just short of the height of a die .
When the cycle starts , the shoe is almost all the way into the hopper , with the dice stacked on top .
The bottom die poses through a window for the camera .
The Camera .
The cheap USB camera is mounted using a few holes I drilled in its housing to accept pegs .
It 's is mounted on an old time hinge and swivel to make orienting easy .
The camera has an external button on it's housing to take still shots .
Rather than try to rig up something to poke this button directly ( which would jostle the camera , blurring the picture , and probably reorient it ) , I sacrificed a long Lego wire jumper .
I cut the jumper in half , opened the camera housing , fed the wires of a half jumper through a small hole I drilled in the housing , and then soldered the wires to the camera 's push button leads .
I can now easily use a Mindstorm push button sensor to trigger the camera .
The sensor is depressed at the right time by a peg on the shoe connecting rod , and the camera sends a black and white picture to the computer .
The Shoe , Part 2 .
After the picture is taken , the shoe slides back , allowing the stack of dice to drop 1 level .
It then moves forward again , pushing the bottom die out from under the stack and toward the throwing wheels .
A ramp at the end lifts the die directly between the wheels .
The Throwing Wheels .
The throwing wheels are two 81.6x15s spaced 13 holes apart , exactly enough room to get a good grip on a die in between them .
They have their own motor and gear train as they do not need to synchronize with the rest of the cycle .
The wheels are geared together so they spin at the same rate , but in opposite directions .
They spin pretty fast , using a 40 to 24 increasing gear set .
When the die is pushed up the ramp , it gets pinched and thrown into the air , spinning , but more or less straight up .
Unblocked , they reach about 2 feet high .
However , the catcher is positioned to grab them before they peak .
The Catcher .
The catcher is a deflector plate attached to the hopper .
The upward bound die hits the angled plate which sends the die into the funnel of the hopper .
There are a few tumbling blocks in the hopper that help roll the die .
The die tumbles to the stack at the bottom , where it begins the journey again .
There must be at least three dice in the system to help gravity feed and position the die for the camera .
I run it with a few extra .
Next , the software .
It has 4 parts :
1 ) The Camera
2 ) The Preview Box
3 ) The Still Image Box
4 ) The Pip Counter
The Camera .
The USB camera is a TWAIN device .
I 'm programming in .NET which currently has no built - in TWAIN libraries .
I 'm too cheap to buy an aftermarket TWAIN library for .NET , and too lazy to figure out all the details of using twain_32.dll as an extern to capture the incoming still images directly .
So I let the TWAIN events get handled by the simple preview and still image applications that came with the camera , and simply do screenshots of the still image application box , and process that .
The Preview Box .
The first time you click the camera button , the preview box opens , looking like so .
I 've set the image filter to drop the color as I 'm only interested in black and white .
The Still Image Box .
When the preview box is open and the camera button is clicked again , the image is sent to the Still Image Box .
Every time the button is clicked , a new image is in the box .
The Pip Counter .
I wrote a .NET application to count the pips on the dice .
It does this by constantly monitoring the Still Image Box .
Every quarter second , it captures a partial screen shot of the Still Image Box .
It then compares this image to the previous image .
Even with consecutive rolls , the images are slightly different .
If the images are the same , no new picture was taken and nothing happens .
If the images are different , it scans for pips .
The image captured is not of the whole box , it is just the part where the dice should be .
The image is scanned in a simple left to right , top to bottom fashion , looking for a black pixel .
When a black pixel is found , the scanning process pauses , and it goes into Fill Pip mode .
This mode recursively checks a pixel and returns it 's " Fill Count " .
If it is white , the count returned is 0 .
If it is black , the pixel is made red , the count is set to 1 , and then it 's neighbors are checked , recursively adding their fill count to the total .
In the end , you have the number of pixels in a black group .
If the group was large enough , it is counted as a pip , else it is ignored .
Since the black pixels in the group were turned red , the same group will not be counted again when the scan resumes .
The scan is done stepping 5 pixels at a time .
This is both faster and allows the pip fill to traverse reflection streaks that might otherwise split a single pip into two .
The rolls are appended to a text file , with an automated nightly upload to the game server .
If so inclined ( and I had the bandwidth ) , the image of each actual roll could be stored and uploaded as well , and shown to the player .
Just make sure they cannot be viewed before they are consumed !
Presto !
Dedicate an old 266MHz machine to the task , and the rolls are as random as I can make them .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense and the Army that seeks more information on a military web censorship unit called the Army Web Risk Assessment Cell ( AWRAC ) after the DOD failed to answer the EFF 's Freedom of Information Act request in an expedited fashion .
AWRAC 's existence was revealed last October in an Army News Service piece that described the unit .
The AWRAC team monitors hundreds of thousands of web sites each month and contacts webmasters and bloggers about any security concerns .
The EFF wanted more information , and on November 2 , 2006 , they filed a FOIA request with the DOD .
In that request for documents and e-mails , the EFF also requested " expedited processing " and applied for the journalistic fee waiver .
Both requests were denied on November 13 .
The FOIA examiner at the DOD told the EFF that " the information you have requested would not be considered the subject of a breaking news story because it has already been the subject of multiple national news stories . "
Furthermore , because the EFF is not primarily a publisher , the group did not qualify for the news media waiver .
The fee waiver decision was overturned on appeal , but the expedited processing decision was not .
The EFF then chose to file suit in the DC Circuit Court , seeking to compel the DOD to turn over the information promptly .
The government has not yet filed a response .
The FOIA request and subsequent lawsuit are part of the EFF 's FLAG program that looks at government " technologies that invade privacy , " but the group is not seeking to have the AWRAC program shut down .
Marcia Hoffman , the EFF attorney who filed the complaint , says that she recognizes the need for some censorship of war information .
" Of course , a military effort requires some level of secrecy , " she says .
" But the public has a right to know if the Army is silencing soldiers ' opinions as well .
That 's why the Department of Defense must release information on how this program works without delay . "

No reason to feel optimistic
Conversely , those who are depressed , nervous or angry are more likely to complain about cold symptoms - whether or not they get bitten by the cold bug .
A team from Carnegie Mellon University , Pittsburgh , found people who had a positive emotional attitude were not infected as often and experienced fewer symptoms than people with a negative emotional style .
There are a lot of interactions going on in the body which we just do n't fully understand
Dr Nigel Higson
After their assessment , each volunteer got a squirt in the nose of a rhinovirus - the germ that causes colds .
The researchers kept the subjects under observation for five days to see whether or not they became infected and how they manifested symptoms .
Tests showed that positive people were no less likely to be infected with the virus .
However , infection seemed to produce fewer signs and symptoms of illness .
Lead researcher Dr Sheldon Cohen said : " We found that experiencing positive emotions was associated with greater resistance to developing a common cold .
" But a negative emotional style had no effect on whether or not people got sick . "
Immune system
Dr Cohen believes the findings suggest that a positive outlook may impact on how effective the immune system is at fighting disease .
He said that a more upbeat attitude may also help to reduce the risk of other infectious diseases .
Dr Cohen told BBC News Online : " The symptoms of a cold are caused by the release of chemicals such as cytokines , histamines and bradykinins .
" The release of these chemicals is to some extent under the control of hormones that are produced when we experience various emotions .
" We think that the levels of these hormones in happy people may partly protect them from developing symptoms of cold when infected by a cold virus . "
Dr Nigel Higson , a GP and chairman of the Primary Care Virology Group , said there was a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that stress had an impact on the immune system .
He said : " It seems that the immune system is affected by your wellbeing , and if you are free from stress it is able to fight disease more rapidly . "
Dr Higson said it was possible that chemicals in the brain may have a direct impact on the functioning of immune system chemicals .
However , he said : " There are a lot of interactions going on in the body which we just do n't fully understand . "
The research is published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine .
Scott Rosenberg : What Makes Software So Hard Print By Edward Cone
The history of software development is marked by missed deadlines , blown budgets and broken promises .
Author Scott Rosenberg discusses this dysfunctional culture , and why it persists .
This is my response to If
this suite ’s a success , why is it so buggy ?
by Andrew Brown of
The Guardian .
Andrew Brown claims that OpenOffice “ illustrates the limitations of
open source ” and establishes that my aphorism “ Many eyes make bugs shallow ” is
false , but his reasoning is shaky .
Mr Brown appears to be arguing that because open - source development is n’t
perfect , it is n’t any better than closed source .
But there is no
silver bullet for the problem of software complexity — all
programs , open or closed , will have bugs .
The figures he is waving
around ( 6 K bugs , 5 K feature requests ) are meaningless in isolation .
In fact , controlled comparisons between closed - and open - source
versions of functionally equivalent programs have been done .
Barton
Miller ’s well - known “ Fuzz Papers ” suggested that open source programs
to have a 39 % edge in reliability over closed - source equivalents .
So where are the comparative statistics for the bug load of Microsoft
Office ?
Do we know that it has fewer than 11,000 bugs and feature
requests outstanding ?
If Mr. Brown do n’t know that , or at least have
those figures for a closed - source program of comparable size to
OpenOffice , he has no basis for asserting that the open - source method
is failing .
His article does inadvertently illustrate an important point , however .
If you make legal paperwork a requirement before volunteers can
contribute to a project , very few will do so .
If OpenOffice is
failing its promise , it ’s not because “ many eyeballs ” does n’t work —
it ’s because bureaucratic obstacles are driving the eyeballs away .

IN THE EARLY 1980s you did n’t need to be a member of EarthFirst ! to know that Ronald Reagan was bad for the environment .
You did n’t even have to be especially politically aware .
Here was a man who had , after all , publicly stated that most air pollution was caused by plants .*
By contrast , while George W. Bush gets low marks on the environment from a majority of Americans , few fully appreciate the scope and fury of this administration ’s anti-environmental agenda .
“ What they ’re doing makes the Reagan administration look innocent , ” says Buck Parker , executive director of Earthjustice , a nonprofit environmental law firm .
The Bush administration has been gutting key sections of the Clean Water and Clean Air acts , laws that have traditionally had bipartisan support and have done more to protect the health of Americans than any other environmental legislation .
It has crippled the Superfund program , which is charged with cleaning up millions of pounds of toxic industrial wastes such as arsenic , lead , mercury , and vinyl chloride in more than 1,000 neighborhoods in 48 states .
It has sought to cut the EPA ’s enforcement division by nearly one - fifth , to its lowest level on record ; fines assessed for environmental violations dropped by nearly two - thirds in the administration ’s first two years ; and criminal prosecutions - the government ’s weapon of last resort against the worst polluters - are down by nearly one - third .
The administration has abdicated the decades - old federal responsibility to protect native animals and plants from extinction , becoming the first not to voluntarily add a single species to the endangered species list .
It has opened millions of acres of wilderness - including some of the nation ’s most environmentally sensitive public lands - to logging , mining , and oil and gas drilling .
Under one plan , loggers could take 10 percent of the trees in California ’s Giant Sequoia National Monument ; many of the Monument ’s old - growth sequoias , 200 years old and more , could be felled to make roof shingles .
Other national treasures that have been opened for development include the million - acre Grand Canyon - Parashant National Monument in Arizona , the 2,000 - foot red-rock spires at Fisher Towers , Utah , and dozens of others .
And then , of course , the White House has all but denied the existence of what may be the most serious environmental problem of our time , global warming .
After campaigning on a promise to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide , Bush made an abrupt about - face once elected , calling his earlier pledge “ a mistake ” and announcing that he would not regulate CO2 emissions from power plants - even though the United States accounts for a fourth of the world ’s total industrial CO2 emissions .
Since then , the White House has censored scientific reports that mentioned the subject , walked away from the Kyoto agreement to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions , and even , at the behest of ExxonMobil , engineered the ouster of the scientist who chaired the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
So why are n’t more people aware that George W. Bush is compiling what is arguably the worst environmental record of any president in recent history ?
The easy explanations - that environmental issues are complex , that war and terrorism push most other concerns off the front pages - are only part of the story .
The real reason may be far simpler :
Few people know the magnitude of the administration ’s attacks on the environment because the administration has been working very hard to keep it that way .
Like any successful commander in chief , Bush knows that putting the right person in the right place is the key to winning any war .
This is n’t just a matter of choosing business - friendly appointees for top positions .
That ’s pretty much standard operating procedure for Republican administrations .
What makes this administration different is the fact that it is filled with anti-regulatory zealots deep into its rank and file - and these bureaucrats , unlike James Watt , are politically savvy and come from the very industries they ’re charged with regulating .
The result is an administration uniquely effective at implementing its ambitious pro-industry agenda - with a minimum of public notice .
Take the case of mountaintop - removal coal mining .
As the name implies , this method - the predominant form of strip mining in much of Appalachia - involves blasting away entire mountaintops to get at coal seams below and dumping the resulting rubble , called “ spoil , ” into adjacent valleys .
In some cases , valleys two miles long have been completely filled with spoil .
Opponents had hoped that a court - ordered Environmental Impact Statement ( EIS ) would crack down on the practice , which has buried at least 1,000 miles of Appalachian streams and destroyed tens of thousands of acres of woodland that the EPA describes as “ unique in the world ” for their biological diversity .
But when the Bush administration released the EIS this spring , it not only gave mountaintop removal a clean bill of health ; it also relaxed what few meaningful environmental protections existed and focused on how to help mining companies obtain permits more easily .
So how did a process mandated by a federal judge “ to minimize , to the maximum extent practicable , the adverse environmental effects ” from mountaintop removal become a vehicle for industry ?
Two words : Steven Griles .
Never heard of him ?
You ’re not supposed to .
Steven Griles is one of industry ’s moles within the Bush administration .
Before coming to work as deputy secretary of the Interior , Griles was one of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington , with a long list of energy - industry clients , including the National Mining Association and several of the country ’s largest coal companies .
On August 1 , 2001 , Griles signed a “ statement of disqualification , ” promising to stay clear of issues involving his former clients .
Despite that promise , according to his own appointment calendar ( obtained by environmental groups through the Freedom of Information Act ) , Griles met repeatedly with coal companies while the administration worked on the mountaintop - removal issue .
Griles has denied discussing the “ fill rule ” in any of those meetings .
But on August 4 , 2001 - three days after signing his recusal letter - he gave a speech before the West Virginia Coal Association , reassuring members that “ we will fix the federal rules very soon on water and spoil placement . ”
Two months later , Griles sent a letter to the EPA and other agencies drafting the EIS , complaining that they were not doing enough to safeguard the future of mountaintop removal and instructing them to “ focus on centralizing and streamlining coal mine permitting . ”
Griles is now the subject of an Interior Department investigation for possible ethics violations .
With key positions in the hands of industry veterans , the administration has been able to pursue one of its most effective stealth tactics — steering clear of legislative battles and working instead within the difficult - to - understand , yawn - producing realm of agency regulations .
It ’s a strategy that has served Bush well , especially in his push to give the energy industry - which donated $ 2.8 million to the 2000 Bush campaign - access to some of the nation ’s last wildlands .
In Congress , where the administration ’s agenda must endure full public scrutiny , Bush ’s effort to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has failed repeatedly .
But there was little public debate over a plan to drill 66,000 coalbed methane gas wells in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana - a massive project that will result in 26,000 miles of new roads , 48,000 miles of new pipelines , and discharges of 2 trillion gallons of contaminated water , disfiguring for years the rolling hills of that landscape .
That plan was hatched behind closed doors , by the secretive energy task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney .
The Cheney task force is behind another of the administration ’s pet projects - protecting utilities from having to comply with a law enacted 26 years ago .
Some 30,000 Americans die each year because the federal government is unwilling to take meaningful steps to enforce the Clean Air Act ’s standards for coal - fired power plants .
Nearly 6,000 of those deaths are attributable to plants owned by a mere eight companies , according to a study by ABT Associates , which frequently conducts assessments for the EPA .
( The companies are American Electric Power , Cinergy , Duke , Dynegy , FirstEnergy , SIGECO , Southern Company , and the Tennessee Valley Authority . )
When Congress passed the current air - pollution standards in 1977 , it grandfathered in these aging plants and some 16,000 other industrial facilities around the country .
Under a provision known as New Source Review , the plants could perform routine maintenance without having to install cleaner technologies , but any substantive changes or expansions leading to increased emissions would force the operators to meet the new standards .
The grace period was expected to last just a few years - a reasonable compromise , it must have seemed to Congress at the time .
Yet , for nearly three decades these facilities have gotten around the New Source Review rules by continually expanding and calling it “ routine maintenance . ”
In 1999 , the EPA ’s then - director of enforcement , Eric Schaeffer , tried something radically new :
He actually enforced the law .
The agency filed suit against eight power companies that together emitted one - fifth of the nation ’s total output of sulfur dioxide - a deadly compound that is also the leading cause of acid rain .
Soon , violators started lining up to negotiate settlements .
By the end of 2000 , two of the largest power companies had agreed to cut emissions by two - thirds .
And then George W. Bush took office .
The new administration immediately leaked its intentions to expand , rather than close , the New Source Review loophole ( see “ No Clear Skies “ ) .
By March 2002 , EPA administrator Christine Whitman was telling Congress that if she were an attorney for one of the companies sued by the agency , “ I would not settle anything . ”
Not surprisingly , the two tentative agreements the EPA had worked out evaporated .
Meanwhile , in a classic bit of greenwashing , the White House has released a plan called “ Clear Skies ” that will , in President Bush ’s words , “ dramatically reduce pollution from power plants . ”
In fact , Clear Skies would gut the standards of the Clean Air Act , allowing companies to wait 15 more years to install state - of - the - art pollution - control equipment - and even then , power plants would be emitting far more pollution than allowed under current law , for a total of 450,000 tons of additional nitrogen oxide , 1 million tons of sulfur dioxide , and 9.5 tons of mercury annually .
The administration also wants to sink millions into reviving the dying nuclear industry , increasing by 50 percent the number of nuclear plants currently operating in the United States .
That ’s no small feat , given that not a single new plant has been ordered for two and a half decades - not since the nation held its breath in 1979 , waiting to find out if a nuclear doomsday scenario was unfolding at Three Mile Island .
Industry officials insist that with today ’s improved technology such a calamity is unthinkable .
But that has n’t stopped the administration from endorsing a $ 9 billion cap on industry liability , just in case the unthinkable should occur .
Other gifts to nuclear - plant operators include more than $ 1 billion in new subsidies and tax breaks , support for relicensing dangerously outdated reactors , and at least $ 18 billion in taxpayer money for construction of a high - level nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain , Nevada .
JUST BEFORE SHE STEPPED DOWN last summer , EPA head Whitman issued a “ state of the environment ” report that fairly rhapsodized about the significance of environmental protection : “ Pristine waterways [ and ] safe drinking waters are treasured resources , ” one passage declared .
“ The nation has made significant progress in protecting these resources in the last 30 years . ”
What Whitman did not mention was that the administration has spent two years attempting to eviscerate the law that brought about most of that progress - the Clean Water Act of 1972 .
In January 2003 , the administration proposed new rules for managing the nation ’s wetlands , removing 20 percent of the country ’s remaining swamps , ponds , and marshes from federal protection .
And wetlands are only the beginning : A close reading of the proposed rules shows that the administration is attempting to change the definition of “ waters of the United States ” to exclude up to 60 percent of the country ’s rivers , lakes , and streams from protection , giving industries permission to pollute , alter , fill , and build on all of these waterways ( see “ Down Upon the Suwannee “ ) .
“ No president since the Clean Water Act was passed has proposed getting rid of it on the majority of waters of the U.S. , ” notes Joan Mulhern of Earthjustice - and Bush might not have tried either , had he been forced to justify the move in congressional debate rather than burying it in bureaucratic rule - making .
Even when it seems to bow to environmental concerns , the administration often manages to leave a back door open for industry .
This summer , after more than two years of foot - dragging and resistance in court , the Department of Agriculture finally accepted a Clinton - era rule placing more than 58 million acres of national forests off limits to road building ( and thus logging ) .
But it added two caveats : Governors could obtain exemptions for federal forests inside their borders ( as several have already done ) ; and the rule would n’t apply in much of Alaska , where the largest stretches of roadless wild forest are located .
In June , Undersecretary of Agriculture Mark Rey- a veteran timber lobbyist who is now the chief architect of the nation ’s forest policy - announced that nearly 3 million acres of land could be opened to timber sales in Alaska ’s Tongass National Forest , the planet ’s largest pristine temperate rainforest and home to several species of animals found nowhere else on earth .
The White House has also been darkly brilliant at using the courts to do its dirty work - through methods such as “ sweetheart suits , ” the practice of encouraging states and private groups to file lawsuits against the federal government , and then agreeing to negotiated settlements that bypass environmental laws without any interference from Congress or the public .
In perhaps the most egregious such case , in April the state of Utah and the Interior Department announced that they had reached a settlement involving 10 million acres of federal lands set aside in the 1990s for possible wilderness designation .
The deal will allow Utah to sell oil and gas rights on what had largely been pristine areas , including the Grand Staircase - Escalante National Monument with its multihued cliffs and Cedar Mesa , a fragile desert area near Monument Valley that holds world - renowned archaeological sites - and that is now slated to host a jeep safari .
Two days after the first settlement with Utah - in another closed - door deal - Interior Secretary Gale Norton signed a second , more sweeping compact promising that the federal government would never again so much as study lands for wilderness designation .
And not just in Utah :
The decision , which effectively freezes a wilderness - protection program that goes back nearly 40 years , applies to more than 200 million acres of Western lands , an area twice as large as California .
But it ’s not just the West ’s spectacular scenery that ’s threatened , or even the purity of our air and water - as important as those are .
By using stealth tactics to pursue a corporate agenda , the Bush administration is undermining the very landscape of democracy , which depends on an informed citizenry , transparency in government , and lively public debate .
A culture of deception and deceit erodes all of these - and that is probably the most serious “ environmental ” damage of all .
* Correction , April 4 , 2007 :
The original opening paragraph of this story erroneously continued , “ And then there was Reagan ’s secretary of the Interior , James Watt , who saw no need to protect the environment because Jesus was returning any day . ”
But Watt ’s statements about his religious beliefs were taken out of context .
On Feb .
5 , 1981 , Watt told a congressional oversight committee he believed his job was “ to be steward for the natural resources for this generation as well as future generations .
I do not know how many future generations we can count on before the Lord returns , whatever it is we have to manage with a skill to have the resources needed for future generations . ”
You 'll never beat poker robots
The time is 5 am .
A watery dawn light is bringing a new day into my study ; I 'm reaching the weary end of a bottle of brandy and a gruelling six - hour internet session on Paradisepoker.com .
And I 've just haemorrhaged a packet .
Game 's up ?
Most players are habitual losers called ' fish ' but would they still play if they knew they could n't win ?
It all started so well .
I broke even for the first few hours .
But since 2 am , I 've lost £ 670 .
They say you should never play poker with any more money than you can afford to take to the bottom of your garden and burn ; I can't afford to burn £ 670 .
So now I 'm playing like a wild man , trying to claw some funds back .
I no longer care about odds or stats ; I just want to play every pot , regardless of my cards , and I 'm paying out money like a broken fruit machine as a consequence .
It 's what is known in the trade as ' playing on tilt ' - emotion , not logic , is the driver .
I 'm every poker player 's dream opponent .
My sleepless , ruinous night should be music to the ears of the billion - pound online poker industry - after all , the more I play , the more they make in commission .
But , as I am about to discover , these poker giants are sleeping even worse than me .
Because the computers they rely on to coin them their fortunes are being turned against them .
And it could cost them their entire empires .
How poker robots work
To explain why , we must fast - forward 24 hours after my marathon poker disaster .
Because now I 've made a new friend to help me with my online poker , and he 's making me decent money - at five tables simultaneously .
So far we 're averaging £ 20 profit an hour - and my friend does n't take breaks .
He 'll go on playing forever , he 'll never flag or make a wrong call and he wo n't become depressed or euphoric .
This is because he is , of course , a computer .
It 's very simple , it 's legal and no one on the other side of the screen will ever know .
I 've run a cable from the PC showing the game - or , rather , games - into a laptop running some specialist poker software .
This displays an information - only Etch A Sketch - like rendering of the poker tables ; the cards , the betting , the players contending the pot .
The laptop is making millions of different computations based upon the strength of my hand and how the others are betting .
Then it places ' my ' bet .
I do n't have to lift a finger or even be in the room .
If you 're a poker player , this is merely unethical .
But if you 're an executive or shareholder in one of the top poker websites , the advent of programs that play for you is very bad news indeed .
Online poker is a £ 3 bn - a - year industry - £ 3 m is gambled on online poker every day in Britain alone ( we 're now the fifth biggest gambling country in the world ) .
But this depends on the punters knowing they 're getting a fair game .
When they 're up against expertly programmed computer players , then they are , quite emphatically , not .
And if these programs evolve as fast as the experts predict , online poker is nothing more than a busted flush .

You can't beat poker robots
One expert in this powerful new software , ' Chopper ' , tells me , ' It 's amazing to think of how much we gamble on online poker sites - mainly because there is no such thing as a fair game of online poker .
It just does n't exist .
The game is completely corrupt ; it has zero integrity .
Online players are secretly using every means at their disposal to fleece you - and at the forefront of their campaign is the use of poker robots .
When all this becomes public knowledge , the amateurs will leave and the game will die . '
Ten years ago , poker in general was nowhere .
Now it 's huge .
In August this year , poker tournaments were broadcast on nine separate UK TV channels .
Organisations such as the World Poker Tour have shaped the game into a small - screen adrenaline hit ; there 's even been a poker storyline on The Archers .
Online poker has ridden on the back of poker 's new appeal to become the internet success story .
It 's easy to join in - you sign on to a site such as 888.com or Party Poker , submit your credit card number and start to play on a ' table ' showing yourself and your opponents .
Only you can see your own cards , of course ; everyone can see the five shared cards that feature in the most popular poker variation , Texas Hold ' Em , and with which you make your strongest five - card hand .
All those who are still ' in ' at the end of the last betting round have their cards revealed , and the computer flags up the winner , adjusting everyone 's cash totals accordingly .
As well as winning on the night , if you 're good and lucky you can also win entry to high - rolling tournaments associated with the website ; all of which explains why American - owned Paradise Poker 's average daily profit in one month earlier this year was £ 169,000 .
Are you a poker fish ?
Of course , what the huge billboards dotting the country do n't tell you is that an astonishing 90 per cent of online players are habitual losers .
They 're known as ' fish ' .
These inexperienced players have very little grasp of odds or strategy and might as well bet on raindrops rolling down a window .
But the credit card deposits they make are the lifeblood of the new poker boom .
They trickle down to the huge TV pots that ultimately draw in shoals of new fish .
What is crucial for the boom to continue is that these fish think there 's no cheating .
In the beginning of online gaming , the big and obvious worry was collusion - groups of supposed strangers in fact conferring by phone .
It 's impossible to win against such a group , because when you get a strong hand , you do n't rake in as much as you should to cover the losses from all your weak hands , since your opponents will work out who among them has the strongest hand and the rest will fold .
But the websites stopped this - terrified that their cash cows would falter under this threat , they spent millions creating software to automatically monitor patterns of play and sniff out these collaborators .

The poker robot runner
Which is where the poker programs - or poker bots - came in .
From a tiny start , they 're creeping into games everywhere .
Of course , the whole point is that it is impossible to quantify exactly how widespread they are , but those in the know say you could quite easily expect all the other ' players ' at a typical table to be computers - in which case , if you are anything other than a very capable player you can surely only lose .
Take ' Dave ' ( ' bot - running ' is n't illegal , but like other bot - runners he wants to keep his identity concealed from the casinos ) .
He is a British computer programmer whose bots have played some 300,000 online rounds .
He was approached a year ago by a syndicate of pro poker players eager to build a bot to take advantage of the new money pouring into online poker .
He says , ' I 'm doing pretty well .
I have two computer systems , and each one can run four poker bots , and each of those four can play up to five tables at once .
At worst I make on average £ 2.90 an hour at each table .
That 's a minimum of £ 116 an hour if I can get all the bots running at once .
' Right now I 'm working on getting two bots at a table card - sharing , but cleverly so they can't be detected .
Ultimately we 'll get to a stage where if you want to win anything , you 're going to have to use some kind of poker bot just to keep you in the game . '
Ray Bornert II is the creator of the WinHold Em software that is the most popular of these intelligent poker bots .
Bornert began work on his card - beating program shortly after approaching casino companies as a security consultant .
' When I realised that profiling - that 's the software that tracks the performance of all online players - could be successfully eliminated , but that bots could not , my entire world changed almost overnight . '
Bornert harbours an almost evangelical belief that online poker is institutionally corrupt .
' The sites are helpless .
It 's obvious - casinos cannot control what a human player does with the game information once it graphically arrives on his or her screen .
A player typically has 30 to 60 seconds to make a decision when their turn arrives .
Think of what a computer can achieve in five seconds , let alone a minute .
And that 's the casinos ' problem .
People want to play against humans that have weaknesses , not robots .
They wo n't stand for it . '
Poker robots explained
What is a bot ?
A piece of automated software .
Bots conduct millions of transactions daily on the world 's stock exchanges .
What does a poker bot do ?
It plays online poker for you by scanning casino software on your first computer and playing your hands for you .
Having run through millions of scenarios involving your hand , it will decide whether the bet is worth calling or raising .
It does this based on the strength of the hand , your betting position , the size of the pot and the number of players contending it .
Does it work off the shelf ?
Yes , but it wo n't make you any money .
The program is a virtually blank slate that you fill with as many scenarios as you see fit .
You 'll need to spend about 2,500 hours programming it to turn even a small profit .
What hardware will I need ?
You 'll need two computers .
The bot has to be concealed on a second system away from casino software that reads your hard drive .
How much is the software ?
WinHoldEm Team Edition costs £ 115 .

Will it make me money ?
That depends .
Most people quit after a couple of weeks ; those who persevere make around £ 3 per table per hour - which soon adds up ...

COULD the end of sign language for deaf children be in sight ?
A spate of new studies has shown that profoundly deaf babies who receive cochlear implants in their first year of life develop language and speech skills remarkably close to those of hearing children .
Many of the children even learn to sing passably well and function almost flawlessly in the hearing world .
These findings may sound like a triumph to audiologists and the hearing parents of deaf babies .
But they have done little to convince those in the deaf community who maintain that it is unethical to give deaf …

This " Those who forget history may be doomed to repeat it , but who could imagine we 'd already be in danger of replaying that rotten year 2003 ? " writes New York Times columnist Frank Rich for Sunday editions .
Excerpts follow .
# Scooter Libby , the mastermind behind the White House 's bogus scenarios for ginning up the war in Iraq , is back at Washington 's center stage , proudly defending the indefensible in a perjury trial .
Ahmad Chalabi , the peddler of flawed prewar intelligence hyped by Libby , is back in clover in Baghdad , where he purports to lead the government 's Shiite - Baathist reconciliation efforts in between visits to his pal Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran .
Last but never least is Libby 's former boss and Chalabi 's former patron , Dick Cheney , who is back on Sunday - morning television floating fictions about Iraq and accusing administration critics of aiding al - Qaida .
When the vice president went on a tear like this in 2003 , hawking Iraq 's nonexistent WMD and nonexistent connections to Mohamed Atta , he set the stage for a war that now kills Iraqi civilians in rising numbers ( 34,000 - plus last year ) that are heading into the genocidal realms of Saddam .
Cheney 's latest sales pitch is for a new plan for " victory " promising an even bigger bloodbath .
Cheney was honest , at least , when he said that the White House 's Iraq policy would remain " full speed ahead ! " no matter what happened on Nov. 7 .
Now it is our patriotic duty -- politicians , the press and the public alike -- to apply the brakes .
Our failure to check the administration when it rushed into Iraq in 2003 will look even more shameful to history if we roll over again for a reboot in 2007 .
For all the belated Washington scrutiny of the war since the election , and for all the heralded ( if so far symbolic ) congressional efforts to challenge it , too much lip service is still being paid to the deceptive PR strategies used by the administration to sell its reckless policies .
This time we must do what too few did the first time : call the White House on its lies .
Lies should not be confused with euphemisms like " incompetence " and " denial . "
# TIMES SELECT SUBSCRIBERS CAN READ FULL COLUMN HERE
A University of Calgary professor in the Haskayne School of Business has recently published his magnum opus on the subject of procrastination - and it's only taken him 10 years .
Joking aside , Dr. Piers Steel is probably the world 's foremost expert on the subject of putting off until tomorrow what should be done today .
His comprehensive analysis of procrastination research , published in the recent edition of the American Psychological Association 's Psychological Bulletin , presents some surprising conclusions on the subject , such as :
Most people 's New Year 's resolutions are doomed to failure
Most self - help books have it completely wrong when they say perfectionism is at the root of procrastination , and
Procrastination can be explained by a single mathematical equation
" Essentially , procrastinators have less confidence in themselves , less expectancy that they can actually complete a task , " Steel says .
" Perfectionism is not the culprit .
In fact , perfectionists actually procrastinate less , but they worry about it more . "
Other predictors of procrastination include : task aversiveness , impulsiveness , distractibility , and how much a person is motivated to achieve .
Not all delays can be considered procrastination ; the key is that a person must believe it would be better to start working on given tasks immediately , but still not start .
It 's estimated that about 15 - 20 per cent of the general population are procrastinators .
And the costs of procrastinating can add up well beyond poor work performance , especially for those who delay filing their taxes or planning their retirement .
Steel says motivational failures such as difficulty in sticking to diets and exercise regimes - frequently the focus of New Year 's resolutions - are related to procrastination because impulsiveness is often at the root of the failure .
" Temptations that are close at hand are difficult to resist .
Addicts often relapse after returning from treatment facilities because drugs and alcohol become easily available and daily habits reassert themselves .
Or we load up on bread in the restaurant before the meal is served .
Or we check our email 10 times an hour instead of completing a project . "
The good news is that willpower has an unusual capacity .
" The old saying is true : ' Whether you believe you can or believe you can't , you 're probably right ' , " Steel says .
" And as you get better at self control , your expectancy about whether you can resist goes up and thus improves your ability to resist . "
Steel has also come up with the E=MC2 of procrastination , a formula he 's dubbed Temporal Motivational Theory , which takes into account factors such as the expectancy a person has of succeeding with a given task ( E ) , the value of completing the task ( V ) , the desirability of the task ( Utility ) , its immediacy or availability ( Ã ) and the person 's sensitivity to delay ( D ) .
It looks like this and uses the Greek letter Ã : Utility = E x V/ÃD
It 's still unclear why some people may be more prone to developing procrastination behaviour , but some evidence suggests it may be genetic .
Steel concludes : " Continued research into procrastination should not be delayed , especially because its prevalence seems to be growing . "
###
The title of the paper is " The Nature of Procrastination : A Meta - Analytic and Theoretical Review of Quintessential Self - Regulatory Failure . "
The American Psychological Association 's Psychological Bulletin is arguably the top academic journal for the social sciences .
Steel 's research on the subject is referred to as a meta - analysis , in which he distills and synthesizes the evidence on procrastination from 691 other research sources .

Proposal for additional QA and localisation time on Dapper
Hi all I 'm writing to propose a six week delay in the release date of Dapper , in order to do additional validation , certification , localisation , and polish .
I would like to call for a community " town hall " meeting on Tuesday 14th March - once at 09:00 UTC ( for the Aussies and Asian communities ) and then again at 18:00 UTC ( for Europe and the Americas ) .
The meetings will be in #ubuntu- meeting on irc.freenode.net .
Based on feedback at those meetings , we will ask the Tech Board and the Community Council to take a view on the proposal , and announce the decision by the end of the week .
Work towards our feature goals for Dapper is very much on target : https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/dapper/+specs
Having good tools to track our evolution has made Dapper our best - managed release so far .
We have deferred very few goals since our Montreal planning summit , and have been able to land some unexpected but very nice extra features .
The new installer is looking good , so we could in fact make our target date of April 20 if we decide that is the most important thing .
We have a very good track record of meeting our six monthly release dates , and that reputation is not something I want to compromise .
However , in some senses Dapper is a " first " for us , in that it is the first " enterprise quality " release of Ubuntu , for which we plan to offer support for a very long time .
I , and others , would very much like Dapper to stand proud amongst the traditional enterprise linux releases from Red Hat , Debian and SUSE as an equal match on quality , support and presentation .
We would like Ubuntu Dapper to be a release that companies can deploy with confidence , which will be the focus of certification work from ISV's and IHV's , and which will bring the benefits of Debian to a whole new group of users .
That 's certainly a new set of challenges , and I would like to give us a few more weeks of work on Dapper in order to make absolutely sure that we are , for a period at least ( until Etch lands :-) ) , the very best enterprise desktop and server release in the world .
I would like the Tech Board to determine , if we delay the final release , what the optimal beta , release candidate and target final release dates should be , based on the feedback that comes in during this discussion .
Here are the concrete things I think we can gain from a delay : 1 . Testing The Dapper user will likely be new to Linux , and working in a more corporate environment than previous Ubuntu release adopters .
They will likely also be given Dapper to use , rather than choosing it for themselves , as Dapper is deployed in larger - scale environments .
Additional testing time will shake out more bugs and give us a more robust codebase to support .
2 . Certification
There are a number of ISV's and IHV's who are in the process of certifying Dapper as part of their solution , and the delay will give us an opportunity to ensure that those are ready for the release .
I am happy to say that we are working towards LSB 3.0 certification of Dapper , and the delay greatly reduces any risk of failure to achieve that certification .
3 . Localisation After the Asia business tour I realised that we need to improve our support for Chinese , Japanese , Korean and other Asian fonts , translations , input methods and supporting tools .
We are pulling together a crack team to work on that next week , and I would like to land their changes in Dapper .
These countries are growing their adoption of technology at a very high speed and it would be great to offer them a compelling alternative to the traditional route of proprietary software .
I missed the importance of this in Montreal , I confess , and so did not prioritise the work early on in our cycle .
I would like to remedy that now , rather than waiting two or three years for another enterprise - class Ubuntu release .
In addition , the extra time will help us ensure that all languages have better translations available , for the installer and the whole desktop environment .
We have just done the import of Dapper into Rosetta , so those of you with a talent for languages will appreciate the extra time to add depth to your language packs .
4 . Polish
You may have noticed this weeks theming and polish changes .
No , we are not newly sponsored by Orange :-) .
Of course , there is a lot still to be done , and with some extra time I think Dapper can look beautiful for Kubuntu , Ubuntu and Xubuntu users .
Speaking of Xubuntu , there is a main inclusion report under discussion to make Xubuntu part of main , and to publish ISO 's of Xubuntu .
The extra time makes this a more reasonable proposition .
There are many groups that are working towards Dapper 's release or dependent on it in one way or another .
For example , folks who are writing books with planned release dates , or folks doing work on derivative distributions and hardware that needs Dapper to be available .
I would like to hear from anyone who will be impacted by this potential change to see if we can find a way that gives the best result for the broad community .
Please send me email , and join in on the meetings at whichever time suits you best .
We would like to be able to announce 24x7 global technical support for Dapper , both from Canonical and from the fantastic ecosystem of companies that is growing up around Ubuntu .
We would like to show that a Debian - based distribution can deliver the same world class desktop punch that you might traditionally expect from Novell or Red Hat .
We will live with Dapper for five years - so let 's give it a few extra weeks now so that it can be a real asset to the Ubuntu project for the full duration of its lifespan .

Previous entry : Transhumanist jobs of the future
On January 4th , the Pentagon “ announced the identities ” of six American soldiers who had died between December 28th and New Year ’s Eve .
It was just one of many such listings over these last years and , like similar announcements , this one had a just - the - facts quality to it  spare to the bone , barely more information than you would get from a POW : rank , age , place of birth , date of death , place of death , type of death , and the unit to which the dead soldier belonged .
These announcements , which blend seamlessly into one another , also blend the dead into a relatively uniform mass .
You can , of course , learn nothing from such skeletal reports about the dreams of these young men ( and sometimes women ) , their hopes or fears , their plans for the future or lack of them , their talents and skills , their problems , their stray thoughts or deepest convictions , their worlds , and those who cared about them .
So few paragraphs are almost bound to emphasize not the individuality of the dead , but their similarity in death .
Five of these soldiers died due to roadside explosives ( IEDs ) , one from small - arms fire .
Two died in Baghdad ; two in Baqubah ; the embattled capital of Diyala Province , north of Baghdad , where civil war rages ; one in Ramadi , the capital of al - Anbar Province , the heartland of the Sunni insurgency ; and one in Taji , also in the “ Sunni Triangle . ”
None had a rank higher than sergeant .
The oldest was only 22 ; the youngest , 20 .
Another thing five of the six had in common was not coming from a major American city .
In order of population :
Pvt. David E. Dietrich came from Marysville , Pennsylvania , ( population , 2,428 in 2005 ) , not far from Harrisburg .
Pfc. Alan R. Blohm came from Kenai , Alaska ( population , 7,166 in 2003 ) , 150 miles south of Anchorage .
Cpl. Jonathan E. Schiller came from Ottumwa , Iowa , ( population 24,998 in 2000 ) , best known as the home of Radar O’Reilly in the TV show M* A * S*H .
It supposedly has “ the highest unsolved murder rate ( per capita ) in the free world . ”
Sgt. John M. Sullivan came from Hixson , Tennessee ( population 37,507 ) .
Spc. Luis G. Ayala came from South Gate , California ( population of 103,547 ) , part of Los Angeles and once the home of a huge General Motors plant .
Spc. Richard A. Smith came from Grand Prairie , Texas , population 145,600 in 2005 .
“ Legend has it , ” the Wikipedia tells us , “ that the town was renamed after a famous female actor stepped off the train and exclaimed ‘ My , what a grand prairie ! ' ”
Some of them , in other words , grew up in places with vanishingly small populations but even those who did n’t came from places you ’re likely to have heard of only if you grew up there yourself .
As Lizette Alvarez and Andrew Lehren put it , in examining the last thousand American deaths in Iraq for the New York Times :
“ The service members who died during this latest period fit an unchanging profile .
They were mostly white men from rural areas , soldiers so young they still held fresh memories of high school football heroics and teenage escapades .
Many men and women were in Iraq for the second or third time .
Some were going on their fourth , fifth or sixth deployment . ”
All you have to do is look through the most recent of these Pentagon announcements of deaths in Iraq to find more evidence of that parade of places you just have n’t heard of : Vassar , Michigan ( pop. 2,823 ) , Paris , Tennessee ( pop. 9,763 ) , Wasilla , Alaska ( pop. 5,470 ) , Tamarac , Florida ( pop. 55,588 ) , New Castle , Delaware ( pop. 4,836 ) , and Vancouver , Washington ( pop. 157,493 ) .
This is n’t new .
You could say , in fact , that here , as elsewhere in the American experience of war in Iraq , the Vietnam analogy seems to apply , at least to a degree .
Historian Chris Appy in his book Working - Class War comments :
“ Rural and small - town America may have lost more men in Vietnam , proportionately , than did even central cities and working - class suburbs
It is not hard to find small towns that lost more than one man in Vietnam .
Empire , Alabama , for example , had four men out of a population of only 400 die in Vietnam  four men from a town in which only a few dozen boys came of draft age during the entire war . ”
But in the present all - volunteer military at the height of an increasingly catastrophic , ever - less - popular war , this trend toward sacrificing the overlooked young from overlooked American communities seems especially pronounced .
What does this mean , practically speaking ?
Assistant Professor James Moody of Duke University recently estimated that somewhere between 4.3 and 6.5 million Americans “ may know people who were killed or wounded in the recent fighting ” in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That may sound like a lot of people , but as Globalsecurity .org ’s director John Pike put the matter , “ The probability of knowing a casualty was about 100 times higher in [ World War II ] than today . ”
Similar figures for the Vietnam years would have been significantly higher than the present ones as well ( and , of course , the omnipresence of the draft gave so many more Americans a sense of being at war ) .
As University of Maryland sociology professor David Segal put the matter , in considering Moody ’s research , “ The bottom line is that the American military is at war , but American society is not .
Even in Vietnam , everybody knew somebody who was killed or wounded . ”
When , last night , the president announced that he had already “ committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq , ” when he “ surges ” them into Baghdad and al - Anbar Province , he is surging from Kenai , from Wasilla , from South Gate .
And he is ensuring a spate of future Pentagon “ announcements ” that will again take us to what ’s left of the hamlets , villages , small towns , and out of the way smaller cities of this country , the places Americans increasingly do n’t notice .
When the president talks to us , as he did last night , about “ a year ahead that will demand more patience , sacrifice , and resolve , ” this is who he is mainly sacrificing .
Today , in our civilized world , we are shocked when we read of the bloody rites , the human sacrifices , of the Aztecs whose priests ripped hearts , still beating , from human chests to appease their bloodthirsty gods .
These were , of course , the hearts of captives .
In all his fervor , George W. Bush looks ever more like an American high priest who , for his own bloody gods , is similarly ripping hearts from the chests of the living .
Make no mistake , in his speech last night , he was offering up human sacrifices from the captive villages and towns of the United States on the altar of blind faith and pure , abysmal folly .
A Surge of Words
In our country , last night ’s “ surge ” was mainly a surge of words , twenty - minutes worth , 2,898 of them .
In the build - up to the speech , as almost every last detail of it was leaked to the media , untold hundreds of thousands of words surged onto news pages , onto the TV news , into talk radio chatter , and online  and so many hundreds of thousands more , these included , will follow in the days to come .
As Gail Russell Chaddock of the Christian Science Monitor wrote , the president ’s “ new way forward ” plan is guaranteed to run into a “ wall of words on Capitol Hill , ” but , she added , “ not much more . ”
The New York Times front - paged that the Democrats were planning “ symbolic votes ” against the president ’s plan “ which would do nothing in practical terms to block Mr. Bush ’s intention to increase the United States military presence in Iraq . ”
Practical terms means , not words but Congress ’ undeniable power of the purse , and so its right to deny at least some part of the tsunami of money the Bush administration is demanding to carry out its latest plan .
Only in recent days has the possibility of using the purse to rein in the war begun to make its way from the distant frontiers of critical pariah - hood onto at least some mainstream agendas .
In the lead - up to Bush ’s speech to the nation , almost nowhere did words not surge  despite the odd irony that the president did not actually use the word “ surge ” in his speech .
Amid the deluge of words , only George Bush resorted to the resounding sound of silence .
As Howard Fineman wrote in Newsweek :
“ [ T ] he new chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee  Carl Levin , an important character now  sent Bush a private letter three weeks ago offering his counsel .
Levin never got a reply .
Bush can be just as deaf to Republicans .
At a recent White House ceremony , Sen. Susan Collins offered to brief him on her Iraq visit .
He responded by escorting her to the office of his deputy national - security adviser  and then left before she told her story . ”
Given the crisis atmosphere , much of the speech itself , when the president was not plodding through his tactical changes in Iraq or offering insincere thanks to James Baker ’s Iraq Study Group , was remarkably ordinary Bush boilerplate .
The newest ( and most ominous ) note struck hardly related to Iraq at all .
It lay in these two lines clearly aimed at Iran , a country the Study Group wanted to draw into negotiations : “ I recently ordered the deployment of an additional carrier strike group to the region .
We will expand intelligence sharing  and deploy Patriot air defense systems to reassure our friends and allies . ”
At a moment when at least one American air strike had just taken place in Somalia , it hinted at a different kind of surge entirely .
Otherwise , we had heard it all , including the plan , before .
The president struck only a few Iraq notes that , with a modest stretch of the imagination , might be called new and which are already all over the news .
He called the situation in Iraq “ unacceptable to the American people ” and to him .
( No mention was made of the Iraqis , of course ) .
He offered this : “ Where mistakes have been made , the responsibility rests with me , ” which , though already being headlined , managed in typical fashion to sound as if he was somehow taking responsibility for mistakes he had little or nothing to do with making .
He did speak of “ benchmarks ” twice 
“ So America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced ”  but where exactly those “ marks ” were and how the Iraqis were to be held to them no one listening to the speech could have had a clue .
Perhaps the single novel statement was this one : “ I have made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq ’s other leaders that America ’s commitment is not open - ended . ”
Of course , it too went utterly undefined , but assumedly when the present surge fails , it does leave the president some vague kind of out , were he ever to decide to use it .
When it came to much of the rest of the speech , you could easily have taken his address to a joint session of Congress on September 20 , 2001 , or his September 11 , 2006 anniversary address on the World Trade Center attacks , shaken the words up and simply dumped them randomly into last night ’s speech without reaching for a bit of new vocabulary .
As in either of those previous speeches , he created his usual hair - raisingly Manichaean vision of an embattled us - and - them world ( one he and his top officials have worked assiduously to bring into being ) , of simple good and pure evil ( though , a rarity for him , he did not actually use the word “ evil ” last night ) , of longed - for security and utter terror .
If you were simply to do a word count comparison to his 9/11 anniversary speech ( almost 400 words shorter ) , there would be little way , except possibly by the rise in the use of the word “ sectarian , ” to note the passage of time in Iraq .
Just to take the dystopian side of his official presidential vision , here are some word counts from last night ( with the September counts in parentheses ) .
Terror , terrorists : 13 ( 17 )
Violence , violent : 13 ( 3 )
Sectarian : 9 ( 1 )
Al - Qaeda : 10 ( 3 )
Extreme /ists : 6 ( 6 )
Enemies : 5 ( 14 )
Attack : 5 ( 13 )
Insurgents : 5 ( 0 )
Kill , Killing , Killers : 4 ( 3 )
Fight , fighters , fighting : 4 ( 6 )
War : 3 ( 13 )
Struggle : 3 ( 4 )
Death , Deadly : 3 ( 1 )
Islamic ( Radical Empire , Radical Extremists ) : 2 ( 1 )
Murder , Murderers : 2 ( 1 )
Threat : 1 ( 6 )
Defeat : 1 ( 5 )
Destroy , Destruction : 2 ( 2 )
Hateful : 1 ( 2 )
Danger , Dangerous : 2 ( 1 )
Aggressive : 1 ( 1 )
Conflict : 1 ( 1 )
On our side of the black / white divide were all his ( and his speechwriters ’ ) usual favorites : “ protect , ” “ secure , ” “ defend , ” “ democracy , ” “ liberty , ” and even , against all expectations , not just “ success ” and its cognates , as well as “ prevail , ” but “ victory ” itself ( twice ) , even though it long ago went missing in action in the real world .
Awkwardly , even uncomfortably delivered , last night ’s Way - Forward - in - Iraq speech was , in sum , a speech to be forgotten , a speech certain to be buried  and quickly  in the coming carnage .
And here ’s a strange footnote to the administration ’s surge of words .
The most secretive White House in our history , ever ready to accuse others of leaking or releasing information that could hurt national security , has over the last week essentially released the full American “ surge ” plan for the Baghdad area  as if we were n’t in one world , as if those resisting the American military did n’t watch CNN and could n’t read our press online like anyone else .
Whether you belong to a Sunni insurgent group , al - Qaeda in Iraq , or Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army , you now know that the American plan involves dividing the Iraqi capital into nine sections ; more or less how many American ( as well as Iraqi ) troops and police will be assigned to live in each of them ; that new mini-bases for the surging Americans will be created throughout the city , and so on .
Given administration and military leaks , copious official background briefings for the media , Bush ’s speech , and the endless comments of key neocon planners and presidential briefers Frederick Kagan and retired General Jack Keane , can there be anyone on our planet who does n’t know a great deal about the American “ way forward ” and the exact schedule on which it is to be rolled out ?
Since the president ’s plan sounds so much like past “ surges ” into Baghdad , military and economic , just as the speech itself caught so many past presidential speech patterns , planning to avoid , outwait , outfight , or outwit it should be well underway as you read this .
The Man Who Met the Man Who Shot Abu Musab al - Zarqawi
On January 2nd , there was a strange piece of news buried in a back paragraph of a front - page New York Times story by the reportorial team of David E. Sanger , Michael R. Gordon , and John F. Burns .
It had the wonderful headline , “ Chaos Overran Iraq Plan in ’ 06 , Bush Team Says ” ( as if they were just standing around , when the tsunami of chaos happened to hit ) and here was the passage :
“ By May 2006 , uneasy officials at the State Department and the National Security Council argued for a review of Iraq strategy .
A meeting was convened at Camp David to consider those approaches , according to participants in the session , but Mr. Bush left early for a secret visit to Baghdad , where he reviewed the war plans with General Casey and Mr. Maliki , and met with the American pilot whose plane ’s missiles killed Iraq ’s al - Qaeda leader , Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
He returned to Washington in a buoyant mood . ”
The italics are mine .
And yes , the week after Abu Musab al - Zarqawi took an American missile in the teeth , the president made a visit to Baghdad , so quick and secret that even he hardly knew he was there .
At the time , the American death toll had just hit 2,500 .
As a signal of trust , the new Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , was given a full five - minutes notice that he was about to have the President of the United States look him “ in the eye . ”
All of this was covered in our news , including a presidential meeting with cheering American troops and Bush ’s comments on his return flight  that seem as up - to - date as last night ’s surge speech 
“ I assured [ the Iraqis ] that we ’ll keep our commitment .
I also made it clear to them that in order for us to keep our commitment and be successful , they themselves have to do some hard things .
They themselves have to set an agenda .
They themselves have to get some things accomplished . ”
This is the sort of thing that , almost seven months later , gives you confidence that the “ new way forward ” is , in fact , the traditional way backward .
At a moment when the Iraqi situation was already visibly devolving into chaos , civil war , and catastrophe , that the president came home “ buoyant ” remains a striking detail , more so perhaps because of the fervor with which he described his own mood at the time .
“ I was , ” he claimed , “ inspired . ”
But what was it that actually “ inspired ” him that week in June 2006 ?
The death of Zarqawi certainly .
The president , whose approach to his war is unnervingly personal , had built up Zarqawi ’s importance not just to the American public but evidently in his own mind until the man stood practically co-equal with the ever - missing Osama bin Laden .
So , it may not be surprising that he would have wanted to meet the pilot whose plane ’s missiles killed Zarqawi  but it ’s still news , all these months later , and revealing news at that .
You can search the coverage of that June moment from MSNBC and the Washington Post to Fox News in vain for mention of it .
All I found was this oblique reference in a presidential radio address : “ And I was honored to meet with some of our troops , including those responsible for bringing justice to the terrorist Zarqawi . ”
At the time , no one in the media seems to have picked up on the meeting with the pilot , although presidential doings of any sort are usually closely scrutinized .
Even the White House , it appears , chose not to publicize it .
So I think we have to assume that the meeting may actually have represented a private presidential desire ( or , at least , the decision of someone who knew that this would give Bush special satisfaction ) .
If so , it catches something of the character of the man who is now so ready to surge other people ’s sons and daughters onto the streets of Baghdad .
It ’s reasonable to assume that , in his heart of hearts , George Bush never really wanted to be president and , before the 9/11 attacks woke him up , many observers noted that he acted that way .
On the eve of the 2001 attacks , even Republicans were griping that he was n’t into the nation ’s business , just the business of vacationing at the “ ranch ” in Crawford , Texas .
One Republican congressman complained that “ it was hard for Mr. Bush to get his message out if the White House lectern had a ‘ Gone Fishing ’ sign on it . ”
What 9/11 seems to have awoken in him was a desire not so much to be president as to be Commander - in - Chief ( or maybe sheriff ) .
It ’s an urge that anyone who grew up in the darkened movie theaters of the 1950s , watching American war films and Westerns , might understand .
Sooner or later , most of us , of course , left behind those thrilling screen moments in which Americans gloriously advanced to victory and the good guys did what was necessary to put the bad guys down , but my own suspicion has long been that George W. Bush did not  and that avoiding the conflicts of the Vietnam - era helped him remain a silver - screen warrior .
In launching his Global War on Terror and the “ hunt ” for Osama bin Laden , the president famously said , “ I want justice .
And there ’s an old poster out West …
I recall , that said , ‘ Wanted , Dead or Alive . ' ”
That “ old poster ” was , of course , “ recalled ” from childhood cowboy movies , not from any West he ever experienced .
Similarly , from his “ Top Gun , ” Mission - Accomplished moment landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln to the way he kept his own “ personal scorecard of the war ” ( little bios with accompanying photos of leading al - Qaeda figures , which he crossed out as U.S. forces took them down ) , from his visible pleasure in appearing before hoo- aahing American troops wearing G.I .
Joe doll - style dress - up jackets ( often with “ commander - in - chief ” stitched across his heart ) to his petulant “ bring ’em on ” comment of game - playing frustration when the Iraqi insurgency would n’t go away , it ’s hard not to register his childish urge for role - playing .
Every signal we have indicates that he experienced himself as , and savored finding himself in , the specific role of Commander - in - Chief , and that he has been genuinely thrilled to do commander - in - chief - like things and act in commander - in - chief - like ways , at least as once pictured in the on - screen fantasy world of his youth .
Being the man who met ( and congratulated ) the man who shot Abu Musab al - Zarqawi certainly qualifies , even if the antiseptic act of missiling a house from a jet is n’t quite the equivalent of the showdown at the OK Corral , six - gun in hand .
In other words , George Bush dreams of himself in High Noon , while , in reality , he ’s directing a horror movie or a snuff film .
This is all so woefully infantile for the leader of the globe ’s last superpower .
Take his response to being presented with the pistol found near Saddam Hussein when he was finally captured in his “ spiderhole ” in 2004 .
According to Time magazine ’s Matthew Cooper that same year :
“ Sources say that the military had the pistol mounted after the soldiers seized it from Saddam and that it was then presented to the president privately by some of the troops who played a key role in ferreting out the old tyrant .
Though it was widely reported at the time that the pistol was loaded when they grabbed Saddam , Bush has told visitors that the gun was empty  and that it is still empty and safe to touch .
‘ He really liked showing it off , ’ says a recent visitor to the White House who has seen the gun .
‘ He was really proud of it . ’
The pistol ’s new place of residence is in the small study next to the Oval Office where Bush takes select visitors ”
The military knew their man  or perhaps boy ; someone deeply involved not in the actual bloody carnage of Iraq , but in a fantasy Iraq
War of his own imagining , a man who could still tell us last night : “ We can and we will prevail ” and predict “ victory . ”
This is the man who is now going to launch an “ aggressive effort ” to sell Congress and the American people on further madness and bloody carnage in Iraq .
And this is the plan after which , according to Neil King Jr. and Greg Jaffe of the Wall Street Journal , may come the already named “ nightmare scenario ”  civil and regional war across the Middle East  according to some worried American officials and Arab diplomats .
This is the man who holds in his hands the lives of countless Iraqis and tens of thousands of Americans about to be sent into Hell .
It ’s no news that George W. Bush has been living in a bubble world created by his handlers , but it ’s hard not to believe that his own personal “ bubble ” is n’t far more longstanding than that .
The problem , of course , is that only Mr. Bush and a few neocon stragglers are left inside the theater still showing his Iraq War movie .
The Iraqis are n’t there .
The man who pushed the button to shoot that missile surely was n’t ; nor were Zarqawi ’s Shi’ite victims ; nor were the 120 or more Iraqis who died this Tuesday , including the 41 bodies found dumped throughout Baghdad and the five found scattered around Mosul ; nor was Dustin Donica , the 3,000th American who died in the war ; nor was Pfc. Alan R. Blohm from Kenai , Alaska .
None of them could put up a “ Wanted Dead or Alive ” poster , cross - out the faces of the bad guys , land gloriously on an aircraft carrier , or dress up for war  and then go home “ inspired . ”
They had the misfortune to be in a horrific reality into which a president , thoroughly in the dark , had sent them stumbling .
Now , George W. Bush is about to send even more young ( and some not so young )
Americans from hamlets , small towns , distant suburbs , and modest - sized cities all over America on yet another “ last chance ” mission .
Perhaps he ’s even still dreaming of that moment when , in those movies of old , the Marine Corps Hymn suddenly welled up and , against all odds , our troops started forward and the enemy began to fall .
But before we ’re done , if there ’s a commander he might bring to mind , it ’s not likely to be George Patton , but George Armstrong Custer .
What if that last chance comes to look more like a last stand ?
The least the president could do for the rest of us is step out of the dark of his brain , where those old films still flicker , and look around .

" My dear Krauts " Humor Lessons for a Paranoid Nation
Germany is in urgent need of " humor development aid , " says Roger Boyes , the London Times correspondent in Berlin .
He is distributing care packages in the form of a new book , a kind of autobiographical satire provocatively titled " My dear Krauts . "
It 's the product of a long struggle to understand a deeply confusing nation .

A receiver under the eye surface passes the signals back to the chip
US researchers have been given the go - ahead to implant the prototype device in 50 to 75 patients .
The Argus II system uses a spectacle - mounted camera to feed visual information to electrodes in the eye .
Patients who tested less - advanced versions of the retinal implant were able to see light , shapes and movement .
" What we are trying to do is take real - time images from a camera and convert them into tiny electrical pulses that would jump - start the otherwise blind eye and allow patients to see , " said Professor Mark Humayun , from the University of Southern California .
BIONIC EYE TECHNOLOGY
1 : Camera on glasses views image 2 : Signals are sent to hand - held device 3 : Processed information is sent back to glasses and wirelessly transmitted to receiver under surface of eye 4 : Receiver sends information to electrodes in retinal implant 5 : Electrodes stimulate retina to send information to brain
Retinal implants are able to partially restore the vision of people with particular forms of blindness caused by diseases such as macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa .
About 1.5 million people worldwide have retinitis pigmentosa , and one in 10 people over the age of 55 have age - related macular degeneration .
Both diseases cause the retinal cells which process light at the back of the eye to gradually die .
The new devices work by implanting an array of tiny electrodes into the back of the retina .
A camera is used to capture pictures , and a processing unit , about the size of a small handheld computer and worn on a belt , converts the visual information into electrical signals .
These are then sent back to the glasses and wirelessly on to a receiver just under the surface of the front of the eye , which in turn feeds them to the electrodes at the rear .
The whole process happens in real time .
Growing dots
First - generation , low - resolution devices have already been fitted to six patients .
" The longest device has been in for five years , " said Professor Humayun .
" It 's amazing , even with 16 pixels , or electrodes , how much our first six subjects have been able to do . "
Terry Byland , 58 , from California was fitted with an implant in 2004 after going blind with retinitis pigmentosa in 1993 .
" At the beginning , it was like seeing assembled dots - now it 's much more than that , " he said .
" When I am walking along the street I can avoid low - hanging branches - I can see the edges of the branches . "
Mr Byland is also able to make out other shapes .
" I can't recognise faces , but I can see them like a dark shadow , " he said .
Brain change
The new implant has a higher resolution than the earlier devices , with 60 electrodes .
It is also a lot smaller , about one square millimetre , which reduces the amount of surgery that needs to be done to implant the device .
The technology has now been given the go - ahead by the US Food and Drug Administration to be used in an exploratory patient trial .
This will take place at five centres across America over two years , with 50 - 75 patients aged over 50 .
If successful , the device could be commercialised soon after , costing around $ 30,000 ( £ 15,000 ) .
Other devices could then be developed with higher resolution or a wider field of view , said Professor Humayun .
Future work includes studying the effects the implants have on the brain .
" We are actually studying what happens to the visual cortex over time , " said Professor Humayun .
The research was presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) annual meeting in San Francisco , US .

Bill Keller , the executive editor of the New York Times , sat on a couch in the Oval Office of the White House , three feet from President George W. Bush , and listened .
For a meeting without historical precedent , the president of the United States had called the Times to the White House to personally try to prevent a state secret from appearing in print — an exposé of the National Security Agency ’s efforts to monitor phone calls without court - approved warrants that the Times had held back on for over a year .
Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. sat in a wing chair facing Bush , while Keller and Washington bureau chief Philip Taubman sat across from Bush ’s lawyer , Harriet Miers , and national - security adviser Stephen Hadley .
General Michael Hayden , the then - director of the National Security Agency , sat alongside Bush with a thick briefing book in his lap .
After stiff pleasantries , Bush issued an emphatic warning :
If they revealed the secret program to the public and there was another terrorist attack on American soil , the Paper of Record would be implicated .
“ The basic message , ” recalls Keller , “ was , ‘ You ’ll have blood on your hands . ’ ”
The meeting lasted an hour .
Afterward , Sulzberger and Keller stood outside the White House .
Undaunted by the president ’s logic and his threats , Keller told Sulzberger , “ Nothing I heard in there changed my mind . ” Sulzberger agreed .
Eleven days after the meeting with Bush , the Times defied the president ; the story , by James Risen and Eric Licht­blau , was headlined bush lets u.s. spy on callers without courts .
That same day , the USA Patriot Act was blocked in the Senate .
The White House went into attack mode .
Its target : Bill Keller and the New York Times .
The Times is as powerful a news organization , and media brand , as any on earth , but the cracks in its foundations have become disconcertingly visible .
Of course , things could be much worse .
A look at the papers in most other cities reveals what the Times might look like in a nightmare future : a bland , cowed publication with ads on its front page , sustained by auto guides and real - estate brochures .
The distance between here and there , once comfortably vast , has shortened considerably as the newspaper finds its financial , legal , and journalistic powers under assault .
The Times itself helped weaken the right of reporters to protect sources by taking Judith Miller ’s tortured case to the steps of the Supreme Court and failing .
The paper has been attacked by the president as “ disgraceful ” for publishing national - security secrets , the vice - president has led a chorus of conservative commentators impugning its patriotism , and a grand - jury probe of the NSA leak could bring yet more subpoenas for reporters .
Conservative commentators have even urged the Justice Department to charge the paper under the Espionage Act , an unlikely but terrifying prospect that could mean jail time for Sulzberger and Keller and perhaps force the closure of the newspaper .
Ominously , the Bush administration appears to have the support of the public ; a national poll shows 54 percent of Americans in favor of wiretapping without warrants .
There ’s not a lot of enthusiasm for press freedom , either .
Meanwhile , the very business of selling newspapers is falling apart .
The Web has gnawed away at the Times ’ ad revenue , and as the cost of newsprint soars , the newspaper itself is literally shrinking :
Next year , the Times will be 1.5 inches narrower , with 5 percent less space for news ( not a huge loss , but a crushing metaphor ) .
Under publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. , whose family has operated the paper since 1896 and maintains majority ownership , the company ’s shares have lost half their value since 2002 , frustrating not only Wall Street but legions of stock - owning employees .
While Sulzberger searches for new sources of revenue in what appears to be an ad hoc manner , he entrusts the editorial power to Bill Keller , who , famously , was not Sulzberger ’s first choice to be in charge .
In 2001 , in the months leading up to Joe Lelyveld ’s retirement as executive editor , the paper ’s highest editorial position , the then–­editorial - page editor Howell Raines had sold himself to Sulzberger as a revolutionary and painted Lelyveld ( and , by association , his protégé Keller ) as defending a newsroom full of “ lifers , careerists , nerds , time - servers and drones ” ( this from Raines ’s recent memoir ) .
Raines advocated a ­hyperaggressive news culture , promising the business side of the newspaper that he could produce more bang for the paper ’s buck by cracking the whip .
Passing over Keller , the managing editor at the time , Sulz­berger gave Raines the job .
But 21 months into his tenure , when reporter Jayson Blair admitted to faking news stories , Raines had so many enemies at the paper that he could n’t survive the ensuing scandal .

So after a two - month return stint by Lelyveld in the spring of 2003 , Sulzberger tapped Keller , in a move widely thought to be orchestrated by his mentor .
Sulzberger may have been cornered , but the choice restored order to the newsroom .
Keller was the anti- Howell , stable and strikingly inoffensive , the beta to Raines ’s alpha .
In his first speech to the staff , Keller signaled a downshift , urging reporters to spend more time with their families , assuring people close to Raines that they need n’t fear petty reprisals .
His primary mode of communication , even with people who sat within sight of his office , was e-mail .
Ushering in an era of transparency and nonconfrontation , he dubbed his biannual Q&A sessions with reporters “ Throw Things at Bill . ”
He was surprised to discover just how defeated the newsroom was .
In the daily page - one meetings , Keller says , he would “ throw something out on the table expecting people to tear it apart , and everybody would wait quietly and look around and wait to hear what I thought .
They were expecting me to tell them what the right answer was . ”
“ I think Howell ’s view of leadership is martial , it ’s Robert E. Lee , it ’s Bear Bryant , ” he says .
“ And mine is more paterfamilias , I guess .
You are dependent on this huge reservoir of talent , and your job is to create the circumstances under which they can do their best work , to reward them when they do well , correct them when they do wrong , set some guidelines , and spur their ambitions .
But it ’s not about me . ”
The Keller honeymoon did not last long .
In time , more and more members of the notoriously cantankerous newsroom began to find his self - effacement troubling , especially in view of the challenges facing the Times and quality journalism in general .
That Keller was committed to safeguarding the paper ’s editorial integrity was never doubted ; what people started to worry about was whether that was all he could do and whether it would be enough .
Bill Keller , 57 , a California native , son of a onetime chief executive of Chevron , is a fiercely intelligent , taciturn , occasionally prickly man who never wanted to be an editor , let alone a leader .
But , like Lelyveld , he believes that reporters are the heart of the Times and should run it , even if they have to be torn away from what they do best .
Keller was among the most gifted foreign correspondents of his generation .
A graduate of Pomona College , he went to work for the Times in 1984 and , two years later , was sent to Moscow to serve under bureau chief Philip Taubman .
His then - wife , Ann Cooper , was a correspondent for National Public Radio , and the two took immediately to Russia .
Good fortune struck early .
While out with Cooper and Keller , Taubman ’s wife , Times reporter Felicity Barringer , suggested they visit dissident intellectual Andrei Sakharov , who was about to return from exile .
That very day , the Soviet government had installed a phone in his house so he could receive a call from Mikhail Gorba­chev .
A guard at the house gave the reporters Sakharov ’s number , and they rushed back to the Times bureau .
Normally , a bureau chief might choose to take such a big story for himself , but Taubman let Keller have it .
“ Phil said , ‘ You ’ve got the number , you make the call , ’ ” says Keller .
“ He let me do the share of the stories that were obviously destined for page one . ”
In Moscow , Keller worked ­sixteen - hour days .
Among his friends there was David Remnick , then a Washington Post reporter and now editor of The New Yorker .
When Remnick arrived in Moscow in 1988 , he sized up his chief competitor .
“ To watch him work , there ’s a certain kind of cool intelligence to his bearing , ” Remnick says .
At Remnick ’s first press conference , he noticed that Keller asked no questions and barely took notes .
Reading the next day ’s paper , he realized Keller had “ already been to everybody ’s kitchen and sewn the thing up . ”
Keller and Remnick had one of the great journalistic opportunities of the twentieth century , witnessing the fall of the Soviet Union , and they both produced spectacular work .
Barringer says Keller ’s journalism was straighter , Remnick ’s more soulful .
Taubman compares their competition to “ a heavyweight championship match . ”
Keller won .
He was in Cuba covering Gorbachev ’s visit when he learned that he ’d won the Pulitzer Prize in 1989 .
Remnick ’s reaction : “ I ca n’t say my initial feelings were ones of overwhelming glee .
But he earned it , flat - out . ”
Afterward , Keller and Remnick both got book contracts .
Remnick ’s book , Lenin ’s Tomb : The Last Days of the Soviet Empire , was published in 1993 and won a Pulitzer .
Keller could never finish his and eventually had to return the advance to the publisher .
“ I ’m still paying it back , actually , ” says Keller , “ on the installment plan . ”
Keller remained in Moscow until 1992 , then took over as the Times ’ Johannesburg bureau chief to cover the collapse of apartheid .
That same year , he and Cooper adopted a Russian child , Tom .
Two years later , Lelyveld traveled to South Africa — where he was once bureau chief ­himself — to sound out Keller about becoming an editor .
The two barely knew each other , having met once in Moscow and for lunch another time in London .
“ He was one of our stars , and I wanted to see if he had any interest , ” says Lelyveld , who agreed to be interviewed only about his recruitment of Keller .
The two took a road trip together through the Eastern Cape province , “ and I kind of orated on the satisfactions of editing and how I had n’t thought of it myself until late in the game and he should ­really think about it , ” Lelyveld says .
“ He was completely cold and unresponsive to it . ”
The following year , Lelyveld wrote him a letter asking if he ’d like to talk about the foreign - editor job .
“ To my amazement , we did n’t even meet , he accepted the job . ”
Keller now describes his rationale for suddenly changing his mind as uncomplicated — foreign editor is a prestigious post , and what could you do after covering the fall of communism and apartheid , anyway ?
Moving to New York , Keller wrote one last piece on South Africa , an article for the Times Magazine about Nelson Mandela ’s wife , Winnie , in which he cited a book called The Lady : The Life and Times of Winnie Mandela .
The following week , the magazine published a letter by the book ’s author .
I thoroughly enjoyed Bill Keller ’s article “ The Anti-Mandela ” ( May 14 ) and am glad he found my biography of Winnie Mandela useful .
I agree with him that the phrase “ a blistering inferno of racial hatred , ” used to describe her childhood , is an overwrought one .
However , credit where credit is due .
It is not my phrase , it is Winnie ’s own .
— Emma Gilbey , Sag Harbor , L.I .
After reading the letter , Keller called Gilbey , a British journalist living in New York , and asked her to coffee at the Times cafeteria .
Gilbey , at the time , had a reputation as something of a power - dater ; her exes included Senator John Kerry and Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour .
An affair ensued , which shocked Keller ’s friends .
“ I felt bad for everyone involved , ” says Stephen Engelberg , a former Times reporter .
“ This was not characteristic behavior at all .
I would n’t pretend to be Bill ’s psychologist , but he did n’t get a red sports car , so … ”

Gilbey offers another explanation , related to Keller ’s son .
“ After he fell in love with Tom , he was just falling in love all over the place — with chairs and tables — and when he fell in love with me he did n’t know whether this was actually real or whether he actually loved me or was in love with the world .
And , so , you know , we sort of thank Tom . ”
Two years after they met , Gilbey was pregnant , Keller was divorced from Cooper , and he had a new job as managing editor under Joe Lelyveld .
On a morning in late July , Keller met me at La Guardia airport to catch a shuttle flight to Washington , D.C. , where he was to visit the paper ’s bureau .
Among a crowd of executives drinking coffee and perusing the newspapers , Keller was barely noticed — except by women .
With his square jaw , patrician nose , and crinkly eyes , he has the look of a handsome doctor on a soap opera .
Onboard the plane , an attractive older woman gazed across the aisle at him while her husband punched e-mail messages on his Treo .
Keller did n’t seem to notice .
“ You asked once before whether I considered myself ambitious , ” he told me , “ and I do n’t in the sense that I really aspired to the jobs that I got .
But I am competitive . ”
Keller ’s wife says he ’s got a bigger ego than he lets on , suggesting his ostentatious humility is a costume .
She calls him an “ alpha male in disguise . ”
The alpha - beta question is at the heart of any evaluation of Keller ’s tenure as executive editor .
He was , after all , hired to be a kind of institutional nurturer , which turned out to be an untenable role .
It took him ten months to even address the question of whether the paper needed to make amends for Judith Miller ’s discredited stories on Iraq ’s illusory weapons of mass destruction , which had been published under Raines .
By that time , it was clear that Miller had , at best , been led astray by unreliable sources and that there were serious problems with her reporting .
At that point , Keller gathered his top lieutenants , including Managing Editor Jill Abramson , and asked them how far the paper ought to go in investigating those stories .
The consensus that emerged was that the paper should not pursue an internal review on the scale of what had been done following Jayson Blair because it would be too damaging for a newsroom still recovering from that scandal .
Keller , who was inclined to make recovery his top priority , agreed .

Shortly thereafter , prompted by public editor Daniel Okrent ’s decision to write a column about Miller ’s WMD stories , the paper published an editor ’s note in May 2004 .
Keller later acknowledged that it came too late , apologizing in a memo for mistakes in the Miller episode : “ I wish we had dealt with the controversy over our coverage of WMD as soon as I became executive editor …
I was trying to get my arms around a huge new job , appoint my team , get the paper fully back to normal and I feared the WMD issue could become a crippling distraction . ”
Keller ’s reluctance to engage the issue , for which he was clobbered by bloggers in particular , had the effect of solidifying a reputation for indecisiveness that had started to gel , in part , as a function of his allowing Abramson to have the greater profile in the newsroom .
Spending most of his time in front of a computer screen , he managed in a hands - off style that allowed self - starting editors to prosper but that sidestepped hard calls .
“ By avoiding strife , he allowed problems to fester , ” observes one Times reporter who , like others quoted in this story , requested anonymity for fear of angering his colleagues and / or bosses .
“ And they seem to have a nasty habit of blowing up . ”
Other than Sulzberger , Abramson is Keller ’s most important and complicated relationship at the paper .
Because she had worked mostly in Washington , Keller did n’t know her well when she was appointed the managing editor for news ( John Geddes is the managing editor for operations ) .
Keller had preferred to make former metro editor Jon Landman his news managing editor but offered the post to Abramson as a concession to Sulzberger , who wants Abramson in contention to be the Times ’ first female executive editor .
The 52 - year - old Abramson arrived at the paper as a reporter in 1997 after a decade at The Wall Street Journal .
She marched quickly through the ranks , keeping close company with other powerful women writers , including Maureen Dowd .
In right - wing conspiracies about the Times , Abramson and Dowd are seen as a liberal female cabal with occult power over the relatively benign and more conservative Keller .
Abramson is known within the paper for her sharp elbows and for being an aggressive editor who implores reporters to “ go kill for us . ”
Indeed , Abramson advertises herself as the more assertive of Keller ’s consiglieri .
“ I ’m blunter and more impatient , and I tend to worry and think things are off course , ” she says .
“ And he ’s more programmed the other way . ”
During our interviews , Keller repeatedly referred to Abramson as “ my sidekick . ”
He describes his relationship to Abramson as being like a marriage , with all its attendant complexities .
“ It ’s harder to see straight when you ’re in it , ” says Keller .
“ Like any marriage , we have our occasional spats . ”
Before Keller became editor , Abramson was n’t necessarily his greatest fan .
One Timesman recalls Abramson characterizing him as aloof , arrogant , and “ incommunicado . ”
After he offered her the job , Abramson pushed for her friend and former deputy Rick Berke to succeed her as bureau chief .
Instead , Keller went with his trusted friend from Moscow , Philip Taubman .
“ Rick had been not only a steady , wonderful deputy but someone who also kept morale in the bureau up , ” Abramson says .
“ I thought he would have been a good choice . ”
Keller divides his executive editorship thus far into two distinct chapters : the period of healing after Raines left and the “ period of distractions , ” when he found himself once again tormented by Judy Miller , who this time was fighting a federal subpoena in the Valerie Plame leak case .
The year - and - a - half - long ordeal — which Abramson calls an “ icky , demoralized time ” — cemented the relationship between Abramson and Keller .
“ Judy Miller was our first bonding experience , ” he says .
“ If Abe was running the New York Times today , ” says Keller , he would find himself “ in the same predicament that I find myself in … Howell may have been the last gasp of the thunderbolt editor . ”
The impact of the Miller affair on the paper ’s reputation was enormous — in many ways , more damaging than the Blair scandal .
The Times spent more than $ 1.5 million and an incalculable amount of public credibility defending a reporter who appeared to many to be cooperating with a White House effort to smear a WMD whistle - blower .
The case was byzantine , but it basically revolved around relationships —
Sulzberger ’s to Keller , Keller ’s to Abramson , and everybody ’s to Miller .
Keller , though , had a strangely detached role in it all .
While Sulzberger went on his crusade to make Miller a martyr for freedom of the press and Abramson got caught up in the day - to - day dogfight of holding together the Washington bureau ( where resentment against Miller and Times management was running very hot ) , Keller seemed to float above the fray .
He did make one critical decision , though ; when Miller tried to claim that Abramson had known about her reporting on the Plame case , Abramson said Miller was lying .
That made it Miller ’s word against Abramson ’s , and Keller sided with his managing editor .
“ I ’m pretty sure Jill would have remembered , ” he says , “ and I ’m pretty sure Judy would have put it in writing anyway . ”
Even before Miller went to jail for 85 days to protect her source , Abramson and Keller decided she would never write for the paper again .
Keller then did something that angered even his supporters at the Times .
As Miller ’s controversial role in the case leaked out in the press , Keller took off on a preplanned twelve - day trip to the paper ’s Asia bureaus .
He was under intense pressure , and it was viewed by some as a convenient escape from the turmoil at home .
“ It was absolutely fucking awful , ” recalls Gilbey , who was traveling with him .
“ If he had come back because of Judy — what message are you sending to the foreign desk as opposed to the Washington desk ?
If it had been , ‘ I ’ve got this one lunatic at home and I ’m not coming …’
The Times has , like , a million children — well , actually only 1,200 fucking children — and they got left behind at home . ”
I asked her if perhaps there was n’t a streak of conflict avoidance in Keller .
“ Well , ” she says , “ nobody likes conflict . ”
As with Sulzberger , whose father oversaw business and editorial revolutions at the paper in the early seventies , the New York Times ’ burdensome history hangs over Keller ’s every move .
In June , when the Times celebrated the 35th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that allowed it to publish a top - secret government file regarding the faltering war in Vietnam , Jill Abramson led a panel discussion in Washington .
She told the audience that the NSA story “ may very well turn out to be this generation ’s Pentagon Papers ” and recalled A. M. Rosenthal , the legendary executive editor of the Times who published the story and died in May , as an aggressive hero of journalism , “ a gutsy , larger - than - life character , an editor perfectly matched to the historic moment . ”
Was Bill Keller also a man perfectly matched to his historic moment ?
When I ask her this question , Abramson pauses .
“ I want to think about it , ” she says .
Not because she doubts it , she emphasizes , but because she wants to draw up the perfect response .
Sitting next to Abramson at the Pentagon Papers panel was reporter James Risen .
In the fall of 2004 , Risen had brought a massive scoop to his editors : Beginning in the days after September 11 , he discovered , the Bush administration had authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on foreign calls into the United States without court - approved warrants .
When the Times first approached the White House with the story that fall , Taubman took the lead editorial role , beginning a series of meetings with Bush officials .
General Hayden , the NSA director , took him on a personal tour of the agency ’s headquarters and tried to impress upon him the importance of its secret programs .
Taubman also met personally with then–national - security adviser Condoleezza Rice , a close friend of his for more than twenty years .
Six months before the 2004 election , Taubman had thrown a lavish dinner party for Rice at his house in Washington .
Shortly after Taubman was briefed by the Bush administration , Keller himself met with Rice , Hayden , and others .
“ I think they were shocked they were having to share this with journalists , ” Keller recalls .
But , sitting on a potentially explosive piece of news that could tip the presidential election to John Kerry , Keller was persuaded by the administration ’s counterarguments and decided against publishing Risen ’s revelations .
Asked recently if there was a defining piece of evidence that affected his decision to hold the story then , Keller said no , then took a deep breath and ­added , “ The argument they made was that , even though it may seem obvious to us that they ’re going to try to eavesdrop on terrorists ’ phone calls , the behavior of terrorists suggested that it was n’t obvious to them .
Therefore , publishing the story would change their behavior . ”
In a long , explanatory e-mail he sent me , Keller says the issue of the legality of the NSA program had not been the thrust of the original story — at least , not that he recalls .
“ Perhaps [ the legality of the wiretaps ] should have struck me earlier , perhaps it was clear to the reporters , ” he writes .
“ In its original incarnation , I saw it as essentially a story about the methodology of counter terrorism . ”
In other words , Keller maintains that he did not originally grasp what the reporters considered the essence of their scoop .
The fact that the Times was suffering from a profound lack of institutional confidence also contributed to the decision to hold the story .
On October 25 , 2004 , the Times reported on unsecured munitions left after the invasion of Iraq and was promptly slammed by the Bush administration , which vigorously questioned the story ’s accuracy and scared editors so bad that Abramson worried she was going to be the next Mary Mapes , the producer of the flawed CBS News report on Bush ’s National Guard service .
When a Minnesota TV station broadcast video that proved the munitions story , Keller told a friend , “ Thank God for that . ”
The holding of the NSA story enraged both Risen and Licht­blau , who primarily blamed Taubman .
Risen would not comment for this story , but colleagues say he told them that Taubman lacked the “ balls ” to publish his scoop .
Both Risen and Lichtblau — as well as many other reporters in the Washington bureau — suspected Taubman ’s deference to Hayden and Rice had influenced his decision and thus Keller ’s .
Asked about this , Keller calls it a “ bum rap ” and says it was his own decision to make , not Taubman’s .
“ The idea that he ’s somehow pulling his punches to accommodate sources is just wrong , ” says Keller .
“ I know where that ’s coming from , but the decision not to publish the story early was mine .
There was nobody above the rank of reporter who was arguing that we should publish it . ”
Risen was beyond furious .
A 51 - year - old reporter who could be cranky and uncommunicative , he had clashed with his superiors on major stories before , including the Wen Ho Lee case , which concerned the Chinese scientist accused of stealing nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory ( Keller , then the managing editor , had written an editor ’s note disavowing some of Risen ’s reporting ) .
In addition , Risen harbored lingering resentment of Abramson over the paper ’s WMD coverage .
When she was Washington bureau chief under Raines , Risen has claimed to at least two people , he offered her reporting that cast doubt on the Bush administration ’s evidence about Iraq ’s WMD program .
At the time , Miller ’s reporting was how the Times , as an extension of Raines , saw the subject .
And Abramson felt powerless to fight Raines over this and other things .
When Risen pressed his case , she finally told him to “ get with the program , ” these people say .
Abramson , a known Raines antagonist , declined to comment on that particular encounter , but in an earlier interview described the climate she was working under .
“ I really felt like I had barely been able to do the job , because in the Howell regime , all three of the top editors all thought they knew best about Washington , ” says Abramson , “ and a lot of days , I did n’t necessarily feel like I was really the bureau chief . ”
( Raines , in an e-mail , responds : “ If Jill skewed or suppressed stories from Jim Risen or anyone else she did so on her own hook , not as a result of any instruction or signal from me .
It was a point of tension between Jill and me that we were consistently behind on weapons and intelligence stories . ” )
On the NSA story , Risen called Abramson the weekend before the election , begging her to convince Keller to run it .
Abramson says she “ anguished ” over it , eventually siding with Keller and Taubman .
For Risen , holding the NSA spying story was the final insult .
After the 2004 election , communications between him and Keller ’s two key advisers — Abramson and ­Taubman — effectively disintegrated .
“ There was no working relationship between Risen and Jill , or Risen and Phil , ” says a Times person who knows Risen well .
“ They did n’t engage him . ”
The story , of course , did n’t go away .
The Times could have published it right after the election .
Keller offers a curious explanation for why that did n’t happen , suggesting that the “ normal process was much delayed because the lead reporter on the story went on a book leave , ” as if he had disappeared off the face of the earth .
According to several sources , Risen was convinced that the paper would never publish the story , and he had already signed a lucrative deal with the Free Press for a book that was originally to be about George Tenet and the CIA .
According to one Times person , Risen said he ’d quit if the paper did n’t allow him the leave of absence , and off he went to write his book .
In the summer of 2005 , two months after Risen returned from book leave , Taubman learned from a friend of Risen ’s that he planned on including a chapter in his book about the NSA eavesdropping program .
Both Abramson and Taubman confronted Risen , separately , and asked him point - blank whether he was using the material for his book .
People briefed on those meetings say he was “ evasive ” and “ squirrelly . ”
Privately , the editors believed that Risen , who was n’t able to get Tenet to cooperate because he had his own book deal , was desperate to salvage his book and had used the NSA material to pad it out .
Taubman was livid , telling Risen that it was against Times policy to use material obtained on the newspaper ’s dime for his book without notifying the paper .
In September , shortly after his conversation with Taubman , Risen delivered the manuscript to the Free Press , including a chapter called “ The Program , ” detailing the government ’s secret eavesdropping program and drawn from the original draft of the story Risen had filed to the Times the year before .
The Free Press believed it now owned the material ( and , in a comic twist , offered the Times first - serial rights ) .
As the book ’s publication loomed in the near distance ( the Free Press was cagey about when exactly it would come out ) , Risen went back to work on the story for the Times .
He was now caught between two obligations , but the Times was in an even tougher spot :
If Keller again folded under the weight of White House arguments and held the story , the Times would be humiliated by Risen ’s book .
In a long e-mail about the origins of the spying story , Keller was adamant that the book had not been the “ deciding factor ” in publishing .
The “ conventional wisdom ” that Risen ’s book forced the paper to publish the story , he writes , “ is bullshit . ”
But he also admits , “ I have tried to be careful never to say the Risen book was irrelevant .
I ’ve said it was a factor in reopening the discussion . ”
( In fact , Keller has never said that publicly before . )
According to Keller , the additional reporting in the fall of 2005 improved the story , with more people inside the government questioning the legal basis for the program .
The argument over the iffy legality had grown starker , says Keller , and the fear that the Times might be relying entirely on the word of a partisan ax - grinder ( which , according to sources , was originally the case ) was now assuaged .
As Keller wrote in an e-mail to me this summer , which he also sent to Times public editor Byron Calame , “ We now had some new people who could in no way be characterized as disgruntled bureaucrats or war - on - terror doves saying we should publish .
That was a big deal . ”
Colleagues describe Risen and Lichtblau as vehement that the story okayed in 2005 was not fundamentally different from the one that had been rejected in 2004 .
After his meeting at the White House , Keller sought out the counsel of Joe Lelyveld , whom he had n’t spoken to in months .
They had coffee together on the Upper East Side near Lelyveld ’s apartment .
There , Lelyveld advised Keller to publish but also not to overplay it with a big headline on page one .
On the evening of December 15 , Keller called the White House to inform Bush ’s aides that the NSA story was about to go up on the Times Website and that it would appear in the newspaper the next day .
Two days later , Russell Tice , a former NSA intelligence analyst , requested permission to testify to Congress about his doubts about the legality of the NSA program , prompting speculation that he was a source for the Times .
He has since been subpoenaed by a grand jury seeking to indict whoever leaked the story to the Times .
If the prosecution requires more evidence , it could issue subpoenas to Risen and Lichtblau , prompting another legal war over the protection of sources .
The Times has retained two law firms to prepare for this possibility .
Keller will never be accused of under - thinking a problem .
In one of our many conversations about the NSA story , he offered a highly unusual rationale for why it took fourteen months for the story to find its way into the paper :
“ There was an erosion of the administration ’s credibility , not just with us , but with the public , ” he said , “ as more and more was revealed — including in the Times , by the way — about the use of intelligence in the run-up to the war .
“ As time passed , ” he added , “ they ’ve demonstrated that they ’re entitled to somewhat less benefit of the doubt . ”
The effect on Keller of publishing the NSA story was clear .
A month later , I saw him at a cocktail party — a rare appearance for a man whose wife calls him “ socially ­autistic ” — and needled him about when , in the spirit of transparency , we could expect to be told why the paper had held the NSA story for more than a year before publishing it .
That same month , Calame had been stonewalled by Keller on the issue .
“ We ’re done with transparency for a while , ” Keller told me , with a just - ­perceptible smirk .
Keller now says it surprises him that other stories the paper ran did n’t have the same effect as the NSA story .
He thinks the Times ’ debunking of the Iraqi aluminum tubes , once thought to be proof of a nuclear program , was equally powerful .
“ There were a number of stories where I thought people would say , ‘ Yeah , the New York Times , that ’s right . ’
The NSA happened to be that story , but there were a bunch of things before that I thought would be that story , ” he says .
The power of the New York Times has always been tied to how it covers the biggest story in the land : the White House .
The spying scoop seemed to remind Keller that Washington coverage was where the Times would be historically measured .
But accepting it and liking it are two different things .
The NSA story “ certainly drove home the point that the Washington bureau is the paper ’s megaphone , ” he says .
“ And because Washington is Washington , it tends to be what you ’ll be judged by .
It ’s not necessarily what I ’d want the paper to be judged by . ”
Keller enjoyed a brief alpha moment after the NSA story was published .
“ The story freed Bill Keller to be Bill Keller , ” says Okrent , the former public editor .
The boost to morale at the paper was unquestionable .
Reporter Gardiner Harris voices the sentiment of many in the Washington bureau : “ The yearlong delay was a transitional moment for Bill , ” he says .
“ The delay resulted from his timidity .
I ’m not at all convinced that it was a change in his mind - set that led it to be published . ”
But , he adds , “ once published , it sent him down a path to being more aggressive . ”
But almost as quickly , Keller was attacked again from outside the paper , mostly by the left , for delaying the story and possibly costing Kerry the election .
In January , Keller and Abramson flew to Washington to discuss overhauling the Washington bureau .
They wanted fewer incremental stories on the daily political scrum , more “ high impact ” stories like the NSA scoop .
“ Clearly , the NSA story and the way it lifted the whole paper was a big factor in setting that as a priority , ” says Keller .
The changes were a long time coming .
Late in 2003 , six months into Keller ’s editorship , at least three senior reporters at the paper told Keller they thought the paper ’s coverage of the Bush administration was weak and frightened .
Keller tended to bristle at such criticism .
But Abramson says the Abu Ghraib prison torture story , broken by CBS News and The New Yorker , showed that the Times had fallen behind .
Keller ’s wife says he ’s got a bigger ego than he lets on .
She calls him an “ alpha male in disguise . ”
Keller now admits that the paper ’s Washington bureau had , until late last year , been too “ reactive ” to news , often playing catch - up on big stories broken by others .
Asked if the need for a shake - up was an implicit criticism of his friend Taubman , Keller pauses for a long moment , then declines to answer directly .
“ A number of things , including the NSA story , awakened us to the potential that was n’t being fully realized in the bureau , ” he says .
But enacting change turned out to be harder than Keller had imagined .
Inside the Times , there was a growing consensus that Taubman was too cautious , and Keller himself thought the bureau needed fresh blood .
Just as the NSA story was being revived in the fall of 2005 , Abramson , who had begun to take a larger role in Washington coverage , suggested that 42 - year - old Don Van Natta Jr. , a Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter , be promoted to Taubman ’s deputy , the No. 2 slot , and in November 2005 , Keller offered Van Natta­ that job .
This move was perceived by some as an attempt to undermine Taubman , just as Raines had done to Abramson years ago when he assigned a relatively inexperienced reporter named Patrick Tyler to be her No. 2 . ( “ She ’s got a little bit of Howell in her , ” notes one Times reporter of Abramson . )
But Taubman would not let that happen to him .
A week after Keller offered Van Natta the job , Taubman met with Van Natta and told him there ’d be two deputy positions .
Later , Taubman would propose a three - deputy configuration .
Weighing the diminishing job against a $ 1 million advance he and Jeff Gerth had been offered to co-write a book about Hillary Clinton , Van Natta reversed course and turned down Keller .
The apparent power struggle between Abramson and Taubman — or at least Keller ’s inability to square his ­relationships — had effectively blown up Keller ’s best idea for recharging the D.C. bureau , without removing Taubman .
Keller was ­incensed — at Van ­Natta .
“ Yeah , I was mad that he did n’t take the job , ” says Keller .
“ We were serious about wanting to move the bureau away from incremental coverage to high - impact coverage , and he would be there supporting that , and I guess I took his decision not to take the job as at least in part a lack of trust or a lack of faith in us . ”
The difficulty of navigating the paper through this historic period can hardly be overstated .
The Bush administration has masterfully eroded the press ’s ability to do its job .
Partisan bloggers and radio commentators scrutinize every story for evidence of carrying somebody ’s political water .
For a paper that aspires to objectivity , like the Times , and for an editor who is a true centrist , like Keller , that has made the going very tough .
After the NSA story , Keller allowed the paper to become more aggressive in its coverage of the administration , leading in June to Risen ’s Swift banking story , about the Bush administration ’s efforts to track international financial records .
This time , the backlash was even harsher .
If the White House had simply been infuriated by the first report on a secret program , it went ballistic this time , excoriating the Times and inspiring bloggers and talk - radio hosts to call for Keller ’s head .
One commentator suggested he be gassed .
The vice - president said it was “ disturbing ” that “ the news media take it upon themselves to disclose vital national - security programs . ”
In some ways , the Swift story was a stumble for the Times .
In an effort to unleash another NSA - size story by giving Risen ( now a Pulitzer Prize winner for his NSA story ) room to run , Keller appeared to overplay the paper ’s hand .
After all , this program not only was legal but also had been disclosed in a United Nations report in 2002 and even alluded to by Bush himself in less - specific ways .
If the paper had not framed the story as a blockbuster scoop , it might have avoided some of the backlash .
Keller , though , was uncharacteristically fired up by the effort to tar him .
“ They pissed me off , ” he says .
“ I think the administration is genuinely distressed that we ran the story over their objections .
I think they were embarrassed by it , by the fact that this most secretive of administrations has so much trouble keeping its secrets .
I think they were probably sincere in their anxiety that publicizing this program might jeopardize it .
And , you know , that ’s all fair , but when they stir up a partisan hatefest and impugn your integrity and patriotism , that is , to borrow a word from the White House list of talking points , disgraceful . ”
If Keller had been vague and unsteady in defending the eavesdropping story , he moved decisively to ward off this next wave of attacks from the Bush administration .
He took to the television and the op - ed page and fired back at his critics .
It was n’t necessarily a great performance — he looked hunched and defensive on CBS News ’
Face the Nation — but his critics gave him points for letting his alpha flag fly .
Is Bill Keller “ an editor perfectly matched to the historic moment ” ?
After two weeks of no response , I e-mailed Abramson and she finally wrote back , “ I do think he is very well suited to these times .
He is cerebral and careful , which at a historic moment when The New York Times is under such constant scrutiny and attack , serves the paper extremely well .
He is gutsy .
I ’ve watched him stand up and make the tough — and right — call and then fight for and defend his stand , whether involving stories or issues inside the paper . ”
To fully answer the historical question about Keller , though , means engaging the subject of his relationship with Arthur Sulzberger and the business aspects of the newspaper .
Sulzberger has long wrestled with how the Times can prosper , or even survive , in the fast - changing media environment , and for his troubles , he has been battered in the press ( Ken Auletta last year in The New Yorker , Michael Wolff more recently in Vanity Fair ) as well as savaged in his own newsroom .
His championing of Judy Miller , a figure perhaps more reviled within the Times than even Howell Raines , may have been the final straw .
Now that the paper ’s much - vaunted national circulation strategy has hit a wall , the worry that Sulzberger carries around with him every day is that the Internet is killing his bottom line .
The newspaper ’s Website simply cannot produce enough revenue to sustain a huge news - gathering operation , and that has put Sulzberger on a tireless quest to cut costs and find the big idea that will save the day .
( His investment in the Discovery Channel did n’t do it , nor did the Times ’ semi-hostile takeover of the International Herald Tribune .
His purchase of About .­com has fared better . )
One of Sulzberger ’s big ideas was naming Raines executive editor , and when that came crashing down and he was essentially forced to appoint Keller , Sulzberger made sure to curtail his powers .
“ The person who truly controls the fate of the paper is Arthur Sulzberger , ” says one Times staffer , “ and in that sense no one feels like they ’re in good hands because people feel he ’s an incredible boob . ”
People who know both men say that their relationship remains scarred by Sulzberger ’s initial rejection of Keller and that their interactions still tend to be awkward .
But the public floggings that Sulz­berger has endured over the Miller affair have softened Keller ’s position toward his publisher , leading , says Keller , to “ a greater degree of understanding and candor between the two of us . ”
Keller depends on Sulzberger to protect the paper from Wall Street — but no one can protect Keller from Sulzberger .
Keller meets with him three times a week to discuss business at the paper , a part of the job he loathes .
Pressure on the Times has grown in the last year to add more style and entertainment editorial — from Thursday “ Styles ” to the array of T magazines — while trimming the core news operation .
Some changes have been particularly unpopular internally , like the imminent shrinking of the paper size and the “ strip ads ” that began to appear on section fronts .
Keller concedes they are “ a blight , ” but they are now a fixture .
In the past , Times editors have led revolts against the publisher over newsroom cuts .
Now changes are frequently handed to Keller from the business side with little room for negotiation .
Asked if he has less power than previous editors to resist the business forces at the paper , Keller says , “ Sure , of course , ” adding , however , that “ it has n’t really yet been tested .
I have n’t been asked to do something I feel would seriously impair my ability to put out a great newspaper . ”
He says new economic realities require a less adversarial role with the publisher , and that “ if Abe was running the New York Times today , ” he would find himself “ in the same predicament that I find myself in . ”
For the same reasons , he says , “ Howell may have been the last gasp of the thunderbolt school of editor . ”
Though Keller took over as executive editor to the great relief of the Times ’ old guard , many of these people have begun to privately express frustration with Keller ’s passivity .
Even Lelyveld is said by friends to be critical of Keller ’s job performance .
There is a collective belief that this is precisely the moment for a thunderbolt editor , perhaps even one like the venerated - on - his - passing Rosenthal , who saved the paper in another troubling time by marrying aggressive journalism with a vision for a four - ­section paper to attract lifestyle advertising that could pay for the reporting .
No such vision is apparent now — the newspaper still runs outstanding journalism , but lacks an evident blueprint for the future , or even a leader committed to devising one .
Keller understands the perception and seems committed to changing it , even if it means undergoing something of a personality transplant .
“ I ’ve come to realize , as much as I would like to think of the New York Times as a collective endeavor , at least in the public eye , a lot comes down to me , ” he says .
“ And whether it ’s caution or deliberation or a kind of instinct to avoid snap judgment , whatever that characteristic is in me , I think it may have been brought to the fore or exaggerated a bit by my determination not to be Howell in the early days . ”
It ’s a confession that Keller almost seems to choke on : “ You know , over time , I ’ve come to realize that , whether I like it or not , to some extent , it has to be about me . ”
An optimist might say that if Keller has found his legs , perhaps the newspaper has , too .
There are a few of those out there —
Jack Shafer , media critic for Slate , says , “ I ca n’t think of a better guy than Bill Keller to have at the top of the paper . ”
Investigative reporter David Barstow says , “ Look , when you ’re sailing through a shit storm , it really helps if the captain is steady and strong .
You know , our ship may be leaking , but we ai n’t going to go under on his watch . ”
Where Keller and the paper are heading , though , remains anybody ’s guess .
With the daily financial pressures and arrows pointed his way , the exit is always a temptation .
“ Look , this is not what I went into newspapers to do , ” he says in a long e-mail discussing the business challenges .
“ I ’m a reporter at heart .
I still regard my quality time as the time I spend with reporters and editors , and with stories .
( Every time I send someone off to a new reporting assignment , there ’s a little voice in my head that says , ‘ Take me with you ! ’ ) ”
Concha Gomez , UW faculty member in the mathematics department said the proposal and recent passage of Wisconsin 's gay - marriage amendment led her to look for jobs outside the state .
Voters passed the amendment in the Nov. 7 election , effectively banning same - sex marriage and civil unions .
" Early in the fall I started thinking about how it would feel if the amendment passed , and how likely it would be for my partner and I to feel that we could stay here long - term and grow old and retire , " Gomez said .
Gomez said she and her partner moved to Wisconsin two years ago and added that she would be sending out " feeler " applications to see what kind of response she gets .
According to Gomez , when she accepted a job at UW the math department supported her relationship and assured her that Wisconsin would eventually be able to offer domestic - partner benefits .
" They said the domestic - partner benefits was a big problem in the recruitment , but the university was committed to get full domestic - partner benefits for employees , and that was pretty sincere , " Gomez said .
" Perhaps they were naíve — and so was I . "
Gomez said she will continue working at UW until she finds a job elsewhere , but added California is her destination of choice .
California recognizes domestic - partner benefits , Gomez said , and added the Golden State does not appear to have a marriage amendment similar to the one in Wisconsin on the horizon .
" It is really important to us that we are able to support each other if something were to happen , " Gomez said of her and her partner .
" We are not so much interested in marriage as we are in security and being recognized by our government as a couple . "
However , author of the amendment Rep. Mark Gundrum , R - New Berlin , said he does not know why UW faculty and staff 's sentiments about working at the university have changed since the Nov. 7 election because " nothing has changed . "
Gundrum said faculty and staff leaving the state in reaction to the amendment was not a concern of his while he was writing the amendment .
He added that he does not think UW faculty and staff leaving the state will affect the UW students .
" Maybe the faculty that replace them wo n't be as much of liberal activists , " Gundrum said .
" But other than that , I can't imagine .
I 'm sure they 'll hire replacements that are very qualified . "
UW Interim Dean of Students Lori Berquam noted the amendment impacts unmarried heterosexual couples as well as same - sex couples .
Before the amendment passed by a vast majority , there was hope that domestic - partner benefits could be obtained in Wisconsin , Berquam said .
That hope , according to Berquam , is now gone .
" With the passing of the amendment it 's pretty clear it 's not going to change for a while , " Berquam said .
" It 's pretty clear that if you want to be in a domestic - partner relationship and you need those benefits , or you want those benefits , then obviously you 'll have to go elsewhere to get them . "
UW Provost Patrick Farrell acknowledged the fact that faculty who " held out hope " that domestic - partner benefits would eventually be offered at UW could see the passage of the amendment as a " discouraging message . "
Farrell added that it is possible those faculty have " since taken that message to decide that maybe they do n't see change happening in a timeframe that they are happy with . "

by Nandkumar KamatTHE victory of Ivana Furtado in World under eight chess championship should interest child psychologists , neuroscientists and mathematical philosophers .
She might also be having outstanding mathematical , programming and computing capabilities .
Thanks to her involved and caring parents and the timely and expert coaching by the trainers she got moulded into the world ’s first under eight junior chess champion .
But she has not so far got the press coverage , which a lawn tennis star Sania Mirza once got .
There is always discrimination between games involving muscles and mind .
Chess is a perfect brain game .
It converges mind and consciousness on a single platform - the chessboard .
In creating Chess champions like Ivana both nature and nurture , genes and training are involved .
Chess was probably discovered by the ancient Vedic mathematicians to understand the concept of infinity .
There are mind boggling permutations and combinations .
The Arabs popularised it in the middle east as ‘ Shataranj ’ from where it reached all over the world .
The rules of Chess are simple but the winning strategies are complex .
Computers like the “ deep blue ” built on chess programming theories have come very close to defining winning strategies against the world chess champions .
This proves that the moves of chess have to be coded in our genes .
There are relatively scanty attempts to probe into the minds of the champion chess players - Fischer , Spasky , Karpov , Kasparov and Vishwanathan Anand .
There is no direct connection between a person ’s Intelligent Quotient ( IQ ) and chess playing skills .
Scholars of maths or expert computer programmers do not necessarily turn out to be chess champions .
What must be going on in the mind of Ivana Furtado at such a tender age when she was pitted against players of Poland , Hungary , Bulgaria , Peru , Ukraine and from her own country ?
Her trainers feel that it is her unique concentration skill , the prolonged attention span - which is the hallmark of her success .
But how the brain functions when a child concentrates on a challenging task ?
It is an established fact that children can acquire most of their intelligence up to the age of 12 .
Then they have to struggle .
It is difficult to make a child smarter after 12 .
Ivana picked up Chess at four and half years - perhaps the right age when neurons – the cellular microcomputers in the brain are in their final burst of building a network of connections .
Chess is not merely a brain game .
It is also a game of neurons against neurons .
Obviously neurons with superior dendritic connections and complex networks would win .
For building a superior neuronal network there are three requirements - a happy childhood , the right brain stimulating stimuli and a genetic endowment of excellent genes .
A happy childhood depends on loving , caring and understanding parents .
Children feel emotionally secure when their parents are around .
The personal presence of Ivana ’s parents in Georgia was a clinching factor in raising her confidence level .
Brain stimulation in childhood depends on exposure to a variety of sound , speech , colours , symbols , patterns , textures , tastes - or rather exposure to material , cultural and natural diversity .
Children pick up all types of stimuli to complete in a short duration the evolutionary programming of millions of years of human cognitive development .
Deprivation of these stimuli makes the children mentally stunted .
The neurobiochemical potential of neurons is not realised in such children .
It is not known whether human mathematical and computing abilities are encoded by the genes , yet to be identified .
But with a poor package of genes it is not possible to be a chess champion .
Consciousness is an emergent property of the architecture of the brain .
This architecture is a function of an intricate synaptic interconnections of billions of neurons .
A chess player uses the focused consciousness as a switch to turn on this neuronal supercomputer to analyse the opponent ’s moves , compute the pros and cons of millions of possible moves in real time and prepare a strategy to win the game .
Chess champions like Ivana have powerful neuronal resources .
As she would continue to focus on her game without losing the momentum , the world would probably see the making of a young Chess genius .
There is a lesson for parents dreaming to make their children follow her footsteps .
Normal schooling and education is one part of life .
It does not make anyone intelligent .
The problem solving , decision making , logistical skills are more important .
Unfortunately such skills are rarely taught in our education system from pre-primary to university level .
We are turning out a generation of dumb degree holders .
To this crowd World Chess champion Ivana offers a beautiful example .
Success is possible with focus and concentration , attention and dedication .
Chess is not a game for the faint hearted or lethargic persons .
There is a complex neurochemistry behind it .
All of us are born with billions of neurons .
Till death no human being has been able to use even one per cent of its capacity .
In fact at young age the more you train the neurons more dendritic junctions are formed .
Within just three years of picking up the game and with relatively little exposure to competition - Ivana performed a feat - which shows how best she could utilise her neuronal resources .
A focused person refuses to be narcissistic .
If Ivana speaks less and is not overwhelmed by her achievement it shows how best she has trained her mind - to be stoic .
This is exactly the type of temperament , which makes the world champions .
It is a high time that we understand Chess as a game of mental discipline based on a complex neurochemistry .
The players are merely physical vehicles for the neuronal strategies .
The Buddhist philosophers have not yet commented on the Zen of chess playing .
The neuroscientists have not delved deeper into the minds and the brain chemistry of the chess players .
There may certain secrets waiting for them .
Unfolding of these may give science some useful clues about developing artificial intelligence ( AI ) .
Ivana Furtado would be a showpiece for Goan society for some time but let us not forget that she represents a new generation in Information age with superior neuronal resources .
India is known to be a country where coals are polished and diamonds lose their shine .
May Ivana go on to conquer many more chess championship crowns , without falling into the traps of promotional industry .

FICTION
ABSURDISTAN
By Gary Shteyngart .
Random House , $ 24.95 .
Shteyngart 's scruffy , exuberant second novel , equal parts Gogol and Borat , is immodest on every level - it 's long , crude , manic and has cheap vodka on its breath .
It also happens to be smart , funny and , in the end , extraordinarily rich and moving .
" Absurdistan " introduces Misha Vainberg , the rap- music - obsessed , grossly overweight son of the 1,238th richest man in Russia .
After attending college in the United States , he is now stuck in St. Petersburg , scrambling for an American visa that may never arrive .
Caught between worlds , and mired in his own prejudices and thwarted desires , Vainberg just may be an antihero for our times .
THE COLLECTED STORIES OF AMY HEMPEL
Scribner , $ 27.50 .
A quietly powerful presence in American fiction during the past two decades , Hempel has demonstrated unusual discipline in assembling her urbane , pointillistic and wickedly funny short stories .
Since the publication of her first collection , " Reasons to Live , " in 1985 , only three more slim volumes have appeared - a total of some 15,000 sentences , and nearly every one of them has a crisp , distinctive bite .
These collected stories show the true scale of Hempel 's achievement .
Her compact fictions , populated by smart , neurotic , somewhat damaged narrators , speak grandly to the longings and insecurities in all of us , and in a voice that is bracingly direct and sneakily profound .
THE EMPEROR'S CHILDREN
By Claire Messud .
Alfred A. Knopf , $ 25 .
This superbly intelligent , keenly observed comedy of manners , set amid the glitter of cultural Manhattan in 2001 , also looks unsparingly , though sympathetically , at a privileged class unwittingly poised , in its insularity , for the catastrophe of 9/11 .
Messud gracefully intertwines the stories of three friends , attractive , entitled 30 - ish Brown graduates " torn between Big Ideas and a party " but falling behind in the contest for public rewards and losing the struggle for personal contentment .
The vibrant supporting cast includes a deliciously drawn literary seducer ( " without question , a great man " ) and two ambitious interlopers , teeming with malign energy , whose arrival on the scene propels the action forward .
THE LAY OF THE LAND
By Richard Ford .
Alfred A. Knopf , $ 26.95 .
The third installment , following " The Sportswriter " ( 1986 ) and " Independence Day " ( 1995 ) , in the serial epic of Frank Bascombe - flawed husband , fuddled dad , writer turned real estate agent and voluble first - person narrator .
Once again the action revolves around a holiday .
This time it 's Thanksgiving 2000 : the Florida recount grinds toward its predictable outcome , and Bascombe , now 55 , battles prostate cancer and copes with a strange turn in his second marriage .
The story , which unfolds over three days , is filled with incidents , some of them violent , but as ever the drama is rooted in the interior world of its authentically life - size hero , as he logs long hours on the highways and back roads of New Jersey , taking expansive stock of middle - age defeats and registering the erosions of a brilliantly evoked landscape of suburbs , strip malls and ocean towns .
SPECIAL TOPICS IN CALAMITY PHYSICS
By Marisha Pessl. Viking , $ 25.95 .
The antic ghost of Nabokov hovers over this buoyantly literate first novel , a murder mystery narrated by a teenager enamored of her own precocity but also in thrall to her father , an enigmatic itinerant professor , and to the charismatic female teacher whose death is announced on the first page .
Each of the 36 chapters is titled for a classic ( by authors ranging from Shakespeare to Carlo Emilio Gadda ) , and the plot snakes ingeniously toward a revelation capped by a clever " final exam . "
All this is beguiling , but the most solid pleasures of this book originate in the freshness of Pessl 's voice and in the purity of her storytelling gift .

FALLING THROUGH THE EARTH
A Memoir .
By Danielle Trussoni .
Henry Holt & Company , $ 23 .
This intense , at times searing memoir revisits the author 's rough - and - tumble Wisconsin girlhood , spent on the wrong side of the tracks in the company of her father , a Vietnam vet who began his tour as " a cocksure country boy " but returned " wild and haunted , " unfit for family life and driven to extremes of philandering , alcoholism and violence .
Trussoni mixes these memories with spellbinding versions of the war stories her father reluctantly dredged up and with reflections on her own journey to Vietnam , undertaken in an attempt to recapture , and come to terms with , her father 's experiences as a " tunnel rat " who volunteered for the harrowing duty of scouring underground labyrinths in search of an elusive and deadly enemy .
THE LOOMING TOWER
Al - Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 .
By Lawrence Wright .
Alfred A. Knopf , $ 27.95 .
In the fullest account yet of the events that led to the fateful day , Wright unmasks the secret world of Osama bin Laden and his collaborators and also chronicles the efforts of a handful of American intelligence officers alert to the approaching danger but frustrated , time and again , in their efforts to stop it .
Wright , a staff writer for The New Yorker , builds his heart - stopping narrative through the patient and meticulous accumulation of details and through vivid portraits of Al Qaeda 's leaders .
Most memorably , he tells the story of John O'Neill , the tormented F.B.I. agent who worked frantically to prevent the impending terrorist attack , only to die in the World Trade Center .
MAYFLOWER
A Story of Courage , Community , and War .
By Nathaniel Philbrick .
Viking , $ 29.95 .
This absorbing history of the Plymouth Colony is a model of revisionism .
Philbrick impressively recreates the pilgrims ' dismal 1620 voyage , bringing to life passengers and crew , and then relates the events of the settlement and its first contacts with the native inhabitants of Massachusetts .
Most striking are the parallels he subtly draws with the present , particularly in his account of how Plymouth 's leaders , including Miles Standish , rejected diplomatic overtures toward the Indians , successful though they 'd been , and instead pursued a " dehumanizing " policy of violent aggression that led to the needless bloodshed of King Philip 's War .
THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA
A Natural History of Four Meals .
By Michael Pollan .
The Penguin Press , $ 26.95 .
" When you can eat just about anything nature has to offer , deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety , " Pollan writes in this supple and probing book .
He gracefully navigates within these anxieties as he traces the origins of four meals - from a fast - food dinner to a " hunter - gatherer " feast - and makes us see , with remarkable clarity , exactly how what we eat affects both our bodies and the planet .
Pollan is the perfect tour guide : his prose is incisive and alive , and pointed without being tendentious .
In an uncommonly good year for American food writing , this is a book that stands out .
THE PLACES IN BETWEEN
By Rory Stewart .
Harvest / Harcourt , Paper , $ 14 .
" You are the first tourist in Afghanistan , " Stewart , a young Scotsman , was warned by an Afghan official before commencing the journey recounted in this splendid book .
" It is mid-winter - there are three meters of snow on the high passes , there are wolves , and this is a war .
You will die , I can guarantee . "
Stewart , thankfully , did not die , and his report on his adventures - walking across Afghanistan in January of 2002 , shortly after the fall of the Taliban - belongs with the masterpieces of the travel genre .
Stewart may be foolhardy , but on the page he is a terrific companion : smart , compassionate and human .
His book cracks open a fascinating , blasted world miles away from the newspaper headlines .
Although this process amounts to a litany of legal outrages , its effect is primarily very sad .
Mr. Williamson was an aspiring baseball star whose career was ruined by the time he was 24 .
“ Man , you ’re gonna die in the minors , ” he was once nastily told by his hero , Reggie Jackson .
That was Mr. Williamson ’s closest brush with baseball stardom .

The book provides much evidence of Mr. Williamson ’s mental deterioration .
His behavior becomes wildly erratic .
His substance abuse heightens .
His habits turn increasingly peculiar .
( At one point he refuses to discuss anything unrelated to presidents of the United States . )
Meanwhile Mr. Grisham brings his extensive legal expertise to the job of being dumbfounded by what he describes as the law ’s systematic flouting of Mr. Williamson ’s rights and by the sadistic manipulation of his paranoia .
In the face of such flagrant abuse of a suspect , Mr. Grisham has a hard time keeping sarcasm at bay .
Of the terrible circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Williamson ’s mother , and that he was kept shackled even at her funeral , the author writes : “ Such precautions were obviously needed for a felon who forged a $ 300 check . ”
( At that point the murder charge had not been brought against him . )
Far worse than her son ’s humiliation is that Mr. Williamson ’s mother died thinking that she had proved to the police that her son was home watching videos with her on the night of Debbie Carter ’s murder .
Though her lawyer said he watched her make this statement to a police detective , a video camera apparently failed to record what she said .
No evidence of it surfaced in the legal proceedings that followed .
“ The Innocent Man ” is plural , despite its title .
It is about “ four men , four average white guys from good families , all chewed up and abused by the system and locked away for a combined total of 33 years . ”
This is a lot for a nonfiction narrative to juggle , and this book sometimes strains under the burden of so much grim , frustrating data .
Mr. Grisham ’s report on the construction of an underground , completely daylight - deprived prison provides the most egregious chamber of horrors in a book that is figuratively full of them .
Every now and then “ The Innocent Man ” provides a tangible reminder of Mr. Grisham ’s novels .
Take Barney Ward , Mr. Williamson ’s court - appointed lawyer , who sounds as if he walked right out of Grisham fiction .
This is Mr. Ward ’s first death penalty case .
He is a wildly colorful character .
He is also blind ; and just as the case pivots on forensic evidence that requires visual examination , his assistant leaves him in the lurch .
Mr. Ward ’s relationship with Mr. Williamson is so edgy that Mr. Ward ’s son is poised to tackle the client physically should trouble arise .
If this were fiction , Mr. Ward would triumph .
And he ’d do it in style .
But he neglected to use crucial evidence that could have helped his client .
Mr. Williamson was eventually assigned a different lawyer .
His vindication was bittersweet at best .
The process that finally brought him justice could not bring him peace .

Archaeological dig reveals high - tech medieval instrument .
That 's not junk : this is only the 8th astrolabe quadrant ever found .
Canterbury Archaeological Trust Ltd
When the owners of a restaurant in the historic British city of Canterbury dug the foundations for an extension to their period property , they may have hoped to find an old coin or two .
Instead , they unearthed a rare scientific instrument .
Nestled among shards of pottery in a fourteenth - century rubbish pit , archaeologists watching over the dig spotted an astrolabe quadrant - a complex astronomical calculator for telling the time and calculating latitude .
Such devices are extremely rare — it is only the eighth such instrument ever to be discovered .
And finding it in what was probably a rubbish dump is even more unusual .
The building that houses the restaurant dates back to the sixteenth century , so when work on the extension began in 2005 , Andrew Linklater of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust was assigned to watch over it — just in case .
As the foundations were dug , the builders uncovered the remains of a medieval building .
By the back wall was a pit containing shards of pottery dating to 1375 - 1425 , which Linklater speculates might have been a rubbish pit .
Among the fragments , he picked out a dirty brass plate in the shape of a quarter circle .
Unable to identify the plate , he took it to the British Museum .
" They held their hands up and went ' wow ' , " he recalls .
Experts there identified it as an incredibly rare astrolabe quadrant , and suggested sending it to Elly Dekker , a Dutch independent scholar with expertise in historical astronomical instruments , for full analysis .
Eye on the sky
Dekker 's study is now complete , and she believes that the find dates to around 1388 .
The quadrant has a series of curves and markings engraved on it .
Along one edge of the instrument are two sighting holes , which the user would have lined up with the Sun .
An attached plumb bob ( now missing ) would have hung down vertically , aligning with the engraved calibrations and allowing the user to tell the time of day .
It could also be used to determine the time of sunrise and sunset , or to work out the latitude .
Dekker says that the quadrant is quite recent compared with the few others that are known .
But the Canterbury version can only be used during the day , unlike the other instruments that were designed to line up with the stars as well as the Sun .
It may be that its designers realized it was too difficult to fit so much information onto a small instrument , and so created a simplified , stripped down version .
Brass in pocket
Dekker says the object would have been very expensive in its time , and that it is extremely rare to find such a valuable object buried in the earth - most pieces such as this get passed down through the generations and are eventually rediscovered in someone 's attic or private collection .
" We do n't find instruments of this type in archaeological sites , " she says .

Linklater adds that he is more used to digging up coins or buckles , and is mystified by how the quadrant ended up in the pit .
" It would have been exceptionally highly prized ; it was the peak of the technology of the day , " he says .
" It was the sort of thing you had to have if you wanted to be ahead of everything in science .
But it must have been discarded . "
He speculates that the owner might have been a member of the Church , which was interested in science .
And this person may have been travelling , perhaps even on a pilgrimage .
Astrolabe quadrants were the ' pocket ' version of a more common , circular instrument called an astrolabe .
Back in the fourteenth century , the street where the restaurant stands was lined with inns for pilgrims coming to Canterbury .
The quadrant is being sold by London auctioneers Bonhams on 21 March , and is predicted to net the owners between £ 60,000 ( US $ 118,000 ) and £ 100,000 .
The extension to the restaurant is now complete , and has been named the Quadrant Bar .
Linklater says archaeologists generally frown on the selling of artefacts , as they often then do n't end up in a museum .
But he 's happy just to have discovered it .
" To find something as rare as this is incredibly exciting , " he says .
" It 's certainly the most valuable thing I 've ever found . "

Grassroots Americans of all parties and economic classes rose up out of their political apathy a few months ago and forced President Bush to reverse his administration 's decision to allow a Middle East government to own America 's major ports .
But the push for foreign ownership continues : the next port scheduled to be taken over is Kansas City , Missouri .
Even though public schools stopped teaching geography a couple of decades ago , most Americans ( especially residents of the Show Me state ) are surprised to learn that Kansas City ( where the only waves are " amber waves of grain " ) is a port .
We are also surprised , and shocked , to discover that Mexico will be running its own inspection facility .
The plan , shrouded in secrecy , has been in the works for at least three years , but it is now coming to light because of the diligent use of Missouri 's Sunshine law by concerned citizens .
Joyce Mucci and Francis Semler forced the release of the emails from Kansas City to Mexico , including one admitting that " The space [ in Kansas City ] would need to be designated as Mexican sovereign territory . "
SmartPort spokesmen are now running away from this written admission , blaming " the problems and pressure the media attention has created . "
However , the stubborn sovereignty issue wo n't go away ; the plan does involve setting up Mexican customs officials in downtown Kansas City .
The mechanism for this deal is a " nonprofit " business economic development corporation called Kansas City SmartPort Inc. , whose president is Chris J.F. Gutierrez .
The deal calls for Kansas City to lease the valuable property at 1447 Liberty Street .
As laid out on SmartPort 's website , the plan is to enable cheap - labor products made in Communist China to travel in sealed " containers nonstop from the Far East by way of Mexico , " through " a ships - to - rail terminal at the port of Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico , " then up " the evolving trade corridor " to Kansas City , Missouri , where they would have their first inspection .
A Kansas City SmartPort brochure explains further : " Kansas City offers the opportunity for sealed cargo containers to travel to Mexican port cities with virtually no border delays . "
A key purpose of the project is to take jobs away from U.S. longshoremen in Los Angeles and Long Beach who earn $ 140,000 a year and replace them with Mexican laborers at $ 10,000 a year .
U.S. truck drivers and railroad workers will likewise be replaced by Mexicans .
The port of Lazaro Cardenas on the west coast of southern Mexico is controlled by Hutchison Whampoa , the same giant Hong Kong shipping firm that owns the ports at both ends of the Panama Canal .
The Chinese - made goods will be carried by Kansas City Southern Railway de Mexico directly to Kansas City , where freight will be distributed east and west and on to Canada .
Kansas City Southern was originally just a belt rail around Kansas City but , after buying various Mexican rail companies and tracks , KCS now controls a 2,600 - mile artery from Lazaro Cardenas to Kansas City .
KCS 's president , Michael Haverty , was one of only five U.S. businessmen who met with Presidents Bush and Vicente Fox , along with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , at their Cancun Summit in March .
Mexico was at first expected to pay for the big , expensive machines to conduct high - tech gamma- ray screening for drive - through inspections of containers , but Mexico declined the honor .
SmartPort has applied for a $ 1.5 million grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration ( i.e. , to get the U.S. taxpayers to pay for the machines ) .
The Kansas City city council has already earmarked $ 2.5 million in loans and $ 600,000 in direct aid ( of taxpayers ' money ) to SmartPort , which would build and own the facility and then sublet it to the Mexican government .
The cost could go as high as $ 6 million because Kansas City has an existing lease that runs through 2045 on the same property with the 107 - year - old American Royal , which uses that land for its annual livestock / rodeo / barbecue event .
The last piece in finalizing this project is getting the U.S. State Department to approve the Mexican operation on U.S. soil by signing off on what is called the C - 175 document .
It has already been approved by U.S. Customs .
Meanwhile , NASCO ( North America 's SuperCorridor Coalition ) , another non-profit business organization , has taken on the mission of building an " international , integrated and secure , multi- modal transportation system " from Lazaro Cardenas through Kansas City and up to Winnipeg , Canada .
This will allow Mexican trucks to haul goods along a 12 - lane superhighway through the heartland of the United States .
“ Television is just like making a hole in the wall , ” said Albert Borgmann , a professor of philosophy at the University of Montana who studies technology ’s impact .
“ All kinds of stuff comes in , on the screen , that we would never allow to come in through the door . ”
And quickly .
Though I surf the Web with high - speed Internet access , television , with 150 channels at 40 inches and powerful stereophonic sound , was like white - water rafting .
Light flew out of the set like spray , as I gripped the remote and rode the river from CBS ( 2 ) to PBS ( 13 ) , “ Entertainment Tonight ” to “ The News Hour With Jim Lehrer . ”
Then I shot the rapids through the rest — Marvin Hamlisch ( food tips ) , QVC ( wrap tops , sold out in two colors ) , Queens Public Television ( children praying ) , Spike ( mixed martial - arts fights ) .
And prime time was still around the bend , sluiced by ratings and sheer with rock .
At 8 o’clock , the season finale of “ The Biggest Loser ” ( the diet Oscars ) , “ America ’s Next Top Model ” ( a kind of reverse of a talent show ) and “ CSI : Miami . ”
At 9 , Anna Deavere Smith and bikers against child abuse .
By 10 o’clock , “ CSI : NY . ”
Have I told you that every other show is “ CSI ” ?
The most important , quantifiable effect on a person exposed to television , experts told me , is time shifting .
“ You shift time to the television , ” said Annie Lang , a professor of telecommunications at Indiana University .
“ If you start watching television , there ’s something else you ’re not doing .
Who knows what you were doing before ? ”
Reading , seeing friends , bonding with partners , theater , film , restaurants — toast .
( In an e-mail , Dr. Kubey from Rutgers told me I would begin eating meals in front of the television .
I have .
Over a bowl of spaghetti and a glass of red wine , I watched “ Battlestar Galactica ” until my neighbor complained about the noise — something that I marked proudly as a rite of passage , as he went back upstairs to begin anticipating the worst .
It did bring us closer together . )
Given the popularity of the personal computer , and worry about its use , I asked Ms. Lang if television was still Public Enemy No. 1 as far as studies of how a pervasive presence might become corrosive over time .
“ Historically , we always go after the new technology , ” she said , explaining that the computer is only being demonized in its turn .
“ We always say that it will physically hurt you — it will hurt your eyes .
There was research on whether computers cause miscarriage .
Then the next wave of research is , ‘ Will it hurt children ? ’
Then , ‘ Will it hurt society ? ’
That ’s the pattern of looking into a new technology . ”
Computers and televisions are rapidly merging , though , into what could be a super - adversary ( or friend ) , and screen size is the first frontier of that future , media experts agreed .
For Zarqa Nawaz , a hijab - wearing Muslim woman living in the Canadian prairies , life in the west has always provided certain conundrums .
For example , is a woman obliged to cover herself in the presence of a gay man ?
Now Islam meets sitcom in a new Canadian show called Little Mosque on the Prairie .
The show , the first of its genre to deal with the Muslim experience in North America since the September 11 terror attacks , begins tonight .
" It always struck me as hilarious .
What if that man has no interest in you sexually , does he count ? "
Ms Nawaz , the show 's creator , told the Guardian .
" You normally can't ask those questions out loud in your community because they think it 's too out there , so this series is almost a form of therapy for me . "
Little Mosque 's eight episodes unroll in the Saskatchewan town of Mercy , where life for its Muslim residents is centred on the mosque .
In one episode , an imam warns his followers against the evils of television .
" Desperate Housewives ?
Why should they be desperate when they 're only performing their natural womanly duties ? " he asks .
A young woman in a headscarf whispers to her mother : " Did you tape last night 's episode ? "
Making light of such issues in the aftermath of the 2001 attacks is a source of high anxiety for the show 's producers , operating in the shadow of outrage around the world over a Danish cartoon deemed insulting to Muslims .
But Ms Nawaz , 39 , who was born in Liverpool , raised in Toronto , and moved to Saskatchewan after her marriage , says she is constantly bemused by the issues of living as a Muslim in western society .
Should she allow her children to dress up for Halloween , although it 's a pagan ritual ?
Is it OK to wear a conventional swimming costume to water aerobics if the male instructor is gay ?
In the show , the conflict is resolved by a woman donning a garment described as the " Haz - Mat Islamic swimsuit " , covering her from neck to ankle .
But in a country that saw the disruption of its own homegrown terror cell last year , the upheavals since September 11 , 2001 , are not far from the surface .
The sitcom 's pilot shows a south Asian man in an airport queue talking on a phone to his mother about his decision to give up the law for a job at a mosque in the Canadian prairies .
The decision is not suicide , he says .
No , he is not throwing his life away .
" This is Allah 's plan for me . "
Moments later , a police officer claps his hand on the man 's shoulder .
" Step away from the bags , sir , " he says .
" You 're not going to paradise today . "
Now that that 's out of the way , Ms Nawaz says the series hopes to focus on a life more ordinary .
" The only thing we draw from 9/11 is the paranoia and the misunderstanding and mistrust of Muslims , " she said .
" Comedy comes out of the quirks and foibles of everyday life . "
The red line shows an attempt to follow the straight scent trail
US research had confounded the established belief that people have a poorer sense of smell than animals .
The work , published in the journal Nature Neuroscience , asked people to follow scents on the ground , as a dog would do , and found they were as good .
A UK expert said the findings were " intriguing " and would aid better understanding of the sense .
It is not the second class system that has been the traditional assumption
Dr Peter Brennan , University of Bristol
The researchers from University of California Berkley laid scent trails , including one of chocolate essential oil , in a grassy field , and asked 32 people to find the 10 metre trail and track it to the end .
Those who took part were blindfolded and wore thick gloves and earplugs to force them to rely exclusively on smell .
Two thirds were able to follow the scent .
And while they remained slower than the animals at tracking scents , their performance improved over time .
In other tests , it was found that humans required both nostrils to be working to be able to track scents .
' Highly developed '
Writing in Nature Neuroscience , the researchers led by Dr Noam Sobel showed the human sense of smell was more powerful than previously believed and that , with training , humans might be capable of tasks which had been thought to be the exclusive province of non-human animals .
Dr Peter Brennan , a physiologist at the University of Bristol , said : " It 's certainly an intriguing piece of research .
" It shows that although the sense of smell is less important for humans than it is for many other animals , it is nonetheless a highly developed and sophisticated sensory system .
" It is not the second class system that has been the traditional assumption . "
He added : " There has been previous evidence that scent can elicit orientation and movement towards maternal odours by new - born babies , but this is the first time that adult humans have been shown to follow a scent trail . "
Dr Brennan said the findings could enable specific areas of research into the human sense of smell .
" For example , it would be interesting to study the extent to which blind people make use of their sense of smell for finding their way around their environment . "
This essay is the result of meditations directly linked to the process of writing my book , The Pagan Man .
I 'm not claiming that all Neopagans or very many Mesopagans ( mixed Christian - Pagan believers ) will agree with me , but these are my conclusions rooted in my religious beliefs and polytheological speculations , informed by my research into men's issues in the history of Western culture .
Being a Pagan man means , among many other things , fighting for what one thinks is right and true , even if one belongs to a religious and political minority , so I spend a great deal of my time thinking about political issues and taking what actions I can to support my beliefs , including writing political essays rooted in my religious beliefs .
Let me point out my biases immediately for those of you who are unfamiliar with my writings .
I believe that those who have stolen the term " conservative " as an excuse to glorify greed over generosity , competition over cooperation , individuality over community , exploitation over stewardship , and violence over peace , do not have a " divine right " to rule either America or the rest of the planet , no matter what their scriptures say .
If I wanted to live in a power - mad theocracy , there are several Middle Eastern nations to which I could move ( and where they would quickly kill me ) , so obviously I do n't support the Religious Reich in America any more than I do the jihadists of the Middle East .
To this Neopagan , it 's not moral for some people to be obscenely wealthy while others starve , to use up most of the world 's resources to give a tiny fraction of its population a luxurious life , or to destroy entire ecosystems , and perhaps the Earth 's very ability to sustain life , in order to fatten the secret bank accounts of people who already have more money than they will ever be able to spend .
To anyone who pays attention , it is also clear that those working class and middle class folks who dream of being wealthy someday , and who thus vote to support the policies beloved of multinational corporations and the super - rich , are being bamboozled by clever propaganda -- for 99 % of them will die only slightly better - off than their parents and grandparents , if not worse .
Some relevant ancient history Indo - European myths ( those of the Paleopagan Celts , Germans , Norse , Latins , Greeks , Slavs , etc. ) commonly describe social and cultural conflict between the members of a " clergy " caste / class , who were the intellectuals , artists , judges , priests and priestesses , etc. , and those of the " warrior " caste / class , who defended their tribes and attacked others ( see my essay Indo - European Paleopaganism and its Clergy for an overview , and consult the works of Georges Dumezil and his followers for details on this ) .
As I say in The Pagan Man :
This time period ( from about 2000 BCE to 500 - 1000 CE , depending on what IE territory you are looking at ) is as far back as we can trace the war between the geeks and the jocks that goes on even today .
The results of this conflict varied in different places .
In Ancient Rome , the warriors became more important than the clergy and most of the latter became governmental functionaries or political appointees .
This seems to have gone along with the " historization " of Roman myths , whereby various deities became described as mortals in the stories ( see Archaic Roman Religion , by Dumezil ) .
In the Celtic cultures , the clergy and the warriors seemed to have been in a state of balance ( in that neither side was depicted in the myths as more important than the other ) , at least until the Romans arrived in the first century BCE , which is when we first begin to have detailed knowledge of the Celts .
Julius Caesar knew that the traveling members of the druid classes ( mostly bards , storytellers , and visiting judges ) of Hispania ( what we now know as Spain and Portugal ) had made the Empire 's conquest of their Celtic territory harder , by warning tribes further away from the battle lines of what was to come -- " Do n't trust these Roman guys , they do n't fight fair ! "
Logically enough , when Julius Caesar decided to invade Gaul he also decided to kill every druid he got his hands on , unless they were willing to become " native guides " for him and his army .
Over the next century or so , the Romans slaughtered members of the druidic class ( throughout Gaul and the parts of Britain that they conquered ) by the hundreds and the thousands , wiping out the native intelligentsia before conquering the tribes .
Later , the Roman Church was to wage a centuries - long battle against the Irish and Welsh druids , finally converting , killing , or banishing the last of them by 600 CE or so .
The Romans were n't able to conquer the Germanic tribes , but the job of suppressing the clergy class was done by the Germans themselves .
That is to say , the competition between the clergy and the warrior classes in the Germanic / Norse cultures was " won " by the warriors .
By the early medieval period , Germanic Paleopagan clergy spent most of their time attending to local shrines dedicated to specific deities .
The majority of religious activities were led by the male or female heads of households , or tribal chieftains acting as clergy .
There were skalds ( equivalent to the Celtic bards or poets ) attached to the households of tribal leaders , much as the fili ( poets ) later were in medieval Ireland .
There were some traveling soothsayers / prophets , usually women , called volvas who practiced a form of divination and oracular trance possession called seidh .
This eventually became associated predominantly with women and effeminate men , because the magical techniques usually involved passivity and receptivity rather than assertive magical action .
The Germanic tribes known as the Angles , the Saxons , the Jutes , as well as the Scandinavian Vikings took these attitudes with them when they conquered what became the British Isles .
Magical and spiritual matters ( other than battle magic ) was considered to be of interest only to women and those weak intellectual men the warriors kept in their places as poets or bookkeepers .
Later in The Pagan Man I point out : Among the Norse and Germanic peoples , passive / receptive homosexuality was looked down upon by the warriors , while active partners of such men were given free rein .
It was " unmanly " to be passive and receptive , which is why the seidh system of shamanic divination was considered an unfit occupation for males ( despite the story about Odin being taught seidh by Freyja ) .
Diana Paxson , a leader in the Norse Neopagan community , has these important notes to make in an essay entitled Sex , Status , and Seidh : Homosexuality and Germanic Religion : " Late Norse homophobia seems to be inextricably connected to late Norse misogyny .
Femaleness and Magic were both severely repressed and thrust into the dark , chthonic realm of the unconscious , which therefore became a place of horror and fear .
This represents a major shift from the situation in most Pagan cultures , which recognized and valued chthonic [ underworld ] and liminal [ borderline ] power , and saw in it a necessary balancing aspect of spirituality .
Perhaps the degree to which horror of ' woman 's magic ' is expressed in the Saga period provides a measure of the prestige in which women 's spiritual power was held in earlier times Clearly in a traditional culture the criminality of sexual behavior depends less on the gender of the partners than on their relative social status - their freedom to refuse .
Whether any act ( of sex or magic ) is considered shameful depends on the status of those with whom it is typically associated in that society .
If women are defined by a culture as submissive , and if one considers women inferior , then it becomes shameful for a person of socially superior status ( a male ) to submit sexually . "
Much of this is related to mammalian power and status displays .
The " top dog " is such because he has the power to mate , forcibly if he wishes , with all the other dogs , male and female alike .
The ancient conflict between the warriors and the clergy castes explains more than just why modern Pagan men might be ambivalent about Pagan priesthood and why Germanic / Anglo / Latin cultures are so homophobic .
It also explains why the general American , British , and Latin American public do n't elect many liberals or most women to high office , and why male homophobia towards gay men is qualitatively different than that towards lesbians .
" Effete intellectual snobs " Despite loud claims to the contrary by conservative pundits , most intellectuals are , in fact , political and social liberals .
Liberalism requires long - term thinking , looking at complex solutions to complex problems , and paying attention to group welfare rather than just individual welfare .
These mental skills are all different from warrior - thinking , which is why university environments throughout the Western world are full of liberals , except for the obligatory campus jocks and contrarian intellectuals .
Dualism , the belief that all topics have only two , completely irreconcilable , sides to them , then pushes members of both the liberal and the conservative groups to ever more - extreme positions .
Intellectuals in Germanic / Anglo / Latin cultures are only allowed to be " under " the warriors , never " on top . "
So when a politician talks about the need for a sensitive analysis of complex issues , rather than just hitting The Enemy over the head with clubs , swords , or bombs , he is instantly suspected of not being " tough " enough to lead the warriors -- not just because " tough men do n't think hard " ( as amply demonstrated by George W. Bush ) but because on a very deep subconscious level , the top warrior is the top dog who gets to force the other males and all females to be passive receptacles .
Being led by an intellectual or a woman is an insult to their manhood because it violates the pack order they see as based on implied or overt force .
The few public intellectuals who have ever been elected President of the United States , such as Thomas Jefferson , Franklin Roosevelt , and John F. Kennedy ( all of whom , by an odd coincidence , are seen today as having been " liberals " ) , managed to bury their intellects under tough images , enabling them to be seen as " smart " rather than intellectual .
Being a smart man is considered okay in America and England , because it is associated with becoming wealthy , which is almost as manly as being a warrior ( inheriting wealth is somewhat suspicious , because you do it as a son , who is a dependent , not a ruler ) .
Benjamin Franklin , who started out being seen as a smart man for the inventions that made him wealthy , made the " mistake " of becoming America 's first and most famous scientist , and thus an intellectual .
Even worse , he became a diplomat , the one occupation for which warriors have the most contempt ( because they sometimes prevent wars and thus diminish opportunities for glory ) .
All of this led to him becoming what has been called , " The most famous President of the United States who was never President of the United States . "
When a smart man tricks his way into the White House ( usually by being seen as " a good old boy " ) and accidentally reveals himself to be an intellectual , he becomes the target of rabid political campaigns designed to drive him from office or prevent him from being re-elected , as the United States saw with Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton .
The terror of feminine power
So it now becomes obvious why women find it so hard to be elected to high office in the Anglo / Germanic - Latin cultures .
Women warriors in the ancient Indo - European cultures were objects of both fascination and dread to the male warriors .
When they were seen as both mighty warriors and highly heterosexual , such as the Irish goddess Morrigan or the British one Brigantia , they were revered and even loved , for they still " needed " men sexually even if they did n't need them for protection .
Consider the character of Eowyn in Tolkein 's Lord of the Rings .
During the earlier parts of the story she established her feminine credentials as a nurse for her father Theodin , then spent several chapters mooning after the unattainable but very manly Aragorn .
When she finally rides off to battle with the men ( still being womanly by caretaking the hobbit / child substitute ) , her dramatic action in slaying the worst of the evil warrior - wizards " who could not be slain by a man " is acceptable and the audience bursts into applause .
Afterwards , she is " fixed up with " another brave male warrior who will go back home with her to rule the nation her father bequeathed to her .
Why , by the way , is the King of the Nazgul as malevolent a sub-character as Tolkein could devise ?
Because to warriors , wizards who use magic to " cheat " in battle are contemptible intellectuals , reversing the natural order of things by " topping " the warriors .
This is probably why Gandalf the White , supposedly the greatest living wizard on the side of the Forces of Good , actually does so little magic in the story -- what he does is either harmless entertainment or directed exclusively against magical threats which are unnatural to begin with .
After all , he drove the dragons away with his magical laser beams , why could n't he have driven the giant elephants away ?
( " Because he was wearing a dress ? " asks Phaedra . )
But in contrast to " safe " women warriors , the Amazons of ancient myth were tough warriors who did n't need men at all , either because they were lesbians or because they " used " men for their sperm before killing or driving them away .
Women like them were despised as evil , unnatural monsters who were to be raped and / or killed , not followed into battle .
Hence we see why homophobic men just sneer at " fem " lesbians , actively hate " dykes , " and are often obsessed sexually with bisexual women .
So for women to succeed in politics , they must seen as tough ( but not too tough ) fighters and as emphatically heterosexual mothers and / or subordinate lovers - not equals - of powerful men .
Then , as long as they are willing to be told what to do by the male leaders of the warrior class , they are acceptable and can even be presented as " proof " of how unbiased the warriors are towards women ( think Margaret Thatcher , Indira Ghandi , and Golda Meir ) .
One of the reasons that so many political conservatives are so rabid about Hillary Clinton is precisely because she is " too tough " and is not subordinate enough to her husband .
All of this also relates to the fear and dread that the warrior class has towards the feminist movement , for it threatens to put more women into " unnatural " positions of power over them .
Vive la France ?
But what about the French ?
How did they escape from so much of this hatred of intellectuals and its intertwined homophobia ?
Why are their politics so liberal and their attitudes towards homosexuality so blasé ?
The answer lies in the classes that most intellectuals and warriors forget about except when they want something from them : the producers and the serfs , or as we think of them these days , the " middle and lower classes . "
" Awake ye sons of France to glory , hark , hark , what myriads bid ye rise !
Behold your wives and grandsires hoary , behold their tears and hear their cries .
Shall hateful tyrants mischief breeding , with hireling hosts ( a ruffian band ) , affright and desolate the land , while Peace and Liberty lie bleeding ?
To arms !
To arms , ye bold !
The avenging sword unsheath !
March on , march on , all hearts resolved - - on victory or death ! "
This is one version of what became the French national anthem , " Le Marseillaise , " in the 18th century .
Many different versions of the song were written .
These are the English lyrics I learned as a child and still love ( no , I ca n't sing it in French ) .
Compare it with " The Internationale , " which was to become the rallying cry of union workers and Marxists in the 20th century : " Arise ye prisoners of starvation , arise ye wretched of the earth .
Justice thunders condemnation , there 's a better world in birth .
No more tradition 's chains shall bind us , arise ye slaves , no more in thrall .
The world shall rise on new foundations -- ye have been naught , ye shall be all . "
In 1789 , over 25,000,000 French people were peasants barely surviving in the countryside .
A few thousand members of the clergy and warrior classes lived in opulent luxury , supported by a small middle class of shopkeepers and servants , mostly in the cities .
This was n't all that different , except perhaps in the population extremes , from the situation in much of the rest of Europe .
So what happened ?
There are many , many ways to explain the French Revolution ( a good starting point for research is the Liberty , Equality , Fraternity : Exploring the French Revolution website ) , but here 's an aspect of it that has occurred to me .
For 4,000 years the Indo - European clergy and the warriors were allies , however uncomfortably .
In the 1780s , however , French intellectuals who were just plain tired of the Church 's control of science and philosophy , " betrayed " their religious brothers in the clergy class and made an alliance with the producer and serf classes to overthrow both the Church and the warrior class ( the nobility ) .
They actually succeeded , mostly because of the sheer numbers of warm ( lower class ) bodies they could throw at the warriors .
The intellectuals then proceeded to make a mess of things , mostly because they could n't make the leap from generating fine - sounding theories to leading a nation of ignorant and uneducated people , while trying to keep the warriors who had risen from the lower classes under control .
They even tried to make a Mesopagan version of Roman Paleopaganism the new faith of France !
Eventually , the Church and the warrior class managed to regain much of their former power , aided by the new merchant class , but something remarkable had happened .
Intellectuals had become national heroes and the French people continued to consider artists , poets , scientists , and philosophers as important members of society who should be listened to .
Even more , atheism and agnosticism became respectable attitudes , which considerably weakened the hold of dualism on public thinking .
The ultimate results , as far as this discussion is concerned ?
Intellectuals became social , political , and cultural leaders and " liberal " political , economic , social , and sexual attitudes gradually became the norm .
France defined itself as the " civilized " country and got more than a bit snooty towards other nations and cultures .
That is why , despite the honorable history of French military men ( who won half of the American Revolution for us , after all ) when most Americans and British people think of French men and the French nation , they think of them as " perverts , " who reversed the natural order by letting a bunch of pointy - headed intellectuals boss the warriors around and ruin their protection racket .
Certainly many people have never forgiven the French for making religion subordinate to the needs of the people , or for weakening the memetic power of dualism , so they insist that the French " must be " immoral and degenerate .

If it 's offline when you go there , wait a few days and try again .
For some odd reason , this most subversive of websites tend to get kicked offline a lot )
May the best man win ?
Can you see why a presidential candidate such as John Kerry , who was complex , subtle , slow to decide his positions on things and -- horror of horrors !- who even spoke French , was doomed from the beginning ?
The warrior and merchant classes who rule America , along with their allies in the Religious Reich , have worked hard to promote a dualist , anti-intellectual culture of short - sighted , simplistic thinking .
If the phrase " ruling classes " shocks or offends you , I 'm sorry -- were you one of those people who fantasizes that America has no classes ?
Or that anyone mentioning the existence of classes is " trying to whip up class warfare , " rather than just mentioning the centuries - old class war already going on ?
In any event , our rulers ' memetic efforts , rooted in Christian dualism and Anglo / Germanic homophobia , have successfully created one of the most virulently anti-intellectual cultures in human history .
Being able to associate any other kind of thinking than their own with effeminacy , weakness , and the Forces of Evil is a remarkable accomplishment of memetic engineering in social , political , and religious control , which is why dualism has been so popular with the Christian churches and Islam for so long .
And then , after centuries of dualistic religious , political , and philosophical systems ruling the world , us darned Neopagans have to show up and start promoting complexity , sensuality , and personal religious freedom .
No wonder the members of the Religious Reich hate us so much !
So here 's a Clue - by - Four for the Democratic , Green , and Libertarian Parties in the USA : Start doing some memetic engineering of your own !
Start spreading slogans that praise complexity , the wisdom of thinking before acting , and the equivalence of all fundamentalisms .
Start recalling the heroic images of the early political activists who fought for the working classes and the poor .
Start promoting your candidates as " heroes , " but not as " warriors " in the traditional military sense .
Do n't make the mistake of promoting your liberal or libertarian candidates as warriors , because those voters who identify with the military mindset will always be more loyal to the warrior class and its conservative leaders than to the welfare of the general population as a whole ( hence the " Swiftboat Veterans for Propaganda " ) .
" Renegade " military men who criticize the military -- for anything , ever , but especially if their claims are justified -- are the kiss of death for the veterans ' vote .
If your candidates were born rich , emphasize how they increased the family fortune by successfully competing in the marketplace with tough opponents .
Promote your candidates as " smart " men who know how to use the knowledge and talents of their intellectual subordinates , whom they keep firmly under control .
This wo n't work for female candidates , unfortunately , because American women , like Islamic women must never be seen as " dominating " a room with lots of men in it .
This is why Hillary Clinton is so hated by right - wing extremists in America , and why women in Islamic governments are targets of assassinations .
Above all , fight dualism !
Get your memes into the memepool with mainstream and underground journalists making fun of black - or - white thinking habits .
Those habits are precisely why political mudslinging works : if an opposing candidate can be shown to have anything wrong with him or her at all , then everything about them must be wrong and " their side " must be The Forces of Evil .
Stop letting the media use the phrase , " both sides of the question , " and start insisting on discussing all sides of any given problem instead .
Demand that the cable and internet news political discussion shows have at least three or four political viewpoints represented .
The so - called " culture wars " are actually memewars between two major memeplexes ( dualism and pluralism ) and a host of other , smaller memeplexes , all striving to become the dominant mental species that rules the world 's minds .
This is why Islamic Jihadists and Christian Reconstructionists / Dominionists have more in common with each other than either group has with their mainstream co-religionists , and why those who would save the world from terrorists and fascists alike had best start looking at the memes they unconsciously hold .

Women are marrying later and having fewer children
The report says the current population of about 127m is projected to sink below 90 m by 2055 .
By that date the proportion of the population aged above 65 is set to double to 40.5 % .
Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe pledged to bring in policies that would prevent further falls in birth rates .
Correspondents say the current trend is caused by women marrying later in life and having fewer children .
In 2005 for the first time since World War II the Japanese population declined , the survey by the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research for the ministry of health noted .
Draft budget
Japan already has the highest number of elderly people and the lowest number of young as a percentage of its population .
The imbalance is threatening future economic growth and raising fears over whether the government will be able to fund pensions .
But Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki said : " It 's impossible for the pension system to collapse due to the declining birth rate because we will adjust the amount of money put into it . "
Mr Abe unveiled a draft budget on Wednesday that seeks to increase support for child - care services .

The pretend marriage of Jessica Simpson and the once - famous Nick Lachey has come to an end , with the formal completion of their divorce .
The pair have had their contract - formalised by the payment of cash from Viacom - dissolved .
There had been hopes of a reconciliation , or at least that the pair of them could record a soundtrack for the DVD boxset .
Simpson intends to continue to concentrate on whatever her career was supposed to be this week ;
Lachey 's long - term plans are not known but in the short term will be sniffing boxers to find a pair clean enough to open the door when his extra large Four Seasons is delivered .

WASHINGTON ( CNN -- Donald Rumsfeld is stepping down as defense secretary , President Bush announced Wednesday , a day after voters in the midterm elections expressed dissatisfaction over the handling of the war in Iraq .
Bush said he will nominate former CIA director Bob Gates to head the Pentagon .
CNN's Don Lemon spoke to Pentagon correspondent Jamie McIntyre to gauge to mood at the defense headquarters .
LEMON : Jamie , reaction from there ?
MCINTYRE : Well , Don , I can tell you that this came as a bit of a surprise here at the Pentagon , considering the misdirection that President Bush gave last week when he indicated that he expected Donald Rumsfeld to stay ' til the end of his administration .
The president admitting today that during the last week he had been reconsidering the tenure of Donald Rumsfeld .
And he actually had come to the decision , before yesterday 's election results were clear , that Donald Rumsfeld would be replaced , in his words one way or another , that Bob Gates would replace him , the former CIA director .
Most of the people at the Pentagon found out the news this morning as they came in to work during various briefings and phone calls that took place in the course of the morning .
Donald Rumsfeld always said that he served at the pleasure of President Bush , indicated that he would not be stepping down voluntarily .
But the president said after mutual discussions with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld it was agreed that his replacement would bring a fresh perspective to the Iraq policy .
The president also today conceding that progress in Iraq has not been fast enough and that the message sent by the American people in yesterday 's elections was a clear signal that they expected more results .
The president called it " a thumpin ' " that the Republicans took at the polls yesterday .
And he said now it is incumbent upon him to work with the Democrats to forge a way forward .
A couple of unanswered questions :
We do n't know exactly where Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is at this moment or whether he is still technically the defense secretary until Bob Gates is confirmed .
They have not told us the effective time of his resignation .
LEMON : It seems yesterday the president saying in his news conference that he met with the secretary of defense and decided that he would take his resignation , but no word yet or no sight of Donald Rumsfeld .
MCINTYRE : Usually when these kinds of things happen , the person stays on until the next person is in place .
However , there is a deputy defense secretary that can take over if Rumsfeld steps away .
And they may want to make a clean break .
We 've asked the Pentagon for clarification on those two points .
When exactly did Defense Secretary Rumsfeld stop being Defense Secretary Rumsfeld , and will we hear from him at all today ?
Presumably he is in Washington , but we have n't seen him in the building .
Via Sullivan , this Hugh Hewitt interview with retired Army Colonel Stuart Herrington , which featured this tidbit :
HH : Now an e-mail .
Mr. Hewitt , can you ask the Colonel if we would authorize torture regarding someone who knows of a nuke about to go off in minutes or hours .
SH : Yeah , that ’s the so - called ticking time bomb scenario .
The difficulty with that is that that question poses a hypothetical which in my experience , I never ran into a hypothetical like that .
If you pose the rectitude , or lack thereof , of torture based upon that hypothetical , you ’re not really dealing in the real world .
That ’s my answer to that .
HH : In an era when we ’ve had attempted dirty bomb importation into the United States , and we ’ve had WMD used here , in anthrax , at least , are there some circumstances where at least at a classified lever , people ought to walk through those scenarios , to have the rules laid down in stone , Colonel ?
SH : I ’m sorry , but I did n’t get the thrust of that .
HH : The thrust is , should … I do n’t know whether you want to do it publicly , but should n’t the military be walking through those scenarios , and establishing the guidelines right now , so that they ’re not improvised when and if such hypotheticals occur ?
SH : You mean the interrogation guidelines ?
HH : Yeah .
SH : Yeah , well I think the answer to that is that you know , the type of information you ’re trying to get is obviously situation dependent , and sometimes the situation is more critical than others , but there ’s got to be , and that ’s what ’s going on now , a healthy deliberation , and a laying down of here are the procedures … and this has been done already , here are the procedures that are authorized , here are some more aggressive procedures that are not authorized without the approval of so and so , and here are procedures that you will never do , and so that everyone knows basically what the ground rules are , so there ’s no room for hot doggery , you know ?
I particularly enjoyed how , even after being told the scenario is not in the real world , Hugh pressed on and thought that guidelines should be created for the fantasy ticking time bomb scenario anyway .
That would go a long way to explain our policy decisions the past 5 - 6 years , and I suggest the administration already has a guy who would be perfect for creating guidelines and policies in fantasy situations - Doug Feith .
Herrington did have some suggestions as to what does work :
HH : Is it effective ?
Is water boarding effective ?
SH : Boy , you know what ?
I ca n’t tell you that .
I ’ve never practiced it .
I consider it to be abhorrent , a practice that should n’t be practiced by any professional interrogator , and you ’re going to have to ask someone other than me .
But I , generally speaking , know from experience that when you levy brutality against a person in order to get that person to talk , even if the person has n’t got anything to say , or does n’t know what it is that you want , they ’ll come up with something to say just to get you to quit doing it .
HH : Do you play on fears of family and their safety , not reprisal , but you know , going back to be with them ?
Is that effective ?
SH : You know , the developmental approach involves engaging someone in conversation and evaluating them .
And certainly , I ’ve had cases where family played a big part .
I once had a prisoner in Panama , for example , who was on his second day of captivity , was in tears , and was depressed , and the guards told me they were worried about him .
When I went to see him , it turned out that you know , he ’d been captured for three days , his wife did n’t know if he was dead or alive .
He had an 18 month old child at home , and he was just totally depressed and in a deep funk over it .
I got a cell phone , and we called his wife .
I was his friend for life after that .
If that happened today , the pro-torture Republican party and her blogospheric nitwit enablers would advocate having the man stripped down naked , have menstrual blood smeared on him while chained him to the floor in either an exceptionally hot or exceptionally cold room with blaring music .
When that did n’t work , they would waterboard him .
If the press found out , Donald Rumsfeld would have clucked that he stands all day long at work , so how bad could that really be ?
The reason Hugh and others are so desperate to validate the necessity of torture through the ticking time bomb scenario is that it is the only way to justify it , because torture just is n’t effective for information gaining purposes .
There are other practices that are better , and that do not debase yourself , your country , and terrorize the victim .
In essence , the ticking time bomb scenario is not unlike the old joke ( some are claiming it was Churchill and not Shaw , I do n’t know - I just googled parts of the joke and this is what I came up with .
Wikipedia credits both of them , FYI . ) :
Some years ago , George Bernard Shaw and a middle - aged London socialite engaged in one of the most famous encounters in the battle of the sexes .
Shaw asked the woman if she would sleep with him for a million pounds .
She responded with an enthusiastic “ yes ! ” Then Shaw playfully lowered the offer to one pound and sixpence .
“ Certainly not ! ” the woman huffed , “ what do you think I am ? ”
Shaw smiled and said , “ We ’ve already established that . . . now we ’re haggling about the price . ”
The only way they can justify torture is through the worst - case scenario , and then , once it is validated in their own minds , they can apply the torture procedures downward .
In short , the ticking time bomb advocates are just haggling for a price .
*** Update ***
I have to comment on this , btw :
HH : You ’re not a Steelers fan , are you , Colonel ?
SH : Oh , I have to say I am .
HH : You know , that ’s…it ’s a very sad thing when I find otherwise upright Americans who lack football sense .
SH : But my credibility would be zero if I said no .
HH : No , that ’s true , but it ’s sort of like an accident of birth .
Browns won a Super Bowl , yet , Hugh ?
That is what I thought .
What 's New in Prototype 1.5 ?
January 24 , 2007
Scott Raymond
The latest release of Ruby on Rails , version 1.2 , was announced last week to great fanfare .
But the announcement might have overshadowed news of a simultaneous release : version 1.5 of Prototype , the popular JavaScript library .
Despite the synchronization and developer overlap between the two projects , nothing about Prototype depends on Rails — it 's perfectly suitable for use with any server - side technology .
In fact , Prototype has amassed a huge user base beyond the Rails community — from dozens of Web 2.0 startups to household names like Apple , NBC , and Gucci .
The Prototype library is fairly compact ( about 15 K ) , and decidedly not a kitchen - sink library .
It does n't provide custom widgets or elaborate visual effects .
Instead , it just strives to make JavaScript more pleasant to work with .
In many ways , Prototype acts like the missing standard library for JavaScript — it provides the functionality that arguably ought to be part of the core language .
Despite the minor version number bump , the 1.5 release is a major one .
It 's been over a year since 1.4 was released , and the library has made significant strides in that time , while retaining complete backward compatibility ( with one notable exception , but more on that later ) .
In this article , we 'll look at what 's new , organized into four major areas : Ajax support , String extensions , Array / Enumerable extensions , and DOM access .
For an introduction to some of Prototype 's capabilities , see Prototype : Easing AJAX 's Pain and The Power of Prototype.js .
To get a feel for the breadth of the library , peruse the new , long - awaited API documentation on the new , long - awaited Prototype website .
Or check out my book , Ajax on Rails , which includes an exhaustive reference to Prototype , as well as its companion library script.aculo.us .
The Prototype reference is also available as a PDF : Prototype Quick Reference .
Ajax Support
Prototype is perhaps best known for its top - notch Ajax support .
Of course , Ajax - style interactions can be created without a JavaScript library , but the process can be fairly verbose and error - prone .
Prototype makes
Ajax development more accessible by accounting for the varieties of browser implementations and providing a clear , natural API .
The 1.5 release adds even more power , especially as relates to creating RESTful , HTTP - embracing requests .
Prototype now has the ability to easily access HTTP request and response headers and simulate HTTP methods other than GET and POST by tunneling those requests over POST .
Specifically :
Query parameters can now be provided as an object - literal to the parameters option on any Ajax method .
The object is converted into a URL - encoded string .
For example : // Requests / search?q=ajax%20tutorials
new Ajax .
Request ( '/ search ' , { parameters : { q : 'ajax tutorials ' } } ) ;
Like query parameters , request headers can also be provided as an object - literal to the requestHeaders option .
For example : new Ajax .
Request ( '/ search ' , { requestHeaders : { X - Custom - Header :' value1 ' } } ) ;
All requests now include an Accept header , which informs the server of the preferred response format .
The default ( text / javascript , text / html , application / xml , text / xml , */* ) can be overridden using the requestHeaders option .
For example : new Ajax .
Request ( '/ data ' , { requestHeaders : { Accept : ' text / plain ' } } ) ;
The contentType option sets the Content - Type request header , which defaults to application / x - www - form - urlencoded .
An encoding option can also be specified , which defaults to UTF - 8 .
For example : var myXML = " < ?xml version = ' 1.0 ' encoding='utf - 8 ' ?>
<rss version= ' 2.0 '>...</rss > "
new Ajax .
Request ('/ feeds ' , { postBody : myXML , contentType :'application/rss+xml ' , encoding : ' UTF - 8 ' } ) ;
The standard XMLHttpRequest object at the heart of Ajax functionality only allows HTTP GET and POST methods , but RESTfully - designed web applications often call for the lesser - used methods , like PUT and DELETE .
Until browsers support the full range of HTTP methods , Prototype offers a compromise : " tunneling " those methods over POST , by including a _method query parameter with the request .
You can now specify the intended HTTP method with the method option on all Ajax functions ( the default is POST ) .
Methods other than GET or POST will actually be requested with POST , but will have a _method query parameter appended to the request URL .
For example : // Creates a POST request to / feeds/1.rss?_method=PUT
new Ajax .
Request ('/ feeds/1.rss ' , { method : ' put ' , postBody : myXML , contentType :'application/rss+xml ' } ) ;
Of course , the server side of the application must be written to understand this convention as well , but if you use Rails , you 'll get the behavior for free .
String Extensions
In a typical web application , a great deal of code is written to simply manipulate strings .
Thus , a thorough set of string - processing methods are an invaluable weapon in the web developer 's arsenal .
With version 1.5 , Prototype 's suite of extensions to the standard String class ( or more accurately , the String prototype ) has roughly doubled .
Here are the latest additions .
strip ( ) removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string .
For example : " foo " .strip ( ) ; // => " foo "
gsub( pattern , replacement ) returns the result of replacing all occurrences of pattern ( either a string or regular expression ) with replacement , which can be a string , a function , or a Template string ( see the Template class below ) .
If replacement is a function , it 's passed an array of matches .
Index zero of the array contains the entire match ; subsequent indexes correspond to parenthesized groups in the pattern .
For example : " In all things will I obey " . gsub ( " all " , " ALL " ) ; // =>
" In ALL things will I obey "
" In all things will I obey " . gsub ( /[ aeiou ] / i , " _ " ) ; // =>
" _n _ll th_ngs w_ll _ _b_y "
" In all things will I obey " . gsub ( /[ aeiou ] / i , function ( x ) { return x [ 0 ] .toUpperCase ( ) ; } ) ; // =>
" In All thIngs wIll I ObEy "
' Sam Stephenson'.gsub ( /( \w+ ) ( \w+ ) / , '# {2} , # {1} ' ) ; // =>
" Stephenson , Sam "
sub ( pattern , replacement [ , count ] ) is identical to gsub ( ) , but takes an optional third argument specifying the number of matches that will be replaced , defaulting to one .
For example : " In all things will I obey " . sub ( /[ aeiou ] / i , " _ " ) ; // =>
" _n all things will I obey "
" In all things will I obey " .gsub ( /[ aeiou ] / i , " _ " , 3 ) ; // => " _n _ll th_ngs will I obey "
' Sam Stephenson'.sub ( /( \w+ ) ( \w+ ) / , '# {2} , # {1} ' ) ; // =>
" Stephenson , Sam "
scan( pattern , iterator ) finds all occurrences of pattern and passes each to the function iterator .
For example : // Logs each vowel to the console
" Prototype " . scan ( /[ aeiou ] / , function ( match ) { console.log ( match ) ; } )
truncate ( [ length [ , truncation ] ] ) trims the string length characters ( default is 30 ) and appends the string truncation , if needed ( default is " ... " ) .
For example : " Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought " .
truncate ( ) ; // =>
" Four score and seven years ... "
" Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought " .
truncate ( 20 ) ; // =>
" Four score and se ... "
" Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought " .
truncate ( 30 , ' ( read more ) ' ) ; // =>
" Four score and sev ( read more ) "
capitalize ( ) returns a string with the first character in uppercase .
For example : " prototype" .capitalize ( ) ; // => " Prototype "
dasherize ( ) replaces underscores with dashes .
For example : " hello_world " .dasherize ( ) ; // => " hello- world "
" Hello_World " .dasherize ( ) ; // =>
" Hello - World "
underscore ( ) replaces " : : " s with " / " s , converts CamelCase to camel_case , replaces dashes with underscores , and shifts everything to lowercase .
For example : " Foo : :Bar".underscore ( ) ; // => " foo /bar "
" borderBottomWidth".underscore ( ) ; // => " border_bottom_width "
succ ( ) returns the " next " string , allowing for String ranges .
For example : " abcd" .succ ( ) ; // => " abce "
$ R( 'a ' , 'd ' ) . map( function ( char ) { return char ; } ) ; // => [ 'a ' , 'b ' , 'c ' , 'd ' ]
In addition to Prototype 's new extensions to the String prototype , it also defines an entirely new class for string manipulation : Template , which provides simple templating functionality with JavaScript strings .
Using the Template class is simple : just instantiate a new template with the constructor , and then call evaluate on the instance , providing the data to be interpolated .
For example :
var row = new Template ( '< tr >< td > # {name} </td><td>#{age}</td></tr >' ) ;
To render a template , call evaluate on it , passing an object containing the needed data .
For example :
var person = { name : ' Sam ' , age : 21 } ;
row.evaluate( person ) ; // => '< tr >< td > Sam</td>< td>21</td></tr>'
row.evaluate( {} ) ) ; // => '< tr >< td></td>< td></td></tr>'
The default template syntax mimics Ruby 's style of variable interpolation ( e.g. , # {age} ) .
To override this behavior , provide a regular expression as the second argument to the constructor .
For example :
// Using a custom pattern mimicking PHP syntax
Template .
PhpPattern = /( ^|. |\r|
)(<\?=\s*\$(.*? ) \s*\? >)/ ;
var row = new Template ( '< tr > < td ><?=
$ name ?></td><td><?= $ age ?></td></tr>' , Template .
PhpPattern ) ;
row.evaluate ( { name : ' Sam ' , age : 21 } ) ; // " < tr >< td > Sam < / td >< td>21</td></tr > "
Templates are especially powerful in combination with Prototype 's capability to insert content into the DOM .
For example :
// < table id =" people " border = " 1 " ></ table >
var row = new Template ( '< tr >< td > # {name} </td><td>#{age}</td></tr >' ) ;
var people = [ {name : ' Sam ' , age : 21} , {name : ' Marcel ' , age : 27} ] ;
people.each( function( person ) {
new Insertion . Bottom ( ' people ' , row.evaluate ( person ) ) ;
} ) ;
Array and Enumerable Extensions
The String prototype is n't the only language - native object that Prototype enhances .
It also extends JavaScript 's Array prototype with over a dozen methods , including four in the latest release .
size ( ) returns the number of elements in the array .
For example : [ 1,2,3].size ( ) ; // => 3
clone ( ) returns a clone of the array .
For example : var a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ;
var b = a ;
b.reverse( ) ;
a ; // => [ 3 , 2 , 1 ]
var a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ;
var b = a.clone ( ) ;
b.reverse( ) ;
a ; // => [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
reduce ( ) returns the array untouched if it has more than one element .
If it only has one element , reduce ( ) returns the element .
For example : [ 1 , 2].reduce ( ) ; // [ 1 , 2 ]
[ 1].reduce ( ) ; // 1
[ ].reduce ( ) ; // undefined
uniq ( ) returns a new array with duplicates removed .
For example : [ 1 , 3 , 3].uniq ( ) ; // => [ 1 , 3 ]
Although not technically an extension to the Array prototype , the new method $ w( str ) creates arrays from strings , like Ruby 's %w method .
For example : $ w ( " foo bar baz " ) ; // => [ " foo " , " bar " , " baz " ]
In addition to the extensions directly to Array , Prototype also provides an object called Enumerable , inspired by the Ruby module of the same name .
The methods defined in Enumerable are added to several type of collections , including Array , Hash , and ObjectRange .
As with Ruby 's Enumerable , it 's possible to " mix - in " Prototype 's Enumerable methods into your own custom classes as well .
There are a handful of new features added in the 1.5 release :
eachSlice ( number [ , iterator ] ) groups the members into arrays of size number ( or less , if number does not divide the collection evenly . )
If iterator is provided , it 's called for each group , and the result is collected and returned .
$ R( 1,6).eachSlice(3 ) // => [ [ 1,2,3 ] , [ 4,5,6 ] ]
$ R(1,6).eachSlice ( 4 ) // => [ [ 1,2,3,4 ] , [ 5,6 ] ]
$ R( 1,6) .eachSlice ( 3 , function ( g ) { return g.reverse ( ) ; } ) // => [ [ 3,2,1 ] , [ 6,5,4 ] ]
inGroupsOf ( number [ , fillWith ] ) groups the members into arrays of size number ( padding any remainder slots with null or the string fill With ) .
[ 1,2,3,4,5,6].inGroupsOf(3 ) ; // => [ [ 1,2,3 ] , [ 4,5,6 ] ]
$ R(1,6) .inGroupsOf( 4 ) ; // => [ [ 1,2,3,4 ] , [ 5,6 , null , null ] ]
$ R( 1,6 ) .inGroupsOf ( 4 , 'x ' ) // => [ [ 1,2,3,4 ] , [ 5,6 , " x " , " x " ] ]
size ( ) returns the number of elements in the collection .
$ R( 1,5 ) .size ( ) ; // => 5
each ( ) now returns the collection to allow for method chaining .
$ R( 1,3).each ( alert ) .collect ( function (n ) { return n+1 ; } ) ; // => [ 2,3,4 ]
DOM Access
The area that has gotten the most attention in the 1.5 release is Prototype 's DOM access and manipulation methods .
First , a new Selector class has been added for matching elements by CSS selector tokens .
The new $ $ ( ) function provides easy access to the feature , returning DOM elements that match simple CSS selector strings .
For example :
// Find all < img > elements inside < p > elements with class " summary " , all inside the < div > with id " page " .
Hide each matched < img > tag :
$ $ ( ' div#page p.summary img' ) .each( Element.hide )
// Supports attribute selectors :
$ $ ( ' form#foo input[type=text ] ' ) .each ( function ( input ) {
input.setStyle( {color : ' red'} ) ;
} ) ;
Support Insertion .
Before and Insertion .
After for < tr > elements in IE .
Add Element.extend , which mixes Element methods into a single HTML element .
This means you can now write $ ( ' foo ' ) .
show ( ) instead of Element .
show ( ' foo ' ) . $ ( ) , $ $ ( ) and document.getElementsByClassName( ) automatically call Element . extend on any returned elements .
Plus , all destructive Element methods ( i.e. , those methods that change the element rather than return some value ) now return the element itself — meaning that Element methods can be chained together .
For example :
$ ( " sidebar " ) .addClassName ( " selected " ) . show ( ) ;
The 1.5 release brought a ton of new methods to Element .
Methods :
replace ( html ) is a cross - browser implementation of the outerHTML property ; replaces the entire element ( including its start and end tags ) with html .
For example : $ ( ' target ' ) .replace ( '< p> Hello </p >' ) ;
toggleClassName( className ) adds or removes the class className to / from the element .
For example : $ ( ' target ').toggleClassName( 'active ' ) ;
getWidth ( ) returns the width of the element in pixels .
For example : $ ( ' target ' ) .getWidth ( ) ;
getElementsByClassName( className ) returns an array of all descendants of the element that have the class className .
For example : $ ( ' target ') .getElementsByClassName(' foo ' ) ;
getElementsBySelector ( expression1 [ , expression2 [... ] ) returns an array of all descendants of the element that match any of the given CSS selector expressions .
For example : $ ( ' target ').getElementsBySelector('.foo ' ) ;
$ ( ' target ').getElementsBySelector('li.foo ' , ' p.bar ' ) ;
childOf( ancestor ) returns true when the element is a child of ancestor .
For example : $ ( ' target ' ) .childOf ( $ ( ' bar ' ) ) ; // => false
inspect ( ) returns a string representation of the element useful for debugging , including its name , id , and classes .
For example : $ ( ' target ' ) .inspect ( ) ; // => ' < div id =" target " >'
ancestors ( ) , descendants ( ) , previousSiblings ( ) , nextSiblings ( ) , and siblings ( ) return arrays of related elements .
For example : $ ( ' target ').ancestors ( ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) .descendants ( ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) .previousSiblings ( ) ;
$ ( ' target ').nextSiblings ( ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) .siblings ( ) ;
immediateDescendants ( ) returns an array of the element 's child nodes without text nodes .
For example : $ ( ' target ').immediateDescendants ( ) ;
up ( [ expression [ , index ] ] ) returns the first ancestor of the element that optionally matches the CSS selector expression .
If index is given , it returns the nth matching element .
$ ( ' target ' ) .up ( ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) . up ( 1 ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) .up ( ' li ' ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) .up ( ' li ' , 1 ) ;
down ( [ expression [ , index ] ] ) returns the first child of the element that optionally matches the CSS selector expression .
If index is given , it returns the nth matching element .
$ ( ' target ' ) .down ( ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) .down ( 1 ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) . down ( ' li ' ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) .
down ( ' li ' , 1 ) ;
previous ( [ expression [ , index ] ] ) returns the previous sibling of the element that optionally matches the CSS selector expression .
If index is given , it returns the nth matching element .
$ ( ' target ' ) .previous ( ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) . previous ( 1 ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) . previous ( ' li ' ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) .
previous ( ' li ' , 1 ) ;
next ( [ expression [ , index ] ] ) returns the next sibling of the element that optionally matches the CSS selector expression .
If index is given , it returns the nth matching element .
$ ( ' target ' ) . next ( ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) . next ( 1 ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) . next ( ' li ' ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) . next ( ' li ' , 1 ) ;
match ( selector ) takes a single CSS selector expression ( or Selector instance ) and returns true if it matches the element .
For example : $ ( ' target ' ) .match ( 'div ' ) ; // => true
readAttribute ( name ) returns the value of the element 's attribute named name .
Useful in conjunction with Enumerable .
invoke for extracting the values of a custom attribute from a collection of elements .
For example : // < div id =" widgets " >
// < div class=" widget " widget_id= " 7 " >...</div>
// < div class=" widget " widget_id= " 8 " >...</div>
// < div class=" widget " widget_id= " 9 " >...</div>
// </div > $ $ ( 'div.widget ').invoke('readAttribute ' , ' widget_id ' ) // [ " 7 " , " 8 " , " 9 " ]
update ( html ) replaces the innerHTML property of the element with html .
If html contains < script > blocks , they will not be included , but they will be evaluated .
As of version 1.5 , update ( ) works with table - related elements and can take a nonstring parameter , or none at all .
For example : $ ( ' target ' ) .update ( ' Hello ' ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) .update ( ) // clears the element
$ ( ' target ' ) .update ( 123 ) // set element content to ' 123 '
hasAttribute ( attribute ) returns whether the element has an attribute named attribute .
Despite being a standard DOM method , not all browsers implement this method , so Prototype spans the gap .
For example : $ ( ' target ' ) .
hasAttribute ( ' href ' ) ;
While the members of Element .
Methods are added to every element , form - related elements also get the methods defined in Form .
Methods and Form .
Element .
Methods .
Two new such methods were added to Form .
Element .
Methods in Prototype 1.5 : enable ( ) and disable ( ) , which make the element editable or locked .
For example : $ ( ' target ' ) .enable ( ) ;
$ ( ' target ' ) .disable ( ) ;
Backward compatibility change : toggle ( ) , show ( ) , and hide ( ) , as well as Field.clear ( ) and Field.present ( ) , no longer take an arbitrary number of arguments .
Before upgrading to Prototype 1.5 , check your code for instances like this : Element.toggle ( ' page ' , ' sidebar ' , ' content ' ) //
Old way ; wo n't work in 1.5
[ ' page ' , ' sidebar ' , ' content '].each( Element.toggle ) // New way ; 1.5 - compatible Element.show ( ' page ' , ' sidebar ' , ' content ' ) //
Old way ; wo n't work in 1.5
[ ' page ' , ' sidebar ' , ' content '].each( Element.show ) // New way ; 1.5 - compatible Element.hide ( ' page ' , ' sidebar ' , ' content ' ) //
Old way ; wo n't work in 1.5
[ ' page ' , ' sidebar ' , ' content '].each( Element.hide ) //
New way ; 1.5 - compatible
... And More !
Object.clone ( object ) returns a shallow clone of object , such that the properties of object that are themselves objects are not cloned .
For example : original = {name : " Sam " , age : " 21 " , car : {make : " Honda " }} ;
copy = Object.clone( original ) ;
copy.name = " Marcel " ;
copy.car.make = " Toyota " ;
original.name ; // " Sam "
original.car.make ; // " Toyota "
Object.keys ( object ) returns an array of the names of object 's properties and methods .
For example : Object.keys ( {foo :' bar'} ) ; // => [ " foo " ]
Object.values ( object ) returns an array of the values of object 's properties and methods .
For example : Object.values ( {foo :' bar'} ) ; // => [ " bar " ]
Instances of PeriodicalExecutor have a new method , stop ( ) , which will stop performing the periodical tasks .
After stopping , the object will call the callback given in the onComplete option , if any .
Function.prototype.bindAsEventListener( ) now takes an arbitrary number of arguments .
Any additional arguments after the first ( an object ) will be passed through as arguments to the function .
The Prototype developers maintain a suite of unit tests alongside the library itself , verifying that the code works — and keeps working — across a range of browsers .
The test coverage in this release has skyrocketed , with an incredible 20 - fold increase in the number of assertions .
The testing infrastructure has matured remarkably as well : with one shell command ( rake test , which requires Ruby and the Rake library ) , Prototype 's tests are automatically run in every browser found on your system , and the results are displayed .
You take advantage of the same infrastructure to test your own JavaScript , thanks to unittest.js , part of the script.aculo.us library .
The status of the JavaScript test run can even be automatically integrated with the other unit tests in your system .
If you are building a JavaScript - heavy web application , that safety net can be a life - saver ( or more likely , a job - saver . )
In addition to all of the new features described above , this release includes 68 bug fixes , cross- platform compatibility enhancements and performance improvements .
And over 60 contributors were acknowledged — all of whom deserve credit for making this release such a remarkable one .
In this article , we 've looked at all of the significant additions in Prototype 1.5 .
It 's a wealth of new features , but it scarcely compares to the full breadth of Prototype 's functionality .
With just a few exceptions , all of the method descriptions and examples in this guide were drawn from my Prototype Quick Reference , which covers the entire library in just as much detail .
The same content is available in print as part of my book , Ajax on Rails .
Habeas Corpus and the Tyranny Gap JB Several people have asked about Chief Justice Marshall 's statement in the 1807 case of Ex Parte Bollman that the right of habeas corpus depends on statute even though it should be interpreted according to the common law : " for the meaning of the term habeas corpus , resort may unquestionably be had to the common law ; but the power to award the writ by any of the courts of the United States , must be given by written law . "
8 U.S. 75 , 94-95 .
Does n't this prove that the Constitution secures no right to habeas corpus , and that habeas corpus is purely a creature of statute ?
If so , was n't Attorney General Gonzales technically correct that there is no constitutional right to habeas ?
The answer is no .
Let me first point out that in the current litigation over the Military Commissions Act of 2006 ( MCA ) the Bush Administration is not taking Gonzales ' position .
It is arguing that either the MCA withdraws rights that fall outside of the minimum constitutional requirements of habeas corpus or that the remedy the MCA offers is an adequate substitute for habeas .
Let me repeat : even Gonzales 's own Justice Department is not making as radical a claim as he apparently made before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The arguments in this case start with the assumption that there is a constitutional core of habeas that Congress may not rescind without falling afoul of the Constitution , even if federal habeas jurisdiction is provided by statute .
The dispute in the MCA litigation is the scope of that constitutional core .
How do we know that there is such a constitutional core ?
The drafters of the 1787 Constitution chose language that preserved the common law right of habeas corpus rather than specifically fashioning a new constitutional right .
As a result , the 1787 Constitution left in place the common law right of habeas and restricted Congress 's ability to suspend it .
And , as we shall see , there are structural reasons why , when elements of sovereignty were transferred from the states to a new federal union , the principle of non-suspension meant that habeas corpus had to apply to a new series of situations .
To understand Chief Justice Marshall 's remark in Ex Parte Bollman , we must remember that the 1787 Constitution does not , on its face , require that there be any federal courts except for the Supreme Court .
Congress soon created such courts , and created jurisdictional statutes which , among other things , gave these courts the right to hear writs of habeas corpus .
However , if Congress had not created any lower federal courts , there would still be a common law right of habeas corpus available in state courts .
Imagine that the governor of a state imprisoned a political opponent by declaring him an enemy of the state .
This , of course , is the paradigm case for why the English common law created habeas -- to limit the King 's ability to imprison people outside of the rule of law .
In this case , the common law courts would be able to issue writs of habeas corpus to the governor .
Now imagine , after the ratification of the 1787 Constitution , that the President of the United States declares some one an enemy of the state and throws him in jail .
Suppose further that there are no federal courts except the Supreme Court .
Presumably either the Supreme Court would have the authority to issue a common law writ of habeas under its original jurisdiction ( But cf. Marbury v. Madison ) or , more likely , state courts could issue such a writ , with appellate review by the U.S. Supreme Court .
But could the state courts do this , you may wonder ?
How could they have jurisdiction to compel the President to do anything ?
Recall that people were very concerned that the new federal government would destroy the liberties of the citizenry .
It is unthinkable that the ratifiers would have allowed the new President to be free from the writ of habeas corpus when even the King of England , George III , was limited by that writ .
Thus , if there had been no federal courts , the states would retain not only the right to restrain their own officials , but also the officials of the new federal government for violations of law , subject always to review by the Supreme Court of the United States .
As it turned out , Congress created federal courts almost immediately , and gave them the power , by statute , to issue writs of habeas corpus .
In this sense Marshall 's statement in Ex Parte Bollman is technically correct that the power of * federal * courts to issue writs comes from statute , and not directly from the Constitution .
But it does not follow that the power of * state * courts to issue writs of habeas corpus comes only from statute .
Moreover , it does not follow that Congress may limit the power of federal courts to issue writs of habeas corpus without running afoul of the Suspension Clause .
Here 's why :
First , the Supreme Court later held in Tarble 's Case , 80 U.S. 397 ( 1872 ) , that state courts do not generally have the power to issue writs of habeas corpus to federal officials acting under claim of or color of federal authority .
Justice Field argued that otherwise , no federal decision or action could be final unless it received the consent of all the courts in all of the states .
Given that in 1872 , the country was still in the middle of Reconstruction , with federal officials despised in the newly conquered South , Field 's reasoning made a lot of sense .
If state courts in South Carolina and Georgia could repeatedly haul federal officials into court on writs of habeas , federal enforcement of law in the South would come to a standstill .
Some people think Tarble 's case is wrongly decided -- an aberration caused by the features of the Reconstruction period .
It also makes sense only if you assume that there had to be lower federal courts ; but for the moment , let 's assume that it is correct .
If Tarble 's Case is correct , it would mean that Congress was constitutionally * obligated * to vest habeas jurisdiction in the federal courts to the extent that common law state courts collectively enjoyed in 1789 .
Why ?
Because otherwise the Suspension Clause would be completely undermined .
The President would be able to do what the King of England could not do : throw people in jail under claim of executive authority without any right of judicial redress .
The President could easily become a tyrant -- precisely the thing that the framers and ratifiers of the 1787 Constitution feared .
It is simply unthinkable that the people who ratified the 1787 Constitution would have agreed to a President who could do what even George III could not do .
So if Tarble 's case is correct , then Congress has a constitutional obligation to create statutory jurisdiction for habeas in the federal courts .
Second , even if Tarble 's case is incorrect and state courts can issue habeas orders to federal officials , there might be other reasons why the Constitution required Congress to create federal habeas jurisdiction .
In Ex Parte Bollman itself , Marshall noted that
It may be worthy of remark , that this act was passed by the first congress of the United States , sitting under a constitution which had declared ' that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should not be suspended , unless when , in cases of rebellion or invasion , the public safety might require it . '
Acting under the immediate influence of this injunction , they must have felt , with peculiar force , the obligation of providing efficient means by which this great constitutional privilege should receive life and activity ; for if the means be not in existence , the privilege itself would be lost , although no law for its suspension should be enacted .
Under the impression of this obligation , they give , to all the courts , the power of awarding writs of habeas corpus .
Why would Congress feel an obligation to create federal habeas if state courts could issue writs of habeas corpus against federal officials ?
Assume that Tarble 's case is wrong and that state courts could issue these writs .
The 1787 Constitution created a new federal government with new powers superimposed over the old state governments , and claimed some of their powers -- particularly in the areas of foreign affairs , maritime regulation , and the creation and maintenance of federal territories .
These new powers , and the creation of a new government to exercise them , created new classes of cases -- and new possibilities for executive abuse -- where habeas might be needed .
For example , the President might have arrested a person in the federal territories ( not controlled by any state ) or on the high seas ; or , as the English Kings sometimes did , dragged their political opponents outside the borders of the country to attempt to escape the jurisdiction of the English courts .
Moreover , the Constitution authorized the creation of new federal crimes , including treason against the United States , which was the subject of Ex Parte Bollman itself .
For some or all of these new situations , Congress might want to vest jurisdiction to test the legality of federal actions solely in the federal courts .
Moreover , now that these new situations and new powers existed , there was a real question whether state courts could issue writs to restrain these illegal exercises of executive power .
For example , states might not have jurisdiction over what happened in the federal territories , including the District of Columbia .
If the suspension clause merely preserved the historical scope of habeas jurisdiction * in each state* , then the President would be free to drag people into federal territories ( including not only military bases but also the District of Columbia ) and keep them in federal prison there forever without charges .
Put a different way , the new federal government created the possibility of a " tyranny gap " ( to use an expression of my friend Akhil Amar ) .
Once again , the President would have greater powers than the King of England , George III .
To avoid this result , there was an easy and obvious structural argument :
The Suspension Clause should be read to hold that preservation of the common law writ of habeas corpus must include the power of federal courts to issue the same sorts of writs against the federal government that states could have issued against their own governors and executive officials before 1789 , or that English courts could have issued against the Crown .
( If Congress did not choose to create federal courts , the principle would require that Congress vest this jurisdiction in some group of state courts , most likely with a right of appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court .
But in 1789 Congress made its choice : it created a federal judiciary and gave it jurisdiction over habeas . )
Now we see why Chief Justice Marshall , even before Tarble 's Case , thought that Congress felt an obligation to create federal habeas jurisdiction .
Ex Parte Bollman was a prosecution for treason arising in a federal territory , the District of Columbia .
It was one of these new cases created by the formation of a new central government superimposed over the states , a situation where state jurisdiction might not be available .
As Marshall said , " for if the means be not in existence [ to deal with such cases ] , the privilege itself would be lost , although no law for its suspension should be enacted . "
Hence , the basic principle of the suspension clause is : if courts in a pre-ratification state government , or in the United Kingdom , had jurisdiction to bring writs of habeas corpus against their executive officials , either state courts or federal courts ( if state courts lack jurisdiction ) must have a structurally equivalent power .
Congress has an obligation to create federal habeas jurisdiction sufficient to achieve this result .
This principle outlines the constitutional core of habeas corpus .
It is a matter of constitutional right , and it may not be abridged by Congress except under the conditions outlined in the Suspension Clause .
Call this principle the principle of structurally equivalent sovereignty , or , more to the point , the principle of structurally equivalent tyranny .
This principle avoids the tyranny gap that would otherwise have been created by the formation of a new federal government .
The principle would have made a great deal of sense at the time of the ratification of the Constitution .
At the time of the Revolution , Great Britain was a major empire and maritime power , with colonies and military forces strewn around the known world .
There was a great deal of mischief the King of England could do outside the territory of the British Isles , and courts were needed to keep him in line .
The new American nation was becoming a lot like its British predecessor .
It too , was developing into a maritime power , and it too , was amassing a sizeable quantity of new federal territory , some ceded from the states , others newly acquired .
The Northwest Territory , created in 1787 before the 1789 ratification , was larger than any of the existing states .
Indeed , after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 , the scope of federal territories was larger than all of the existing states put together .
The idea that habeas corpus did not apply to this vast territory -- much less the nation 's capitol -- would be unthinkable .
The structural principle I 've outlined here is the best way to make sense of what the suspension clause did -- and what it required -- for an emerging continental and naval power .
In addition to the constitutional core of habeas , Congress may create additional habeas jurisdiction .
This is sometimes confusingly called " statutory habeas , " to distinguish it from " constitutional " habeas .
As we have seen all federal habeas jurisdiction is statutory , but some is required as part of the constitutional core .
Although Congress must pass statutes to give lower federal courts power to issue writs of habeas corpus , it does not follow , as Attorney General Gonzales seemed to suggest , that individuals have no rights of habeas corpus guaranteed by the Constitution .
There is a core of habeas protection drawing on the common law that must exist somewhere in the legal system , and must be enforceable by some courts , whether federal or state .
Congress may expand habeas jurisdiction beyond that constitutional core .
The issue at stake in the Guantanamo Bay litigation is whether the constitutional core of habeas applies to aliens who have been accused of being enemies of the state and confined in territory controlled by the United States .
If only statutory habeas applies to the Guantanamo Bay detainees , Congress may withdraw habeas jurisdiction .
The Supreme Court has not squarely addressed this issue in Rasul v. Bush .
Although the majority opinion suggested that such persons were protected by the common - law habeas right protected under the Constitution , its specific holding was only that -- in the legal context prior to the MCA -- they were at the very least entitled to statutory habeas rights .
If the MCA 's alteration of habeas falls within the constitutional core of habeas , Congress and the President must either demonstrate that we are in a period of rebellion or invasion , or that it has offered an adequate substitute for habeas .
Not surprisingly , the Bush Administration 's major argument before the courts is that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals -- and the limited appeal from the CSRTs to the D.C. Circuit -- offer an adequate substitute for habeas .
I 've given my reasons why I think the constitutional core of habeas applies to aliens within the United States and to the Guantanamo Bay detainees here .
That is why I think there are serious problems of constitutionality raised by the MCA .
We are in a position remarkably similar to that of the British Empire before the American Revolution ; just as King George was limited by the British courts in how he could treat aliens in British territories held overseas , so too President George is limited in how he can treat aliens today .

Sharman reports wind energy production data for Denmark for the whole of 2003 and shows how shockingly unreliable wind energy production is .
But he also shows how the Danes and their Scandinavian neighbours have made wind energy work productively by balancing Danish wind energy output against Norwegian and Swedish Hydro generation and here in lies the main message of this post .
But first , a summary of the findings .
The current absence of a means of storing wind energy leaves electricity grids at the mercy of the weather and critics have long since pointed out that wind energy cannot provide a grid base - load .
Furthermore , it can not be relied upon to provide peak electricity production .
So what is the point in having wind energy ?
It has seemed to me that wind 's primary purpose has been to provide politicians with a feel good factor and grounds for claiming green credentials .
The main problem with most oceanic and climatic forms of renewable energy — wind , tidal , wave and ocean currents — is that electricity generation is sporadic and may not be linked to the times that power is needed .
Hydroelectric power alone provides a means of storing this oceanic / climatic renewable energy for use when it is most needed making Hydro an invaluable source of electricity .
This post is based on an excellent report titled " Why Wind Power Works in Denmark " by Hugh Sharman , which can be found here .
Denmark
Denmark lies on the eastern margin of the North Sea where it is quite windy .
The population is around 5.5 million and the country produces the highest per capita amount of wind energy in the World .
There is 0.88 kW installed wind capacity per capita in Denmark compared with 0.18 kW per capita in Germany and 0.01 kW per capita in the UK .
Wind supplies 16 % of Denmark 's electricity .
The Danish wind carpet
Denmark has 5500 wind turbines including two large off - shore wind farms .
A total capacity of 2374 MW was installed by the end of 2003 .
The Danish grid is split in two ( there are some large islands ) and Sharman 's report deals only with the west Danish grid , representing 80 % of the total .
Crucially , the west Danish grid was already connected to Norwegian , Swedish and German grids before the wind carpet was built .
A fine day at Horns Rev , the World 's largest offshore wind farm
Load factor
The load factor of the Danish wind carpet is only 20 % .
In other words , for every 5 MW of installed capacity the wind carpet on average produced 1 MW during 2003 .
Information on the cost of installing wind power is given here .
On average 1 kW of installed wind power costs $ 1000 .
Therefore , to get 1 MW return , 5 MW costing $ 5 million needs to be installed .
Highly variable output
There were 9 occasions in 2003 when the wind carpet produced at > 2000 MW ( > 85 % of installed capacity ) but these periods of high output were short lived ( Sharman , Figure 8 ) .
The output suffers from extreme high amplitude high frequency variance - in other words it is very spiky .
" Sometimes the Danish wind carpet produces maximum output when there is little demand .
On other occasions it delivers no energy when demand is high " .
On one day during 2003 , the wind carpet actually consumed more energy than it produced .
I find the high variance in output surprising as I 'd always assumed that wind in one location would compensate for no wind at another and this should result in some smoothing of output .
In Denmark it seems that the wind blows everywhere at once and this may be due to the flat topography and relatively small area .
In larger , topographically more variable countries it might be expected that greater smoothing of output will occur .
How the Danish grid is balanced
The west Danish grid is connected to the Norwegian , Swedish and German grids .
The inter connectors were built as export lines of Norwegian and Swedish hydroelectric power to Germany but have found a new use in helping to balance the highly variable wind output from Denmark .
Figure 13 ( Sharman ) shows the hourly output from the Danish wind carpet in December compared with energy exchange over the interconnectors .
This shows quite amazingly that essentially all Danish wind power is exported to Norway and Sweden .
These countries dynamically balance the interconnected grid using their extensive hydroelectric generating capacity that can be adjusted rapidly to compensate for the highly variable input from Danish wind .
In essence , water is conserved in Norway and Sweden when the wind blows in Denmark .
This conserved water can be used to produce power when it is needed .
This to my mind is a brilliant scheme that essentially provides a means of storing wind power through conserving hydro power .
Energy sinks
Sharman also points out that some of the variance in Danish wind energy output gets sunk into the massive German grid that lies to the South .
The variance in the Danish wind supply is only a problem for Denmark because wind energy represents a significant proportion of the total grid supply — 16 % .
Any country wanting to rival the Danish wind model will have to either develop a grid balancing system or develop energy sinks within the grid or both .
A few weeks back some TOD engineers were throwing around ideas about using the batteries of electric cars as sinks for wind energy .
This sounded a great idea .
Would it also be possible to develop water - heating systems in public buildings to store heat when the wind blows ?
Would it be possible to use wind energy to actually pump water back into hydro dams using existing pump storage schemes ?
Conclusion
Denmark has no indigenous hydroelectric power but has managed to negotiate a power balancing agreement with Scandinavian cousins to make their wind carpet work .
Larger countries such as the US and the UK that have extensive hydroelectric capacity must surely manage to engineer a power balancing act between their wind and hydro generators .

Florida teen gets $ 35 K in topless lawsuit
PENSACOLA , Fla . ( AP ) 
A teenager who sued the city after claiming a police officer forced her to do jumping jacks while topless has reached a $ 35,000 settlement , officials said .
The City Council unanimously approved the settlement Thursday , City Manager Tom Bonfield said .
Officer Shawn Patrick
Shields found the girl , then 16 , and a 19 - year - old man together in a parked car in April 2003 .
Shields ordered the two teens out of the car , then told them he could arrest them for lewd and lascivious behavior , authorities said .
The girl told investigators that Shields told her to perform five topless jumping jacks , which she said she did as he shone his flashlight on her .
Both teenagers passed polygraph tests .
Shields was later fired and pleaded no contest to extortion .
He was placed on probation for two years in December 2003 and ordered to write a letter of apology to the girl .
The name of the girl 's attorney was not immediately known .

Hindus oppose swastika ban in EU
H S Rao in London | January 17 , 2007 19:28 IST
Hindus in Europe are opposing a German call for an European Union ban on the display of swastikas , the 5,000 - year - old Hindu religious symbol that became the insignia of the Nazi Party , saying it was ' sacred ' to the community .
Hindus in Britain , the Netherlands , Belgium , France and Italy plan to visit each EU member state , European Commission leaders and members of the European parliament to garner support for a pressure group intended to resist the German move .
Germany plans to use its presidency of the European Union to launch an initiative , which could lead to common laws making it a crime to display Nazi symbols like swastika .
German Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries said earlier this month that the country wanted to make Holocaust denial punishable by law and a prohibition on Nazi symbols in every member state of the EU .
Claiming that a ban on swastikas would amount to abuse of human rights , Ramesh Kallidai , Secretary General of the Hindu Forum of Britain , an umbrella organization of about 275 Hindu organizations here , told PTI that it would affect 2.5 million Hindus in Europe .
They would be found guilty of violating the law if they use the sacred swastika symbol at religious or marriage functions .
" The Nazi Party started using a Hindu symbol and abused it .
That 's not the fault of the Hindus .
For us swastika is a sacred symbol implying peace and prosperity , " he said .
Kallidai said the forum was working with the Hindu Council of Holland , which represents about 50 Hindu groups , the Hindu Forum of Belgium , comprising about 20 organisations and the Italian Hindu Union , made up of about 25 groups .
He said besides launching a Europe - wide campaign to create awareness of the importance of Swastika for Hindus , the issue would be taken up at the European Parliament through a motion .
Intro
The main problem in floating point numbers being the only numeric type in Lua is that most programmers do not understand floating point .
Floating point numbers are A LOT more complicated than integers ( fixed point numbers ) .
Most programmers ' mental model of floating point is that the result of an operation sometimes has a very slight error .
As a consequence , people get jittery .
But this mental model is wrong ; modeling floating point arithmetic as " correct answer + noise " is wrong , particularly when dealing with the most common type of floating point , IEEE - 754 .
The solution to this whole problem is education .
The essential integer - backwards - compatible behavior of double floating point should be emphasized more in the documentation , the website , the FAQ , the wiki , etc .
Before going further , it should be noted that although floating point numbers are often used as the numeric type in Lua , Lua does not depend on floating point but can be compiled with any numeric type , such as single precision floating point , integer , or even some very unfamiliar numerical representations [ * 5 ] .
Of course , the semantics of division , for example , changes significantly if you compile Lua with an integer numeric type , but on an embedded processor that would probably not come as a surprise . [ * 1 ]
ARM , Coldfire , and various flavors of embeded MIPS have no FPU , yet these are _very_ widely used . [ * 2 ]
Accuracy
Here are some points about ( IEEE 754 ) 64 - bit double - precision floating point numbers ( " doubles " ) v.s. 32 - bit integers :
Double can represent many more integers exactly .
In fact , everything integer can represent , double can represent exactly .
Every result that integer arithmetic can compute correctly and exactly , double arithmetic can compute correctly and exactly .
Largest power of ten : a 64 - bit double can represent all integers exactly , up to about 1,000,000,000,000,000 ( actually - 2^52 ... 2^52 - 1 ) . [ * 3 ]
Largest power of ten : a 32 - bit int can represent all integers exactly , up to about +/-2,000,000,000 ( actually - 2^31 ... 2^31 - 1 ) .
Summary : 64bit precision floating point arithmetic is better than 32 bit integer arithmetic , from the point of view of accuracy , range , and ' backwards - compatibility ' .
See the caveats section though .
Arithmetic operations
IEEE 754 defines the basic mathematical operations , + - * ( multiplication ) / ( division ) , to produce results that are as close as possible to the exact mathematical answer .
In particular , if the answer is exactly representable as a double - precision floating point then that will be the answer ; otherwise , there are two double - precision floating point numbers that are nearest the exact answer ( one just above and one just below ) , and one of those two is selected according to the rounding mode .
For operations involving integers , most of the operations are exact .
If I compute 2+5 , then because the exact mathematical answer is 7 , that is the also IEEE 754 answer .
Performance
Big CPUs
Admittedly Intel 's Pentium design comes a poor third ( because it has too few FP registers ) .
But Intel is catching up .
The only remaining performance concern is floating point to integer conversion .
Like it or not , memory load instructions operate with an address and byte offset ( i.e. two integer values ) .
Therefore , any performance savings of using floating point instead of integers is for naught if the CPU 's float - to - int conversion performance is poor .
Some claims state that float to int conversion can have a devastating effect on performance [ 1 ] .
( For gcc - 3.4 and a circa 2006 AMD processor , the problem is gone , but test it for yourself .
It is easy to compile the benchmark from that link . )
Memory
For users of these serious modern desktop CPUs the only major remaining potential issues are memory bandwidth and memory usage .
Presumably , because of the cell ( union structure ) size in Lua for these objects , these considerations are actually irrelevant .
Hard data about this would be good here , such as the sizeof ( ) the appropriate union with single and double precision floating point configed under various ( or one ) architecture (s ) .
--
In the world of 8 - byte structure alignment , they do n't really take any more space , though if the object structure ever gets over 64 bits due to the size of a FP number , the size issue is " durn tootin " relevant .
FP numbers also take more room in CPU caches -- it 's not just registers that suffer .
-- ChuckAdams
Small CPUs
Summary : Circa 2001 your average entry level $ 10 CPU chip is capable of computing with 64b double as fast and as accurately as integer arithmetic ( or more so ) .
Users of these CPUs should not pay any costs by virtue of using double floating point only in lua , and may reap benefits .
Users of smaller chips may well be obliged to use integer arithmetic only in lua .
-- as also noted below , most ARM chips , one of the most widely used embedded CPUs , have no hardware floating point support .
This means every conversion between int and float , and every arithmetic operation , is a function call ( usually inlined ) .
Doubles are even worse .
When you consider the checks for NaN and denormalized numbers , the overhead vs. integers is quite significant ( and yes , I have profiled ) .
-- BenStJohn ?
While Lua 's number type can be built as integer , profiling is suggested before use since ( even on integer - only processors ) the speed up might be not as great as imagined and the loss of floating point can make some operations more complex .
Also note Lua 5.3 has explicit integer support built in .
e Lua http://www.eluaproject.net/ is a fork of Lua for some microcontrollers which has an optional integer build .
However , it should be noted that standard Lua also builds on cores like the ARM7TDMI quite easily - since the source is standard C .
The integer changes can be applied if necessary .
Caveats
If your C code passes huge numbers of integers to Lua , that may be slow on your architecture .
Or it may create predictability problems on your architecture .
You might really need integer arithmetic divide , for example .
A few ( very few ) algorithms really do .
Additionally you might find that the proper floating point truncate is slower than integer , and that this algorithm is time critical for your application .
Some vendors ' printf implementations may not be able to handle printing floating point numbers accurately .
Believe it or not , some may incorrectly print integers ( that are floating point numbers ) .
This can manifest itself as incorrectly printing some numbers in Lua.
QNX has this problem [ 2 ] .
The only sensible fix is to complain to your vendor and / or replace printf with one that works .

If what you really need is 64 - bit signed or unsigned integers , then a 64 - bit floating point ( ie , double ) may be an issue .
For example , if you 're interfacing with the C - API and C - code actually needs a 64 - bit signed / unsigned int ( ie , long long ) such as for a random number or key or serial number or to go to / from a network packet .
To do that you 're better off having the C - code use a Lua userdata to hold the value , and provide methods / metamethods for manipulating the 64 - bit value .

Footnotes / Comments
SO WHICH will be harder to spot this season — Mark Foley campaign signs or movie ads for “ Idiocracy ” ?
If Foley had been as stealthy about messaging teenage pages as 20th Century Fox has been in releasing this dystopian social satire , Foley might still be the honorable member from Florida ’s 16th Congressional District .
“ Idiocracy ” could n’t be more undercover if it were wearing a burka : a film released without an ad campaign , without movie trailers , without media screenings .
You can see “ Idiocracy ” if you live in Atlanta , but not in New York .
In Houston , but not in San Francisco .
I saw it in Pasadena on a double feature with “ The Celestine Prophecy , ” a cinematic mismating on the order of Lenny Bruce hooking up with Glinda the Good Witch .
Advertisement
I got wind of “ Idiocracy ” only because I know people who know the guy who made it —
Mike Judge , who did “ Office Space ” and “ King of the Hill . ”
This film stars Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph , with a cameo by Thomas Haden Church , the Oscar - nominated roué in “ Sideways . ”
And yet Paris Hilton got more press for “ House of Wax . ”
“ Idiocracy ” begins as your standard suspended - animation plot , with its stars thawing out in 2505 , in an America that will bring hosannas from the creationist crowd because , clearly , Darwin has struck out .
The smart people have dithered themselves out of the gene pool .
America 2505 is populated not by the fittest but by the fattest and the dumbest — the overbreeding , oversexed spawn of the cast of “ Jackass . ”
Their Barcaloungers are fitted out with toilets so they do n’t have to miss a moment of the top-rated show , “ Ow , My Balls ! ”
The nation ’s hit movie is “ Ass ” : 90 wordless minutes of bare butt , winner of Oscars for best picture and best screenplay .
It ’s worse than Big Brother — it ’s Big Bro .
Time traveler Joe Bowers was “ remarkably average ” five centuries ago , but here he ’s the smartest man around .
People who converse in hip - hop catchphrases and advertising jingles mock Joe ’s subject - verb agreement as “ faggy . ”
But the nation plunges into crisis — no more burrito toppings — because a canny uber - CEO bought the FDA and replaced water with sports drinks , even for crops .
The president , a pro wrestler who ’s put mud-flap girls on the White House gates , puts Joe in charge of saving them all .
“ Do something smart , ” the Cabinet orders him , by the light of a pool - hall beer lamp .
Advertisement
Why has Fox deep - sixed this film ?
A
Fox spokesman tells me that “ Idiocracy ” was “ a limited release , that ’s it , nothing to really talk about . ”
But the cine - blog world is roiling with questions .
Did Judge ’s film , by sheer happenstance , mirror Rupert Murdoch ’s blueprint for a Fox - fed nation of fat , dumb and happy ?
Is the problem a threatened lawsuit over the way “ Idiocracy ” treats corporate America ?
Starbucks in 2505 serves speedy sex acts with the coffee , and Carl ’s Jr. and H&R Block get the same rough handling .
But that ’s why studios have lawyers , and that ’s why we have the 1st Amendment .
Perhaps it ’s been cast out of distribution Eden for the same reason that Newsweek made “ Losing Afghanistan ” its cover story last week in every country except the United States .
We got a cover story about a celebrity photographer .
It could be the same reason the $ 400 - billion “ war on terror ” has been slyly financed by “ emergency ” legislation , put on the nation ’s credit card , where the bill never seems to comes due .
Or the same reason the administration bans pictures of coffins coming back from Iraq .
Advertisement
And that would be because Americans are being mollycoddled and infantilized .
If we ’re not getting the truth — even delivered via satire — it might be because leaders think we ca n’t take it , or they may be afraid of what we might do if we did get it .
President Bush dismissed leaked intelligence reports critical of the Iraq war because they could “ create confusion in the minds of the American people . ”
Goodness no ; do n’t confuse us with information .
Luke Wilson ’s
Joe is cinema ’s classic “ average guy ” who spills the beans to the other folks — Gary Cooper ’s John Doe , Jimmy Stewart ’s Sen. Smith .
Such men are dangerous .
And “ Idiocracy , ” in its snarky way , is a dangerous movie .
Joe tells a fellow time - traveler to return to the past to “ tell people to read books , stay in school .
I think the world got like this because people like me never did anything with their lives .
There was a time in this country when smart people were considered cool . ”
In a culture devoted to “ getting and spending , ” that ’s radical talk .
Slate.com calls “ Idiocracy ” “ the most stirring defense of traditional values since Edmund Burke ’s ‘ Reflections on the Revolution in France . ’ ” I would n’t go that far , but Judge may be a man out of his own time too .
You have to wonder whether he ’s making satire — or documentaries .

The MPAA , RIAA and several anti-piracy organizations are constantly trying to trap people into downloading fake torrents .
These torrents are hosted on trackers that are setup to collect IP addresses of all the ' pirates ' who try to download these files .
To make these traps more visible , Fenopy just introduced the FakeFinder .
The FakeFinder lists the most popular fake torrents and the latest fake trackers .
It also allows you to search for fake torrents by keyword or infohash .
The actual . torrent links for these fake files are blocked , and FakeFinder serves an informational purpose only .
It is actually quite amusing to browse through these fake files and trackers .
The companies that host these anti-piracy trackers came up with some interesting hostnames like “ dirtydevils.cyberbox.com.br ” and “ bittorrent.isthebe.st “ .
Although most of the IPs of these fake trackers are already blocked by blocklist software like PeerGuardian , they still manage to collect the IP addresses of thousands of users who do fall for this trap .
Most torrent site admins are aware of these fakes , and remove them as soon as they are uploaded .
It is kind of a paradox .
On the one hand anti-piracy organizations send thousands of takedown requests to torrent sites , while they upload fake files with similar titles themselves .
Some might argue that downloading a fake file is not really a criminal offense .
And yes , it is doubtful if this evidence will hold up in court .
However , the job of organizations like the MPAA is to scare people , and that is often enough for them .
The first thing they will probably do is send a letter to your ISP saying that you tried to download so - and - so file .
And even if they take it a step further , they try to settle before these things are played out in court .
FakeFinder shows that BitTorrent site admins are trying to track down these fake torrents , and it ’s a nice way to expose the darker side of anti-piracy organizations like the MPAA .
Frequently , the mainstream media , reporting on computer programming tools , gets the story horribly wrong .
What happens is that some kind of vendor of programming technologies has come up with some product they are claiming makes programming easier .
The journalists do n’t really understand .
What they hear is “ programming is going to be easier . ”
Usually there ’s some kind of Lego allusion .
Om Malik ( November , 2006 ) : “… these startups are building development environments that let the user cobble together software packages as easily as snapping together Lego bricks . ”
He admits : “… the transition to this type of platform is going to be slow ; I believe it could take about three years to realize its potential . ”
Three years ?
BusinessWeek ran a cover-story about object oriented programming way back in September , 1991 , accompanied by a picture of a baby in diapers programming a computer .
They also used the Lego metaphor : “ Indeed , at the software startup they now head , Objective Technologies Inc. , programming seems downright juvenile : Instead of mucking around in tangles of C code — writing arcane statements such as printf ( “ %s/n ” , curr str ) — they mainly connect boxes on the screens of their NeXT Computer Inc. workstations and fill in blanks .
In minutes , they have industrial - strength programs that run right the first time and that can be modified without brain surgery .
Says Bergerson , 27 : ‘ I showed my mother , and she said , “ You ’re still playing with Lego blocks , like when you were a kid ! ” ’ ”
“ Eventually , a whole new way of selling software may emerge .
In a market of interchangeable , plug - and - play objects , you might shop for pieces separately and compile your own custom software . ”
None of them believed Frederick P. Brooks , in 1987 : “ Not only are there no silver bullets now in view , the very nature of software makes it unlikely that there will be any — no inventions that will do for software productivity , reliability , and simplicity what electronics , transistors , and large - scale integration did for computer hardware … .
I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification , design , and testing of this conceptual construct , not the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation … .
If this is true , building software will always be hard .
There is inherently no silver bullet . ”
The internet is littered with wastes of space .
This one is no different except that it is my waste of space .
THE mandatory nutrition information that appears on all processed foods in Australia is often inaccurate and misleading , according to the first analysis of how well the claims reflect packet contents .
Even allowing for a 20 per cent margin of error on the specified amount , as many as 84 per cent of labels incorrectly stated the quantity of at least one component , the survey of 70 packaged products conducted for the NSW Food Authority found .
In one brand of chips , scientists found the amount of trans fat - which has been implicated in the development of heart disease - was 13 times higher than claimed on the label .
( Trans fat results when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to make shortening or margarine .
The process extends the shelf life of fatty products such as biscuits and snack foods . )
The Colorado Experiment
Casey Viator , Arthur Jones ,
High Intensity Training
Before and After photos of Casey Viator taken 28 days apart during Arthur Jones Colorado Experiment
The Colorado Experiment : A breakthrough study that produced the largest muscle gains ever recorded : 63.21 lbs in 28 days .
The experiment was devised by Arthur Jones , inventor of the Nautilus training machines .
The main test subject was Casey Viator , a professional bodybuilder .
However , Jones also took part in the experiment as the second test subject .
The experiment took place at the Department of Physical Education at Colorado State University .
The experiment was supervised by James E. Johnson , Ph.D. , Associate Professor , Department of Radiology and Radiation Biology and Dr. Elliott Plese , Director of Exercise Physiology Lab of Colorado State University .
The experiment started on May 1st , 1973 and ran through May 28th , 1973 .
Casey Viator followed the protocol for the full 28 days .
Arthur Jones completed only 22 days .
The Results
During the 28 day experiment , Casey Viator saw an increase in bodyweight of 45.28 pounds .
Allegedly , he also lost 17.93 pounds of fat in that period .
So his overall muscle gain was 63.21 pounds .
During his 22 day stint , Arthur Jones saw an increase in bodyweight of 13.62 pounds .
However , he also lost 1.82 pounds of fat during that period .
So his overall muscle gain was 15.44 pounds .
The Workout
The style of training used was " HIT " or High Intensity Training .
Read the the information below to learn more about High Intensity Training ...
Gives you TWICE the amount of muscle gains in HALF the time ...
Here 's Why Working on Your Tan Can Help You Pack on More Lean , Solid Muscle Mass in Less Time Than You EVER Thought Possible !
It 's true ... if you know what it takes to get a sun tan ... you can apply thatinformation in the gym to gain ALL the muscle mass you want .
And you 'll do it naturally ... with proven techniques that FORCE your muscles into growing ... so you can get as muscular as you want , as FAST as possible !
Dear friend ,
If you 're looking to build more solid muscle mass in a lot less time , I want you to first work on getting a tan .
Sounds a little weird , right ?
Well , before I totally lose you and you think I 've gone nuts ... hear me out because it 's important .
This has EVERYTHING to do with the muscle gains you get in the gym .
First of all , you are NOT going to build muscle from the sun .
We both know that 's ridiculous .
But the relationship between the sun and tanning is the SAME exact one that exists between weight lifting and gaining muscle .
Here 's what I mean .
What happens when you get JUST the right amount of sun ?
You get a nice , attractive tan , right ?
But what happens when you get TOO much sun ?
You get a sun burn .
That 's not something you want , is it ?
Now ... Let 's Take This Inside The Gym ...
What happens when you lift JUST the right amount of weight for JUST the right amount of time ... so you get JUST the right amount of stimulation to your muscles ?
That 's right ... you get bigger and stronger !
Much like the right amount of sun leads to a desired result ( a tan ) ...
JUST the right amount of weight training leads to the desired result of more muscle .
But like too much sun will lead to a burn ... working each muscle TOO MUCH or for TOO LONG will lead to overtraining and your muscles actually GETTING SMALLER AND WEAKER !
Look ... there 's no law that says if you double your time in the gym , you 'll double your results .
In fact , the OPPOSITE happens !
If you double the amount of time you lift ...
You Actually GET WORSE RESULTS !
Again , back to tanning ... the sun is the stimulus and the tan is the result .
When you work out , lifting heavy weight is the stimulus and the result is more muscle mass .
When you expose yourself to the sun or any UV light for a short time ... you activate the melanocytes in your skin .
By repeating this process with SHORT sessions , pigment builds up in your cells and you get a nice , even , sexy tan !
But when you get too much sun ... , you get a sun burn .
Too much of the stimulus leads to a negative result .
So the key is to find the right amount of sun for a tan , but not too much that you burn .
Well , muscle growth happens by overloading a muscle with heavy weight and then allowing it to rest and recuperate .
So in this case , the lifting of heavy weight is the stimulus and if you get the rest and proper nutrition you need , you 'll pack on a LOT of muscle .
If you train a muscle too much or too often , it never gets a chance to recuperate and will not GET BIGGER .
It 's like going back out in the sun too much .
Overexposure to the sun leads to a burn .
Overexposure to weight lifting leads to overtraining !
When overtraining occurs , muscle growth and strength gains come to a screeching halt .
So to maximize muscle growth ... you need train with JUST the right amount of weight training .
Too much will produce negative results .
If you do n't allow your muscles to rest , recover , and get ready for the next workout , you 're doing the same thing as if you went back out into the sun too much .
Too much of something can produce negative results as much as too little of something .
So what 's the answer ?
Simple , just use the
HITMAN high intensity training manual !
HITMAN is a high intensity training system designed for quick gains of muscle , strength and power .
It 's for those who want to gain a lot of muscle and NOT risk overtraining .
HITMAN was developed by Matrix Systems , a group of personal trainers and bodybuilders based in Southern California .
It 's based on the principles or High Intensity Training ( HIT ) , which focuses on performing your weight training reps to the point of muscle failure .
The goal is to overload your muscles the best way possible , in order to maximize the amount of muscle fiber stimulation .
The fundamental principles of High Intensity Training are that each exercise and workout should be brief , infrequent , and intense .
It makes sense that the more weight you lift , the less time you have to work out ?
That 's why high intensity workouts are kept short .
You do JUST the right amount of weight lifting to KEEP stimulating muscle growth ... and no more .
After a High Intensity workout , as with any workout , the body requires time to recover and produce the muscle gains that were stimulated during the workout .
That 's why there 's more emphasis on rest and recovery in the HITMAN program than in most other weight training routines .
Mike Mentzer , a former Mr. Universe , believe wholely in High Intensity training and achieved his lifetime best condition from using it .
Lee Labrada , Sergio Olivia , Casey Viator , and Dorian Yates all had incredibly huge and muscular physiques ... and they ALL used high intensity training .
Sure , you may not have the genetics these guys had ... but even if you get a FRACTION of their results , would n't you be happy ?
If you 're skinny and have very poor genetics for building muscle ... this is the remedy .
Stop wasting time and start building muscle !
Even if you been stuck at the same size for years ... this program will help you burst through and start packing on a lot more muscle .
The truth is , your current workout is n't thoroughly stimulating all of your different types of muscle fibers ... but once you use HITMAN ... you 'll fully stimulate every fiber .
By the end of your first month you 'll notice new muscle .
After a couple of months ... you 'll see a huge difference in size and strength .
After all , HITMAN was designed for the most rapid strength , size and power gains possible ... while also allowing you to achieve complete recuperation .
We 've identified nine Critical Growth Factors , which form the basis from which this program is built upon .
Understanding and applying them correctly will make the difference between packing on a TON of muscle ... and not making any gains at all .
If you 're not happy with your results from the time you spend in the gym right now , this could be the reason why .
You 'll want to take a close look at this program because if what you 're currently doing is n't working , this could be THE key .
Since it takes very little time , it 's also perfect for those who are busy and do n't have a lot of time to work out .
So now , not only do you NOT have to spend five to six days a week in the gym ... you 'll also cut your training time down in HALF ... while you gain TWICE the amount of muscle !
It 's true !
HITMAN has eight completely new engineered training periods .
Each is four weeks long which includes a two - week high intensity " Growth " Phase , followed by a two - week lower intensity " Stabilize " Phase .
The workouts are based on a three - day per week schedule which allows you the other four days to completely rest and recover .
This system is designed for maximum rest , recuperation , and muscle GROWTH !
HITMAN is perfect for someone that wants to get in and out of the gym quickly WHILE ALSO packing on a ton of lean muscle mass .
Every single part of your weight training is covered in detail .
I 'll even show you exactly which exercises to use and how many reps to use every workout .
What you 'll Get with the HITMAN High Intensity Training Manual ...
Short , four - week training periods based on Growth and Stabilize cycles .

... And Much More !
HITMAN is based on the scientific , PROVEN research of cause and effect ... just like the sun can lead to a tan if used correctly .
This program , if used correctly ... will make SURE you train JUST the right amount ... so you get the absolute maximum amount of lean muscle mass growth .
We 'll cover training to failure and whether it 's important to do or not .
We 'll also talk about " the pump " and even if it 's necessary to feel during your workouts .
We 'll cover overtraining and how it can ruin ALL your muscle gains ... and how to prevent it from happening .
I 'll show you the correct training format that helps prevent overtraining from ever happening again .
We 'll get into your workout length , the number of reps and sets to do , which exercises to use , when to train , the top muscle overload techniques and advanced muscle stimulation techniques , rest and recovery for quick muscle gains , nutrition for the most muscle growth , and supplements .
You 'll also get complete exercise descriptions that show you how to perform each one .
Proven Scientific Methods to Help You Reach Your Genetic Potential in Muscle Mass
The primary focus in this program is gaining muscle mass a lot faster , but we also cover nutrition , weight loss , cardiovascular conditioning and flexibility training .
These are all parts of a proper program that will have you looking and feeling your best .
Through years of research and experience , we 've come to understand there is a growing percentage of men that want to train and increase their power and strength yet they have limited recuperation capabilities .
These guys are typically referred to as " hard gainers . "
Their limitations are due to genetic factors as well as daily stress , poor eating habits , lack of regular rest .
These all limit your body 's ability to recover from regular exercise .
Remember our talk about sun tans and muscle growth ?
This is it right here .
If you find yourself not making consistent progress , constantly fatigued when you do train , or little time to spend on your workouts ... then the HITMAN program will help you build a strong , muscular body in a lot less time .
This program relies on intensity cycling , training variety and applying the techniques responsible for complete muscle stimulation .
We work in sync with the body 's natural ability to withstand stress and recover .
Hitman's " secret " is to keep your body rested and recovered after an intense lifting session .
Just enough lifting is crucial ...
Much like the fact that JUST enough sun will produce the desired result of a tan ... this program will produce the desired result of more muscle mass .
It has JUST the right amount of training .
Your progress will depend on following each training Period as close as possible .
There 's a very fine line between the proper amount of training and your overall ability to recover .
But when you follow this , you 'll LOVE what you see in the mirror just a few short weeks after starting .
The gains you see will come faster , they 'll be bigger and more often ... and you 're going to pack on more solid muscle than you ever dreamed possible .
The secrets I 'm about to share with you are the result of YEARS worth of scientific research on what causes muscles to actually grow .
Here at Matrix Systems , we 're big believers in science and proof and feel that if we can find the cause and effect relationship between working out and gaining muscle , that 's what we want to focus on .
What we 've done is use a scientific , results - oriented approach that 's based on what works .
If you want size , fast , use this manual !
You 'll gain muscle mass , you 'll gain size , you 'll get stronger , and you 'll get so jacked ... your friends will think you 've been on a cycle of steroids .
But you wo n't be ... you 'll just be following the proven principles of what actually causes muscle mass to grow .
In fact , a short time after starting HITMAN , your muscle groups will go into growth - overdrive .
While other guys in the gym keep getting the same results and keep looking the same each and every week ... you 'll soon reach a whole new level of muscularity .
This program will separate you from all the other guys that will continue to just spin their wheels in the gym , getting the same old results .
For you , this HITMAN program means a chance to gain more muscle size and do it a lot faster .
So why am I suddenly releasing a program that talks about this stuff ?
Why would n't I just keep these secrets to myself ?
Well , first off , that would n't be fair to let SO MANY people keep doing things wrong and spin their wheels in the gym for little to no results .
After all , we 've noticed that just about 99 % of all the people working out in the gym are just plain WRONG .
I mean , they work out WAY too much and WAY too often .
My clients and I are in and out of the gym by the time they finish warming up !
And here 's the thing :
We 're some of the biggest , most muscular dudes in the gym ... yet we literally spend a fraction of the time !
So instead of just letting most guys keep running around in circles , not getting anywhere , I want to help change that .
My goal is to help guys pack on more solid muscle mass in literally HALF the time they spend in the gym .
This will blast your muscles with something they 've never experienced before .
And as a result , you 'll grow so fast you 'll NEVER want to train any other way again .
I 've used HITMAN to gain an unfair advantage over other lifters in the gym and there 's no reason you can't as well .
Now you do n't have to be like MOST guys who have trouble gaining muscle .
You 'll now have the unfair advantage and be on a totally different level of muscularity .
Whether you want a thick , powerful chest or arms that bulge out of the sleeves of your shirt , or round shapely shoulders that look like bowling balls ... you 'll soon notice guys , everywhere you go , start to give you a lot more respect .
Not only that , but the ladies will be checking you out a lot more too , I guarantee it .
So bottom line , it 's time to use HITMAN to " shock " your muscles into growing faster than they want to !
You 'll blast right through plateaus so you can keep making incredible gains .
What 's more , since you 're no longer spending an extra minute in the gym ... even while you get better results , you 'll have more time to actually live a life .
All the while , you 'll be getting continuous muscle growth that just does n't stop
You 'll be giving your muscles NO OTHER CHOICE but to grow ... and grow FAST because you 'll finally be using the scientific methods of muscle growth .
That means YOU decide when you 've got the amount of muscle you want .
No longer do you have to keep spending hours in the gym for little to no results .
That time of your life is done forever !
In fact , stick with it and you can get results like I 've gotten ... which is more growth in just 3 months than you would normally get in 3 years !
The fact is , you 've just got to SEE this program to believe it .
Look - if you work out and you honestly want to get BIG , you understand just how important proper rest , recuperation , and nutrition is , right ?
If you want MORE muscle size , FASTER than you could ever dream of ... this is your chance .
Some guys are satisfied with their training routine and the fact that they just go to the gym , over and over again , and never see any results .
I guess they figure " that 's just how it goes for them " .
But I know for me , and all of my clients , we 're never entirely satisfied .
We 're always looking for new ways to pack on solid muscle .
Heck , it 's what we do here at Matrix Systems
That 's why advanced training breakthroughs that take above and beyond any training routine you 've ever tried ... that 's why we do this stuff and it's why we get so excited .
We LOVE seeing guys get so much better results from using our stuff .
It makes us feel like what we 're doing matters .
It took me about 5 long years to finally understand why most guys were n't gaining muscle mass like they should be .
After all , they were spending a ton of time in the gym .
Well , once again , it goes back to the sun tan and the sun burn .
Guys were simply spending too much time in the gym .
And I was one of the worst offenders .
But once I learned the techniques that are in the HITMAN program , my workouts were never the same and neither were my gains .
They were far ahead of anything I 've ever gotten before .
So before you lift your next weight , before you go to the gym , you need to get this program because it will change the way you go about putting on muscle mass forever .
The results you get , once you 've used these workouts will quickly set you apart from everyone in the gym .
And You 'll Love Every Minute of it !

That ’s what he just said on 60 Minutes .
SCOTT PELLEY : Do you think you owe the Iraqi people an apology for not doing a better job ?
BUSH : That we did n’t do a better job or they did n’t do a better job ?
PELLEY : Well , that the United States did not do a better job in providing security after the invasion .
BUSH : Not at all .
I am proud of the efforts we did .
We liberated that country from a tyrant .
I think the Iraqi people owe the American people a huge debt of gratitude , and I believe most Iraqis express that .
I mean , the people understand that we ’ve endured great sacrifice to help them .
That ’s the problem here in America .
They wonder whether or not there is a gratitude level that ’s significant enough in Iraq .
PELLEY : Americans wonder whether . . .
BUSH : Yeah , they wonder whether or not the Iraqis are willing to do hard work .
Here ’s a question for Emily Post :
What level of gratitude is appropriate when your country has been invaded under false pretenses , tens of thousands of your fellow citizens have been killed , and hundreds of thousands have fled the country due to the very real fear of assasination ?
Will a muffin basket do it ?
Bush then goes on to repeat a whole bunch of canards about Saddam “ rushing to compete with Iran for a nuclear weapon ” and that “ everybody was wrong on weapons of mass destruction . ”
( Uhhh , for the record , not everybody . )
After listening to Bush and Cheney ( who seems raring to invade Iran , btw . ) do the talk shows today , I ’m left wondering :
Do these guys really believe their own bullshit ?
Or is it all just cynical doublespeak ?
And which is worse ?
Morally , and for the future of the American and Iraqi people ?
For the definitive chronology of the lies the Bush administration told to get us into the war see our our Iraq War timeline , “ Lie By Lie : Chronicle of a War Foretold . ”
For a timeline of Bush ’s own illustrious history of personal military service see “ We Were Soliders Once ? ”
Whatever you have been told , science is not about certainty .
And this creates problems for those health professionals who are charged with interpreting and relating data to the general public .
We are expected to refute wholesale misunderstandings , in a popular forum , to people who may well be intelligent but who know nothing of evidence - based medicine , in soundbite format .
Health scares are like toothpaste : they 're easy to squeeze out , but very difficult to get back in the tube .
On Monday , for example , Melanie Phillips of the Daily Mail wrote yet another attack on the MMR vaccine .
She suggested that the journalists who trusted the new Cochrane review , which shows that MMR is probably safe and not linked to autism , were lazy stooges who took the press release at face value .
The problem is that Phillips seems to misunderstand basic epidemiology .
She cites " research data " of highly dubious status and misrepresents what data there is .
Her response is a microcosm of the problems that can arise when journalists engage with science .
The Cochrane Collaboration is an independent , international non-profit organisation that produces systematic reviews of the literature , written by and for scientists who understand critical appraisal .
It would be a happier world if journalists who write about health issues were also au fait with the intricacies of evidence - based medicine , and were trained to read academic papers .
But because the majority of them can't , the report is converted into a more easily digested press release for journalists .
This creates its own problems .
Science is all about the error bar , a graphic representation of the uncertainties in the data .
I look forward to the day when every politician 's speech has an error bar next to it , fluctuating in response to the margin of certainty around their claims .
This is how science works : you do a piece of research , you get some results and you write them up , in full , so that everyone can see what you 've done , replicate it and critique it .
You say : here are our results , they are this statistically accurate ( error bar ) , and on the basis of this finding , and many other findings from other labs ( which are clearly referenced ) we come to the following verdict on a particular hypothesis .
The process is transparent , but relies on people being able to critically appraise a paper , pull apart its methodology , understand the statistics , in order to come to their own verdict .
It follows that all scientific papers are flawed , to a greater or lesser extent , and each in its own unique way , because of the different ways of working around the practical problems of doing research : imperfect follow - up , imperfect measurements and so on .
Scientists all know that .
A Cochrane review is a systematic review of the literature , which critiques each paper it encounters in exactly this manner .
So the press release for this particular Cochrane review said , overall , that this overview of the evidence suggests that MMR is pretty safe .
But Phillips has read the full report , and is outraged by what she thinks she 's found : " It said that no fewer than nine of the most celebrated studies that have been used against [ Andrew Wakefield , who first claimed in 1998 that there was a link between the vaccine and autism ] were unreliable in the way they were constructed " .
Of course it did .
Cochrane reviews are intended to criticise papers .
She seems surprised that the report does n't walk the reader through the reasons why Wakefield 's speculative 12 - subject case - series report is less worrying when considered alongside the many large epidemiological surveys of up to half a million people that the Cochrane review focuses on .
But the reasons are clear to anyone who understands biomedical research .
So Phillips presents material as experimental scientific research when it has never been published in a peer - reviewed academic journal and is not indexed in PubMed , the standard search tool for finding medical academic papers .
The research she refers to has been published only in the in - house magazine of a rightwing US pressure group well known for polemics on homosexuality , abortion and vaccines .
She says " autistic enterocolitis " is a " disease " and a " new syndrome " that has been " replicated in studies around the world " .
As a rough guide , the phrase " autistic enterocolitis " appears in only five PubMed - indexed academic papers , one by Wakefield and four others mostly doubting its status .
What 's more , she seems to misunderstand basic epidemiology .
Large population surveys have greater power to detect a small increase in a given condition .
Apparently not for Phillips : " Only a very small proportion are said to have been badly affected ... " she says .
" But population - wide studies are considered too large and insensitive to pick up small numbers such as this . "
It is self - evident to anybody who understands biomedical research , and if you do n't get it then you have only two choices : you can either learn to interpret data yourself and come to your own informed conclusions ; or you decide who to trust .
Choose wisely .

Seven cameras in Middlesbrough town centre have a facility , which allows operators to bark orders at those involved in anti-social behaviour .
Officials hope the additions to the town 's 160 cameras will help to further reduce street crime .
It is the latest crime prevention move for Middlesbrough , whose elected mayor is Ray Mallon , the former senior police officer who was dubbed Robocop .
Barry Coppinger , Middlesbrough Council 's executive member for community safety , said : " CCTV is making Middlesbrough safer and this added facility will make it more effective .
' Community safety '
" For example , if an operative now sees someone dropping litter , they can tell them to pick it up , or if they see an incident starting to get out of hand , they can give advice that will hopefully nip it in the bud .
" I think that it will give people extra confidence as they go about their business and re-enforce the message that Middlesbrough is a place that is constantly thinking about community safety . "
A similar " talking " system was piloted in Wiltshire in 2003 .
Mr Coppinger added : " Middlesbrough 's CCTV network is one of the most comprehensive in the UK and in 2005 was responsible for helping net 678 offenders .
" It was also responsible for helping locate 15 missing people . "
The system is managed from a command centre in the town 's main bus station and linked to Cleveland Police headquarters .
It is hoped to install another three " talking " cameras in Middlesbrough by April 2007 .
One undertaker admitted taking parts from Alistair Cooke 's body
The criminal operation saw body parts removed from corpses without the consent of relatives and sold to biomedical companies .
The body of veteran BBC broadcaster Alistair Cooke was among those used .
Brooklyn district attorney Charles Hynes said that hundreds of parts were sold for millions of dollars , and that more people were likely to be charged .
He said the seven , who have not been named , agreed to co-operate in the investigation and entered their pleas in a secret hearing .
The very equipment that they used , the mask and gloves and surgical items were tossed into the bodies
NYC Police Commissioner
Ray Kelly
One of those who pleaded guilty was the undertaker who removed parts from the body of Alistair Cooke , who died in 2004 aged 95 , Associated Press reported .
Four other people who have been named - Michael Mastromarino , Joseph Nicelli , Lee Cruceta , and Christopher Aldorasi - on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to charges of illegally harvesting bones and organs from up to 1,000 bodies , and were released on bail .
They could face up to 25 years in jail if convicted .
Mr Hynes said in a statement : " These ghoulish thieves thought they could pull off the crime of the century , stealing bones from the dead , without any thoughts to their victims ' families or the transplant recipients who would receive possibly tainted bone and tissue grafts . "
Cancerous bones
Prosecutors said they had unearthed evidence that death certificates and other paperwork were changed .
X -ray of corpse showing leg bones replaced with plastic piping
In Mr Cooke 's case , his age was recorded as 85 rather than 95 , and the cause of death was listed as a heart attack instead of lung cancer that had spread to his bones .
Other evidence includes X - rays and photographs of exhumed corpses showing that where leg bones should have been , someone had inserted white plastic pipes .
The pipes were crudely reconnected to hip and ankle bones with screws before the legs were sewn back up .
New York City Police Commissioner , Ray Kelly , said : " The unspeakable desecration of the bodies - PVC pipe was used to replace bones .
Indeed , the very equipment that they used , the mask and gloves and surgical items were tossed into the bodies . "
Transplanting tissues such as muscle , skin and bone is common in the United States and the trade in implantable body parts is legal , providing certain conditions are met .

All it takes is 2 tablespoons of glue , 1 tablespoon of liquid starch , and a good stir ( food coloring optional ) .
When you 're finished , you should have a fairly good Silly Putty - like substance .
For the record , though , this is n't exactly Silly Putty ; however , having followed a similar recipe in my youth , I can vouch for it as an easy and fun alternative .

Senator John Sununu ( R -NH ) has just announced that his office is working on legislation that would prevent the FCC from creating specific technology mandates that have to be followed by consumer electronics manufacturers .
What 's his target ?
The broadcast flag .
Television and movie studios have wanted a broadcast flag for years .
The flag is a short analog or digital signal embedded into broadcasts that specifies what users can do with the content .
It would most often be used to prevent any copying of broadcast material , but there 's an obvious problem with the plan : it requires recording devices to pay attention to the flag .
Because no consumers wander the aisles at Best Buy thinking , " You know , I would definitely buy this DVD recorder , but only if it supported broadcast flag technology , " the industry has asked the federal government to step in and simply require manufacturers to respect the flag .
At first they approached the FCC , and the FCC complied by dutifully trotting out some new broadcast flag regulations .
Unfortunately for the content industry , the FCC does n't generally have the right to tell manufacturers how to build their products .
The rules were thrown out by an appeals court in 2005 .
Undaunted , the industry tried again in Congress .
Last year , when a rewrite to the 1996 Telecommunications
Act was being considered , broadcast flag legislation was in fact attached to the bill and even made it through committee before bogging down .
Sununu 's bill will attempt to rein in the FCC and prevent it from reviving the broadcast flag without Congressional authorization to do so .
" The FCC seems to be under the belief that it should occasionally impose technology mandates , " Sununu said in a statement .
" These misguided requirements distort the marketplace by forcing industry to adopt agency - blessed solutions rather than allow innovative and competitive approaches to develop .
We have seen this happen with the proposed video flag , and interest groups are pushing for an audio flag mandate as well .
Whether well - intentioned or not , the FCC has no business interfering in private industry to satisfy select special interests or to impose its own views . "
Linux ist nicht Windows und auch wenn es einige Ähnlichkeiten gibt , muss man doch bedenken , dass eine Reihe von Dingen neu zu lernen sind , ehe man sich auch bei Linux wie zu Hause fühlt .
Linux ist ein Open - Source - Klon von UNIX , einem sicheren Betriebssystem , das noch älter ist als DOS und Windows und vor allem für den Mehrbenutzerbetrieb entwickelt wurde .
Die Punkte der folgenden Auflistung gelten für jedes UNIX - basierte * nix - System wie Linux und die unterschiedlichen Versionen von BSD .
Der Einfachheit halber ist in diesem Artikel aber nur von Linux die Rede .
Hier die 10 Dinge , die man wissen sollte :
1. Verzeichnishierarchie
Im Unterschied zu einigen anderen Betriebssystemen , welche für jedes Laufwerk einen eigenen Verzeichnisbaum haben , ist das Linux - Dateisystem ein einziger , großer Verzeichnisbaum .
Ganz oben gibt es das Root - Verzeichnis „ / “ , und alle Ordner , Dateien und Laufwerke sind Zweige dieses Wurzelverzeichnisses .
Angenommen , man hat zwei Festplatten ( mit Namen a und b ) , ein Disketten - und ein CD - ROM - Laufwerk .
Die erste Festplatte hat zwei Partitionen ( a1 und a 2 genannt ) .
Unter Windows würde diese Konfiguration so aussehen :
Festplatte a , Partition 1 ( hda1 ) : Laufwerk C :
hda2 : Laufwerk D :
hdb1 : Laufwerk E :
Diskette : Laufwerk A :
CD - ROM : Laufwerk F :
Unter Linux gibt es nur ein Dateisystem , nicht die fünf aufgeführten wie im Windows - Beispiel .
Jedes Laufwerk ist in den Verzeichnisbaum eingebunden ( mounted ) und funktioniert wie ein Ordner .
Die Laufwerke können daher zum Beispiel wie folgt platziert werden :
hda1 : / ( das Root - Verzeichnis )
hda2 : /home
hdb1 : /home/user/music
Diskette : /mnt/floppy
CD - ROM : /mnt/cdrom
Die Laufwerke D : und E : sind in Laufwerk C : eingebunden , daher muss man sich zum Laufwerkwechsel nicht erst bis ganz oben im Verzeichnisbaum durchhangeln .
Der Wechsel geschieht nahtlos beim Wechsel von einem Ordner zum anderen .
Dasselbe gilt für das Disketten - und das CD - ROM - Laufwerk :
Sie werden einfach unter / mnt in das ( einzige ) Dateisystem eingebunden .
Diese Laufwerke können im Prinzip an einer beliebigen Stelle in einem Linux - System eingefügt werden , je nachdem , wie die Installation ( oder der Benutzer ) die Datei /etc / fstab eingerichtet hat , in der man dem Computer mitteilt , wo und wie Geräte eingebunden werden ( vgl. Abbildung A ) .
Auren Hoffman of RapLeaf has a blog post entitled
Why big high tech companies are losing the talent war where he writes
In today 's hot startup market , it is essentially irrational to join a big company .
That means that big companies are only attracting “ B ” and “ C ” players or they are attracting irrational A players .
And they are losing all those great “ A ” players they hired in the dog days of 2002 ( most of which now have fully vested stock - options ) .
Essentially , when the economy is good and massive amount of startup activity is happening , the big companies suffer .
Just think about it …when you see the Google $ 1.65 billion acquisition of YouTube , does that make you want to work more for a Google or for a potential YouTube ?
I venture to guess that you ’ll want to go out there and work for startups like POSTroller and Blip.tv [ Disclosure : Auren is an investor in POSTroller and is on the advisory board of Blip.tv and both companies are looking to recruit “ A ” players right now ]
Now there are some rational “ A ” players that are still going to large companies .
In order to recruit rockstar engineers , companies like Google significantly increase the pay and offer too many perks to list .
And some people have their own reasons to join these tech companies .
Niall Kennedy , a true “ A ” player , joined Microsoft last April because he wanted to be at the epicenter of the PC user experience .
Like a scientist attracted to a university with great resources , Niall was attracted to Microsoft not to make a personal profit but to build true , long - lasting innovations .
Unfortunately Niall left four months later when he realized corporate bureaucracy can stifle innovation .
I disagree with the core premise of this post but it did get me thinking about how to differentiate the typical employee at a big company like Microsoft or IBM from the typical person who joins a startup .
After watching a couple of people leave Microsoft for startups , I think I 've put my finger on the core difference between the kind of people you see toiling at a startup versus the ones you see as faceless cogs in a giant corporation .
There are basically two kinds of people that you 'll find a lot of at large software companies like Microsoft and IBM but rarely at startups
The Indentured : For example , all those foreign workers on H - 1B visas The Risk Averse : For example , the kind of folks with a spouse , kids and / or a mortgage .
After a few years of watching people , these are the actual differences I 've seen between startup folks and corporate ladder climbing types .
It 's not some silly distinction as to whether the person is an " A " player or not .
An interesting consequence of this difference is the culture of the work environment .
A place full of people who do n't want to rock the boat because they are risk averse or indentured is n't the kind of place that will produce a project as fundamentally risky as YouTube .
Even though all the big Web companies had online video offerings from MSN Video to Google Video , it was YouTube that won .
How ?
By doing things that the typically cautious , risk averse folks in big companies like Google and Microsoft did n't consider like allowing user uploaded content and not bothering to have an " approval " process to ensure only appropriate videos showed up .
YouTube was clearly a lawsuit magnet of the sort that would never fly at a big company .
That is the difference between startups and big technology companies
As I discussed previously , I submitted a document ( CDR 3 ) to the Common Lisp Document Repository .
It 's now getting closer to the time when that document needs to be finalized or withdrawn ; I have some minor changes to make to it , but if there are any other issues with it they need to be brought up soon .
( There has been some discussion on the cdr-discuss mailing list , as well as some discussion of CDR 2 : this is encouraging ) .
The work that inspired that CDR submission was work I 've been doing to allow extensions of the sequence type in SBCL .
I 've now merged a preliminary version of that work into SBCL's CVS .
It 's currently undocumented ; although I expect the final version of this to be very close to what is in CVS now , I 'd like to verify that other people find it possible to use the protocol .
Instead of documentation , which will be forthcoming once some details about publication are sorted out , I posted an example of using the protocol to the development mailing list .
The basic idea is that there are five protocol generic functions which need methods for a new sequence class ; once those methods are implemented , all of the Common Lisp sequence functionality will work on instances of the class ( so functions like find , position , delete - duplicates – in fact , all functions from the Sequences Dictionary , as well as a few stragglers ( the quantifiers such as some and every , and the read - sequence and write - sequence I /O functions ) .
However , the default implementation of iteration over sequences in my protocol is based on accessing the sequence by index ; for sequence types such as a doubly - linked list , both forward - and backward - iteration can be implemented more efficiently ; there are some extensible generic functions for performing that optimization .
Additionally , some standard functions ( like nreverse on doubly - linked lists ) can be implemented more efficiently than through the iterator protocol , so there are likewise some extensible generic functions for expressing that .
I look forward to receiving feedback , both on the CDR and on the extensible sequence facility ...
Mathematics students have cause to celebrate .
A University of New South Wales academic , Dr Norman Wildberger , has rewritten the arcane rules of trigonometry and eliminated sines , cosines and tangents from the trigonometric toolkit .
What 's more , his simple new framework means calculations can be done without trigonometric tables or calculators , yet often with greater accuracy .
Established by the ancient Greeks and Romans , trigonometry is used in surveying , navigation , engineering , construction and the sciences to calculate the relationships between the sides and vertices of triangles .
" Generations of students have struggled with classical trigonometry because the framework is wrong , " says Wildberger , whose book is titled Divine Proportions : Rational Trigonometry to Universal Geometry ( Wild Egg books ) .
Dr Wildberger has replaced traditional ideas of angles and distance with new concepts called " spread " and " quadrance " .
These new concepts mean that trigonometric problems can be done with algebra , " says Wildberger , an associate professor of mathematics at UNSW .
" Rational trigonometry replaces sines , cosines , tangents and a host of other trigonometric functions with elementary arithmetic . "
" For the past two thousand years we have relied on the false assumptions that distance is the best way to measure the separation of two points , and that angle is the best way to measure the separation of two lines .
" So teachers have resigned themselves to teaching students about circles and pi and complicated trigonometric functions that relate circular arc lengths to x and y projections – all in order to analyse triangles .
No wonder students are left scratching their heads , " he says .
" But with no alternative to the classical framework , each year millions of students memorise the formulas , pass or fail the tests , and then promptly forget the unpleasant experience .
" And we mathematicians wonder why so many people view our beautiful subject with distaste bordering on hostility .
" Now there is a better way .
Once you learn the five main rules of rational trigonometry and how to simply apply them , you realise that classical trigonometry represents a misunderstanding of geometry . "

Voters in Ohio can be forgiven if they feel they have been beamed out of the Midwest and dropped into a third - world autocracy .
The latest news from the state ’s governor ’s race is that the Republican nominee , Kenneth Blackwell , who is also the Ohio secretary of state , could rule that his opponent is ineligible to run because of a technicality .
We ’d like to think that his office would not ultimately do that , or that if it did , such a ruling would not be allowed to stand .
But the mere fact that an elected official and political candidate has the authority to toss his opponent out of a race is further evidence of a serious flaw in our democracy .
Ted Strickland , the Democratic nominee , is leading Mr. Blackwell by as much as 28 points , according to one recent poll .
In their panic , some Blackwell supporters have hit on the idea of trying to prevent the election from occurring .
One of them filed a complaint alleging that Mr. Strickland , who is a member of Congress , does not live in the apartment where he is registered to vote .
Mr. Strickland owns a condominium in another part of Ohio , and the complaint alleges that he actually lives there .
If Mr. Strickland was not a qualified voter , he would be prohibited from running for governor .
The complaint itself is without merit .
No one disputes that Mr. Strickland lives in Ohio , or that he is registered .
The only issue is which of his two homes he chose to register from , and the law gives voters with multiple homes broad discretion in choosing among them .
What is more interesting , and troubling , is the way the complaint is proceeding .
The county board that heard it broke down 2 to 2 , on party lines , about whether to hold a hearing .
In the case of a tie vote at the county level , complaints like these get forwarded to the secretary of state ’s office to be resolved .
Mr. Blackwell says he has designated his assistant secretary to handle duties that could conflict with his candidacy .
But passing these matters on to a subordinate who is a political ally and owes his job to the candidate hardly removes the conflict .
An old friend emailed me to ask :
“ I wanted to get your response to some basic questions concerning technologies available for creating an enterprise level application that is built upon a Web Server , Web based applications , and a large distribution model and collection model .
The project is starting from scratch and so there is no legacy code involved but other than that I wo n’t bore you with the details …
“ Would you head down the .NET route or J2EE ?
“ Which Web Server ( Apache , IIS , or something else ) should we use and why ?
“ Which Web development language ( ASP .
NET , Ruby , Ruby on Rails , Java , Python , etc. ) would you recommend and why ?
“ What do you use at your company and why ? ”
Ah , an excellent question , simultaneously impossible to answer and very easy to answer !
Sorry , I should stop speaking in riddles .
A while ago I wrote an article called Lord Palmerston on Programming in which I claimed that some of these programming worlds , like .NET and Java , were so huge and complicated that you never could really tell if they were going to be good enough for your needs until it was too late .
In particular , a debate between the C#/ .NET / IIS stack and the Java / J2EE / Apache / Solaris stack and the PHP / Apache / Linux stack could go on and on for years and years and you ’d never find the right answer .
That ’s because there are so many pros and cons of all these platforms that advocates of each side can debate and debate and never get any closer to the Truth , but it sure as heck is a fun debate .
You might think that if you could find someone with extensive experience in multiple platforms , they would be the right person to ask .
I have n’t found a lot of people like that .
What I do know for sure , though , is two things :
People all over the world are constantly building web applications using .
NET , using Java , and using PHP all the time .
None of them are failing because of the choice of technology .
All of these environments are large and complex and you really need at least one architect with serious experience developing for the one you choose , because otherwise you ’ll do things wrong and wind up with messy code that needs to be restructured .
Last summer when we had a group of interns build Copilot , we had to decide what language to use for new code .
I know that typically on new projects there ’s a long evaluation period where you decide what technology to use , along with lots of debates that include some crazy person actually wasting quite a lot of time evaluating Squeak and Lisp and OCaml and lots of other languages which are totally , truly brilliant programming languages worthy of great praise , but just do n’t have the gigantic ecosystem you need around them if you want to develop web software .
These debates are enormously fun and a total and utter waste of time , because the bottom line is that there are three and a half platforms ( C# , Java , PHP , and a half Python ) that are all equally likely to make you successful , an infinity of platforms where you ’re pretty much guaranteed to fail spectacularly when it ’s too late to change anything ( Lisp , ISAPI DLLs written in C , Perl ) , and a handful of platforms where The Jury Is Not In , So Why Take The Risk When Your Job Is On The Line ? ( Ruby on Rails ) .
Before you flame me , Ruby is a beautiful language and I ’m sure you can have a lot of fun developing apps it in , and in fact if you want to do something non-mission - critical , I ’m sure you ’ll have a lot of fun , but for Serious Business Stuff you really must recognize that there just is n’t a lot of experience in the world building big mission critical web systems in Ruby on Rails , and I ’m really not sure that you wo n’t hit scaling problems , or problems interfacing with some old legacy thingamabob , or problems finding programmers who can understand the code , or whatnot .
So while Ruby on Rails is the fun answer and yes I ’ve heard of 37 Signals and they ’re making lovely Ruby on Rails apps , and making lots of money , but that ’s not a safe choice for at least another year or six .
I for one am scared of Ruby because ( 1 ) it displays a stunning antipathy towards Unicode and ( 2 ) it ’s known to be slow , so if you become The Next MySpace , you ’ll be buying 5 times as many boxes as the .NET guy down the hall .
Those things might eventually get fixed but for now , you can risk Ruby on your two - person dormroom startup or your senior project , not for enterprisy stuff where Someone is Going to Get Fired .
Python get a half because it ’s on the border , about to cross the line from an “ interesting ” choice to a “ safe ” choice .
Oh and I know Paul told you that he made his app in Lisp and then he made millions of dollars because he made his app in Lisp , but honestly only two people ever believed him and , a complete rewrite later , they wo n’t make that mistake again .
The safe answer , for the Big Enterprisy
Thing where you have no interest in being on the cutting edge , is C# , Java , PHP , or Python , since there ’s so much evidence that when it comes right down to it zillions of people are building huge business - critical things in those languages and while they may have problems , they ’re not life - threatening problems .
How do you decide between C# , Java , PHP , and Python ?
The only real difference is which one you know better .
If you have a serious Java guru on your team who has build several large systems successfully with Java , you ’re going to be a hell of a lot more successful with Java than with C# , not because Java is a better language ( it ’s not , but the differences are too minor to matter ) but because he knows it better .
Etc .
What we ended up doing with the interns was just telling them that they had to build it in C# and ASP .
NET .
In particular , one intern , who wrote the website part of Copilot , had enough experience with ASP.
NET to know what things to avoid ( like viewstate ) and knew to avoid the gotchas that make it impossible to have two < forms > in one page , etc. etc. , so he did a beautiful job architecting the ASP.
NET code exactly the right way to begin with so we did n’t get into trouble later .
And the benefit was that not one minute was spent debating the merits of programming languages , a fruitless debate if I ’ve ever seen one .
Finally — as to what we use — Copilot is C# and ASP .
Net , as I mentioned , although the Windows client is written in C ++.
Our older in - house code is VBScript and our newer in - house code is C#. FogBugz is written in Wasabi , a very advanced , functional - programming dialect of Basic with closures and lambdas and Rails - like active records that can be compiled down to VBScript , JavaScript , PHP4 or PHP5 .
Wasabi is a private , in - house language written by one of our best developers that is optimized specifically for developing FogBugz ; the Wasabi compiler itself is written in C# .
Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track : The Letters of Richard P. Feynman edited and with an introduction by Michelle Feynman , with a foreword by Timothy Ferris Basic Books , 486 pp. , $ 26.00
Great scientists come in two varieties , which Isaiah Berlin , quoting the seventh - century - BC poet Archilochus , called foxes and hedgehogs .
Foxes know many tricks , hedgehogs only one .
Foxes are interested in everything , and move easily from one problem to another .
Hedgehogs are interested only in a few problems which they consider fundamental , and stick with the same problems for years or decades .
Most of the great discoveries are made by hedgehogs , most of the little discoveries by foxes .
Science needs both hedgehogs and foxes for its healthy growth , hedgehogs to dig deep into the nature of things , foxes to explore the complicated details of our marvelous universe .
Albert Einstein was a hedgehog ; Richard Feynman was a fox .
Many readers of The New York Review of Books are more likely to have encountered Feynman as a story - teller , for example in his book Surely You ’re Joking , Mr. Feynman ! , 1 than as a scientist .
Not many are likely to have read his great textbook The Feynman Lectures on Physics , 2 which was a best seller among physicists but was not intended for the general public .
Now we have a collection of his letters , selected and edited by his daughter , Michelle .
The letters do not tell us much about his science .
For readers who are not scientists , it is important to understand that foxes may be as creative as hedgehogs .
Feynman happened to be young at a time when there were great opportunities for foxes .
The hedgehogs , Einstein and his followers at the beginning of the twentieth century , had dug deep and found new foundations for physics .
When Feynman came onto the scene in the middle of the century , the foundations were firm and the universe was wide open for foxes to explore .
One of the few letters in the collection that discusses Feynman ’s science was written to his former student Koichi Mano .
It describes the fox ’s way of working :
I have worked on innumerable problems that you would call humble , but which I enjoyed and felt very good about because I sometimes could partially succeed … .
The development of shock waves in explosions .
The design of a neutron counter ….
General theory of how to fold paper to make a certain kind of child ’s toy ( called flexagons ) .
The energy levels in the light nuclei .
The theory of turbulence ( I have spent several years on it without success ) .
Plus all the “ grander ” problems of quantum theory .
No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it .
“ The ‘ grander ’ problems of quantum theory ” were only one item in a long list of Feynman ’s activities .
The phrase “ the ‘ grander ’ problems of quantum theory ” refers to the great work for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1965 : inventing the pictorial view of nature which he called “ the space - time approach . ”
This work began in 1947 as a modest enterprise , to calculate …
THE HOME INFORMATION TERMINAL - A 1970 VIEW

Abstract :
This article was published in Man and Computer .
Proc. int. Conf. , Bordeaux 1970 , pp. 48-57 ( Karger , Basel 1972 ) .
It is interesting to compare its 1970 proposals with the current situation , 30 years later .
I have decorated it with footnotes commenting on the 1970 situation and making comparisons .
Some of the improvements advocated in the paper are still yet to come .
I claim quite a few prophet points for it .
The 1970 paper
Visionaries have often proposed that homes be equipped with information terminals each consisting of a typewriter keyboard and a screen capable of displaying one or more pages of print and pictures .
The terminal is to be connected by the telephone system to a time - shared computer which , in turn , has access to files containing all books , magazines , newspapers , catalogs , airline schedules , much additional public information not now kept , and various files personal to the user .
Through the terminal the user can get any information he wants , can buy and sell , could communicate with persons and institutions , and process information in other useful ways .
Such a system has never come about because it costs too much , but with each advance in technology , it becomes more feasible .
I think that the technology of computers , time - sharing , terminals , and application programming has advanced to the point where realistic estimates are possible of the remaining advances necessary to make home consoles feasible and useful .
In this paper , I shall discuss the uses of the home terminal , some potential beneficial effects on society , estimate how far we are from a system people will pay for , and advocate some pilot projects , some standardization efforts , and some laws and regulations to prevent monopoly and secure adequate competition .
We can start with ordinary reading .
To get a newspaper or book , I type its name or number and the first page appears .
The most obvious benefits are :
(1) I can get any document instantly .
(2) My house is not full of paper to be sorted and put on shelves and dusted or put in the trash .
Trees are not cut down , and air pollution does not result from burning the stuff .
Some immediately apparent disadvantages are :
(1) The expense .
I will deal with this later ;
(2) I can not read in bed .
The book - size portable terminal will come later .
A household may require several terminals or perhaps we may have to compromise with sin and provide a hard copy terminal after all .
There are two other immediate negative reactions :
(1) The average citizen is a TV fan and does not read anyway .
In the first place , our system does not need so many subscribers to be economical .
Secondly , after I have described all the bells and whistles , you will see that even the TV fan will be tempted , and you - oh socially conscious reader - may even want to coerce him into buying one or coerce the government into giving him one for free .
(2) How can you think of one more convenience and comfort when the world will come to an end in 10 years unless menaces A , B , and C are dealt with immediately .
In the first place , I do not think the world is about to come to an end or even that it is getting worse , and we Americans like new gadgets .
In the second place , you will see that the new information system will make the public more responsive to the careful reasoning of you good guys and more immune to the blatant propaganda of those bad guys .
In order to see the effects of the new information system , suppose that all book and newspaper information were so distributed .
What changes would occur ?
At present , a newspaper or a book is a package produced by a large organization .
In our new system , the physical production disappears allowing a much smaller organization to put out the same packages of text and pictures .
Moreover , the user does not face a one shot decision to buy Life or Look .
He will be able to read the ' cover ' or table of contents of each and read such items as strike his fancy , and the system will bill him for what he reads from each source .
In fact , since the cost of keeping a file of information in the computer and making it publicly available will be small , even a high school student could compete with the New Yorker if he could write well enough and if word of mouth and mention by reviewers brought him to public attention .
What , then , is a publication in the new information system ?
A publication is an organization that puts out a list of material it has edited and recommends to its readers .
It helps its authors produce material that it thinks will suit the readers , and it has a financial arrangement with them about splitting the proceeds .
There can be a wide variety of publications of different standards of writing and editing and different budgets for carrying out these activities .
However , they will all be equally accessible to all readers , and the only justification for an expensive editorial organization will be that it can produce a more popular package .
The price of reading a package can be set by the publishers .
A reader may feel that he needs help in finding his way through the totality of literature available to him .
Various people will be eager to make a living by providing it .
A bookstore or library is a program that when called shows the ' covers ' of publications .
Reviewers will produce lists for him and make money when he reads their lists or by kickbacks from the publishers .
' Reading advisers ' under some catchier name will offer to generate lists just for him according to a profile of his interests . .
Advertising in the sense of something that can force itself on the attention of a reader will disappear because it will be too easy to read via a program that screens out undesirable material .
However , people will still want to know what is for sale and will still want to see the seller 's story about why they should buy it .
Probably , Life will still be able to get money from advertisers ; many people will still want to know what is advertised in Life , but those who do not want to know will be able to avoid it automatically .
Another effect is the possibility of frequent revisions of articles and books .
An author can take into account new facts or other people 's criticisms , and the revision will take effect immediately .
This raises 1984ish possibilities , so it must be provided that old versions remain available .
Those who suspect the whole system will keep their own copies of favorite material in their private files , on microfilm , or even on paper .
Public controversy can be carried out more expeditiously than at present .
If I read something that seems controversial , I can ask the system if anyone has filed a reply .
This , together with an author 's ability to revise his original statement , will lead people to converge on considered positions more quickly than at present even if they do not come to actual agreement .
Famous authors will not need publishers because their loyal readers will have the system find their stuff automatically .
To summarize : the new information system will promote intellectual competition by reducing the price of entry , will permit readers to be selective , and will allow authors to revise material until they are satisfied that it withstands criticism as well as it ever will .
This should make intellectual life more interesting .
The financial aspect of writing would presumably be as follows : a piece of written material has a price for reading it ( this price may be zero for amateur writing , political propaganda , advertising , and for scientific journals ) .
The reader 's account is debited and the account to which the material belongs is automatically credited .
The reader will have the system balk at what he considers overpriced material .
The new information system will have a profound effect on buying and selling .
Sellers of movies , groceries , automobiles , plumbing services and cures for baldness will find it advantageous to list their wares in the information system together with current prices and availability .
The user can place an order through the system as he can by telephone , but he can do much more :
(1) He can call on someone 's program to scan the sellers of sports cars and propose what it considers the best deal .
This program might even negotiate with programs representing the sellers .
(2) He can tell the system whether last year 's cure for baldness worked and get a summary of the opinions of those who bothered to record their opinions of the cure he contemplates trying now .
(3) He can make an airplane or hotel reservation by interacting with a program the airline or hotel reservation company has written to tell him what is available .
He need not suffer the delays you now get when you call an airline or travel agent at peak hours .
(4) Individual design and construction services can be offered through the system although this requires the development of computer - controlled manufacturing techniques for various types of articles .
The idea is that automated design programs can produce designs for articles meeting individual specifications .
Either by himself or in consultation with an expert , an individual would use the system to produce a design and display how it would look and possibly how it would perform .
Candidates for individual design include clothing , furniture , boats , electronic equipment , houses , and even cars .
The system would then produce the instructions for controlling machine tools , fabric cutters , and also printed instructions for the hand parts of the operation .
In general , it should be possible to make single objects at little more cost than present mass produced objects .
In some cases , there would even be savings , because mass production requires estimates of demand that are often wrong resulting in inventories that are expensive to sell or even have to be sold at a loss ; the cost of this is made up by a general increase in prices .
There are many more useful services that can be offered through the new information system and again the system is conducive to competition .
Writing and storing a program and announcing its availability can be a very low capital operation , and the system can collect whatever price has been set for its use .
We could go on listing services that would come to be offered in a fully developed system , but now we shall list some services to smaller groups of users that are cheaper to provide and which will help get the system started .
(1) Calculation and facilities for writing , running , and debugging computer programs :
This does not interest the general public much , but it is the present bread and butter of the time - sharing service bureaus that will grow into the new information system .
At present , these service bureaus offer a very convenient way of doing small scientific and engineering calculations , but do not offer reasonable prices for big computations , and are only beginning to offer useful services to business firms .
(2) Editing : Anyone who writes ( writers , journalists , scientists , advertising men , engineers and students ) will benefit from using an editor program .
It allows easy revision , can be made to check spelling , grammar , and punctuation , and will produce justified or other forms of elegant output and also indexes .
(3) Filing : Keeping personal files in the computer has great advantages once documents can be entered without retyping them , either because they have been prepared in a computer readable form or because a suitable page reader is available .
Namely , one can retrieve any document on the basis of its characteristics without having taken the trouble to file it properly in the first place .
(4) Education : Computer - aided instruction ( CAI ) has advanced to the point that a number of courses or aids to traditional courses have been developed and have been shown to be useful .
The main obstacle to the widespread use of CAI is economic , but new developments in display technology and communications give a reasonable probability of cost - effective systems within this decade .
There is no special problem in having these systems available in the home as well as at school .
This would be aided by standardizing course writing languages .
Again , we should try to stimulate competition by encouraging the offering of courses in particular subjects independent of the schools . .
The development of such a system is probably inevitable ( unless it is forbidden by law ) as soon as costs come down to the point where it is profitable for time - sharing service bureaus to offer services to individuals .
However , favorable policies will bring this about sooner and will make the effects better .
The main danger to be avoided is the creation of services of limited scope that through some avoidable feature cannot be expanded to provide the services mentioned here and many more .
Another problem is to avoid monopolies ; the intrinsic nature of the system permits any person who can write computer programs to compete with large organizations in inventing and offering imaginative services , but one can worry that the system might develop commercially in some way that would prevent that .
In general , we should try to develop information services in such a way as will enhance the individuality of its users .
Between us and the home information system lie a number of problems ; some in developing suitable low - cost terminals , some in programming technology of time - sharing , some in the economics and politics of communication systems , and some in the attitude of the public and government towards innovation .
In the following sections we shall discuss these problems .
How we Get There from Here
1. Consoles
The quality and price of display consoles is rapidly improving .
At present , one can add a display console with keyboard to our laboratory system for about $ 700 , but to add another part on the system so that the number of consoles active at one time is increased by one costs about $ 2,500 .
A reasonable display console that can be located at the end of a telephone line now costs about $ 10,000 .
These consoles are adequate for any of the services mentioned in the previous section , although for reading purposes , it would be desirable to be able to display more than 35 typed lines at a time .
In my opinion , the cost of an adequate display terminal that can be located at the end of a telephone line will be in the $ 500 to $ 1000 range by 1975 even without a market of the size of the potential home - terminal market .
The business , engineering and science , and government markets will be large enough and price sensitive enough to bring this about .
Another contender as a terminal is the plasma panel , but the above estimates are based on CRT terminals with a mini-computer and an integrated circuit memory .
2. Communications
In the United States , the facilities for digital communications are growing rapidly but in a rather disorderly way because of the multiplicity of requirements of the different applications .
Some applications such as credit verification require very low - cost short communications with turn - around times of seconds .
Others require very low cost per bit but can stand delays of minutes and hence are candidates for low performance store and forward systems .
The terminal systems require long holding times , short response times , and much higher transmission rates from the computer to the user than in the other direction .
For the purposes of the home terminal , the speeds of transmission over present unconditioned voice - grade circuits are a bit too low for such applications as reading .
1200 bits per second would take 20 sec to transmit a typed page and about 4 times that for a page of a dictionary .
Eight times this rate is obtained over conditioned voice - grade lines , and this might be barely adequate .
Perhaps a better bet is the transmission facility planned for the picturephone service now being introduced experimentally , but the cost of this service for long holding times is not yet determined .
The most economical system might be a specially designed store and forward system configured to give fast turn - around for short messages .
Whether such a service will be made available depends on political as well as technical factors .
For example , if on the basis of present plans , the digital communication market is divided by regulatory action among AT&T and its potential competitors , it might turn out that no one is obliged or even allowed to offer the service required for home terminals at a reasonable cost .
3. Computer Technology
At present , computer technology can offer the services required for the home terminal at a reasonable cost , provided computer configurations are optimized for the purpose , provided reasonable load factors can be obtained , and provided there are reasonable economies of scale .
Unfortunately , IBM computers are organized in such a way that time - sharing is very expensive because of their interrupt - structure , their expensive terminal multiplexors , and their dedication to the archaic half duplex method of communication .
The other major computer manufacturers such as CDC , General Electric , and Univac are not in much better shape since they offer for time - sharing machines that were optimized for other purposes .
Smaller companies like DEC are in a somewhat better position .
However , none of these difficulties are permanent , and better organized computers may be expected once the factors in computer design that make for good cost - performance in time - sharing become clearer to the manufacturers .
The present magnetic disk storage units are a bit marginal in cost effectiveness for use with home terminals .
Thus storage on the new IBM 3330 disk would cost a user about $ 0.03 per month to store a typewritten page making storage of extensive personal files expensive and private copies of books at $ 5 to $ 10 per month prohibitively expensive .
This would not be too expensive for national libraries , but it would be economically very difficult to get enough readers to support the storage of books on magnetic disk files in the near future .
Fortunately , much larger files are becoming available .
The laser file made by Precision Instruments Inc. is claimed to store a trillion bits and costs $ 1,000,000 .
This comes to about $ 4 per book which is reasonable even for single copies .
Mass production of such files will reduce the cost even further .
4. Computer Programming
The basic technology of writing time - sharing technology is reasonably well - developed in that cost - effective systems have been written , but there is still a lot of chasing of willow - the - wisps , and quite bad time - sharing systems are often produced by otherwise competent firms .
Before the programming required to offer the services mentioned in the first part of this paper can be accomplished , some further advances need to be made including at least the following :
(1 ) the interactive and file reference aspects of programming languages and time - sharing systems need to be standardized so that an interactive system written in one system can be used in another that uses different hardware and a different time - sharing system .
Without this it will be very expensive for new user services to get large markets unless some particular timesharing system gets a monopoly ;
( 2 ) a system needs to be developed for representing text in a computer that will include the full variety of alphabets , type fonts and character sizes and also be adaptable to diagrams , drawings and photographs .
The consoles also have to be adapted to this variety of styles .
This is an ultimate requirement ; much can be done with texts that are just regarded as sequences of latin letters ;
( 3 ) the biggest task , however , is the application programming itself .
5. Commercial Organization
From a social point of view , one of the attractive features of the provision of time - sharing services is that it is not a natural monopoly .
Communication is cheap enough for teletype - based time - sharing so that with local multiplexors , time - sharing bureaus can compete all over the United States .
In principal , it should be possible to have world wide competition .
The major force that might tend to reduce competition is the exclusive possession of proprietary programs or files .
Therefore , it is desirable to separate the ownership of programs performing services from the ownership of the service bureaus themselves and to encourage enough compatibility between different time - sharing systems so that the owner of a service program could provide it on a number of machines .
It is also important that important files be accessible and modifiable with suitable protections by actions initiated on other machines than the one that maintains the file .
6. Needs for Research and Development
The hardware required for home consoles will be too expensive for extensive systems for probably another 5 years .
In the meantime , research and development should be undertaken in the following areas :
( l ) standarization of the interfaces of time - sharing systems and their languages ;
( 2 ) experimentation with services .
At present , it is very difficult to get support for development of generally useful services unless either it can be claimed that disaster will result from failure to support the activity or that the supporting organization will itself make a profit .
This political fact is one of the reasons for the concentration on military technology in the recent past ;
( 3 ) research aimed at devising ways of coordinating the great variety of time - sharing services into a mutually communicating network .
Neither sufficient understanding nor sufficient political or commercial force is available to cause the development of timesharing services to proceed according to a unified plan .
Nevertheless , computers are flexible enough so that originally incompatible systems can be made to communicate and use each other 's services .
Experiments with the ARPA network that provides communication between US Government - sponsored research computers will provide useful information .
7. Comments on the Conference
In general , the conference showed a poor situation in the scientific and technological community and also the public affairs community regarding technology and the human future .
There were a few technically competent but rather narrow surveys of the state and prospects of particular tool areas of technology .
There was much random doom - saying and denunciation of currently fashionable whipping boys .
There was a fair amount of opinion that certain things should not be done .
There was an almost total lack imaginative discussion of the opportunities technology offers us to improve human life .
This lack was especially notable in those individuals and organizations that are supposed to be professionally concerned with the matter .
This essay represents a small effort to redress the balance .

It has been widely reported that Apple secured a patent worth a " billion dollars . "
According to a patent attorney involved in the issue , Apple will be " after every phone company , film maker , computer maker and video producer to pay royalties on every download of not just music but also movies and videos . "
The good news is that all the news reports were based on misleading hyperbole ; the sole source of the flurry of articles about the billion dollar patent was a press release issued by the same patent attorney who represented the patent , and stood to gain the most from a wild spin on its actual valuation .
The patent in question was described in such glowing words that it nearly overshadowed the clear intent of the press release , which was really all about the patent attorney , Michael Starkweather .
After all , it was given the headline : “ Apple Settlement Decision Lands Patent Attorney in Public Spotlight . ”
Me Me Me !
After effusively describing the absolutely tremendous value of the patent , the press release immediately recommended Starkweather as someone available to " valuate " the patent portfolios other companies might hold .
Rather strikingly , the press release made only a passing mention of the patent 's inventor , which it left unnamed , and only referred to Apple and the iPod as benefactors of the " valuating " service Starkweather provides .
It spent three paragraphs on his illustrious career ; apparently , he ’s the most important patent clerk since Albert Einstein .
If Apple , as a publicly traded company , secured a patent worth a billion dollars , why did n't it notify its investors ?
Apple makes little public mention of its patents .
That modest secrecy is exploited by reporters who dig through patent applications related to the company , hoping to find nuggets that might shed light on its future products .
Unfortunately , these patent reports are rarely very useful in proving clear clues to Apple 's next batch of products , because patent applications are purposely written to be as broad and generalized as possible .
Applications are also published 18 months after they are filed , making any news in them rather stale .
What is a patent , how do patents affect products , why are they so contentious , and how will Apple use this new patent ?
Here ’s a look at some answers .
The Purpose of Patents
The Latin root of patent literally means " to lay open . "
Patented inventions are " laid open " for society 's benefit , and in exchange , inventors are given limited rights to benefit from their development work .
Inventors file an application that describes their invented device , method , or substance in detail .
If they are granted a patent on their invention , they hold the exclusive rights to commercially benefit from it for a specific period of time , usually 20 years .
Since the public benefits tremendously from commercial investment in the invention of new technology , the legal protections of patent law increase the potential for a significant return on those investments , in order to encourage new research and development .
Investment Incentive
Patent law protects ideas the same way property law protects real estate .
Who would invest in home improvements if anyone else , at any time , could suddenly assume control of their home ?
Similarly , how many people would invest their money in developing new technology if there were no potential for payback ?
In a world without any patent protection , no pharmaceutical company could afford to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop , test , and gain regulatory approval for new drugs , because as soon as it finished , another company could simply copy the end results of its work .
Without intellectual property laws , there would be no commercial basis for working to achieve anything .
Patents provide a legal mechanism for funding commercial research that would otherwise have no business model .
Open vs Proprietary
Open source software is an example of non-commercial development work : its free solutions are often voluntarily supported by companies who directly benefit from its contributions .
That works well in some areas , but in others , it can not always effectively compete against research and development directly motivated by the potential for profit .
In our existing world of patent law , open source ideas can also come under threat by moneyed interests who hold patents .
The accomplishments of free and open source collaborations often can't afford to license ideas that are patented , or wade through the complicated and expensive legal bureaucracy created to manage patents .
Patented ideas are proprietary by definition : proprietary simply means owned , and patents are granted to an owner .
This creates contention and problems in the world of open source development , where the ownership of ideas is intentionally shared using licenses such as the GPL , which are designed to prevent exclusive control .
Open source projects are n't the only casualties of patent warfare .
Whenever a patent portfolio falls into the hands of attorneys hoping to fully exploit its potential value , the interests of both businesses and consumers are threatened .
Patently Absurd
Any system involving profits will be routinely exploited .
Until recent changes were made , US patent law granted inventors exclusive rights for 17 years after the patent was granted .
This allowed inventors to file a patent , then continuously delay the final granting date in secret until the invented idea was in widespread use .
Then , to the surprise of the business community , the patent would be granted , allowing the inventor to demand high royalty payments for already established technologies over the next 17 years .
The entire premise of a patent -- to be laid out in the open -- was perverted by this secret attack abuse , referred to as a submarine patent .
Inventor Jerome H. Lemelson was granted over 600 patents , including several that were issued after he died in 1997 .
Among them were machine vision patents originated decades before industry began using bar code scanners .
After the secretly held patents were granted , businesses that had developed their own technologies were hamstrung by the surfacing submarine patents and demands for royalties .
After Lemelson 's death , his estate used these patents to demand ongoing payments until 2004 , when 76 of the patent claims related to machine vision were finally determined to be unenforceable .
That happened only after millions were spent in court costs to defend against the royalty claims .
Another famous stealth patent case involved the GIF graphics format , which was introduced in 1987 .
By the early 90's , it was in wide used as a common file format on the web .
In 1994 , Unisys discovered that it held a patent covering the LZW file compression used by GIF ; the format 's creators were unaware that any part of GIF was covered by patented ideas .
Unisys began demanding royalty payments from any company producing software able to generate GIF files .
That prompted the creation of PNG as a replacement graphics format , along with a campaign to rid the world of GIFs , but most companies had little choice in the matter .
The Unisys patents finally expired in 2004 .
Patent vs. Copyright
While original inventions can be patented , creative or intellectual works are similarly protected by copyright .
Rather than protect ideas , copyright protects a specific expression of an idea .
In the US , exclusive rights to reproduce an article or song are automatically granted to its originator , but the basic ideas they express are not .
In 1985 , Digital Research released GEM , a graphical environment for DOS that appeared to be a direct copy of Apple 's Macintosh .
After Apple sued over copyright violations , Digital Research agreed to change a number of elements for GEM / 2 .
In particular , GEM / 2 stopped using a desktop background with icons or any resizable windows .
Those changes largely destroyed the software as a product .
Apple CEO John Sculley also threatened Microsoft with legal action in 1985 after the company demonstrated the original Windows 1.0 for the PC .
Since Microsoft , as one of the first Mac developers , had received early prototype Mac units for software development under non disclosure agreements , Sculley felt Microsoft had violated its agreement with Apple by incorporating many features of the Mac in its rival PC product .
In response , Microsoft 's Bill Gates threatened to stop development of Mac products ; the dispute was settled in a 1985 contract that granted Microsoft rights to Apple 's " visual displays " in exchange for two years of exclusively releasing Excel on the Mac as well as other continued Mac development .
That agreement ended up gutting Apple 's case for copyright infringement .
Microsoft Windows 2.0 , released in 1987 , and 1990 ’s Windows 3.0 incorporated more and more of the Mac 's unique features .
By the early 90s , Windows was beginning to look a lot like Apple ’s 1984 Macintosh and its 1983 Lisa .
Apple filed a copyright violation suit against Microsoft and HP in 1988 , listing nearly 200 graphic elements that it claimed were lifted from the Macintosh for use in Windows 2.0 and HP 's NewWave software , which ran on top of Windows .
In 1992 , the court ruled that most of the copyright claims were already covered under the 1985 agreement , and the remainder were ideas not protected by copyright .
Apple appealed , and a higher court affirmed those findings in 1994 .
Apple then filed for an appeal with the Supreme Court , but that court refused to revisit the case .
Problems with Litigation
The " look and feel " case served to distract Apple from continued innovation , while also forcing Microsoft to deliver software that was different enough from the Mac to make cross platform use of the two systems awkward .
Further , the earlier GEM lawsuit only served to weed out competition to Windows on the PC , leaving Apple with one strong competitor rather than a fractured set of also - rans .
Had Apple applied for patents covering its graphical desktop inventions , the results may have been very different .
Another alternative path Apple could have taken would have been to license its interface ideas to competitors , promoting interoperability and consistency .
Both Microsoft and Apple had already paid to license user interface ideas from Xerox , and Microsoft had also attempted to license the Mac interface for use on the PC .
By litigating rather than licensing , Apple not only lost time and effort , but also potential royalties , market leadership , and industry compatibility .
Patent Wars
After Apple 's failure to protect its software technology using copyright law , the industry increasingly turned to patents , both as offensive and defensive weapons in litigation .
During 1985 , there were less than 2,000 computer related patents granted in the US .
Today there are well over 150,000 in effect , and every year over 17,000 more are granted in the US alone .
That ’s a dangerous minefield for companies working to deliver new products .
For large companies with huge patent portfolios , cross licensing allows for a Cold War peace ; mutually assured destruction through ongoing , costly litigation is held in check by the threat of the devastating firepower of massive patent arsenals .
The ongoing dispute between Apple and Microsoft was finally resolved in 1997 under a cross licensing agreement .
Unfortunately , there is still a clear and present danger from rogue attorney cells that can launch surprise patent attacks .
Patents Against Open Source
In such attacks , the most vulnerable are the unarmed : open source developers who do n't even like the idea of software patents .
Patent terror attacks on collaborative resources that benefit society present a major problem .
Companies that support open source development have begun building their own patent portfolios as a defense .
Red Hat has 6 patents and 13 more pending .
Major patent holders including Novell , IBM , and others have committed their own legal efforts to defend open source projects from patent attack .
For companies that use open source software , the possibility of patented technology being laced into open source code is a problem .
While companies can effectively hide patent infringements within closed source , anyone can review open source code and then attack companies that make use of it with patent litigation .
SCO ’s Shock and Awe Attack on Linux
While Microsoft has announced attempts to cross license technology with Linux developers Novell and Red Hat , it has also supported SCO in its efforts to attack the legal legitimacy of Linux code .
Without the support of IBM 's legal force , Linux developers would have little recourse to defend against attacks from SCO attorneys armed with generalized legal threats of copyright violations .
SCO provides a warning example of the danger of patent warfare .
It was able to generate significant fear , uncertainty , and doubt about Linux despite the fact that it did n't even have any patents !
SCO even avoided direct copyright claims , basing its lawsuit against IBM on the generalized idea of “ trade secrets . ”
If a company can mount years of brutal and expensive legal attacks without any patents or even substantial copyright claims , consider the damage possible by litigious attorneys who discover a real and relevant patent !
Apple 's Patent Defense
Just like IBM , Apple has to file hundreds of patents annually just to remain competitive and protect its ability to do business in a highly litigious world where trivial ideas can be encumbered by ridiculous patents .
When Apple was sued this spring by Creative over accusations of patent infringement related to the iPod , it responded by countersuing Creative for infringement of its own patents .
The lawsuits were resolved in a $ 100 million settlement that cost Apple much less than an extended trial and made the companies partners in building iPod peripherals .
Faced with its recent $ 12.7 million loss , Creative viewed litigating for Apple 's iPod revenues as its best bet ; without its own patent arsenal , Apple would have faced a possible injunction stopping its entire iPod business , a long and expensive legal war , and a possible judgement giving Creative a significant portion of its iPod earnings .
All of that for a meaninglessly broad patent describing the basic idea of items placed in menus , a far simpler idea than those behind Apple 's " look and feel " lawsuit against Microsoft Windows more than a decade ago .
Gimme Gimme
Apple 's settlement stipulated that if Creative entered into licensing agreements with other music player manufacturers , it would pay portions of those royalties back to Apple .
However , Apple can't make similar deals with other inventors who have less to offer .
Two recent examples of patent attacks on Apple 's iTunes , from Hong Kong patent litigator Pat- rights , and Contois Music & Technology , seek patent infraction payoffs that are more difficult to solve in a mutually beneficial way .
Contois is the source of the supposed billion dollar patent mentioned above ; Apple 's solution was to simply buy it for an undisclosed amount .
In addition to Pat - rights , another litigious patent company , Burst.com , is suing Apple over patents related to QuickTime streaming .
Burst.com also sued Microsoft , which last year paid for a $ 60 million license to end the suit .
Apple claims the patents are invalid .
Apple 's Patent History
Apple , like most successful companies , prefers to focus its efforts on selling products , not the uncertain profits of ongoing litigation .
It is primarily entities that have no ability to compete in the marketplace that are willing to gamble on big payoffs from patent suits .
The above mentioned Pat - rights , for example , hoped to take 12 % of Apple 's revenues related to iTunes and the iPod , plus licensing fees , based on their sketchy " invention " of verifying a machine over a network for DRM .
Its attorneys also filed for an injunction against further distribution of the free iTunes .
Rather than attempting to highjack or shut down competitors , Apple has worked to turn its extensive patent portfolio into retail products or standards that can be licensed to other companies .
That 's not always easy .
When it tried to charge a $ 1 licensing fee for FireWire , Sony and other patent holders pushed for theoretical fees that priced it out of the market .
It also induced Intel to counter FireWire with a new , competing version of USB .
Apple decided to spin FireWire off as an open standard to a group which licensed the technology for a quarter , but USB 2.0 has since become ubiquitous for low end peripherals , marginalizing Apple ’s technically superior and faster FireWire standard .
Given Apple 's history of defensive patent use , Starkweather 's claim that Apple will spend its resources suing everyone over media downloads is a poorly supported idea .
Of course , given the abject failure of everyone else attempting to run an online music or media store , there 's really nobody to sue anyway .
It appears that the patent attorney was just tooting his horn to drum up more work in the patent assault business .
Press releases tend to do that .
This Series
Microsoft has finally conceded support for the OpenDocument Format in its Office products .
This Thursday , the company will release a sponsored piece of software on SourceForge .
net called the Open XML Translator , which will convert documents between Microsoft 's own Open XML format and the OpenDocument Foundation 's OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) .
The plug - in will allow users to open and save documents in the ODF format , and as an added bonus it will work with older versions of Microsoft Office , not just the new 2007 version .
Being developed by a French partner company called Clever Age , Microsoft 's goal is to have the plug - in available by the end of this year , and have it working with Excel and PowerPoint at some point in 2007 .
What made Microsoft decide that ODF support was important ?
Microsoft 's general manager of interoperability and standards , Tom Robertson , has the answer .
" We 're hearing that ( customers ) do n't want homogeneity -- they want diversity ; they want translatability .
And some customers are saying they would like us to focus on this to a certain extent , to make sure the product is high quality . "
Although everything sounds peachy , one major catch is that some Office features wo n't be available when users choose to save a document with the ODF setting .
This is mainly because of the difference in formats between ODF and Open XML .
Nevertheless , this development is a major step for Microsoft in the world of Free and Open Source Software , especially since the company has chosen to use SourceForge rather than its own CodePlex site to host the plug-in .
Once the Open XML Translator plug - in is finalized at the end of the year , it will be interesting to see how it stacks up next to the ODF Plugin developed by the OpenDocument Foundation Inc .
In any case , Microsoft has finally realized that ODF is growing in popularity and that the safest bet is to support both Open XML and ODF .
It 's all about choice , right ?
My question to you is whether you like having the two different formats , or would you rather see Microsoft work closely with the OpenDocument Foundation in order to come up with one ruling format for the future ?
1. 山梨県警がこの機会に職員に周知すべきこと
またもや悲惨なプライバシー漏洩事故が起きてしまった。
警察からの機密漏洩はこれで発生時期として4度目、件数として6回目になる。
昨年の岡山県警のケースでは、巡査長がWinnyでダウンロードしていたファイルが「漫画や音楽やそのほかいろいろ」であることまで判明したにもかかわらず、「他人への譲渡などはなかった」という理由で、巡査長の著作権法違反容疑での立件をしなかった（読売新聞報道より）という経緯がある。
Winny情報流出処分 著作権法違反、巡査長の立件見送る 県警＝岡山 , 大阪読売新聞 2006 年 6月10 日 朝刊 ◆県警 「 譲渡ない 」 （略）巡査長を減給処分とした9日の会見で、柴山克彦警務部長は改めて県民に向けて謝罪し、セキュリティー対策の徹底を約束した。一方、巡査長の個人パソコンには不正にダウンロードした数種類のファイルが残っていたこともわかったが、県警は他人への譲渡などはなかったとして、著作権法違反での立件を見送ることを決めた。
（略）会見では、巡査長が2004年夏ごろから個人パソコンでウィニーの使用を開始し、流出したのは今年2月26日だったことも明らかにされたが、どのようなファイルをダウンロードしていたかについては「漫画や音楽やそのほかいろいろ。プライバシー情報にあたるので公表は差し控えたい」と答えるにとどめた。
県警は、再発防止策として、全職員約４３００人にファイル交換ソフトを使用しないことなどを記した誓約書を提出させたほか、業務使用を認めた約２３０台の個人パソコンを全廃し、公用パソコンを配備。外部記録媒体に捜査情報などを保存する際、文書の内容を自動的に暗号化するソフトを導入した。（略）
Winnyで音楽ファイルをダウンロードしても著作権法違反にならないのかについては、まず次を見てみる。
電子商取引等に関する準則 平 成18 年2月版 , 経済産業省 【論点】 PtoP ファイル交換ソフトを用いて、音楽などのファイルを無断でインターネット上へアップロードする行為やインターネット上からダウンロードする行為は著作権法違反となるか。また、PtoP ファイル交換サービスを提供する行為はどうか。（略） ( 1 ) 問題の所在 近年、ナップスターやグヌーテラと呼ばれるインターネット上でのユーザー同士による音楽等のファイルの交換を支援するソフトウェア（以下「 PtoP ファイル交換ソフト」という。）が出現し、著作権者及び著作隣接権者の利益が損なわれるおそれが生じてきている。（略）
( 2 ) ユーザーの行為 �．▲奪廛蹇璽氷坩� （略）したがって、故意又は過失によって権利者の許諾を得ずにPtoPファイル交換ソフトを用いて音楽等のファイルをインターネット上で送信可能にした者は、複製権（同法第21条、第91条第1項、第96条、第98条、第100条の2）又は公衆送信権若しくは送信可能化権（同法第23条、第92条の2
、第96条の2、第99条の2、第100条の4）を侵害しており、損害賠償責任を負うと解される（民法第709
条）。また、故意過失の有無に関わらず権利侵害があった場合又は侵害のおそれがある場合には権利者から差止請求を受けることもあり（著作権法第112 条）、さらに、刑事責任として３年以下の懲役又は300 万円以下の罰金を課されることがある（同法第119 条）。 �▲瀬Ε鵐蹇璽氷坩� 他方 、PtoPファイル交換ソフトを用いて権利者によって許諾されていない音楽等のファイルを他のユーザーからインターネット経由で受信し複製する行為（ダウンロード行為）は、技術的保護手段の回避等によって行ったものではなく、かつ個人的に又は家庭内その他これに準ずる限られた範囲内において使用する限り、私的複製に相当し、著作権又は著作隣接権の侵害には当たらないものと解される（同法第30条第1項、第102条第1項）。
ただし、受信した複製物を私的使用の目的以外に使用する場合は複製権（同法第21条、第91条第1項、第96条、第98条、第100条の2）の侵害となり（同法第49条第1項第1号、第102 条第4項第1号）、損害賠償責任（民法第709条）、権利者からの差止請求（著作権法第112 条）、刑事責任（同法第119条）の問題が生じる可能性がある。
なお、例えば、ユーザーがダウンロードしたファイルをそのまま自己のパソコンの公衆送信用記録領域に記録し、インターネット上で送信可能な状態にした（ダウンロード行為が同時にアップロード行為に相当する）場合は、当該ダウンロード行為は私的複製には相当しないため複製権侵害に該当すると解される。
Winnyは、ダウンロードしたファイルは、それと同時に、他の者からの求めに応じて送信する「自動公衆送信」が可能な状態にされる（送信可能化される）仕組みになっている（そのこと自体はBitTorrentでも同様である）のだが、他のP2Pファイル交換ソフトに比べて、その仕組みをユーザが自覚しにくいように作られている。
ユーザが知っていようが知らずにいようが、送信可能化されていることは事実であるので、差止請求を受けることがあるだろうし、損害賠償責任を負うこともあるのだろう。しかし、ユーザがその仕組みを知らなかった場合は、故意による送信可能化と認められずに刑事罰を免れるものなのかもしれない。
岡山県警倉敷署の巡査長がWinnyで音楽ファイルをダウンロードしながら著作権法違反で検挙されなかったのは、それが同時に公衆送信可能化となるものだという認識を巡査長が持っていなかったことが捜査で明らかになったからなのかもしれない。
昨 年6月の読売新聞報道にあった「他人への譲渡などはなかったとして」という表現はなかなか微妙なものだ。送信可能化はあったのに譲渡はなかったという。「譲渡」という言葉が故意によるものを指すというつもりなのだろうか？
この報道のせい で 「 Winnyによるダウンロードは合法」と誤って理解が広がってしまっているのだとすれば、それは岡山県警の会見発言が不用意なものだったせいだと言える。「ダウンロードが同時にアップロードになるという認識が巡査長にはなかったため」と岡山県警は発表するべきだった。
さて、今回の山梨県警の巡査はどうだろうか。これだけWinnyに関する報道や情報が多い中、この期に及んで、「学生時代からウィニーを使っていた」というのに、「ダウンロードすると公衆送信可能化される仕組みだとは知りませんでした」などと白を切ることができるのだろうか？
もちろん、本当に嘘偽りなく今回の巡査にもその認識がなかったのであれば、罰するわけにもいかないし、その著作権侵害が親告罪に該当する部分であるなら、著作権者からの告訴がなければ立件できない のだろう。
だがいずれにせよ、少なくとも、今回の事態への対応として山梨県警は次の措置をとることはできるはずだ。
内規とし てWinnyの使用を禁止するにあたり、禁止する理由として、ダウンロードが同時にアップロードになるというWinnyの性質を示して、ダウンロード行為が著作権法違反や、猥褻物陳列に当たることを明記する。
Winnyでのダウンロード行為が著作権法違反や猥褻物陳列となる旨を全職員に周知したことを公表する。
昨 年3月には警察庁が、私物のPCについてもWinnyの使用を禁止する通達をしている。
警察庁が緊急通達 「 私物PC で もWinny厳禁 」 , INTERNET
Watch , 2006 年3月8 日 警察庁は7日、全国の警察本部に対して、公務だけでなく私物のPCについてもP2Pソフト「 Winny」の使用を禁止する緊急対策を通達した。岡山県警や愛媛県警でWinnyによる捜査資料の流出が相次いだことを受け、情報セキュリティ対策の徹底を図る。
おそらくこのときは、禁止する理由として挙げられたのは、情報漏洩リスクを軽減するためというものだったのだろう。その程度の理由ではやめない警察官が全国に何十人か何百人かいて、今回その一人が漏らしてしまったということだろう。今回の報道でも、次のようにある。
婦女暴行被害者リストもネットに 山梨県警の捜査情報流出 , 産経新聞 , 2007年2月25 日 ウィニーをめぐっては、岡山や愛媛など全国の警察で資料流出が相次ぎ、県警では昨年３月、こうしたファイル交換ソフトを使用しないという内容の誓約書を全職員から提出させていた。一度ネットに流出した情報は、次々にコピーされて広まるため、削除することは実質的に不可能といわれている。 県警幹部は「あれほど全国で騒がれ、本人も誓約書を出しているはずなのに、まだウィニーを使っていた職員がいたとは信じられない」と憤った。
この機会に 、 「 Winnyでのダウンロード行為が著作権法違反や猥褻物陳列となる」という見解を警察庁なり、山梨県警なりが示すべきだ。知っていれば故意になるのだから、知らせるべきである。
もっとも、一般市民向けの一般論とし て 「 Winnyでのダウンロードは著作権侵害ですか？ 猥褻物陳列ですか？」と尋ねられれば、「場合により判断される」としか答えようがないというのはわかる。だが、警察職員向けの注意警告として禁止する理由でそう説明することは問題なくできるはずではないか。「著作権侵害又は猥褻物陳列に当たる可能性があるので使用してはならない」と。
さらに、そのように職員に指導したという事実を公表することにも問題がないはずだ。昨年あれだけ問題になって周知されたにもかかわらずそれでもなお同じ事故が再び起きたのでは、今後も延々と同じことが繰り返されると思われてしまうのだから、ここで、新しい手を打ったことを国民に知らせなければ、山梨県警、警察組織全体の信用が回復しないのではないか。
昨年の岡山県警の対応が適切だったならば、今回の山梨県警の事件は防止できたかもしれない。山梨県警が岡山県警と同じ過ちを繰り返すのかが注目だ。
2. 中継が4%の確率で起きるというが

Tiny cameras the size of a fingernail linked to specialist computers are to be used to monitor the behaviour of airline passengers as part of the war on terrorism .
Cameras fitted to seat - backs will record every twitch , blink , facial expression or suspicious movement before sending the data to onboard software which will check it against individual passenger profiles .
Scientists from Britain and Germany are spending £ 25 million developing a system which they hope will make it virtually impossible to hijack an airliner by providing pilots and cabin crew with an early warning of a possible terrorist attack such as 9/11 .
They say that rapid eye movements , blinking excessively , licking lips or ways of stroking hair or ears are classic symptoms of somebody trying to conceal something .
A separate microphone will hear and record even whispered remarks .
Islamic suicide bombers are known to whisper texts from the Koran in the moments before they explode bombs .
The software being developed by the scientists will be so sophisticated that it will be able to take account of nervous flyers or people with a natural twitch , helping to ensure there are no false alarms .
" We 're trying to develop technologies that indicate the differences between normal passengers and those who may be a threat to others , or themselves , " said Catherine Neary of BAE Systems .
Mrs Neary , team leader of the Onboard Threat Detection System for the Paris - based Security Of Aircraft In The Future European Environment ( SAFEE ) project , added : " Blink rates come from lie - detection research and suggest the stress level is higher than normal . "
The project is also developing automated flight controls that will prevent a hijacker taking over an airliner and sensors at the aircraft 's doors to detect if someone is carrying explosives or chemicals .
Mrs Neary said that under the Data Protection Act , all video , audio and other recordings would be destroyed at the end of every flight so that passengers ' civil liberties were not infringed .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of the human rights group Liberty , said : " Watching people constantly on aircraft and trying to work out patterns of behaviour is a difficult road to travel .
" I suspect that it will put people off flying because they will feel uncomfortable if their every blink and twitch is being monitored . "
Airlines gave the scheme a cautious welcome ,
indicating it would be too expensive to fit on existing commercial aircraft and that it would probably be ten years before such systems were fitted to new planes .
A British Airways spokeswoman said : " While we welcome new research and development which advances aviation security , we believe the emphasis and funding for any new initiatives would be better placed on preventing terrorists boarding aircraft in the first place .
" For example , research and development of better screening and detection equipment on the ground would be of more value at this time . "
If someone could tell you when you were going to die , would you want to know ?
It ’s no longer such a hypothetical question now that a “ death index ” can predict with 80 per cent accuracy whether or not someone over 50 is likely to die within four years .
Sei Lee , a geriatric specialist at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center , California , designed a 12 - question form based on data from nearly 20,000 people aged 50 and over , who took part in the US - wide Health and Retirement Survey between 1998 and 2002 .
Lee ’s team looked at who had died by the …
But in future there may be paid protesters in their ranks
Young , good - looking , and available for around 150 euros ( £ 100 ) , more than 300 would - be protesters are marketing themselves on a German rental website .
They feature next to cars , DVDs , office furniture and holiday homes .
For some , these protesters show how soulless life has become .
For others , they breathe new life into old causes .
Staging a protest
Their descriptions read like those on a dating site .
I would like to point out that not all protests will tally with my own point of view and I would like to distance myself from these
Demonstrators ' disclaimer
Next to a black and white posed picture , Melanie lists her details from her jeans size to her shoe size and tells potential protest organisers that she is willing to be deployed up to 100 km around Berlin .
Six hours of Melanie bearing your banner or shouting your slogan will set you back 145 euros .
A spokesperson for erento.com was unable to say how many demonstrators had been booked since the service was launched earlier this month , but that there had certainly been demand .
Organisations using the service are unlikely to reveal themselves , keen to pass off their protesters as genuine supporters of the cause .
But German media reported a Munich march had hired protesters because its own adherents were too old to stand for hours waving banners .
Erento.com stresses that no protester needs to offer their services to a cause they object to , and therefore many may genuinely believe in the protest they are joining .
But the fact they are paid has perturbed a number of commentators in Germany , especially those who remember the passion - fuelled protests of 1968 .
" It seems to confirm the increasingly common assumption , " wrote one , " that democracy is for sale " .
Months passed .
Then one night , I found a greeting card slipped under my door .
A greeting card .
They took the time to shop for the appropriate card to say exactly what they wanted to say .
Wow .
I had no idea I was keeping them up .
But what could I do ?
I had to come home at that hour , and it was n’t my fault the floor was squeaky .
More importantly , who bothers to write such a long and detailed letter just to say “ Keep it down up there ? ”
It seemed like every word was carefully chosen , written , re-read , and reconsidered .
I tested the floor in different areas , trying to find the creakiest spots so I could avoid them when I walk , and made an effort to be quieter when I came home from work .
One night , I came home to find the first in a series of notes slipped under my door .
Small writing filled both sides of a sheet of loose leaf paper .
I did n’t know what to make of it .
The note began , “ Dear Neighbor .
When you arrive late every night , you are probably concentrating on your chores and do n’t realize that this building , this street , the traffic , the people are all very still , very quiet . ”
The care and craftsmanship that went into writing this note was beyond anything I ’d ever heard of from an angry neighbor .
I continued reading .
My first year in New York , I lived on the top floor of an old building in Astoria , Queens , with rotted wood floors that creaked every time I took a step .
I did n’t mind so much , because my schedule was so hectic I was rarely home .
I got up early every day to get to my job by 9:00 a.m.
I was happy to work in a photo studio , but it did n’t pay enough to survive in this town .
So at 5:30 p.m. each day I left the studio and went to a bookstore across town , where I worked until 12:15 a.m. in order to make ends meet ( and another 8 hours on Sundays ) .
By the time I got back to Queens every night , hopefully before 1:30 a.m. , I was beat .
I ’d take an hour to wind down before finally going to bed , getting a few hours sleep , and starting over .
I opened it .
Inside it read :
Wow , that ’s touching .
They picked out the card , and even went through the trouble of using White Out to make it more relevant to the situation .
Who does that ?
Who were these people ?
How did they know my name ?
After all this time , I ’d still neither met them nor seen them .
Well , I was sorry to hear that I was still keeping them awake , but I was honestly doing everything I could possibly do within reason to minimize my noise .
Several more months passed with no notes about the noise .
I guess all my extra efforts to be quiet were paying off .
Then this arrived , slipped under my door :
A leak ?
That ’s much more serious than just some noise .
I called the number on the note and left a message , explaining that I ’d been having no plumbing problems , and no water was pooling in my bathroom or kitchen , so the water must be coming from somewhere else .
I do n’t recall exactly what I said , but I must have put forth some specific theory about water condensation and the shower , because later this note was slipped under my door :
Woah .
Not only was I still too noisy for them , but they were taking advantage of my noise to entice an unwanted guest to leave .
And that was so sweet of them to comment on my health .
I guess they could hear that I was hacking up a lung when I had that cold .
Well , at least the leaks had stopped .
Or so I thought .
A few weeks later , there was another note :
A waterfall ?
Coming from my apartment ?
Please !
I ’d had enough of this .
No more notes .
No more phone calls .
It was time to march downstairs , knock on Apartment 5 , and have a real conversation with these people face to face .
I went downstairs and knocked .
The door opened about 2 inches , and an eyeball stared at me .
We had a brief conversation that way , through the crack in the door .
I confess that I could n’t pay attention to the conversation very much because I suddenly found myself wondering what it was that this woman did n’t want me to see .
I remember she said something about her privacy and her beliefs being nobody ’s business , and she did n’t want me to see what her apartment looked like .
Okay .
I told her I had no idea what the cause of these leaks were , and suggested she bring it up with the building manager to see if they can figure it out .
I went back upstairs to my apartment .
It was n’t long before I received another note :
That was the last note I ever received from Apartment 5 .
A few weeks later , I moved .
Update :
This story now has a very interesting and surreal follow - up , which you can read here .

“ Temporary Promotions ”
At a former employer of mine it was common practice to only grant the pay raises and other benefits associated with a promotion six months after the promotion was given .
The official rationale was that management needed to know you were going to work out in the position .
Not suprisingly in practice the vast majority of promotions were recinded 4 - 5 months after they were announced .
They always managed to catch people slipping up SOMEHOW over that time .
It was an horrific system but jobs were so scarce in that area that no one quit .
( Obviously it was n't a union shop . )
Finally things came to a head when my friend and cubicle mate was promoted to group leader .
The poor guy was put on earth to do the kind of Quality Control work the job entailed .
He loved his job and worked at least three times faster than everyone else .
Better yet he was obsessive about being on time for everything never slacking off during work hours .
In a normal company he would have shot up the corporate ladder .
In this case the management freaked when they could n't trip him up after 5 months .
They started increasing his workload by the day .
To the point where he was doing five and a half peoples share of analysis .
He was my good friend and had a kid and needed the raise so I 'd stay late for the first week and would help him finish his work .
Then suddenly everyone was banned from assisting one another in their work load .
They finally got what they wanted and he missed a deadline and had his promotion canceled .
It was honestly the saddest sight I have ever seen in any workplace .
He literally cried the entire day in his cube while still doing his work faster than any of the rest of us .
" He 's quite visionary , " said Eric Kandel , Nobel - winning director of the Kavli Institute for Brain Science at Columbia University .
" We need more people like him . "
Just a few years after seriously beginning his mission to stimulate advances in nanotechnology , neuroscience and astronomy , Kavli has launched 14 research centres in academia 's most rarified halls .
The sites include Harvard , Yale , Stanford , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Holland 's Delft University of Technology , the University of Cambridge in England and , in China , Peking University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
Although Kavli requires universities to match much of the $ 7.5 million ( euro5.8 million ) he typically puts up for an institute , no school has turned him down .
Many find money for basic research so rare that they send Kavli 's foundation unsolicited appeals .
Kavli expects to eventually create 20 such centres .
And beginning in 2008 , $ 1 million ( euro780,000 ) Kavli Prizes in nanotech , neuroscience and astrophysics will be awarded every two years by the Academy of Sciences in Norway , where Kavli was born and first yearned to better grasp man 's place in the universe .
" I like to look far into the future , " Kavli said in his slightly lilting Norwegian accent .
" I think it 's important for the benefit of all human beings . "
While Kavli's $ 7.5 million ( euro5.8 million ) to inaugurate an institute is generous , by some measures it 's small .
New academic buildings , for example , often cost tens of millions of US dollars ( euros ) .
What makes Kavli 's model notable is that it resembles how a business builds a brand .
Between the Kavli institutes _ expected to be fed by an annual pool of $ 20 million ( euro15.5 million ) after his death _ the Kavli Prizes and regular gatherings of Kavli - funded researchers , Kavli hopes to create something larger than the sum of its parts : a growing organism of avant - garde research .
" Fred 's interest really is more abstract than most , because he wants to fund the very best of science and does n't care where it is , " said David Baltimore , a Nobel - winning biologist who helped launch the Kavli Institute for Nanoscience at the California Institute of Technology when he was the school 's president .
The Kavli Foundation 's momentum is widely credited to its president , David Auston , a former president of Case Western Reserve University in Ohio .
Auston 's connections and credibility have opened doors for the foundation , which is based in Oxnard , California .
But Kavli is not just the guy who signs the checks .
The vision at work here germinated in him long ago , when Kavli was a young dreamer in Norway , marveling at the ethereal glow of the Northern Lights .
Kavli appears to have always set his sights on achieving .
At age 13 , when World War II led to fuel shortages in Norway , he and his brother started a business making wood briquettes that could be burned to power cars .
They also sold planks to furniture factories .
He studied physics in college , then left Norway in 1955 for America with a classic immigrant 's narrative .
" I was ambitious , let 's face it , " he said with a wink .
After a year in Canada , Kavli joined a small Los Angeles company that developed flight controls for Atlas missiles .
Kavli rose to chief of engineering , but his entrepreneurial side beckoned .
So he put a simple ad in the newspaper : " Engineer seeking financial backing to start own business . "
What emerged was Kavlico , which specialized in navigational sensors for the defense and aircraft industries .
Kavli invested much of his resulting wealth in Southern California real estate .
He also became a well - known community donor near his company 's headquarters in Moorpark , California , putting his name on a local performing arts centre , and endowed some university professorships .
But not until he sold Kavlico for $ 345 million ( euro268.2 million ) to C - Mac Industries Inc. in 2000 did Kavli set his sights on a larger - scale legacy .
" It 's important to realize this guy 's kept a very low profile his whole life , until he came out with all this , " said Charles Vest , former MIT president and a member of the foundation 's board .
The foundation is getting most of Kavli 's money _ he is divorced and does not believe in leaving significant sums to his two children _ and his businessman 's emphasis on streamlining .
Its operations essentially consist of just Kavli , Auston , a communications director and a fund manager .
" One of the problems with philanthropy is to make it effective , and to use money so that it's not wasted away , " Kavli said .
That principle is partly why the foundation expects universities to put up their own resources to snare a Kavli Institute .
Kavli and Auston believe the rule ensures a university is committed to supporting its researchers in the long term .
Kavli has few concrete expectations for scientists who get his money , other than that they attend interdisciplinary gatherings every so often to share ideas .
" We do n't try to tell the institutes what to do , " he said .
" We try to just select the very best science teams and institutions and support them in what they want to do , and we expect them to choose the very best course of action . "

Success through specialization
In a fight between a bear and an alligator
Java is not an uninformed choice , and neither is Visual Basic
Conservative ?
Or just Uninformed ?
When you see a program written in a conservative , “ safe ” language , and you want to know whether the programmer is a made a fully informed choice , examine the source code looking for evidence that the programmer has been exposed to other programming paradigms .
You know , this whole “ Blub ” thing has too many negative connotations .
It has become , like “ Star - Bellied Sneetch , ” a way of labeling people .
“ You use J , therefore you ’re a Blub Programmer .
” “ There ’s no such thing as Blub , therefore I ca n’t be a Blub Programmer .
” For the remainder of this post , we are going to discuss things in terms of informed and uninformed choices .
This is a functional description and it focuses on a one - time behaviour .
If you like the old terms , you know where to find grep .
One argument against the idea that there is one overarching continuum of language or tool “ power ” is that tools specialize .
The most appropriate tool for building CRUD database - backed web applications may not be the most appropriate tool for building interactive games .
Within a particular specialization , there is still a continuum of power .
There may be a programmer who insists that Visual Basic backed ASP pages provide all the power she will ever need for CRUD web applications , and there is no need to Ruby , ASP .
NET , or any of the other advances on the technology she likes .
This sounds remarkably like she is making an uninformed choice , does n’t it ?
The specialization argument is invoked quite often .
When I hear it from someone who has taken the time to become comfortable with several different approaches to solving a problem , I give it some credence .
But how often do we hear someone say , “ Oh , language X . Yeah , I hear that ’s kind of specialized for Artificial Intelligence .
And Y is probably terrific if you need to do some startup thing where you need to make a lot of changes as you go .
I have n’t tried it , because I do n’t do Y - like stuff .
But for my purposes Z is the way to go .
Each language has its specialization , and Z is best for what I ’m doing .
” Are those the words of someone who really understands X or Y and why anyone would need those weird features X and Y programmers boast of ?
Or what parts of languages X and Y would or would n’t apply to the problem at hand ?
Or is this just a way of sounding Fair and Balanced Just because tools may provide specialized benefits depending on the problem at hand , that does n’t mean that the particular tool a programmer chooses is the best possible or best available .
In other words , uninformed choice can be local to a problem domain .
My second conjecture about specialized tool hypothesis is that most tools evolve over time away from specialization and towards generalization .
Java , the language often mentioned in the same breath as uninformed choice , began its life as a specialized language for embedded programming .
Toasters , set - top boxes , that kind of thing .
Other languages have seen the same trend towards trying to solve all problems for all people .
The older a language or tool is , the more likely it is a general - purpose tool .
The converse tends to be true : the younger a language or tool is , the more likely it is to be specialized .
The latter seem to be true even if the designers and sponsors intend it to be a general - purpose tool , because younger tools have smaller ecosystems .
Take a language with a relatively small ecosystem : it may have been designed as a general - purpose tool , but if the the most popular stable , widely used libraries and frameworks support building Ajax - ified CRUD applications , it is a specialized tool as compared to a language that seems to support building everything up to an including interplanetary navigation So It seems that some languages boast flexibility , others specialization .
It seems unrealistic to expect that the specialized language can beat the generalized language .
Unless you are comparing the languages on the basis of the specialized language ’s “ home turf . ”
In a fight between a bear and an alligator , terrain determines the outcome .
Now someone argues , “ Hey , you would n’t try to fight a fire with a Maserati or drive the Autobahn on a Segway . ”
The specialization argument .
Ok .
But is that really the comparison ?
All too often , I hear that argument , but what I see in the toolbox is a mini-van , the king of popularity , the vehicle that does several different things equally poorly .
Honestly .
Are programmers clinging to Haskell , Erlang , and Postscript because their needs are specialized and within their niche these languages are the best possible choice ?
Or are they vocally defending a language that does an awful lot of things in awkward ways against languages that solve their exact problem in an elegant way ?
Languages and tools are not uninformed .
It ’s the breadth of experience applied to making a choice that counts .
Making a popular , comfortable , established , unfashionable , safe choice does not make you uninformed .
An uninformed choice is made in ignorance of the benefits of making other choices .
If you think that your next CRUD application would need anywhere from one half the code to one tenth the code if you used a specialized meta- programming tool like Ruby on Rails , but you ’re sticking with ASP because that ’s what the client asked for , you ’re making an informed choice .
If you write a new application and make heavy use of functional programming constructs for the first time , good for you .
If you choose to leave an existing application more or less as - is and you do n’t refactor every method to remove mutable local variables , good for you again .
You ’re making an informed choice .
Some uninformed choices are conservative choices , but so are are some informed choices .
You ca n’t tell the difference merely by examining the language or tool chosen .
I have a little litmus test for identifying an informed choice that just happens to be conservative .
I do n’t claim it ’s infallible , and I have done absolutely no research to back it up .
But in the interest of keeping the amusement value up , here is my proposal : Uninformed programmers invariably stick to whatever has been promoted as the sole , orthodox way to write programs for their language .
If they need to work around a language limitation , they will do so using well known conventions such as widely disseminated “ design patterns . ”
They can invariable name a dozen or more such patterns , but can never name a single language that handles these problems in a different way .
The informed but conservative programmer has learnt something from other tools , other languages .
The principles find their way into her work .
A conservative programmer might have extremely pragmatic reasons for doing some work in Javascript .
But she uses the Prototype Library to implement higher - order functional programming .
Or she might need to build something really big and hairy in C ++.
But she ’ll implement Lisp ’s map and reduce as a library so that C++ programs can vectorize on a grid with thousands of computers
The uninformed programmer may have heard of these things , but not only will they eschew other tools and languages , the eschew the ideas behind them as well .
Although the act of implementing a more powerful language on top of a more conservative language is sometimes frustrating and often derided by purists , it is a sign that the programmer has thought deeply about the best way to solve a particular problem , and is not afraid to port what they like from one environment to another .
What do you think ?
Do informed but conservative programmers incorporate features and paradigms from other tools and languages into their work ?

Objective - C 2.0
December 27 , 2006 at 8:24 pm
As many of you know , Apple is releasing the new incarnation of Objective - C ( creatively dubbed Objective - C 2.0 ) along with XCode 3.0 and Leopard .
Though much of it is hidden under Apple ’s elaborate nondisclosure agreements , people like Andy Matushack and Scott Stevenson as well as other sites have uncovered more information from the ObjC mailing lists and repositories than the meager scraps of info that Apple released on their website .
Since I ca n’t give any new information about this , I ’ll just list my opinions , then brace for the reaming I ’ll receive in the comments .
Disclaimer : Apple may change all of these things .
This post is naught but conjecture heaped upon conjecture .
The Good
1 . The foreach loop .
It ’s simple , but makes lives easier when we do n’t have to mess about with NSEnumerators for standard iteration .
Here ’s how one iterates through an NSArray of objects :
for ( id tempString in the Array )
{
// do things here
}
It ’s very reminiscent of the Python for loop :
for ii in someList :
# do things here
It ’s also much easier to understand immediately than the Java 5.0 foreach loop , which inexplicably uses a colon to indicate “ in ” :
for ( Object ii : someSet ) {
// do things here
}
This is a simple thing that I will appreciate very much ; it saves me from messing about with standard C for loops or NSEnumerators .
I ’m glad they picked the Pythonic syntax , as it ’s far more readable .
2. Garbage collection .
To be honest , I know next to nothing about how garbage collection works .
I do know that though memory management in Cocoa is much better than in C++ , garbage collection is always welcomed ; if they make it both quick to use yet optional ( like the D language has ) , it seems everyone will be happy .
3 . More explicit support for protocol methods .
Now , instead of blindly hoping that I remembered to implement all the methods for a protocol , I can be warned by the compiler that I need to implement certain ones .
By using the @required and @optional directives , one can specify that certain methods must be included in classes that implement a given protocol .
This seems like a step in the right direction – after all , what ’s the point of implementing protocols if you do n’t remember to code the correct methods ?
The Okay , I Guess
[ This section was changed , as what I previously had here was not new to the language . ]
1. Official support for attributes on method calls .
According to this article , we will be able to specify that methods are unavailable / deprecated / what have you – inside the code :
- ( void ) foo __attribute__ ( ( deprecated ) ) __attribute__ ( ( unavailable ) ) ;
The above was taken directly from the repository , so it should be canon .
I do n’t really know what to think about this ; though news about method deprecation would be nice , perhaps Java ’s @deprecated JavaDoc tag is more elegant .
The ( Hideously ) Ugly
1. Properties
I was around halfway through a really venomous diatribe on why properties are such a bad idea when I remembered David Young ‘s entry Does Objective - C Really Need Properties ?
He provides a far clearer case against them than I ever could ; go read the article .
In fact , his article pretty much supersedes mine .
* cries *
We may will learn new things about ObjC 2.0 in the future , things that may put a spring in our steps and smiles in our hearts .
But right now , I am without both – I ’m afraid that Apple went overboard with the syntactic sugar .
Feel free to tell me how wrong I am in the comments .

U.S. Customs Opening International Mail
Reuters is reporting that Customs and Border Protection is opening international mail coming into the U.S. without warrant .
Sadly , this is legal .
Congress passed a trade act in 2002 , 107 H.R. 3009 , that expanded the Custom Service ’s ability to open international mail .
Here ’s the beginning of Section 344 :
(1) In general .
–For purposes of ensuring compliance with the Customs laws of the United States and other laws enforced by the Customs Service , including the provisions of law described in paragraph ( 2 ) , a Customs officer may , subject to the provisions of this section , stop and search at the border , without a search warrant , mail of domestic origin transmitted for export by the United States Postal Service and foreign mail transiting the United States that is being imported or exported by the United States Postal Service .
If I remember correctly , the ACLU was able to temper the amendment , and this language is better than what the government originally wanted .
Domestic First Class mail is still private ; the police need a warrant is to open it .
But there is a lower standard for Media Mail and the like , and a lower standard for “ mail covers ” : the practice of collecting address information from the outside of the envelope .

January 22 , 2007 — jao
Kind reader William Annis noticed how clumsily i copied a line in the kill ring in my last screencast .
I went to the beginning of the line ( C - a ) , killed it ( C-k ) so i got it in my kill - ring , and yanked it back ( C-y ) .
Admittedly , a bit cumbersome , my only excuse being that i have this keystroke sequence hardwired in my nervous system from the dawn of my emacs times ; approximately the same epoch when i put in my .emacs this setting to make kill - line eat also the final carry return :
( setq kill - whole - line t )
But , as William notices , there ’re better ways of copying the current line .
A quick one would be :
( defun jao - copy - line ( ) " Copy current line in the kill ring " ( interactive ) ( kill - ring - save ( line - beginning - position ) ( line - beginning - position 2 ) ) ( message " Line copied " ) )
which can be easily extended to take as a prefix argument the number of lines to copy ( with 1 as the default )
( defun jao - copy - line ( arg ) " Copy lines ( as many as prefix argument ) in the kill ring " ( interactive " p " ) ( kill - ring - save ( line - beginning - position ) ( line - beginning - position (+ 1 arg ) ) ) ( message " %d line %s copied " arg ( if ( = 1 arg ) " " " s " ) ) )
Assign the new function to a handy shortcut , and you ’re done .
These functions have the additional benefit of leaving the point untouched .
Next thing you ’ll do after using your new shiny shortcut will most probably be yanking those lines somewhere .
And it may well happen that they ’ll be mis-indented in their new location .
A relatively quick way of realigning them is to take advantage of the fact that after a yank the region is set to the yanked text and use indent - region , which is bound to C - M - \ .
But i prefer to let Emacs do that for me , using this piece of advice in my .emacs :
( defadvice yank ( after indent - region activate ) ( if ( member major - mode '( emacs - lisp - mode scheme - mode lisp - mode c- mode c++- mode objc- mode LaTeX - mode TeX - mode ) ) ( indent - region ( region - beginning ) ( region - end ) nil ) ) )
where , as you can see , i’m limiting the advice to some modes : just delete the major - mode check if you want it to work everywhere .
The spread of wireless is opening lots of opportunity to log on for free , but experts urge caution .
QUICK VOTE
Is using your neighbor 's wireless Internet connection stealing ?
Yes
No
View results NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - Forty bucks for high - speed Internet access ?
Not a bad deal .
But how does free sound ?
To a growing number of Internet piggy - backers , it 's the sweet sound of pirating their neighbor 's wireless network .
Most new computers are equipped for wireless Internet access , and more and more people are opting for Wi -Fi in their homes .
But as the networks become stronger and more prevalent , more of those signals are available outside the home of the subscriber , spilling over into neighbor 's apartments , hallways and the street .
Add to this the growing number of cafes and other public " hot spots " that offer Wi -Fi ( for wireless fidelity ) connections and the ability to buy more powerful antennas that can pick up signals several hundred feet away .
The coverage in some places can be pretty near flawless .
One study by Jupiter Research said 14 percent of wireless network owners have accessed their neighbor 's connection .
Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that more and more people are logging on for free .
" I have n't paid for Internet since I 've been in New York City , " said one friend of this reporter .
" Ditto , " chimed in another .
And as the practice of using someone else 's connection without paying for it expands , it raises the question :
Is there anything wrong with that ?
Will this land you in jail ?
The legality of stealing your neighbor 's connection is murky at best .
" All of this stuff is so new , it 's hard to say what the liability issues are , " said Robert Hale , a San Francisco - based attorney who recently published an academic paper on the subject .
Hale points out that there is a federal law on the books that ostensibly prohibits using someone 's access point with out their permission .
But " without permission " is vaguely defined and the law seems more geared towards computer hacking .
It seems pretty clear that if you hack your neighbor 's password then it could be reasonably argued you did n't have authorization .
But securing many older wireless systems with a password is difficult and even newer ones can be a challenge if you 're running multiple computers or multiple operating systems .
And , while it may be a violation of the user agreements with Internet service providers , some community - minded users deliberately leave their connections open for others to borrow .
" It 's a gray area , " said Paul Stamp , an analyst at the technology consultants Forester Research .
" By not restricting access it could be argued that you 're implicitly making that available . "
" A broad statement concerning the access of unprotected wireless networks as being always legal or illegal simply can't be made , " said Jackie Lesch , a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice .
" It 's just kind of dicey . "
On a federal level , according to Lesch , prosecuting decisions are made on a case to case basis , mostly depending on the type of system accessed and what it was accessed for .
On the state level it could be more clear .
" It 's unlawful access " , said John Geraty , an officer with the Internet crimes against children unit of the San Francisco Police Department .
According to Geraty , using your neighbor 's wireless is specifically prohibited in the California penal code .
" It 's not yours and you 're taking it , " he says .
But Geraty said his department does n't deal with that type of crime specifically and an officer at the department 's fraud desk -- whose jurisdiction it would fall under -- said she could n't recall anyone ever being arrested for it .
Experts do agree that the likelihood of getting caught and prosecuted for stealing a wireless connection probably depends on how often you do it and how you 're using it .
" The damages are really the big issue , " said Hale .
" Are you just poking around , checking your e-mail , or are you doing it on a regular basis and affecting this person 's bandwidth ? "
Location also seems to play a part .
" If you 're in a Manhattan building with 30 apartments that 's one thing , " said Julie Ask , research director at the technology consultants Jupiter Research .
" But if you 're the guy who parks your car in front of a suburban house in the middle of the night and you 've got the screen from your laptop glowing , well ... " speaking of a man who was arrested earlier this month in Florida for just that .
Exposing yourself Legal questions aside , reliability is another reason to pay for your own access .
If you are a heavy user or need the Internet to work from home , relying on a connection that your neighbor could shut off at any moment is probably not a good idea .
There is also the possibility that someone could have set up the unsecured connection as a trap .
Experts say it 's possible for the network subscriber to gain at least partial access to your computer , read your e-mails and see the pages you visit if you are using their connection .
Any personal information you send online could then be compromised .
So while pirating your neighbor 's Wi- Fi it may seem like a good way to siphon a free service , you may end up feeling pretty stupid if you get a summons for sneaking a peek at the latest sports scores or your favorite Web sites are the topic of conversation at the neighborhood Christmas party .

Two asinine criticisms of Steve Jobs ’s “ Thoughts on Music ” are that ( a ) it ’s a shameless attempt to jump on the anti-DRM bandwagon — i.e. that Jobs and Apple are merely attempting to take credit for the already inevitable move toward non-DRM music ; and ( b ) that it ’s all just some sort of trick and Jobs did n’t mean what he wrote .
Paul Thurrott starts with the ( a ) route :
There are times when Apple and its CEO Steve Jobs seem well ahead of the curve , releasing products and services that easily trump anything the competition is doing .
And then there are times when Apple is a follower , though the company tries , in such cases , to pretend that it is leading the way .
This is an example of the latter case .
…
Jobs ’ pleas follow years of complaints from analysts , music fans , and an increasing number of industry executives , all of whom have noted that DRM restrictions have stymied online music sales .
Of course , when someone with the clout of Steve Jobs makes a stand , it ’s interesting , even if we ’ve heard these arguments before .
Who exactly , then , is Apple following ?
Yes , there have long been outspoken critics of DRM .
Yes , there have long been some publishers and music stores selling unencumbered DRM - free downloadable audio files .
eMusic , for example , sells plain - jane MP3 files , and they are the second - most - popular music download store ( although they trail iTunes by more than an order of magnitude — 100 million vs. 2 billion total downloads to date ) .
But , clearly , what Jobs was writing about was n’t just music downloads in general , but , rather , music downloads from artists belonging to the four major music companies .
( And for better or for worse , this comprises the vast majority of music that most people care or even know about . )
There have been stutter steps in this direction from the Big Four — EMI has released a handful of DRM - free tracks through Yahoo ’s ( Windows - only ) music store — but Jobs ’s essay is the first time anyone with a vested interest in the status quo has unequivocally stated it would be better for everyone if we just got rid of DRM .
It ’s one thing when a peace activist calls for an end to nuclear weapon testing ; it ’s something else when the leader of a country that has nuclear weapons does so .
Thurrott stretches reason to its limits in his conclusion :
Regardless of the timing , Apple will always claim that it led the way to unfettered music downloads , of course .
And though the company knows that record companies will never bow to this kind of pressure , Apple can also claim it ’s been looking out for the interests of consumers all along .
If that ’s really true , I ’ll just reiterate a request I ’ve been making for a long time now .
Mr. Jobs , tear down that DRM wall : License FairPlay , seek a license to Microsoft ’s Windows Media technologies , and make all of these products interoperate in the world as it is , even if it ’s not as perfect as the one you allegedly prefer .
Remember the RIAA ’s response to Jobs ’s essay , where they misread Jobs ’s clear statement that Apple has rejected the idea of licensing FairPlay as an offer to license FairPlay ?
Thurrott takes it even further , suggesting not only that Apple license FairPlay to other companies , but that Apple “ seek ” ( read : “ pay for ” ) a license to Microsoft ’s Windows Media DRM .
This is , yes , a remarkably laughable suggestion .
But it raises a genuinely intriguing question : How could Thurrott be so wrong ?
My guess is that a very simple explanation suffices , which is that Thurrott is starting with a significant but utterly broken assumption :
That Microsoft matters in this debate .
It ’s easy to see how Thurrott might start with this assumption .
He ’s a Windows expert ; covering and analyzing Microsoft technologies is what he does .
And , for most of the last two decades , Microsoft ’s opinion and technology has seemingly been important just because they ’re Microsoft .
If that ’s the assumption you start with regarding DRM , then Thurrott ’s suggestion actually makes some sort of sense .
But Microsoft is a paper tiger in this realm .
Their music DRM is only relevant to anyone who has bought one of their music players — which is to say a decided minority of the market .
Their Windows monopoly has not allowed them to establish a de facto industry standard here , like it has so many times in the past .
The most popular DRM - encoded music format for Windows users is FairPlay ; the most popular music player for Windows users is the iPod .
Microsoft ’s response to Jobs ’s essay conveys this frustration at their lack of relevance .
Zune marketing director Jason Reindorp told The New York Times that Jobs ’s call for the elimination of music DRM was “ irresponsible , or at the very least naïve ” , and then added , “ It ’s like he ’s on top of the mountain making pronouncements , while we ’re here on the ground working with the industry to make it happen . ”
Thurrott quotes Reindorp approvingly , writing , “ Microsoft responded to Jobs ’ pronouncement in a fashion that I feel is long overdue . ”
But what exactly is “ naïve ” about Jobs ’s essay ? 1
I posit that what Reindorp considers naïve is that Jobs did n’t even bother mentioning Windows Media DRM except in passing .
We ’re Microsoft , damn it !
Why is n’t Apple scared of us ?
Too much Microsoft on the brain can lead you to view Apple — or any other company — through Redmond - tinted glasses .
Microsoft ’s history is rife with instances of lock - in as an important technical goal and core business strategy , often to their legal detriment .
Or in Microsoft ’s own parlance : embrace , extend , extinguish .
That ’s never been Apple ’s strategy .
Apple ’s defining corporate desires are maximizing their control while minimizing their dependencies .
If the tables were turned and Microsoft ’s and Apple ’s positions were reversed regarding music DRM market share , we certainly would n’t have seen a “ We ’d be better off if we just got rid of music DRM ” open letter from Steve Ballmer .
But it does make sense from Apple ’s perspective .
One of the implicit points in Jobs ’s “ Thoughts on Music ” is that if Apple ’s going to support any DRM , it ’s going to be their own , and they ’re not going to share it with anyone else .
That way the user experience and technology are under Apple ’s control , and Apple is not dependent on the cooperation or competence of any other companies to make it work and keep it working .
One glaringly obvious problem with Thurrott ’s suggestion that Apple license Windows Media DRM from Microsoft is that Microsoft has never offered decent support for Windows Media — and none at all for DRM — on the Mac .
If the iPod and iTunes were to support Windows Media DRM , there would need to be Mac OS X support for Windows Media DRM .
And the number of PlaysForSure music stores that support the Mac is zero .
Zero .
Maybe this makes sense in Paul Thurrott ’s world , where he thinks the introduction of the iPhone implies “ the beginning of a long farewell to the Mac as a general purpose computing platform ” , but in the real world , the idea that Apple would take the iPod / iTunes platform — which is currently completely independent of Microsoft ’s control — and make part of it not work on the Mac and put the Windows part under Microsoft ’s control , is a joke .
The truth is that the only companies that have a say in this are the Big Four music companies and Apple ; the music companies because they control the rights to the music , Apple because they dominate both the legal download and portable music player markets .
( That eMusic is the second - most - popular download store means several good things for Apple : ( a ) both of the top two download stores fully support iTunes and iPod playback on both Mac and Windows ; ( b ) neither of them use Microsoft technology ; and ( c ) because eMusic only sells songs from independent labels , it means Apple ’s share of the legal download market for major label music is even higher than its share of the overall legal download market . )
For Apple to heed Thurrott ’s suggestion that they license Windows Media DRM from Microsoft would require Apple to forget that if you depend on Microsoft for something , Microsoft wo n’t hesitate to abuse you with that dependency if it later suits them .
Apple ’s delayed support for iTunes on Windows Vista is giving Microsoft a sweet taste of their own medicine .
( Sweet for the rest of us , at least . )
As it stands now , Apple depends on no one but itself for music and video playback in iTunes , iPods , Mac OS X , and new gadgets like the iPhone .
And , by not licensing FairPlay to others , Apple is n’t dependent on any other companies to roll out firmware updates for bug fixes and format changes .
This is just the way Apple wants it .
What ’s interesting is that Microsoft could have started this months ago .
What if the Zune had come out DRM - free — as a music player and online store that made Cory Doctorow happy ?
And then used the lack of DRM as an advertising point against the iPod ?
That would have been worth far more than squirting in terms of publicity and grassroots support .
I doubt this was ever even considered .
Microsoft is so hell - bent on switching places with Apple — so that they control an overwhelming DRM lock - in advantage — that they ’re missing out on the fact that Apple is offering to relinquish its own ( actual , existing ) DRM lock - in advantage .
I.e. Microsoft ’s problem with the iTunes Store is n’t that it has created an unfair playing field , but rather that it has prevented Microsoft from creating an unfair playing field tilted in its own favor .
If Apple succeeds in persuading the Big Four to drop DRM , that would seemingly be good news for the Zune , but it would keep Microsoft from what it really wants , which is a long - term self - perpetuating DRM lock - in advantage .
Which brings us to the most deliciously jackassed aspect of Thurrott ’s call for Apple to voluntarily bridge the DRM gap , which is that Microsoft is so DRM - happy that they do n’t even offer cross -support between their own DRM standards .
Zunes do n’t work with PlaysForSure DRM and PlaysForSure gadgets do n’t work with Zune DRM .
Next up is Paul Kedrosky , who published an op - ed piece in The Wall Street Journal Saturday , titled “ Pardon My Skepticism ” .
Kedrosky writes :
That Microsoft - style lock - in to iTunes / iPod has been good for Apple and its shareholders — the company sold more than 20 million iPods in the Christmas quarter — but others have been less impressed .
First up has been Norway ( an admittedly tiny market ) , which last month gave Apple until March 1 to explain how it would untangle iTunes and iPod and open up the music market .
Similar complaints have now come from groups in France , Germany and the Netherlands .
Enter Mr. Jobs with this week ’s anti-DRM essay .
We ’re less than a month from when Mr. Jobs needed to respond to European complaints , so he seemingly had a deathbed conversion .
Let ’s open it all up , he says , eliminating DRM altogether .
But Jobs did n’t argue for music to be opened up only in Norway .
He called for it to be opened everywhere .
Apple ’s hand has not been forced here :
If they wanted to tell Norway to stuff it , they could take the Norwegian iTunes Store down and suffer no consequences .
The iTunes Store is only meagerly profitable , at best , worldwide .
Apple ’s iTunes Store profits from Norway are almost certainly negligible .
Why is it so hard to believe Jobs meant what he wrote : that Apple is perfectly happy to make its money selling iPods and by competing based on the quality of their products and user experience ?
Kedrosky continues :
First Mr. Jobs notes that it is the record companies that made him impose DRM on iTunes downloadable music .
True enough , but that ’s hardly the point .
Being ordered to do something objectionable is not an excuse — and , further , Mr. Jobs has n’t exactly had the high rhetorical ground here , not having fought the good fight on this subject publicly in the past .
It is true that Apple , and Jobs personally , have heretofore not sung the praises of DRM - free legal music downloads .
But what was Apple ’s option ?
Not to offer legal downloads from the major record companies at all ?
If Apple had refused to use any DRM whatsoever , that ’s what they ’d have been left with .
What business sense would that have made ?
And few serious people in the security community buy the argument that Apple is really just making the music industry safe for all of us by keeping its FairPlay technology to itself .
That ’s not what Jobs argued at all .
He did n’t say that Apple keeping FairPlay to itself helped protect the music industry .
In fact , he explicitly pointed out the opposite , that DRM in general has had no effect on music piracy whatsoever , because 90 percent of music ships on DRM - free CDs .
What Jobs argued is that keeping FairPlay to itself protects Apple , because Apple ’s contracts with the music companies guarantee that when FairPlay is cracked , Apple must patch the hole within a few weeks .
Further , if the recording industry could copy - protect CD music , it would .
But the industry is prevented from doing so by a massive installed base of CD players that do n’t support such technology .
That ’s true — and in fact the music companies have tried all sorts of various tricks to ship CDs that play in regular CD players but which prevent PCs from ripping the music to digital files .
Remember Sony ’s root kit fiasco ?
That the music industry sees DRM - free CDs as a problem is not an indictment of Apple .
Besides , if copy protection in general , and FairPlay in particular , are so fundamental to Mr. Jobs ’s lock - in and current music - media hegemony , this raises an obvious question :
Why would he argue in favor of eliminating DRM altogether ?
It starts to seem … well , nuts .
It ’s only nuts if you assume that lock - in is fundamental to Apple ’s “ music - media hegemony ” .
I say that it is n’t .
Imagine for the sake of argument that the iTunes Store were instead just a front - end to Amazon ; buying music or movies through iTunes would simply be a convenient way to order CDs and DVDs without leaving iTunes .
I posit that in this scenario , Apple would have sold and would continue to sell just as many iPods as it has with the actual iTunes Store .2
It is , of course , a straight - out - of - Clausewitz exercise in diversionary tactics .
While many people are uneasy about beating up on the successful and innovative Apple , gang - tackling the nasty old music companies is something everyone can really get behind .
The reason the music companies are unpopular is that their actions and stated policies make people unhappy .
The reason Apple is popular is that its actions and stated policies ( including Jobs ’s “ Thoughts on Music ” ) make people happy .
This is not complicated .
That Kedrosky is apparently siding with the music companies instead of Apple does n’t make him an iconoclast ; it makes him a jackass .
( Likewise , Microsoft ’s deep institutional devotion to DRM is not about making their customers happy ; it ’s about making the entertainment industry happy even though it makes customers unhappy . )
And Mr. Jobs knows that there is pretty much zero chance the music industry will eliminate DRM .
That move would sound a death ringtone for their struggling business , making online piracy dead simple and destroy the livelihood of an entire generation of artists .
Kedrosky has clearly missed — or refuses to believe — the main point of Jobs ’s argument .
It ’s almost impossible to see how allowing Apple to sell DRM - free music through iTunes would make piracy worse .
Music piracy is already rampant .
There is not a single song on iTunes that ca n’t be downloaded for free from a P2P network .
If iTunes were to switch to DRM - free music , would it stop anyone who is already buying music from iTunes ?
No .
And , more importantly , are there people who have refused to buy songs from iTunes because the songs are encoded with DRM ?
Yes !
People who are already buying from iTunes would continue to .
People who refused to buy from iTunes because of DRM might start .
And people who bootleg would continue to bootleg .
This situation would be better for the music industry , not worse .
The problem from the music industry ’s perspective is their technically ludicrous pipe dream of devising a scheme that forces everyone to pay for every single song they play .
They obsess over pirates while taking their honest customers for granted .
Love movies ?
Sure you do .
That 's why you 're here .
But we only love movies - not the bullshit that goes with them .
Seeing adverts at the movies is a pain in the arse - remember Terry Gilliam 's boringly epic football advert with Eric Cantona that made Attack Of The Clones that much further away ?
Sick and tired of being peppered with at least two or three road safety ads before each film ?
I have n't even got a car !
She should n't have been standing there !
And anyway , Scott Smith 's ' The Betrayal ' looks shite !
At least buying a movie on DVD is a refuge from these semi-educational public service announcements .
Well , not really .
If you buy the DVD , you have n't got a choice anymore .
Slip your shiny new disc in your machine and instead of the menu screen , what 's the first thing you see ?
You get the evil tendrils of F.A.C.T - that 's the Federation Against Copyright
Theft to you and me ; a 47 second advert preaching the dangers of movie piracy , cut to a dated sub - techno soundtrack .
" You would n't steal a car , " it says .
Well , I would if it was as easy as downloading a movie , and I 'm pretty sure everyone else would too .
" You would n't steal a handbag , " it says .
Damn right I would n't steal a handbag , I 'm a bloke , for heavens sake .
That 's why I just bought Conan The Barbarian ; what do I need with a handbag ?
For someone like me , who often watches three or four movies on DVD a day , it 's several minutes a day I spend wanting to garrotte the evil bastards at F.A.C.T .
It 's this type of thing that is really putting me off DVDs .
Fundamentally , DVDs are fantastic .
But also , thanks to some inconsiderable twuntmonkeys at movie studios , decent DVDs are getting harder and harder to enjoy .
I bought the movie - and that 's what I want to watch .
Instead of being given the product I have actually bought , instead I am rewarded with a minute of unavoidable , patronising rubbish about how ' proper '
DVDs are better than pirate ones , patronising rubbish I 've never seen on a pirate DVD , incidentally .
I can't fast forward through it , skip it or go to the menu and watch the film .
I have to see this EVERY TIME I put on these films .
Opening my copy of Lord Of War , not only do I get a finger - pointing lecture from F.A.C.T. , I also get a 30 second advert for Mars Bars : the AK - 47 of chocolate .
Now hang on - I bought the film , not an advert for chocolate .
Should n't they pay ME for watching this ?
Is this my reward for being a good consumer ?
I do n't mind the adverts so much , the thing that I do object to is that these advertorials are hard - coded into the disc .
You can't skip them , fast - forward through them , or even press the ' Menu ' button to get straight to a bewildering array of highly animated menus .
These days it 's second nature to press ' Menu ' and FFWD on one remote control whilst fumbling for the ' Mute ' button on the TV , by instinct when I put a DVD in the machine .
If that does n't work , I even go into the kitchen and raid the fridge rather than watch F.A.C.T's latest redundant opus .
For Christ 's sake , I KNOW pirate DVDs are crap .
That 's why I bought a proper one .
If I am forced to watch one more trailer for a CGI remake of Happy Scrappy Hero Pup voiced by Jude Law and Bill Murray or Pirate DVDs , I swear I 'm going to invoice F.A.C.T. for the time spent .
And nothing ever changes : I was fast - forwarding through an equally rubbish ' educational film ' about how dodgy video tapes can't be returned to Tom The Dodgy Video Seller At The Market on an old VHS last week .
At least I could fast - forward through that .
Strange , is n't it ?
Technology is forcing us backwards to an era of less choice .
Thanks to copy restrictions on DVDs , every time my child smears jam on Finding Nemo I have to go out and buy a new one .
In the olden days , you could just copy it onto a video tape and not risk screwing up the original .
I 've never had a hard - coded , mandatory advert for chocolate , or patronising propaganda on a dodgy DVD being sold in my local Chavporium Pub .
Meanwhile , enquiries to F.A.C.T are going oddly unanswered .

Natural proteins act as super reflectors .
Perfect reflectors help an octopus blend in .
Getty
The molecules that make octopus skin so successful as a dynamic camouflage could provide materials scientists with a new way to make super - reflective materials .
Octopus , squid and cuttlefish have developed sophisticated skins so they can hide in an ocean full of hungry predators .
Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Laboratory , Woods Hole , Massachusetts and colleagues took a close look at this skin and identified a new group of proteins with remarkable properties .
Hanlon 's team discovered that the bottom layer of octopus skin , made up of cells called leucophores , is composed of a translucent , colourless , reflecting protein .
" Protein reflectors are very odd in the animal kingdom , " says Hanlon , who is a zoologist .
What 's even more odd is just how reflective these proteins are — they reflect all wavelengths of light that hit at any angle .
" This is beautiful broadband reflection , " Hanlon told the Materials Research Society at their meeting in Boston last month .
A cuttlefish cunningly hides out on a pebbly seafloor .
Roger Hanlon
The result is a material that looks startlingly white in white light , and blue in the bluish light found beneath the waves .
" These cells also match the intensity of the prevalent light , " says Hanlon 's research associate Lydia Mathger .
All this helps the creatures to blend into their surroundings .
Brightness enhancer
Closer inspection of a cuttlefish shows that some parts of the skin have enhanced reflective properties thanks to flat platelets called iridophores in the layer lying on top of the leucophores .
In the brightest spots , the number of iridophores matches the number of leucophores one for one .
" The flat platelets are enhancing the brightness of the whiteness , " Hanlon says .
But just how they 're doing that is unclear .
" These are very complex 3 - D cells , " Hanlon says .
They require further investigation , he says .
Ryan Kramer , at the Air Force Research Laboratory in Ohio , is investigating reflectin , the only known reflective protein that has been fully genetically sequenced .
Hanlon 's work does show that leucophores are proteins , says Kramer .
Perhaps they are themselves a type of reflectin .
ADVERTISEMENT
Once the proteins involved and their optical properties are fully understood , there could be applications far more diverse than simply mimicking an octopus 's camouflage , says Hanlon .
Better optical fibres could be made , for example , with super - reflective compounds .
Hanlon sees his discoveries as a call to arms for materials scientists to find applications for the bounty being discovered by zoologists .
He 's sure they 'll find a use for it : after all , he says , the military is always interested in playing with light .

Web Design Contracts : Why Bother
In : Columns > The Business End
By Nick Gould
Contract - Shmontract ,
What ’s the Point ?
In law school , one of the things they teach you in Contracts 101 ( usually on the first day ) is that contracts serve more than just a strictly legal purpose .
Specifically , the solemnity involved in the act of signing a contract — the ritual of the contract negotiation and execution itself — impresses on the parties that they are making a commitment to each other , and that the document they are signing describes that commitment .
In this sense , contracts have a socio- psychological function as well as a legal one .
They also have a vital business purpose in that the contract is the accepted opportunity to specify each party ’s expectations and obligations with respect to the promise they are making .
This specification can be incredibly useful for clarifying these promises as the relationship progresses , even if no lawsuit is ever filed .
In other words , a contract is well worth the effort it requires even if you would never sue to enforce it — particularly for designers .
Design work is often difficult to define in advance , and is inherently subjective .
A contract helps to remove some of this ambiguity .
For the reasons I ’ll outline below , working without a contract is unwise and , in this day and age , should be unnecessary .
No reputable client will object to some form of documentation ( especially if you are willing to do all the work of producing this document ) .
If the client does object , I suggest you run away — far and fast .
Proposals Are Not Contracts
What does this mean for the small / solo web designer ?
For most of us , the cost of undertaking even a small - scale litigation would far outweigh the potential return , especially when the adversary is a client with its own internal legal department and mountains of cash at its disposal .
So why bother with contracts in the first place if you ’re unlikely to ever sue to enforce them ?
Ca n’t a design proposal adequately serve the purpose of specifying the details of the upcoming project ?
Why go through the sometimes grueling , time - intensive extra step of negotiating and signing a contract ?
Proposals are written to convince the client to hire you over others .
This means that you may reflexively minimize the demands you are making on the client , and focus mainly on your expertise and the value your work will provide to them .
Of course , your assumptions should be reasonable and your costs should be clearly identified , but it ’s unlikely that you will write a proposal ( or that your client will read it ) in the same way that you would approach a legal document .
Most of us have probably had real - world experiences that support this conclusion .
Clients will often fail to closely read detailed design proposals that clearly specify scope , deliverables , and underlying assumptions .
Instead , they will rely on their own interpretations of conversations they have had with the designers during the proposal process — an interpretation which is often skewed in their own favor .
This situation leads to the dreaded , “ I thought you were going to … ” conversation during which the full detail of the client ’s expectations finally come to light — too late , unfortunately , since by this time significant work has already been started , or finished , on the basis of a totally different understanding .
Even if the content of the contract is basically a duplication of what was in the proposal , the act of transforming the proposal into a contract invites clients to pay closer attention to the terms you are proposing .
Believe it or not , I have had clients question or object to terms in a contract that were clearly stated in the proposal they had already accepted .
In these cases , I was extremely fortunate to have identified these areas of conflict before work was done .
A written contract wo n’t always avoid this outcome — I ’ve had clients tell me with a straight face that they did n’t realize we were billing for each hour of work despite a clear statement in our contract to that effect .
But in that case , I could at least point back to the contract language ( humbly , mumbling apologies as I did so ) as evidence of his misunderstanding .
Your Friend the SOW
Now that we ’ve covered the why of web design contracts , let ’s move on to the what .
Broadly speaking , there are two situations that you should be prepared to deal with : 1 ) Your client drafts the contract , and 2 ) You draft the contract .
Regardless of who actually writes the formal contract itself , it ’s almost certain that you — the vendor — will be called upon to provide the substantive content that describes the work you are going to do , and the basis for your pricing , so you need to be ready to do this .
It ’s easiest if you create a Statement of Work ( SOW ) template that will work for most of your typical projects , and modify it as needed for particular contracts .
I suggest that your SOW contain at least the following information :
Overview : A brief description of the services you are providing and the name of the site or product you will be working on .
If you will be working in phases , it ’s helpful to list and summarize the phases at this point .
Process Description :
For each phase of work , describe exactly what you are going to do , in what order and , ideally , what the purpose of each activity is .
Wherever possible , use actual numbers to clarify your assumptions — the number of design reviews and revisions , the number of stakeholder interviews , the number of page templates , etc .
Deliverables : Clients are always particularly interested in what they are getting from you , so be sure to be specific about the deliverables in each phase .
Ownership :
The ultimate ownership of your work product will be of great interest to your client — and it should be to you as well .
In the vast majority of cases , the copyright for all design work is owned by the client who has commissioned the work .
This is typical and usually not worth opposing .
However , you may want to put some thought into aspects of your delivery in which you will want to retain ownership .
For example , the format and organization of your design specification should be your own , and should not be accidentally transferred to your client along with their designs .
Pricing :
Will you be billing on a fixed - price basis ?
Time and materials ?
It ’s vitally important that the contract specify how you will determine your bill for the work .
This should be stated simply and ( in appropriate cases ) should include hourly rates for all billing resources .
Payment Terms :
State whether you expect payment up front , and when additional invoices will be issued ( e.g. monthly , upon completion of phases , on certain dates ) .
You should also outline payment terms , for example , that all payments are due within 30 days of the bill date ( net 30 ) .
An SOW containing the information described above can itself form the basis for a contract ( in other words , you and your client can simply sign the SOW and move on ) , or it can be attached as an exhibit to a standard form contract that your client may provide .
Your SOW can , and should , evolve over time as your practice develops .
After each project , ask yourself whether you ’ve learned any lessons that would be relevant to how you will describe your work in the next SOW .
Pretty soon , you ’ll find yourself with a customizable SOW that perfectly describes your process and deliverables — which can be a big help with project management and business development as well .
Bring on the Mumbo Jumbo
In addition to the SOW language described above , contracts typically contain a series of other terms that have virtually no effect unless there is a lawsuit — and often not even then .
But that does n’t mean that you do n’t need to understand or care about what these clauses ( often referred to as “ legalese ” or “ legal mumbo jumbo ” ) have to say .
For clarity , let ’s refer to these terms as the Base Agreement .
The Base Agreement is the standard stuff that does n’t change from contract to contract .
These are contractual terms that have evolved out of the legal history in a particular state or country , and they tend to deal with very specific scenarios , usually involving disputes over the contract , that are very unlikely to come to pass .
The good news is that you probably do n’t need to spend much time or effort negotiating them , as their immediate impact on your project is minimal , especially in comparison with the all - important SOW .
The bad news is that you ’ll have no earthly idea what most of these terms mean and you ’d have to earn yourself a law degree to figure them out .
In other words , your ability to safely write a Base Agreement , or review one that a client ’s attorney gives you , is basically zero .
Here ’s my advice :
Get a lawyer .
Sure , you can find all kinds of form agreements out there that look just like real contracts , and they are probably just fine1 .
But I ca n’t in good conscience recommend that you sign something that you do n’t understand — or that has n’t at least been reviewed by someone you trust .
In most cases , it would be better to sign a contract that has no Base Agreement terms ( i.e. just a plain SOW ) than agree to an assortment of legal clauses that could ultimately work against you .
Hiring a lawyer is n’t as scary as it sounds .
There are a ton of them out there , and the kind of agreement we ’re talking about is as basic as they come .
Get a few names from friends , family , or colleagues in the design community .
Or check out your state Bar association for some choices in your area .
Look for lawyers or firms whose pricing is appropriate to the size of your business , and who has experience with professional services contracts .
Make a short list of three or four attorneys and interview them briefly on the phone .
What ’s most important is that your lawyer be someone with whom you can communicate well , someone who explains things in a way you can understand and who understands what you ’re talking about when you describe the challenges you are facing .
Find out what it would cost for them to produce a Base Agreement for you .
You should also get a sense of how costly it would be for them to review a client ’s contract .
Finally , be sure that they are not too busy with larger clients to be as responsive as you would need them to be .
Work with your new attorney to craft a Base Agreement that makes sense for your typical project .
You should review all the Base Agreement terms together so that you have at least a basic understanding of what everything means and the relative importance of each clause .
You may decide together that certain terms are particularly important and should never be changed without additional consultation .
The express goal of your Base Agreement is that it be re-usable .
Working Without a Net
If you just ca n’t stomach the idea of hiring a lawyer — or you ca n’t afford one at the moment — all is not lost .
Sure , you will be operating with a slightly increased level of business risk , and you ’ll have to work harder to get through the contracting process , but this is certainly possible2 .
If you have chosen this path , I suggest the following procedure :
Begin proactively by offering the client your SOW as the point of departure for the contract .
With luck , they may agree to sign this without significant modification .
At a minimum , you should request that the SOW be used as an exhibit , attached to a Base Agreement that is drafted by the client .
Once this Base Agreement arrives , get yourself a cup of coffee and a quiet corner and read through it slowly and deliberately .
Be on the lookout for any language that creates an obligation on you .
For example , some contracts require vendors to maintain a certain level or type of insurance .
Others attempt to hold vendors to a high standard of performance that may or may not be adequately described .
As you read the agreement , think about the scenarios that each provision is envisioning and what impact these provisions would have on you .
Ask yourself in each case if the outcome would be fair to you — or even tolerable at all .
Once you have read every paragraph , make one of the following three notations next to it :
: You understand the clause well enough to deem it harmless or irrelevant to you in this particular project .
You need never look at it again .
? :
You have read the clause eight times and you still have no idea what it means .
The client ( or the client ’s attorney ) will need to explain this to you and make you comfortable that it does not involve the transfer of your firstborn child .
X : You ’re pretty sure that this clause does involve the transfer of your firstborn , or something equally heinous .
The client will need to remove or modify this provision before you will sign the contract .
When you have completed your review of the draft , I suggest you write up a summary of your questions and objections — referencing the contract paragraphs by number .
Return it and ask for a response .
The client may respond to you in writing ( which is preferable ) or might want to arrange a meeting or call to review your concerns .
At this meeting , do your best to dispose of your Xs and question marks — either by deleting the offending language , or obtaining an explanation that alleviates your concerns .
You will almost certainly get a strong vibe from the client regarding the provisions that they are absolutely unwilling to alter .
In these cases , you ’ll need to decide whether the project is worth the potential risk .
Following this process may not guarantee you a contract that is entirely favorable to you — or even one that the client is willing to change at all — but it will give you a better understanding of what you are signing so that you can take any project - related precautions that might help avoid the negative scenarios in the contract .
For example , if you know in advance that even a minor schedule slip will create a payment penalty , you will be extra careful not to let this happen .
Go Forth Unafraid
Now that you have your form of SOW , your Base Agreement , and ( maybe ) your attorney , you are prepared for any contract situation that may arise .
You are ready to produce a complete contract ( SOW + Base Agreement ) , or simply provide your client with an SOW to attach to a Base Agreement — which you may choose to have your attorney review if it seems very complex , or if it varies significantly from the Base Agreement terms with which you are now familiar .
Sure , after having worked hard to sell a new client ( which typically requires a demonstration of flexibility , eagerness , and friendliness ) , it ’s awkward to suddenly turn hard - nosed about getting a signed contract before starting work .
It is certainly easier to just smoothly transition from the sunny optimism of the proposal process to the nitty - gritty of the project itself .
But , as I hope I ’ve outlined in this article , a well - drafted contract protects both sides and clarifies the designer / client relationship in many non-legal ways as well .
Note : Please bear in mind that this article , while it concerns lawyers and legal issues , should not be considered legal advice .
You ’d need a real , practicing lawyer for that .
We ’re just talkin’ here .
Footnotes
1 There are several good online sources for business and legal forms .
For example : Yahoo !
Small Business , NOLO.com , and AllBusiness .
Look for forms for Consulting or Contractor Agreements , as well as those dealing with Intellectual Property issues ( i.e. copyrights and trademarks ) .
Be prepared to pay for high - quality , detailed forms .
You may also need to purchase more than one form in order to cobble together a contract that will work for your specific business .
But these costs are minimal compared with the cost of hiring an attorney .
2 Think about how many contracts you sign every year without even reading them — website terms of service , credit card agreements , wireless contracts … .
On second thought , maybe it ’s better not to think about it .

As we face the challenges of COVID - 19 , the ingenuity , expertise and compassion of our community has never been more apparent .
That title sounds a bit too authoritative , so let me begin by saying that although I ’m by no means an expert on public radio , I was involved with radio in the ’60s , I worked in television news in the ’70s , and I ’ve been talking to many people in commercial and public radio over the past few months .
I was initially reluctant to express my opinions on the topic because I thought they might be hurtful to people I care about .
But as I ’ve been stewing over this for the past few weeks , I ’ve come to realize that what I think and what I ’ve written here is n’t going to “ make it so . ”
I ’m merely describing what I see as an inevitable transformation .
[ I ’ve also given given everyone mentioned in this article a chance to comment on it . ]
Unfortunately , I see Chris Lydon ’s new PRI show , Open Source , as the poster child for this transformation .
Now do n’t get me wrong .
I love the show , and I listen to almost every edition on my iPod .
But Chris and his team have launched what may be the last of the old - time public - radio programs , and they ’ve aimed it right at the middle of the black hole that will swallow them and the rest of public radio : the Internet and podcasting .
I think Open Source may be a catalyst for its own defeat .
This started for me when I blogged about Doc ’s suggestion that we all call our local public radio stations and request they carry the new show .
It took me no time at all to realize how little sense that made .
There ’s no doubt that if KQED - FM were to broadcast the show at all , it would be at some obscure time of day when I was n’t likely to listen .
No , that ’s not even correct .
There ’s no time of day that would be good for me .
I do n’t plan my days around a radio or TV schedule because , quite frankly , I do n’t need to .
I have an iPod and I can listen to what I want , where I want and when I want .
And given that there ’s already more good programming than I have time for , anyone who does n’t make it easy for me by providing an RSS feed with enclosures simply wo n’t make the cut .
Even in my car , unless it ’s just a trip to the grocery store , I no longer tune in a broadcast station .
[ In response to my earlier post on the subject , Brendan Greely , one of Chris ’ producers , pointed out that “ there are a lot of people who would enjoy the conversation who would n’t otherwise hear it ; these are people who might be convinced in the future to listen to a podcast , of this or any show . ”
His point was well taken , and I did ultimately let KQED - FM know that this was an important show which they certainly should carry . ]
Two events then really drove this home for me .
The first was a trip to Boston / Cambridge a few weeks ago to discuss plans for a future venture with some very smart people .
Among them were Jake Shapiro of PRX and Robert Lyons and Eli Ingraham of the WGBH Forum Network .
At WGBH I got a full tour of the facilities of this bastion of public broadcasting , and I was struck by two divergent observations .
First , this is a very large and expensive operation .
Second , it ’s essentially the same as radio was in the 1960s .
Robert and Eli understand this .
Robert has been at WGBH for ( I think ) more than 20 years , and if anything , his Forum Network is one of the few really new projects in public radio that is trying to bring the community into the picture .
But they are up against the Innovator ’s Dilemma .
If you have n’t read that book by Clay Christensen , you really should .
As it applies in this instance , the dilemma is that the established organizations can only approach innovation on the basis of protecting their current way of operating .
The future of public radio may not be podcasting , but it will certainly be based on much lower - cost methods of producing and distributing most programs , and as incumbents in the industry , the WGBHs of the world are unable to cannibalize their own operations to the extent they must to survive .
To do so would mean walking away from all the buildings and studios and firing 80 % of the staff .
Just as 3.5 ″ disk drives replaced the 5 ″ drives at a far lower price / performance ratio , so will the new public radio produce and distribute programs at a far lower cost .
And it wo n’t be done by the same organizations .
The second event was a recent article in The New York Times about Chris ’ show , Open Source .
From listening to the on-air credits , I already knew that the show had a staff of perhaps 7 - 9 people even if not all of them are paid ( much ) and do n’t work full time .
But The Times reported that the show has a $ 1 million budget , and I said , “ Sheesh !
That ’s a lot of money . ”
Now I ’ve worked on $ 100 + million dollar films , and in TV news , and I know how easy it is to spend that kind of money .
But I ’ve also produced 600 programs and distributed them as podcasts and spent next to nothing .
Even if I paid the team and myself decent salaries , my costs would be a mere fraction of Chris ’ budget .
Radio and TV are going to have to adjust to a new economy : the economy in which the long tail plays a major role .
The music industry is painfully making this transformation now .
The movie business is fighting the change in classic innovators - dilemma style .
TV does n’t know what to do .
Its viewers are leaving in droves , and the three major networks ’ reaction so far is to reduce not only the cost but also the quality of programs through the reality - TV and tabloid formulas .
Those are just that industry ’s way of denying the inevitable trap it ’s in .
In commercial radio we see the migration to the two models of talk and formulaic music .
As others have said , there ’s no humanity left .
Commercial stations will die the same way some of the telecoms bit the dust :
They ’re competing for a limited base of customers with undifferentiated commodity products .
It ’s ironic that the broadcast spectrum is a scarce resource yet those with license to use it are writing their own death warrants by using it so inefficiently .
Public radio is on the same path .
Sure , it ’s made worse by the facts that the Bush administration wants to rip the guts out of it , and that NPR and the local stations are always fighting over money and control .
But the real problem is coming from the fact that listeners want long - tail time - shifted content .
They want to hear programs that are more meaningful to them , and they want to listen at their convenience .
The entire broadcast - radio system , with its distribution , simply can’t provide what the customers want .
It ’s not a flaw of management .
There are very good people doing the best that can be done .
The problem is inherent and systemic .
Podcasting is to public radio what Garage Band and Pro Tools are to the music industry .
Large recording studios are closing left and right because musicians — good ones — can produce great music in small project studios or even in their apartments .
Moby is just one of the better - known examples .
But more important than the stars are all the lesser - known artists .
Because of iTunes and GarageBand.com , a significant portion of the market is shifting towards the long tail .
The traditional music industry can only survive to the extent that it can support these new forms of production and distribution , and the same is true for public radio .
If there was one bright light on the public - radio portion of my Boston / Cambridge trip , it was my visit with Jake Shapiro at PRX .
Although their short - term function is to operate a marketplace where producers and stations can sell and buy programming , my sense is that Jake and his team are acutely aware of the larger changes needed in public radio , and I think they ’re worth watching to see how they might play the role of the newcomer that replaces the incumbents .
They match Clay Christensen ’s scenario perfectly .
Instead of an iPod nano , give your kids the tools they need to be financially independent adults .
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) -
Last year you caved and bought your kid an iPod , now they want a nano .
Where does it end ?
" Just say no , " said Janet Bodnar , author of " Raising Money Smart Kids "
Many parents struggle with not buying their children what they desire when they can afford to do so .
But " it has nothing to do with whether you can afford it , " warned Neale Godfrey , author of " Money Still Does n't Grow on Trees . "
" It has to do with the values you want to raise the kids with . "
Let your child in on your spending decisions and convey the reasons behind the choices that you are making .
Explain that " we are saving money for a vacation or something else , " Bodnar said , who believes the biggest problem parents have is not talking to their kids about money .
Here are a few other suggestions to keep your kid from becoming a brat .
Give them an early start Starting when your kids are young , give them a simple lesson in finances .
" Explain to them that the bank is a big piggy bank for Mom and Dad , " Bodnar said , make sure they realize that the money you have in the bank is not limitless , but only as much as you have put in .
Even as early as three years old , your children begin to understand that money is the medium of exchange , which means that 's when their financial education should start , according to Godfrey .
" It 's easier if you start them at three than at 18 , " she said .
But if you are already faced with disillusioned teens , it 's not too late to teach them money - smart lessons .
Give them boundaries
Adhere to limitations on how much money you will spend .
If your child wants an iPod nano , then let them buy it with their own money .
You are n't obligated to finance everything your kid wants to buy .
" I always say kids will spend unlimited amounts of money as long as it is yours , " Bodnar said .
Letting them spend their own money and make their own decisions as to how they want to parcel that out will help them grow into financially capable adults .
Give them responsibility " Teach them as little ones the natural consequences of money , " said Godfrey .
" The only way to get it is to earn it . "
Let them manage their own money at an early age so they can develop the tools they need to become financially independent adults .
Godfrey suggests teaching your kids to set aside some of their own money , like 10 percent , for charity and then dividing up the rest between funds for instant gratification , interim spending and long - term savings .
" Get them involved in how money is spent in real life , " Godfrey said .
Give them an allowance Experts suggest starting with a base allowance that is the anywhere from half the child 's age to equal to the child 's age per week .
You can always add more or supplement their allowance by paying them to do additional chores around the house .
But do n't pay them make their beds .
Kids need to recognize that cleaning their room and clearing the table are " citizen of the house " duties that do n't come with a financial reward .
Instead , let your child earn extra money by completing work - for - pay tasks , such as doing laundry or stacking newspapers for recycling .
Do n't give in As your kids get older , movies tickets , cell phones and Starbucks will be just some of the many additional expenses .
Adhere to the allowance system and , if necessary , start them on a clothing allowance .
You can set the budget and then they can decide what they want and if they want to supplement their allowance with their own money .
If your daughter is coveting a pair of Juicy jeans , let her earn extra money to buy them .
If you child has a cell phone , agree to pay for the basic plan but draw the line there .
If they go over their minutes by calling and text messaging their friends , then they should pay the additional charges .
" Say :
This is what you owe me this month , " Bodnar advised .
And if they have reached -- gasp -- driving age and are using the car , then they should pay for their own gas , parking tickets and even for part of the added insurance cost .
" They need to understand the responsibility that goes along with having access to a car , " Godfrey said .
The important thing to remember is that you are not depriving them , you are giving them a financial education that will be extremely valuable in the long run .

Most of you are probably comfortable enough around computers to know that even if a file got deleted accidentally , and it ’s not in the recycle bin , there are a few ways to get it back .
I wrote an article about hard disk recovery a while ago , covering different free solutions to help you get your data back in case of a disaster , but this is something completely different .
To do our little experiment we will need :
A freshly formatted floppy disk
An hex editor that let you edit the content of a drive or partition ( I used tiny hexer for this article .
This editor is very small , free and simple to use )
WARNING : If you are not VERY careful , you could be corrupting data on your media by doing this .
Only do it on a test disk that has no important data on it .
If you really need to recover something important , use a data recovery software .
First , you have to know that files are still on the disk , even after you delete them .
The only thing that happens when you erase one is that the pointer to the file gets removed from the drive index , marking the old file location as " Free " .
The next time you write something on your disk , you may end up overwriting your precious data since the old location is now marked as available .
That is why you have to execute this procedure as soon as possible after deleting a file .
DO NOT DEFRAGMENT your drive if you need to accomplish this procedure !
Doing so would render all data recovery impossible .
Why ?
Because as you probably know , defragmenting the drive puts file fragments back together , moving information from one location to another .
If the pointer in the index points to something that is n't there anymore , you will not be able to recover anything .
1- Format your floppy
2- Create a text file named test .
txt in notepad and save it on a : ( could be any letter )
3- Start your hex editor , and open your a : drive for editing
4- Go to Sector 19 ( Sector 19 is where the directory listing is on a floppy disk ; it goes up to sector 32 ) .
The name of your file should be right there , written both in HEX and alphanumerical values .
5- Switch to your floppy drive and shift - delete test.txt
6- Go back to TinyHex and Refresh sector 19 ( go to sector 18 , and back to 19 ) .
You should now see that the name of your file is still there , but its first letter was replaced by the å character ( hex E5 ) .
This indicates that the file was deleted .
All you have to do now to undelete it is to type back its first letter on top of the å character .
7- Save your modification
8- Open your a : drive , Wow !
The file magically reappeared on the floppy !
A floppy disk is composed of 2879 sectors :
0 : Boot Track
1 - 9 : First FAT
10 - 18 : Second FAT
19 - 32 : Disk Directory
33-2879 : Data Area
For any FAT 12 and 16 volumes , the directory listing is always located right after the second FAT and has a fixed length .
Under FAT32 , the root directory is treated like a normal directory , and can be relocated and expanded in size .
The FAT32 starting cluster is located in the boot sector at offset 2Ch ( Most of the time , it points to a location after the second fat anyway ) .
NTFS :
Recovering data manually from NTFS is a bit more complex because the location of each file is noted in the MFT ( Master Fat Table ) , and that table is unfortunately not located in a predefined sector such as on FAT volumes .
The Master file table is an index that contains every files on the volume .
For each file , the MFT keeps records called attributes and each of these attributes store a different type of information .
First , you 'll need to locate the exact position of the MFT on your disk .
To do that , start your HEX editor and load up the desired partition .
You should now be looking at sector 0 ( Boot Sector ) .
I 'll give you a few hints about how to start your little research , but you 'll have to do the rest by yourself .
An NTFS boot sector is divided in 6 parts
0x00 : Jump instruction
0x03 : OEM ID
0X0B : BPB
0X24 : Extended BPB
0X54 : Bootstrap code
0X01FE : End of Sector Marker
The BPB portion of the boot sector tells you at which logical clusters the MFT is .
The exact position would be at 0x30 with a length of 8 bytes .
The result would give you the Logical Cluster Number for the MFT file .
NTFS.com has an EXCELLENT tutorial about how to recover data from an NTFS partition , I suggest that you continue your little experiment over there .
There are very little resources on the web about how to recover file manually from an NTFS partition .
Your best bet would be at NTFS.com .
If you really want to dig deeper in this subject , go and get yourself WinHEX .
Winhex is the best hex editor on the market ( In my own opinion ) .
You 'll be amazed by the functionalities of this wonderful application .

錯視のカタログ・本サイト版
錯視（さくし）とは、いわゆる目の錯覚のことです。英語の" visual illusion " あるい は" optical illusion " は不可能図形・反転図形・だまし絵なども含む広い概念ですが、日本語の「錯視」はそのあたりはあいまいで、日本の心理学研究では、対象の大きさや色が「実際」とは違って見えたり、静止画なのに動いて見える現象などのことを錯視と呼ぶことが多いです（最近そうでもないような・・・）。錯視は心理現象ですから個人差が大きいです。錯視は起きるとおもしろいですが、起きなくても何の問題もありません。

This would have seemed an opportune moment to move ahead with Country of Origin Labeling for all meats , scheduled to take effect at the end of this month under federal law .
But some of the biggest players in the meat industry formed the Meat Promotion Coalition and hired a lobbying firm to see that the regulation was delayed until 2008 , even though 86 percent of the public says it wants to know where its meat comes from , according to a survey published in The Packer , the newspaper of the beef industry .
Cargill , Tyson Food , the National Cattlemen ’s Association and the National Pork Producers Council are the best known members of the coalition , which says the labeling costs too much .
Et Tu , Ben and Jerry ?
First Chicago banned the sale of foie gras .
Then Whole Foods stopped selling live lobster .
Now Ben and Jerry ’s has pledged not to use eggs that come from a farm that the Humane Society of the United States has accused of being cruel to its laying hens .
Animal rights activists are on a roll .
While they pursue high - profile cases they are also signing up farmers who , in exchange for taking a pledge to treat their animals humanely , are permitted to label their products “ Certified Humane . ”
In its latest efforts on behalf of animals , the Humane Society has shamed Ben and Jerry ’s into changing to eggs from cage - free hens by calling the company hypocritical for criticizing “ giant industrial farming operations ” on its Web site .
Meanwhile , back in Chicago , the Illinois Restaurant Association , along with other interested parties , has sued the city to halt enforcement of the foie gras ban .
And Whole Foods is reportedly building special housing to make lobsters more comfortable in its stores so its customers wo n’t have to go elsewhere to buy them .
Hunchentoot - The Common Lisp web server formerly known as TBNL
Abstract Hunchentoot is a web server written in Common Lisp and at the same time a toolkit for building dynamic websites .
As a stand - alone web server , Hunchentoot is capable of HTTP / 1.1 chunking ( both directions ) , persistent connections ( keep - alive ) , and SSL .
Hunchentoot provides facilities like automatic session handling ( with and without cookies ) , logging , customizable error handling , and easy access to GET and POST parameters sent by the client .
It does not include functionality to programmatically generate HTML output .
For this task you can use any library you like , e.g. ( shameless self - plug ) CL - WHO or HTML - TEMPLATE .
Hunchentoot talks with its front - end or with the client over TCP / IP sockets and optionally uses multiprocessing to handle several requests at the same time .
Therefore , it cannot be implemented completely in portable Common Lisp .
It currently works with LispWorks and all Lisps which are supported by the compatibility layers usocket and Bordeaux Threads .
Hunchentoot comes with a BSD - style license so you can basically do with it whatever you want .
Hunchentoot is ( or was ) for example used by QuickHoney , City Farming , Heike Stephan .
Download shortcut : http://weitz.de/files/hunchentoot.tar.gz.
: HUNCHENTOOT-NO-SSL
* FEATURES *
Hunchentoot will only work with Lisps where the character codes of all Latin - 1 characters coincide with their Unicode code points ( which is the case for all current implementations I know ) .
Hunchentoot itself together with this documentation can be downloaded from https://github.com/edicl/hunchentoot/archive/v1.3.0.tar.gz.
The current version is 1.3.0 .
The preferred method to compile and load Hunchentoot is via ASDF .
If you want to avoid downloading and installing all the dependencies manually , give Zach Beane 's excellent Quicklisp system a try .
Hunchentoot and its dependencies can also be installed with clbuild .
There 's also a port for Gentoo Linux thanks to Matthew Kennedy .
The current development version of Hunchentoot can be found at https://github.com/edicl/hunchentoot.
If you want to send patches , please fork the github repository and send pull requests .
" / hunchentoot "
Of course , there are several other ( more lightweight ) web proxies that you could use instead of Apache .
The development version of Hunchentoot can be found on github .
Please use the github issue tracking system to submit bug reports .
Patches are welcome , please use GitHub pull requests .
If you want to make a change , please read this first .
http://127.0.0.1:4242/
By default , Hunchentoot serves the files from the www / directory in its source tree .
In the distribution , that directory contains a HTML version of the documentation as well as the error templates .
The location of the document root directory can be specified when creating a new ACCEPTOR instance by the way of the ACCEPTOR - DOCUMENT - ROOT .
Likewise , the location of the error template directory can be specified by the ACCEPTOR - ERROR - TEMPLATE -DIRECTORY .
Both ACCEPTOR -DOCUMENT-ROOT
and ACCEPTOR -ERROR -TEMPLATE-DIRECTORY
can be specified using a logical pathname , which will be translated once when the ACCEPTOR is instantiated .
The EASY - ACCEPTOR class implements a framework for developing web applications .
Handlers are defined using the DEFINE - EASY - HANDLER macro .
Request dispatching is performed according to the list of dispatch functions in * DISPATCH - TABLE * .
Each of the functions on that list is called to determine whether it wants to handle the request , provided as single argument .
If a dispatcher function wants to handle the request , it returns another function to actually create the desired page .
DEFINE -EASY -HANDLER
is accompanied by a set of dispatcher creation functions that can be used to create dispatchers for standard tasks .
These are documented in the subchapter on easy handlers
Now be a bit more adventurous , try this

Hunchentoot comes with a little example website which you can use to see if it works and which should also demonstrate a couple of the things you can do with Hunchentoot .
To start the example website , enter the following code into your listener :
http://127.0.0.1:4242/hunchentoot/test
Adam Petersen has written a book called " Lisp for the Web " which explains how Hunchentoot and some other libraries can be used to build web sites .
Here is some software which extends Hunchentoot or is based on it :
Clack is a web server abstraction layer , defaulting to Hunchentoot .
hunchentoot - cgi ( by Cyrus Harmon ) provides CGI handlers for Hunchentoot .
CL -WEBDAV is a WebDAV server based on Hunchentoot .
RESTAS is a web framework based on Hunchentoot .
Caveman , Radiance , Snooze or again Weblocks are frameworks compatible with it .
[ Standard class ]
acceptor
To create a Hunchentoot webserver , you make an instance of this class or one of its subclasses and use the generic function START to start it ( and STOP to stop it ) .
Use the : port initarg if you do n't want to listen on the default http port 80 .
If 0 is specified for the port , the system chooses a random port to listen on .
The port number choosen can be retrieved using the ACCEPTOR - PORT accessor .
The port number chosen is retained across stopping and starting the acceptor .
There are other initargs most of which you probably wo n't need very often .
They are explained in detail in the docstrings of the slot definitions .
Unless you are in a Lisp without MP capabilities , you can have several active instances of ACCEPTOR ( listening on different ports ) at the same time .
[ Standard class ]
ssl-acceptor
Create and START an instance of this class ( instead of ACCEPTOR ) if you want an https server .
There are two required initargs , :SSL - CERTIFICATE -FILE and :SSL - PRIVATEKEY -FILE , for pathname designators denoting the certificate file and the key file in PEM format .
On LispWorks , you can have both in one file in which case the second initarg is optional .
You can also use the :SSL - PRIVATEKEY - PASSWORD initarg to provide a password ( as a string ) for the key file ( or NIL , the default , for no password ) .
The default port for SSL - ACCEPTOR instances is 443 instead of 80
[ Generic function ]
start acceptor => acceptor
Starts acceptor so that it begins accepting connections .
Returns the acceptor .
[ Generic function ]
stop acceptor &key soft => acceptor
Stops the acceptor so that it no longer accepts requests .
If soft is true , and there are any requests in progress , wait until all requests are fully processed , but meanwhile do not accept new requests .
Note that soft must not be set when calling stop from within a request handler , as that will deadlock .
[ Generic function ]
started - p acceptor => generalized - boolean
Tells if acceptor has been started .
The default implementation simply queries acceptor for its listening status , so if T is returned to the calling thread , then some thread has called start or some thread 's call to stop has n't finished .
If NIL is returned either some thread has called stop , or some thread 's call to start has n't finished or start was never called at all for acceptor .
[ Special variable ]
* acceptor *
The current ACCEPTOR object in the context of a request .
[ Generic function ]
acceptor - listen - backlog listen - backlog => number - of - pending - connections
Number of pending connections allowed in the listen socket before the kernel rejects further incoming connections .
Non-LispWorks only .
[ Generic readers ]
acceptor - address acceptor => address
acceptor - port acceptor => port
acceptor - read - timeout acceptor => read - timeout
acceptor - ssl- certificate - file ssl- acceptor => ssl-certificate - file
acceptor - ssl - privatekey - file ssl - acceptor => ssl - privatekey - file
acceptor - ssl - privatekey - password ssl - acceptor => ssl - privatekey - password
acceptor - write - timeout acceptor => write - timeout
These are readers for various slots of ACCEPTOR objects ( and some of them obviously only make sense for SSL - ACCEPTOR objects ) .
See the docstrings of these slots for more information and note that there are corresponding initargs for all of them .
[ Generic accessors ]
acceptor-access-log-destination acceptor => ( or pathname null )
( setf ( acceptor - access - log - destination acceptor ) new - value )
acceptor - document - root acceptor => ( or pathname null )
( setf ( acceptor - document - root acceptor ) new - value )
acceptor - error - template - directory acceptor => ( or pathname null )
( setf ( acceptor - error - template - directory acceptor ) new - value )
acceptor - input - chunking - p acceptor => input - chunking - p
( setf ( acceptor - input - chunking - p acceptor ) new - value )
acceptor - message - log- destination acceptor => ( or pathname null )
( setf ( acceptor - message - log - destination acceptor ) new - value )
acceptor - name acceptor => name
( setf ( acceptor - name acceptor ) new - value )
acceptor - output - chunking - p acceptor => output - chunking -
p
( setf ( acceptor - output - chunking - p acceptor ) new - value )
acceptor - persistent - connections - p acceptor => persistent - connections -p
( setf ( acceptor - persistent - connections - p acceptor ) new - value )
acceptor - reply - class acceptor => reply - class
( setf ( acceptor - reply - class acceptor ) new - value )
acceptor - request - class acceptor => request - class
( setf ( acceptor - request - class acceptor ) new - value )
These are accessors for various slots of ACCEPTOR objects .
See the docstrings of these slots for more information and note that there are corresponding initargs for all of them .
[ Generic function ]
acceptor - ssl - p acceptor => generalized - boolean
Returns a true value if acceptor uses SSL connections .
The default is to unconditionally return NIL and subclasses of ACCEPTOR must specialize this method to signal that they 're using secure connections - see the SSL - ACCEPTOR class .
[ Special variable ]
* default - connection - timeout *
The default connection timeout used when an acceptor is reading from and writing to a socket stream .
Note that some Lisps allow you to set different timeouts for reading and writing and you can specify both values via initargs when you create an acceptor .
[ Generic function ]
acceptor - remove - session acceptor session => |
This function is called whenever a session in ACCEPTOR is being destroyed because of a session timout or an explicit REMOVE - SESSION call .
If you just want to use the standard acceptors that come with Hunchentoot , you do n't need to know anything about the functions listed in this section .
[ Generic function ]
start - listening acceptor => |
Sets up a listen socket for the given acceptor and enables it to listen to incoming connections .
This function is called from the thread that starts the acceptor initially and may return errors resulting from the listening operation ( like ' address in use ' or similar ) .
[ Generic function ]
accept - connections acceptor => nil
In a loop , accepts a connection and hands it over to the acceptor 's taskmaster for processing using HANDLE - INCOMING - CONNECTION .
On LispWorks , this function returns immediately , on other Lisps it returns only once the acceptor has been stopped .
[ Generic function ]
process - connection acceptor socket => nil
This function is called by the taskmaster when a new client connection has been established .
Its arguments are the ACCEPTOR object and a LispWorks socket handle or a usocket socket stream object in socket .
It reads the request headers , sets up the request and reply objects , and hands over to PROCESS - REQUEST which calls HANDLE - REQUEST to select and call a handler for the request and sends its reply to the client .
This is done in a loop until the stream has to be closed or until a connection timeout occurs .
It is probably not a good idea to re-implement this method until you really , really know what you 're doing .
Handlers may call to the DETACH - SOCKET generic function to indicate that no further requests should be handled on the connection by Hunchentoot , and that responsibility for the socket is assumed by third - party software .
This can be used by specialized handlers that wish to hand over connection polling or processing to functions outside of Hunchentoot , i.e. for connection multiplexing or implementing specialized client protocols .
Hunchentoot will finish processing the request and the PROCESS - CONNECTION function will return without closing the connection .
At that point , the acceptor may interact with the socket in whatever fashion required .
[ Generic function ]
detach - socket acceptor => nil
Indicate to Hunchentoot that it should stop serving requests on the current request 's socket .
Hunchentoot will finish processing the current request and then return from PROCESS - CONNECTION without closing the connection to the client .
DETACH -SOCKET can only be called from within a request handler function .
[ Generic function ]
initialize - connection - stream acceptor stream => stream
Can be used to modify the stream which is used to communicate between client and server before the request is read .
The default method of ACCEPTOR does nothing , but see for example the method defined for SSL - ACCEPTOR .
All methods of this generic function must return the stream to use .
[ Generic function ]
reset - connection - stream acceptor stream => stream
Resets the stream which is used to communicate between client and server after one request has been served so that it can be used to process the next request .
This generic function is called after a request has been processed and must return the stream .
[ Generic function ]
acceptor - log- access acceptor &key return - code
Function to call to log access to the acceptor .
The return - code keyword argument contains additional information about the request to log .
In addition , it can use the standard request and reply accessor functions that are available to handler functions to find out more information about the request .
[ Generic function ]
acceptor - log - message acceptor log - level format - string &rest format - arguments
Function to call to log messages by the acceptor .
It must accept a severity level for the message , which will be one of :ERROR , :INFO , or :WARNING , a format string and an arbitary number of formatting arguments .
[ Generic function ]
acceptor - status - message acceptor http - return - code &key &allow - other - keys
This function is called when a request 's handler has been called but failed to provide content to send back to the client .
It converts the HTTP - STATUS - CODE to some request contents , typically a human readable description of the status code to be displayed to the user .
If an ERROR - TEMPLATE - DIRECTORY is set in the current acceptor and the directory contains a file corresponding to HTTP - STATUS - CODE named < code >.html , that file is sent to the client after variable substitution .
Variables are referenced by $ {< variable - name >} .
Additional keyword arguments may be provided which are made available to the templating logic as substitution variables .
These variables can be interpolated into error message templates in , which contains the current URL relative to the server and without GET parameters .
In addition to the variables corresponding to keyword arguments , the script - name , lisp - implementation - type , lisp - implementation - version and hunchentoot - version variables are available .

You can control the resources consumed by a threaded taskmaster via two initargs .
: max - thread - count lets you set the maximum number of request threads that can be processes simultaneously .
If this is nil , the is no thread limit imposed .
: max - accept - count lets you set the maximum number of requests that can be outstanding ( i.e. being processed or queued for processing ) .
If : max - thread - count is supplied and : max - accept - count is NIL , then a +HTTP - SERVICE - UNAVAILABLE + error will be generated if there are more than the max - thread - count threads processing requests .
If both : max - thread - count and : max - accept - count are supplied , then max - thread - count must be less than max - accept - count ; if more than max - thread - count requests are being processed , then requests up to max - accept - count will be queued until a thread becomes available .
If more than max - accept - count requests are outstanding , then a +HTTP - SERVICE - UNAVAILABLE + error will be generated .
In a load - balanced environment with multiple Hunchentoot servers , it 's reasonable to provide : max - thread - count but leave : max - accept - count null .
This will immediately result in +HTTP - SERVICE - UNAVAILABLE +
when one server is out of resources , so the load balancer can try to find another server .
In an environment with a single Hunchentoot server , it 's reasonable to provide both : max - thread - count and a somewhat larger value for : max - accept - count .
This will cause a server that 's almost out of resources to wait a bit ; if the server is completely out of resources , then the reply will be +HTTP - SERVICE -UNAVAILABLE + .
The default for these values is 100 and 120 , respectively .
If you want to implement your own taskmasters , you should subclass TASKMASTER or one of its subclasses , SINGLE - THREADED-TASKMASTER or ONE - THREAD-PER-CONNECTION -TASKMASTER , and specialize the generic functions in this section .
[ Standard class ]
taskmaster
An instance of this class is responsible for distributing the work of handling requests for its acceptor .
This is an " abstract " class in the sense that usually only instances of subclasses of TASKMASTER will be used .
[ Standard class ]
one - thread - per - connection - taskmaster
A taskmaster that starts one thread for listening to incoming requests and one thread for each incoming connection .
This is the default taskmaster implementation for multi- threaded Lisp implementations .
[ Standard class ]
single - threaded - taskmaster
A taskmaster that runs synchronously in the thread where the START function was invoked ( or in the case of LispWorks in the thread started by COMM : START - UP - SERVER ) .
This is the simplest possible taskmaster implementation in that its methods do nothing but calling their acceptor " sister " methods - EXECUTE -ACCEPTOR calls ACCEPT-CONNECTIONS , HANDLE -INCOMING -CONNECTION
calls PROCESS -CONNECTION .
[ Standard class ]
multi - threaded - taskmaster
This is an abstract class for taskmasters that use multiple threads ; it is not a concrete class and you should not instantiate it with MAKE - INSTANCE .
Instead , you should instantiate its subclass ONE - THREAD - PER - CONNECTION - TASKMASTER described above .
MULTI -THREADED -TASKMASTER
is intended to be inherited from by extensions to Hunchentoot , such as quux - hunchentoot 's THREAD - POOLING - TASKMASTER , though at the moment , doing so only inherits one slot and one method , on EXECUTE - ACCEPTOR , to have it start a new thread for the acceptor , then saved in said slot .
[ Generic function ]
execute - acceptor taskmaster => result
This is a callback called by the acceptor once it has performed all initial processing to start listening for incoming connections ( see START - LISTENING ) .
It usually calls the ACCEPT - CONNECTIONS method of the acceptor , but depending on the taskmaster instance the method might be called from a new thread .
[ Generic function ]
handle - incoming - connection taskmaster socket => result
This function is called by the acceptor to start processing of requests on a new incoming connection .
socket is the usocket instance that represents the new connection ( or a socket handle on LispWorks ) .
The taskmaster starts processing requests on the incoming connection by calling the PROCESS - CONNECTION method of the acceptor instance .
The socket argument is passed to PROCESS - CONNECTION as an argument .
If the taskmaster is a multi- threaded taskmaster , HANDLE - INCOMING -THREAD will call CREATE -REQUEST -HANDLER -THREAD , which will call PROCESS - CONNECTION in a new thread .
HANDLE - INCOMING -THREAD might issue a +HTTP - SERVICE -UNAVAILABLE +
error if there are too many request threads or it might block waiting for a request thread to finish .
[ Generic function ]
start - thread taskmaster thunk &key => thread
This function is a callback that starts a new thread that will call the given thunk in the context of the proper taskmaster , with appropriate context - dependent keyword arguments .
ONE - THREAD-PER-CONNECTION -TASKMASTER
uses it in EXECUTE - ACCEPTOR and CREATE -REQUEST -HANDLER-THREAD
, but specialized taskmasters may define more functions that use it .
By default , it just creates a thread calling the thunk with a specified name keyword argument .
Specialized taskmasters may wrap special bindings and condition handlers around the thunk call , register the thread in a management table , etc .
[ Generic function ]
create - request - handler - thread taskmaster socket => thread
This function is called by HANDLE - INCOMING - THREAD to create a new thread which calls PROCESS - CONNECTION .
If you specialize this function , you must be careful to have the thread call DECREMENT - TASKMASTER - REQUEST-COUNT before it exits .
A typical method will look like this : ( defmethod create - request - handler - thread ( ( taskmaster monitor - taskmaster ) socket ) ( bt : make - thread ( lambda ( ) ( with - monitor - error - handlers ( unwind - protect ( with - monitor - variable - bindings ( process - connection ( taskmaster - acceptor taskmaster ) socket ) ) ( decrement - taskmaster - request - count taskmaster ) ) ) ) ) )
[ Generic function ]
shutdown taskmaster => taskmaster
Shuts down the taskmaster , i.e. frees all resources that were set up by it .
For example , a multi - threaded taskmaster might terminate all threads that are currently associated with it .
This function is called by the acceptor 's STOP method .
[ Generic accessor ]
taskmaster - acceptor taskmaster => acceptor
( setf ( taskmaster - acceptor taskmaster ) new - value )
This is an accessor for the slot of a TASKMASTER object that links back to the acceptor it is associated with .
The ACCEPTOR class defines a ACCEPTOR - DISPATCH -REQUEST generic function which is used to actually dispatch the request .
This function is called by the default method of HANDLE - REQUEST .
Each ACCEPTOR -DISPATCH-REQUEST
method looks at the request object and depending on its contents decides to either handle the request or call the next method .
In order to dispatch a request , Hunchentoot calls the ACCEPTOR - DISPATCH -REQUEST generic functions .
The method for ACCEPTOR tries to serve a static file relative to it's ACCEPTOR - DOCUMENT - ROOT .
Application specific acceptor subclasses will typically perform URL parsing and dispatching according to the policy that is required .
The default method of HANDLE - REQUEST sets up standard logging and error handling before it calls the acceptor 's request dispatcher .
Request handlers do their work by modifying the reply object if necessary and by eventually returning the response body in the form of a string or a binary sequence .
As an alternative , they can also call SEND - HEADERS and write directly to a stream .
The EASY - ACCEPTOR class defines a method for ACCEPTOR - DISPATCH -REQUEST that walks through the list * DISPATCH - TABLE * which consists of dispatch functions .
Each of these functions accepts the request object as its only argument and either returns a request handler to handle the request or NIL which means that the next dispatcher in the list will be tried .
A request handler is a function of zero arguments which relies on the special variable * REQUEST * to access the request instance being serviced .
If all dispatch functions return NIL , the next ACCEPTOR - DISPATCH -REQUEST will be called .
N.B . All functions and variables in this section are related to the easy request dispatch mechanism and are meaningless if you 're using your own request dispatcher .
[ Standard class ]
easy - acceptor
This class defines no additional slots with respect to ACCEPTOR .
It only serves as an additional type for dispatching calls to ACCEPTOR - DISPATCH - REQUEST .
In order to use the easy handler framework , acceptors of this class or one of its subclasses must be used .
[ Standard class ]
easy - ssl- acceptor
This class mixes the SSL - ACCEPTOR and the EASY - ACCEPTOR classes .
It is used when both ssl and the easy handler framework are required .
[ Special variable ]
* dispatch - table *
A global list of dispatch functions .
The initial value is a list consisting of the symbol DISPATCH - EASY - HANDLERS .
[ Function ]
create - prefix - dispatcher prefix handler => dispatch -fn
A convenience function which will return a dispatcher that returns handler whenever the path part of the request URI starts with the string prefix .
[ Function ]
create - regex - dispatcher regex handler => dispatch -fn
A convenience function which will return a dispatcher that returns handler whenever the path part of the request URI matches the CL - PPCRE regular expression regex ( which can be a string , an s- expression , or a scanner ) .
[ Function ]
create - folder - dispatcher - and - handler uri-prefix base - path &optional content - type => dispatch -fn
Creates and returns a dispatch function which will dispatch to a handler function which emits the file relative to base - path that is denoted by the URI of the request relative to uri-prefix .
uri-prefix must be a string ending with a slash , base - path must be a pathname designator for an existing directory .
Uses HANDLE - STATIC -FILE internally .
If content - type is not NIL , it will be used as a the content type for all files in the folder .
Otherwise ( which is the default ) the content type of each file will be determined as usual .
[ Function ]
create - static - file - dispatcher - and - handler uri path &optional content - type => result
Creates and returns a request dispatch function which will dispatch to a handler function which emits the file denoted by the pathname designator PATH with content type CONTENT - TYPE if the SCRIPT - NAME of the request matches the string URI .
If CONTENT - TYPE is NIL , tries to determine the content type via the file 's suffix .
[ Macro ]
define - easy - handler description lambda - list [ [ declaration * | documentation ] ] form *
Defines a handler as if by DEFUN and optionally registers it with a URI so that it will be found by DISPATCH - EASY - HANDLERS .
description is either a symbol name or a list matching the destructuring lambda list ( name &key uri acceptor - names default - parameter - type default - request - type ) .
lambda - list is a list the elements of which are either a symbol var or a list matching the destructuring lambda list ( var &key real - name parameter - type init - form request - type ) .
The resulting handler will be a Lisp function with the name name and keyword parameters named by the var symbols .
Each var will be bound to the value of the GET or POST parameter called real - name ( a string ) before the body of the function is executed .
If real - name is not provided , it will be computed by downcasing the symbol name of var .
If uri ( which is evaluated ) is provided , then it must be a string or a function designator for a unary function .
In this case , the handler will be returned by DISPATCH - EASY - HANDLERS , if uri is a string and the script name of the current request is uri , or if uri designates a function and applying this function to the current REQUEST object returns a true value .
acceptor - names ( which is evaluated ) can be a list of symbols which means that the handler will only be returned by DISPATCH - EASY - HANDLERS in acceptors which have one of these names ( see ACCEPTOR - NAME ) .
acceptor - names can also be the symbol T which means that the handler will be returned by DISPATCH - EASY - HANDLERS in every acceptor .
Whether the GET or POST parameter ( or both ) will be taken into consideration , depends on request - type which can be :GET , : POST , : BOTH , or NIL .
In the last case , the value of default - request - type ( the default of which is : BOTH ) will be used .
The value of var will usually be a string ( unless it resulted from a file upload in which case it wo n't be converted at all ) , but if parameter - type ( which is evaluated ) is provided , the string will be converted to another Lisp type by the following rules :
If the corresponding GET or POST parameter was n't provided by the client , var 's value will be NIL .
If parameter - type is ' STRING , var 's value remains as is .
If parameter - type is 'INTEGER and the parameter string consists solely of decimal digits , var 's value will be the corresponding integer , otherwise NIL .
If parameter - type is ' KEYWORD , var 's value will be the keyword obtained by interning the upcased parameter string into the keyword package .
If parameter - type is 'CHARACTER and the parameter string is of length one , var 's value will be the single character of this string , otherwise NIL .
If parameter - type is ' BOOLEAN , var 's value will always be T ( unless it is NIL by the first rule above , of course ) .
If parameter - type is any other atom , it is supposed to be a function designator for a unary function which will be called to convert the string to something else .
Those were the rules for simple parameter types , but parameter - type can also be a list starting with one of the symbols LIST , ARRAY , or HASH - TABLE .
The second value of the list must always be a simple parameter type as in the last paragraph - we 'll call it the inner type below .
In the case of ' LIST , all GET / POST parameters called real - name will be collected , converted to the inner type as by the rules above , and assembled into a list which will be the value of var .
In the case of ' ARRAY , all GET / POST parameters which have a name like the result of ( format nil " ~ A [ ~A ] " real - name n ) where n is a non-negative integer , will be assembled into an array where the n th element will be set accordingly , after conversion to the inner type .
The array , which will become the value of var , will be big enough to hold all matching parameters , but not bigger .
Array elements not set as described above will be NIL .
Note that VAR will always be bound to an array , which may be empty , so it will never be NIL , even if no appropriate GET / POST parameters are found .
The full form of a ' HASH - TABLE parameter type is ( hash - table inner - type key - type test - function ) but key - type and test - function can be left out in which case they default to ' STRING and ' EQUAL , respectively .
For this parameter type , all GET / POST parameters which have a name like the result of ( format nil " ~A{ ~ A} " real - name key ) ( where key is a string that does n't contain curly brackets ) will become the values ( after conversion to inner - type ) of a hash table with test function test - function where key ( after conversion to key - type ) will be the corresponding key .
Note that var will always be bound to a hash table , which may be empty , so it will never be NIL , even if no appropriate GET / POST parameters are found .
To make matters even more complicated , the three compound parameter types also have an abbreviated form - just one of the symbols LIST , ARRAY , or HASH - TABLE .
In this case , the inner type will default to ' STRING .
If parameter - type is not provided or NIL , default - parameter - type ( the default of which is ' STRING ) will be used instead .
If the result of the computations above would be that var would be bound to NIL , then init - form ( if provided ) will be evaluated instead , and var will be bound to the result of this evaluation .
Handlers built with this macro are constructed in such a way that the resulting Lisp function is useful even outside of Hunchentoot .
Specifically , all the parameter computations above will only happen if * REQUEST * is bound , i.e. if we 're within a Hunchentoot request .
Otherwise , var will always be bound to the result of evaluating init - form unless a corresponding keyword argument is provided .
The example code that comes with Hunchentoot contains an example which demonstrates some of the features of DEFINE - EASY - HANDLER .
[ Function ]
dispatch - easy - handlers request => result
This is a dispatcher which returns the appropriate handler defined with DEFINE - EASY - HANDLER , if there is one .
request
If you need more fine - grained control over the behaviour of request objects , you can subclass REQUEST and initialize the REQUEST - CLASS slot of the ACCEPTOR class accordingly .
The acceptor will generate request objects of the class named by this slot .
[ Standard class ]
request
Objects of this class hold all the information about an incoming request .
They are created automatically by acceptors and can be accessed by the corresponding handler .
You should not mess with the slots of these objects directly , but you can subclass REQUEST in order to implement your own behaviour .
See the REQUEST - CLASS slot of the ACCEPTOR class .
[ Special variable ]
* request *
The current REQUEST object while in the context of a request .
[ Function ]
real - remote - addr &optional request => string{ , list}
Returns the ' X - Forwarded - For ' incoming http header as the second value in the form of a list of IP addresses and the first element of this list as the first value if this header exists .
Otherwise returns the value of REMOTE - ADDR as the only value .
[ Function ]
parameter name &optional request => string
Returns the GET or the POST parameter with name name ( a string ) - or NIL if there is none .
If both a GET and a POST parameter with the same name exist the GET parameter is returned .
Search is case - sensitive .
See also GET - PARAMETER and POST - PARAMETER .
[ Function ]
get - parameter name &optional request => string
Returns the value of the GET parameter ( as provided via the request URI ) named by the string name as a string ( or NIL if there ai n't no GET parameter with this name ) .
Note that only the first value will be returned if the client provided more than one GET parameter with the name name .
See also GET - PARAMETERS * .
[ Function ]
post - parameter name &optional request => string
Returns the value of the POST parameter ( as provided in the request 's body ) named by the string name .
Note that only the first value will be returned if the client provided more than one POST parameter with the name name .
This value will usually be a string ( or NIL if there ai n't no POST parameter with this name ) .
If , however , the browser sent a file through a multipart / form - data form , the value of this function is a three - element list ( path file - name content - type ) where path is a pathname denoting the place were the uploaded file was stored , file - name ( a string ) is the file name sent by the browser , and content - type ( also a string ) is the content type sent by the browser .
The file denoted by path will be deleted after the request has been handled - you have to move or copy it somewhere else if you want to keep it .
POST parameters will only be computed if the content type of the request body was multipart / form - data or application / x - www - form - urlencoded .
Although this function is called POST - PARAMETER , you can instruct Hunchentoot to compute these parameters for other request methods by setting *METHODS -FOR - POST -PARAMETERS * .
See also POST - PARAMETERS and * TMP - DIRECTORY * .
[ Function ]
get - parameters * &optional request => alist
Returns an alist of all GET parameters ( as provided via the request URI ) .
The car of each element of this list is the parameter 's name while the cdr is its value ( as a string ) .
The elements of this list are in the same order as they were within the request URI .
See also GET - PARAMETER .
[ Function ]
post - parameters * &optional request => alist
Returns an alist of all POST parameters ( as provided via the request 's body ) .
The car of each element of this list is the parameter 's name while the cdr is its value .
The elements of this list are in the same order as they were within the request 's body .
See also POST - PARAMETER .
[ Special variable ]
* methods - for - post - parameters *
A list of the request method types ( as keywords ) for which Hunchentoot will try to compute post - parameters .
[ Function ]
cookie - in name &optional request => string
Returns the cookie with the name name ( a string ) as sent by the browser - or NIL if there is none .
[ Function ]
cookies - in* &optional request => alist
Returns an alist of all cookies associated with the REQUEST object request .
[ Function ]
host &optional request => host
Returns the ' Host ' incoming http header value .
[ Function ]
query - string * &optional request => string
Returns the query string of the REQUEST object request .
That 's the part behind the question mark ( i.e. the GET parameters ) .
[ Function ]
referer &optional request => result
Returns the ' Referer ' ( sic ! ) http header .
[ Function ]
request - method * &optional request => keyword
Returns the request method as a Lisp keyword .
[ Function ]
request - uri* &optional request => uri
Returns the request URI .
[ Function ]
server - protocol * &optional request => keyword
Returns the request protocol as a Lisp keyword .
[ Function ]
user - agent &optional request => result
Returns the ' User - Agent ' http header .
[ Function ]
header - in* name &optional request => header
Returns the incoming header with name name .
name can be a keyword ( recommended ) or a string .
[ Function ]
headers - in* &optional request => alist
Returns an alist of the incoming headers associated with the REQUEST object request .
[ Function ]
remote - addr* &optional request => address
Returns the address the current request originated from .
[ Function ]
remote - port * &optional request => port
Returns the port the current request originated from .
[ Function ]
local - addr* &optional request => address
The IP address of the local system that the client connected to .
[ Function ]
local - port * &optional request => port
The TCP port number of the local system that the client connected to .
[ Function ]
script - name * &optional request => script-name
Returns the file name of the REQUEST object request .
That 's the requested URI without the query string ( i.e the GET parameters ) .
[ Accessor ]
aux - request - value symbol &optional request => value , present -
p
( setf ( aux - request - value symbol &optional request ) new - value )
This accessor can be used to associate arbitrary data with the the symbol symbol in the REQUEST object request .
present - p is true if such data was found , otherwise NIL .
[ Function ]
delete - aux - request - value symbol &optional request => |
Removes the value associated with symbol from the REQUEST object request .
[ Function ]
authorization &optional request => result
Returns as two values the user and password ( if any ) as encoded in the ' AUTHORIZATION ' header .
Returns NIL if there is no such header .
[ Special variable ]
* hunchentoot - default -external - format *
The external format used to compute the REQUEST object .
[ Special variable ]
* file - upload - hook *
If this is not NIL , it should be a unary function which will be called with a pathname for each file which is uploaded to Hunchentoot .
The pathname denotes the temporary file to which the uploaded file is written .
The hook is called directly before the file is created .
At this point , * REQUEST * is already bound to the current REQUEST object , but obviously you can't access the post parameters yet .
[ Function ]
raw - post - data &key request external - format force - text force - binary want - stream => raw - body - or - stream
Returns the content sent by the client in the request body if there was any ( unless the content type was multipart / form - data in which case NIL is returned ) .
By default , the result is a string if the type of the Content - Type media type is " text " , and a vector of octets otherwise .
In the case of a string , the external format to be used to decode the content will be determined from the charset parameter sent by the client ( or otherwise *HUNCHENTOOT-DEFAULT-EXTERNAL-FORMAT * will be used ) .
You can also provide an external format explicitly ( through external - format ) in which case the result will unconditionally be a string .
Likewise , you can provide a true value for force - text which will force Hunchentoot to act as if the type of the media type had been " text " ( with external - format taking precedence if provided ) .
Or you can provide a true value for force - binary which means that you want a vector of octets at any rate .
( If both force - text and force - binary are true , an error will be signaled . )
If , however , you provide a true value for want - stream , the other parameters are ignored and you 'll get the content ( flexi ) stream to read from it yourself .
It is then your responsibility to read the correct amount of data , because otherwise you wo n't be able to return a response to the client .
The stream will have its octet position set to 0 .
If the client provided a Content - Length header , the stream will also have a corresponding bound , so no matter whether the client used chunked encoding or not , you can always read until EOF .
If the content type of the request was multipart / form - data or application / x - www - form - urlencoded , the content has been read by Hunchentoot already and you can't read from the stream anymore .
You can call RAW - POST - DATA more than once per request , but you can't mix calls which have different values for want - stream .
Note that this function is slightly misnamed because a client can send content even if the request method is not POST .
[ Function ]
recompute - request - parameters &key request external - format => |
Recomputes the GET and POST parameters for the REQUEST object request .
This only makes sense if you 're switching external formats during the request .
[ Generic function ]
process - request request => nil
This function is called by PROCESS - CONNECTION after the incoming headers have been read .
It calls HANDLE - REQUEST ( and is more or less just a thin wrapper around it ) to select and call a handler and send the output of this handler to the client .
Note that PROCESS - CONNECTION is called once per connection and loops in case of a persistent connection while PROCESS - REQUEST is called anew for each request .
The return value of this function is ignored .
Like PROCESS - CONNECTION , this is another function the behaviour of which you should only modify if you really , really know what you 're doing .
[ Generic function ]
handle - request acceptor request => content
This function is called by PROCESS - REQUEST once the request has been read and a REQUEST object has been created .
Its job is to actually handle the request , i.e. to return something to the client .
The default method calls the acceptor 's request dispatcher , but you can of course implement a different behaviour .
The default method also sets up standard error handling for the handler .
Might be a good place to bind or rebind special variables which can then be accessed by your handlers .
[ Generic function ]
acceptor - dispatch - request acceptor request => content
This function is called to actually dispatch the request once the standard logging and error handling has been set up .
ACCEPTOR subclasses implement methods for this function in order to perform their own request routing .
If a method does not want to handle the request , it is supposed to invoke CALL - NEXT - METHOD so that the next ACCEPTOR in the inheritance chain gets a chance to handle the request .
[ Generic readers ]
cookies - in request => cookies

These are various generic readers which are used to read information about a REQUEST object .
If you are writing a handler , you should not use these readers but instead utilize the corresponding functions with an asterisk at the end of their name , also listed in this section .
These generic readers are only exported for users who want to create their own subclasses of REQUEST .
reply
If you need more fine - grained control over the behaviour of reply objects , you can subclass REPLY and initialize the REPLY - CLASS slot of the ACCEPTOR class accordingly .
The acceptor will generate reply objects of the class named by this slot .
[ Standard class ]
reply
Objects of this class hold all the information about an outgoing reply .
They are created automatically by Hunchentoot and can be accessed and modified by the corresponding handler .
You should not mess with the slots of these objects directly , but you can subclass REPLY in order to implement your own behaviour .
See the : reply - class initarg of the ACCEPTOR class .
[ Special variable ]
* reply *
The current REPLY object in the context of a request .
[ Accessor ]
header - out name &optional reply => string
( setf ( header - out name &optional reply ) new - value )
HEADER -OUT returns the outgoing http header named by the keyword name if there is one , otherwise NIL .
SETF of HEADER - OUT changes the current value of the header named name .
If no header named name exists , it is created .
For backwards compatibility , name can also be a string in which case the association between a header and its name is case - insensitive .
Note that the header ' Set - Cookie ' cannot be queried by HEADER - OUT and must not be set by SETF of HEADER - OUT .
See also HEADERS - OUT * , CONTENT - TYPE * , CONTENT-LENGTH * , COOKIES - OUT * , and COOKIE - OUT .
[ Function ]
headers - out * &optional reply => alist
Returns an alist of the outgoing headers associated with the REPLY object reply .
See also HEADER - OUT .
[ Accessor ]
content - length * &optional reply => content - length
( setf ( content - length * &optional reply ) new - value )
The outgoing ' Content - Length ' http header of reply .
[ Accessor ]
content - type * &optional reply => content - type
( setf ( content - type * &optional reply ) new - value )
The outgoing ' Content - Type ' http header of reply .
[ Function ]
cookie - out name &optional reply => result
Returns the current value of the outgoing cookie named name .
Search is case - sensitive .
[ Accessor ]
cookies - out * &optional reply => alist
( setf ( cookies - out * &optional reply ) new - value )
Returns or sets an alist of the outgoing cookies associated with the REPLY object reply .
[ Accessor ]
return - code * &optional reply => return - code
( setf ( return - code * &optional reply ) new - value )
Gets or sets the http return code of reply .
The return code of each REPLY object is initially set to +HTTP - OK + .
[ Function ]
send - headers => stream
Sends the initial status line and all headers as determined by the REPLY object * REPLY * .
Returns a binary stream to which the body of the reply can be written .
Once this function has been called , further changes to * REPLY * do n't have any effect .
Also , automatic handling of errors ( i.e. sending the corresponding status code to the browser , etc. ) is turned off for this request and functions like REDIRECT or to ABORT - REQUEST - HANDLER wo n't have the desired effect once the headers are sent .
If your handlers return the full body as a string or as an array of octets , you should not call this function .
If a handler calls SEND - HEADERS , its return value is ignored .
[ Accessor ]
reply - external - format * &optional reply => external - format
( setf ( reply - external - format * &optional reply ) new - value )
Gets or sets the external format of reply which is used for character output .
[ Special variable ]
* default - content - type *
The default content - type header which is returned to the client .

Hunchentoot makes some reasonable effort to prevent eavesdroppers from hijacking sessions ( see below ) , but this should not be considered really secure .
Do n't store sensitive data in sessions and rely solely on the session mechanism as a safeguard against malicious users who want to get at this data !
For each request there 's one SESSION object which is accessible to the handler via the special variable * SESSION * .
This object holds all the information available about the session and can be accessed with the functions described in this chapter .
Note that the internal structure of SESSION objects should be considered opaque and may change in future releases of Hunchentoot .
Sessions are automatically verified for validity and age when the REQUEST object is instantiated , i.e. if * SESSION * is not NIL then this session is valid ( as far as Hunchentoot is concerned ) and not too old .
Old sessions are automatically removed .
Hunchentoot also provides a SESSION - REGENERATE - COOKIE -VALUE function that creates a new cookie value .
This helps to prevent against session fixation attacks , and should be used when a user logs in according to the application .
[ Standard class ]
session
SESSION objects are automatically maintained by Hunchentoot .
They should not be created explicitly with MAKE - INSTANCE but implicitly with START - SESSION and they should be treated as opaque objects .
You can ignore Hunchentoot 's SESSION objects and implement your own sessions if you provide corresponding methods for SESSION - COOKIE - VALUE and SESSION - VERIFY .
[ Function ]
start - session => session
Returns the current SESSION object .
If there is no current session , creates one and updates the corresponding data structures .
In this case the function will also send a session cookie to the browser .
[ Accessor ]
session - value symbol &optional session => value , present -
p
( setf ( session - value symbol &optional session ) new - value )
This accessor can be used to associate arbitrary data with the the symbol symbol in the SESSION object session .
present - p is true if such data was found , otherwise NIL .
The default value for session is * SESSION * .
If SETF of SESSION - VALUE is called with session being NIL then a session is automatically instantiated with START - SESSION .
[ Function ]
delete - session - value symbol &optional session => |
Removes the value associated with symbol from session if there is one .
[ Special variable ]
* session *
The current session while in the context of a request , or NIL .
[ Function ]
remove - session session => |
Completely removes the SESSION object session from Hunchentoot 's internal session database .
[ Function ]
reset - sessions &optional acceptor => |
Removes all stored sessions of acceptor .
The default for acceptor is * ACCEPTOR * .
[ Function ]
regenerate - session - cookie - value session => cookie
Regenerates the session cookie value .
This should be used when a user logs in according to the application to prevent against session fixation attacks .
The cookie value being dependent on ID , USER - AGENT , REMOTE - ADDR , START , and * SESSION - SECRET * , the only value we can change is START to regenerate a new value .
Since we 're generating a new cookie , it makes sense to have the session being restarted , in time .
That said , because of this fact , calling this function twice in the same second will regenerate twice the same value .
[ Special variable ]
* rewrite - for- session -urls *
Whether HTML pages should possibly be rewritten for cookie - less session - management .
[ Special variable ]
* content - types - for - url - rewrite *
The content types for which url - rewriting is OK .
See *REWRITE-FOR-SESSION -URLS * .
[ Special variable ]
*use - remote - addr- for- sessions *
Whether the client 's remote IP ( as returned by REAL - REMOTE - ADDR ) should be encoded into the session string .
If this value is true , a session will cease to be accessible if the client 's remote IP changes .
This might for example be an issue if the client uses a proxy server which does n't send correct ' X - Forwarded - For ' headers .
[ Generic function ]
session - remote - addr session => remote - addr
The remote IP address of the client when this session was started ( as returned by REAL - REMOTE - ADDR ) .
[ Special variable ]
*use-user-agent- for- sessions *
Whether the ' User - Agent ' header should be encoded into the session string .
If this value is true , a session will cease to be accessible if the client sends a different ' User - Agent ' header .
[ Generic function ]
session - user - agent session => user - agent
The incoming ' User - Agent ' header that was sent when this session was created .
[ Generic accessor ]
session - max - time session => max - time
( setf ( session - max - time session ) new - value )
Gets or sets the time ( in seconds ) after which session expires if it 's not used .
[ Special variable ]
* session - max - time *
The default time ( in seconds ) after which a session times out .
[ Special variable ]
* session - gc- frequency *
A session GC ( see function SESSION - GC ) will happen every * SESSION -GC-FREQUENCY * requests ( counting only requests which create a new session ) if this variable is not NIL .
See SESSION - CREATED .
[ Function ]
session - gc => |
Removes sessions from the current session database which are too old - see SESSION - TOO - OLD-P .
[ Function ]
session - too - old - p session => generalized - boolean
Returns true if the SESSION object session has not been active in the last ( session - max - time session ) seconds .
[ Generic function ]
session - id session => session - id
The unique ID ( an INTEGER ) of the session .
[ Generic function ]
session - start session => universal - time
The time this session was started .
One way is to mostly leave the session mechanism intact but to tweak it a bit :
The publicly visible part of a session is encoded using a secret which you can set yourself .
And it is stored using a cookie ( or GET parameter ) name that you can override .
Each session receives a new ID when it is created and you can implement a more robust way to do that .
You can arrange to be called whenever a session is created to trigger some action .
You might also do this to invent your own session garbage collection .
By default , all sessions are stored in a global alist in memory .
You can't change the alist part , but you can distribute your sessions over different " databases " .
By default , every operation which modifies sessions or one of the session databases is guarded by a global lock , but you can arrange to provide different locks for this .
The other way to customize Hunchentoot 's sessions is to completely replace them .
This is actually pretty easy : Create your own class to store state ( which does n't have to and probably should n't inherit from SESSION ) and implement methods for SESSION - VERIFY and SESSION - COOKIE - VALUE - that 's it .
Hunchentoot will continue to use cookies and / or to rewrite URLs to keep track of session state and it will store " the current session " ( whatever that is in your implementation ) in * SESSION * .
Everything else ( like persisting sessions , GC , getting and setting values ) you 'll have to take care of yourself and the other session functions ( like START - SESSION or SESSION - VALUE ) wo n't work anymore .
( Almost ) total freedom , but a lot of responsibility as well ... :)
[ Special variable ]
* session - secret *
A random ASCII string that 's used to encode the public session data .
This variable is initially unbound and will be set ( using RESET - SESSION - SECRET ) the first time a session is created , if necessary .
You can prevent this from happening if you set the value yourself before starting acceptors .
[ Function ]
reset - session - secret => secret
Sets * SESSION -SECRET * to a new random value .
All old sessions will cease to be valid .
[ Generic function ]
session - cookie - name acceptor => name
Returns the name ( a string ) of the cookie ( or the GET parameter ) which is used to store a session on the client side .
The default is to use the string " hunchentoot - session " , but you can specialize this function if you want another name .
[ Generic function ]
session - created acceptor new - session => result
This function is called whenever a new session has been created .
There 's a default method which might trigger a session GC based on the value of * SESSION - GC - FREQUENCY * .
The return value is ignored .
[ Generic function ]
next - session - id acceptor => id
Returns the next sequential session ID , an integer , which should be unique per session .
The default method uses a simple global counter and is n't guarded by a lock .
For a high - performance production environment you might consider using a more robust implementation .
[ Generic accessor ]
session - db acceptor => database
( setf ( session - db acceptor ) new - value )
Returns the current session database which is an alist where each car is a session 's ID and the cdr is the corresponding SESSION object itself .
The default is to use a global list for all acceptors .
[ Generic function ]
session - db - lock acceptor &key whole - db - p => lock
A function which returns a lock that will be used to prevent concurrent access to sessions .
The first argument will be the acceptor that handles the current request , the second argument is true if the whole ( current ) session database is modified .
If it is NIL , only one existing session in the database is modified .
This function can return NIL which means that sessions or session databases will be modified without a lock held ( for example for single - threaded environments ) .
The default is to always return a global lock ( ignoring the acceptor argument ) for Lisps that support threads and NIL otherwise .
[ Generic function ]
session - verify request => session - or- nil
Tries to get a session identifier from the cookies ( or alternatively from the GET parameters ) sent by the client ( see SESSION - COOKIE-NAME and SESSION - COOKIE-VALUE ) .
This identifier is then checked for validity against the REQUEST object request .
On success the corresponding session object ( if not too old ) is returned ( and updated ) .
Otherwise NIL is returned .
A default method is provided and you only need to write your own one if you want to maintain your own sessions .
[ Generic function ]
session - cookie - value session => string
Returns a string which can be used to safely restore the session session if as session has already been established .
This is used as the value stored in the session cookie or in the corresponding GET parameter and verified by SESSION - VERIFY .
A default method is provided and there 's no reason to change it unless you want to use your own session objects .
( defclass cookie ( ) ( ( name :initarg : name : reader cookie - name : type string : documentation " The name of the cookie - a string . " ) ( value :initarg :value : accessor cookie- value :initform " " : documentation " The value of the cookie .
Will be URL - encoded when sent to the browser . " )
( expires : initarg : expires : initform nil : accessor cookie - expires : documentation " The time ( a universal time ) when the cookie expires ( or NIL ) . " ) ( max - age : initarg : max - age : initform nil : accessor cookie - max - age : documentation " The time delta ( in seconds ) after which the cookie expires ( or NIL ) . " ) ( path : initarg : path : initform nil : accessor cookie - path : documentation " The path this cookie is valid for ( or NIL ) . " ) ( domain : initarg : domain : initform nil : accessor cookie - domain : documentation " The domain this cookie is valid for ( or NIL ) . " ) ( secure : initarg : secure : initform nil : accessor cookie - secure : documentation " A generalized boolean denoting whether this is a secure cookie . " )
( http - only : initarg : http-only : initform nil : accessor cookie - http-only : documentation " A generalized boolean denoting whether this is a HttpOnly cookie . " ) ) )
HUNCHENTOOT
[ Function ]
set - cookie name &key value expires path domain secure http - only reply => cookie
Creates a COOKIE object from the parameters provided to this function and adds it to the outgoing cookies of the REPLY object reply .
If a cookie with the same name ( case - sensitive ) already exists , it is replaced .
The default for reply is * REPLY * .
The default for value is the empty string .
[ Function ]
set - cookie* cookie &optional reply => cookie
Adds the COOKIE object cookie to the outgoing cookies of the REPLY object reply .
If a cookie with the same name ( case - sensitive ) already exists , it is replaced .
The default for reply is * REPLY * .
ACCESS-LOG-DESTINATION
MESSAGE -LOG -DESTINATION
NIL
When the path for the message or accept log is set to a variable holding an output stream , hunchentoots writes corresponding log entries to that stream .
By default , Hunchentoot logs to * STANDARD - ERROR *.
Access logging is done in a format similar to what the Apache web server can write so that logfile analysis using standard tools is possible .
Errors during request processing are logged to a separate file .
The standard logging mechanism is deliberately simple and slow .
The log files are opened for each log entry and closed again after writing , and access to them is protected by a global lock .
Derived acceptor classes can implement methods for the ACCEPTOR - LOG - MESSAGE and ACCEPTOR -LOG -ACCESS generic functions in order to log differently ( e.g. to a central logging server or in a different file format .
Errors happening within a handler which are not caught by the handler itself are handled by Hunchentoot by logging them to the established ACCEPTOR - MESSAGE - LOG - DESTINATION .
[ Function ]
log - message * log - level format - string &rest format - arguments => result
Convenience function which calls the message logger of the current acceptor ( if there is one ) with the same arguments it accepts .
Returns NIL if there is no message logger or whatever the message logger returns .
This is the function which Hunchentoot itself uses to log errors it catches during request processing .
[ Special variable ]
* log-lisp - errors - p *
Whether Lisp errors in request handlers should be logged .
[ Special variable ]
* log-lisp - backtraces - p *
Whether Lisp backtraces should be logged .
Only has an effect if * LOG - LISP - ERRORS - P* is true as well .
[ Special variable ]
* log-lisp - warnings - p*
Whether Lisp warnings in request handlers should be logged .
[ Special variable ]
* lisp - errors - log - level *
Log level for Lisp errors .
Should be one of : ERROR ( the default ) , :WARNING , or :INFO .
[ Special variable ]
* lisp - warnings - log - level *
Log level for Lisp warnings .
Should be one of : ERROR , :WARNING ( the default ) , or : INFO .
This section describes how Hunchentoot deals with exceptional situations .
See also the secion about logging .
When an error occurs while processing a request , Hunchentoot 's default behavior is to catch the error , log it and optionally display it to the client in the HTML response .
This behavior can be customized through the values of a number of special variables , which are documented below .
[ Special variable ]
* catch - errors -p *
If the value of this variable is NIL ( the default is T ) , then errors which happen while a request is handled are n't caught as usual , but instead your Lisp 's debugger is invoked .
This variable should obviously always be set to a true value in a production environment .
See MAYBE - INVOKE -DEBUGGER if you want to fine - tune this behaviour .
[ Special variable ]
* show - lisp - errors - p *
Whether Lisp errors should be shown in HTML output .
Note that this only affects canned responses generated by Lisp .
If an error template is present for the " internal server error " status code , this special variable is not used ( see acceptor - status - message ) .
[ Special variable ]
* show -lisp - backtraces - p *
Whether Lisp backtraces should be shown in HTML output if * SHOW - LISP - ERRORS - P* is true and an error occurs .
[ Generic function ]
maybe - invoke - debugger condition => |
This generic function is called whenever a condition condition is signaled in Hunchentoot .
You might want to specialize it on specific condition classes for debugging purposes .
The default method invokes the debugger with condition if * CATCH - ERRORS - P* is NIL .
[ Condition type ]
hunchentoot - condition
Superclass for all conditions related to Hunchentoot .
[ Condition type ]
hunchentoot - error
Superclass for all errors related to Hunchentoot and a subclass of HUNCHENTOOT - CONDITION .
[ Condition type ]
parameter - error
Signalled if a function was called with incosistent or illegal parameters .
A subclass of HUNCHENTOOT - ERROR .
[ Condition type ]
hunchentoot - warning
Superclass for all warnings related to Hunchentoot and a subclass of HUNCHENTOOT - CONDITION .
[ Function ]
abort - request - handler &optional result => result
This function can be called by a request handler at any time to immediately abort handling the request .
This works as if the handler had returned result .
See the source code of REDIRECT for an example .
[ Function ]
handle - if - modified - since time &optional request => |
This function is designed to be used inside a handler .
If the client has sent an ' If - Modified - Since ' header ( see RFC 2616 , section 14.25 ) and the time specified matches the universal time time then the header +HTTP - NOT -MODIFIED + with no content is immediately returned to the client .
Note that for this function to be useful you should usually send ' Last - Modified ' headers back to the client .
See the code of CREATE - STATIC - FILE - DISPATCHER -AND-HANDLER for an example .
[ Function ]
handle - static - file path &optional content - type => nil
Sends the file denoted by the pathname designator path with content type content - type to the client .
Sets the necessary handlers .
In particular the function employs HANDLE -IF - MODIFIED-SINCE .
If content - type is NIL the function tries to determine the correct content type from the file 's suffix or falls back to " application / octet - stream " as a last resort .
Note that this function calls SEND - HEADERS internally , so after you 've called it , the headers are sent and the return value of your handler is ignored .
[ Function ]
redirect target &key host port protocol add - session - id code => |
Sends back appropriate headers to redirect the client to target ( a string ) .
If target is a full URL starting with a scheme , host , port , and protocol are ignored .
Otherwise , target should denote the path part of a URL , protocol must be one of the keywords :HTTP or :HTTPS , and the URL to redirect to will be constructed from host , port , protocol , and target .
code must be a 3xx HTTP redirection status code to send to the client .
It defaults to 302 ( " Found " ) .
If host is not provided , the current host ( see HOST ) will be used .
If protocol is the keyword :HTTPS , the client will be redirected to a https URL , if it 's :HTTP it 'll be sent to a http URL .
If both host and protocol are n't provided , then the value of protocol will match the current request .
[ Function ]
require - authorization &optional realm => |
Sends back appropriate headers to require basic HTTP authentication ( see RFC 2617 ) for the realm realm .
The default value for realm is " Hunchentoot " .
[ Function ]
no - cache => |
Adds appropriate headers to completely prevent caching on most browsers .
[ Function ]
ssl - p &optional acceptor => generalized - boolean
Whether the current connection to the client is secure .
See ACCEPTOR - SSL-P .
[ Function ]
reason - phrase return - code => string
Returns a reason phrase for the HTTP return code return - code ( which should be an integer ) or NIL for return codes Hunchentoot does n't know .
[ Function ]
rfc - 1123 - date &optional time => string
Generates a time string according to RFC 1123 .
Default is current time .
This can be used to send a ' Last - Modified ' header - see HANDLE -IF - MODIFIED -SINCE .
[ Function ]
url - encode string &optional external - format => string
URL - encodes a string using the external format external - format .
The default for external - format is the value of *HUNCHENTOOT -DEFAULT-EXTERNAL-FORMAT * .
[ Function ]
url - decode string &optional external - format => string
Decodes a URL - encoded string which is assumed to be encoded using the external format external - format , i.e. this is the inverse of URL - ENCODE .
It is assumed that you 'll rarely need this function , if ever .
But just in case - here it is .
The default for external - format is the value of *HUNCHENTOOT -DEFAULT-EXTERNAL-FORMAT * .
[ Function ]
escape - for - html string => result
Escapes the characters # \< , #\> , #\ ' , #\ " , and #\& for HTML output .
[ Function ]
http-token - p object => generalized - boolean
This function tests whether object is a non-empty string which is a token according to RFC 2068 ( i.e. whether it may be used for , say , cookie names ) .
[ Function ]
mime - type pathspec => result
Given a pathname designator pathspec returns the MIME type ( as a string ) corresponding to the suffix of the file denoted by pathspec ( or NIL ) .
[ Function ]
within - request-p => generalized - boolean
Returns true if in the context of a request .
Otherwise , NIL .
[ Special variable ]
* tmp -directory *
This should be a pathname denoting a directory where temporary files can be stored .
It is used for file uploads .
[ Special variable ]
* header - stream *
If this variable is not NIL , it should be bound to a stream to which incoming and outgoing headers will be written for debugging purposes .
[ Special variable ]
* cleanup - function *
A designator for a function without arguments which is called on a regular basis if * CLEANUP - INTERVAL * is not NIL .
The initial value is the name of a function which invokes a garbage collection on 32 - bit versions of LispWorks .
This variable is only available on LispWorks .
[ Special variable ]
* cleanup - interval *
Should be NIL or a positive integer .
The system calls * CLEANUP -FUNCTION * whenever * CLEANUP -INTERVAL * new worker threads ( counted globally across all acceptors ) have been created unless the value is NIL .
The initial value is 100 .
This variable is only available on LispWorks .
To run the confidence test , start the example web server .
Then , in your Lisp listener , type
[ Function ]
hunchentoot - test: test - hunchentoot base - url &key => |
Runs the built - in confidence test .
base - url is the base URL to use for testing , it should not have a trailing slash .
The keyword arguments accepted are for future extension and should not currently be used .
The script expects the Hunchentoot example test server to be running at the given base - url and retrieves various pages from that server , expecting certain responses .
NIL
NIL
It turned out that Jeff Caldwell had worked on something similar so he emailed me and proposed to join our efforts .
As I had no immediate plans to release my code ( which was poorly organized , undocumented , and mostly CMUCL - specific ) , I gave it to Jeff and he worked towards a release .
He added docstrings , refactored , added some stuff , and based it on KMRCL to make it portable across several Lisp implementations .
Unfortunately , Jeff is at least as busy as I am so he did n't find the time to finish a full release .
But in spring 2004 I needed a documented version of the code for a client of mine who thought it would be good if the toolkit were publicly available under an open source license .
So I took Jeff 's code , refactored again ( to sync with the changes I had done in the meantime ) , and added documentation .
This resulted in TBNL 0.1.0 ( which initially required mod_lisp as its front - end ) .
In March 2005 , Bob Hutchinson sent patches which enabled TBNL to use other front - ends than mod_lisp .
This made me aware that TBNL was already almost a full web server , so eventually I wrote Hunchentoot which was a full web server , implemented as a wrapper around TBNL .
Hunchentoot 0.1.0 was released at the end of 2005 and was originally LispWorks - only .
Hunchentoot 0.4.0 , released in October 2006 , was the first release which also worked with other Common Lisp implementations .
It is a major rewrite and also incorporates most of TBNL and replaces it completely .
Hunchentoot 1.0.0 , released in February 2009 , is again a major rewrite and should be considered work in progress .
It moved to using the usocket and Bordeaux Threads libraries for non-LispWorks Lisps , thereby removing most of the platform dependent code .
Threading behaviour was made controllable through the introduction of taskmasters .
mod_lisp support and several other things were removed in this release to simplify the code base ( and partly due to the lack of interest ) .
Several architectural changes ( lots of them not backwards - compatible ) were made to ease customization of Hunchentoot 's behaviour .
A significant part of the 1.0.0 redesign was done by Hans Hübner .

Hunchentoot originally used code from ACL - COMPAT , specifically the chunking code from Jochen Schmidt .
( This has been replaced by Chunga . )
When I ported Hunchentoot to other Lisps than LispWorks , I stole code from ACL - COMPAT , KMRCL , and trivial - sockets for implementation - dependent stuff like sockets and MP .
( This has been replaced by Bordeaux Threads and usocket . )
Parts of this documentation were prepared with DOCUMENTATION - TEMPLATE , no animals were harmed .
BACK TO MY HOMEPAGE
A UK startup has some interesting ideas about protecting video content : offer it as high - quality , unencrypted MPEG - 4 files already formatted for various user devices .
Instead of shackling users with artificial technological limitations on what they can do with their files , Streamburst hopes to secure content using a bit of personalization and a unique watermarking system , and they 've already put their system to work selling the Ewan McGregor motorcycle trip documentary Long Way Round .
Burn to DVD ?
Fine .
Transfer video to any portable device ?
No problem .
Do n't treat users like criminals ?
Check .
This approach to content is so different from the one taken by most Hollywood studios that we caught up with Róbert Bjarnason at his home in the UK to talk about his new company and to ask him one simple question : is he crazy ?
Long way round
It 's become a mantra of sorts , not just on this site but among the content industry at large : piracy is a business model .
To compete with it effectively , content companies have two choices .
They can pour millions into robust new DRM schemes ( see HD DVD , Blu-ray , and Windows Vista for examples ) and then use the power of the law to hammer any users who are found violating their copyrights .
That approach has n't been working so well .
It 's slow and expensive ; it generates the worst sort of PR ; and it risks creating a new generation of pirates who discover that they have no alternative if they want to exercise their fair - use rights .
The other way to compete with piracy is by actually attempting to compete : lower prices , no DRM , and making it easier to pay for a high - quality legal file than to pirate it .
Bjarnason and his two partners are taking this approach with their new UK company , Streamburst .
Last summer , Bjarnason was looking for something new .
He 'd been working on web sites for Long Way Round , the 2004 documentary about Ewan McGregor 's 19,000 - mile trip across Europe , Asia , and North America on motorcycle .
The show had been off the air for some time , and the producers had plans to repackage the episodes as mobile phone clips .
The project evolved as the team realized that laptops and iPods offered a much superior viewing experience and decided to offer the shows for all three devices .
Bjarnason and two partners formed Streamburst to make the project a reality , and they coded the entire backend system using Ruby on Rails and standard open - source tools , all in under four months .
Because they already had work from Long Way Round , the company was launched without any external funding — it was just the proverbial " guys in a garage . "
Building the storefront and encoding the video clips at different resolutions was straightforward stuff ; the team 's real innovation came when they looked at the piracy problem and decided on a novel approach to it .
Do n't call it DRM
Bjarnason and Co. wanted the video files to be open and unencumbered , but they still needed to make it easy for for honest people to stay honest .
The scheme they hit on does not resemble any traditional DRM .
Bjarnason tells me it's an " anti-piracy scheme , " not a restriction mechanism .
The first part of the scheme appends a five - second introduction to each purchased show .
It 's simply a screen that shows the name of the person who paid for the download .
It functions as a reminder that the file is intended for personal use , but it 's not heavy - handed , and it does n't restrict use .
The video files are unencrypted MPEG - 4 and can be burned to DVD for archiving or for watching on a home theater .
But can't people simply strip their names out of the file ?
Sure they can , says Bjarnason , if they have an MPEG - 4 editor .
But it would take more time to do that ( and to reencode the file ) than it would to simply pirate a copy ; Bjarnason says it 's " harder than downloading . "
Besides , people who have just paid money to download a show should n't be treated like criminals , and are less likely to be the ones seeding P2P networks around the world .
The second part of the scheme is a " watermark . "
That is , it 's not technically a watermark in the usual sense of that term , but the encoding process does strip out a unique series of bits from the file .
The missing information is a minuscule portion of the overall file that does not affect video quality , according to Bjarnason , but does allow the company to discover who purchased a particular file .
The goal is to make people more accountable for their actions without artificially restricting those actions .
Because of its design , the watermark even survives most editing changes and format shifts ; burning to DVD and then ripping back onto a computer does n't eliminate it .
Finally , the price is kept low .
Although Streamburst does n't make these decisions , its first partnerships with McGregor 's production company have sold videos for £ 1.35 each — less than the £ 1.89 charge for individual music videos in the iTunes UK store .
Their first storefronts opened on December 18 , selling episodes of shows like Long Way Round and Missing Face ( a documentary which donates all profits to UNICEF ) .
In their first month , they managed to sell more than 1,000 video clips .
No , they wo n't be giving iTunes execs sleepless nights for quite some time , but they are n't trying to .
Instead , the focus is on allowing independent producers to put out their work and get paid for it without shackling customers into restrictive DRM schemes .
I 've seen the future ... and it is Iceland
Streamburst is brand new — they first set up shop in September and only launched their corporate web site this week — but they already have plans to expand .
Bjarnason hails from Iceland , and though he works in the UK , he 'd love to get involved with the film industry in his native country .
The Streamburst system is unlikely to be adopted by major Hollywood and European studios in the near term , so Bjarnason next hopes to turn to Iceland 's indie film community .
The team has also developed a technique for distributing the files via BitTorrent without losing the customized watermark ; the video comes bundled inside a activation program that encodes the username and watermark into the file when it 's purchased .
But until Streamburst stores get a critical mass of users , it 's actually more efficient to distribute files through the web .
Should traffic pick up , the team already has a new distribution system ready to go .
Will a system that relies on a Reagenesque " trust , but verify " approach to protecting content gain any traction in a famously paranoid industry ?
Here 's hoping .
DRM does n't stop piracy anyway , so it 's not impossible to imagine some future day in which the lion will lay down with the lamb , and studios will stop making criminals of those who want to rip a DVD to their iPod to get them through a long commute .
Unfortunately , as Ken recently noted , DRM is n't really about piracy at all , but more about making users pay a second time for the " privilege " of format - shifting their purchased content .
Even Apple loves the current regime .
Companies that " think different " — like Streamburst — face a tough battle , but it's one worth fighting , and the company stands a decent chance of carving out a niche in the independent video market .
Here 's hoping for more such innovative thinking in 2007 .
As large parts of Europe and North America once again bake in an exceptionally hot summer , many people are asking what has now become a perennial question : " Is this global warming ? "
You need only go to colleges in , say , the Midwest to appreciate the Asian feel of this campus .
But Berkeley is freighted with the baggage of stereotypes — that it is boring socially , full of science nerds , a hard place to make friends .
“ About half the students at this school spend their entire career in the library , ” one person wrote in a posting on vault.com , a popular job and college search Web site .
Another wrote : “ Everyone who is white joins the Greek system and everyone who is n’t joins a ‘ theme house ’ or is a member of a club related to race . ”
There is some truth to the image , students acknowledge , but it does not do justice to the bigger experience at Berkeley .
“ You have the ability to stay with people who are like you and not get out of your comfort zone , ” says Ms. Nakata .
“ But I learned a lot by mixing it up .
I lived in a dorm with a lot of different races , and we would have these deep conversations all the time about race and our feelings of where we belong and where we came from . ”
But she also says that the “ celebrate diversity aspect ” of Berkeley does n’t go deep .
“ We want to respect everyone ’s differences , but we do n’t mix socially . ”
Near the end of my stay at Berkeley I met a senior , Jonathan Lee , the son of a Taiwanese father and a mother from Hong Kong .
He grew up well east of Los Angeles , in the New America sprawl of fast - growing Riverside County , where his father owned a restaurant .
He went to a high school where he was a minority .
“ When I was in high school , ” he says , “ there was this notion that you ’re Chinese , you must be really good in math . ”
But now Mr. Lee is likely to become a schoolteacher , much to the chagrin of his parents , “ who do n’t think it will be very lucrative . ”
The story of Jon Lee ’s journey at Berkeley is compelling .
As president of the Asian - American Association , he has tried to dispel stereotypes of “ the Dragon Lady seductress or the idea that everybody plays the piano . ”
His closest friends are in the club .
It may seem that he has become more insular , that he has found his tribe .
But Mr. Lee says he has been trying to lead other Asian students out of the university bubble .
Once a week , they go into a mostly black and Hispanic middle school in the Bay Area to mentor students .
We have a cash machine inside DNA Lounge , and when reading the manual for the machine , I was pleased to learn that one can customize many of the messages on it !
There is a small area at the top of the screen ( intended for saying the name of your business or something ) plus a " billboard " area at the bottom of the screen that cycles through four settable messages .
The manual encourages you to sell advertising in these spaces .
I chose somewhat different messages :
The top of the screen always displays
SUBMIT - CONFORM - OBEY MARRY AND REPRODUCE NEVER QUESTION
The bottom of the screen cycles through these four messages :
DRIVE THE COP OUT OF YOUR HEAD SURPRISE , SURPRISE : THE GOVERNMENT LIES .
THE U.S. CONSTITUTION ISN'T PERFECT , BUT IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE TODAY DESTROY CAPITALISM SMASH THE STATE
Finally , the heading of the paper receipt begins with
SHOPPING IS NOT CREATING YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU OWN
This last one is my favorite , because people will probably only notice it after they 've gotten home and fish the receipt out of their pockets !
We occasionally get complaints from customers about these messages !
A couple of examples :
Customer : What 's up with the Unamerican shit on the ATM ?
Manager : Unamerican ?
Customer : Yeah , it says " Surprise surprise , the Government lies ! "
Manager : Uh ... they do .
Customer : Yeah , but you 're not supposed to say things like that !
Especially not now !
But my favorite complaint was from the guy who was puzzled that the ATM says " Destroy Capitalism " but charges him a $ 3 service fee .
Irony is hard , let 's go shopping !
Update , 2011 :
We have a new ATM now , but it still has entertaining messages on it .
Details and a video are in my 2011 blog post about it .
The following is republished from the Tech Times # 156 .
If support for web standards in browsers is improving slowly , then support in email clients is moving at a glacial pace .
Attempts to document things like CSS support in the major email clients have revealed a depressing state of affairs , but with recent desktop clients like Thunderbird now sitting on solid rendering engines , things have been looking up .
All that changed when Microsoft dropped a lump of coal into every web developer ’s stocking with the end - of - year release to business customers , and the upcoming consumer release , of Outlook 2007 .
At the risk of turning this newsletter into a biweekly Microsoft bash , Redmond has done it again .
While the IE team was soothing the tortured souls of web developers everywhere with the new , more compliant Internet Explorer 7 , the Office team pulled a fast one , ripping out the IE - based rendering engine that Outlook has always used for email , and replacing it with … drum roll please … Microsoft Word .
That ’s right .
Instead of taking advantage of Internet Explorer 7 , Outlook 2007 uses the very limited support for HTML and CSS that is built into Word 2007 to display HTML email messages .
Having tested the two public beta versions of Outlook 2007 late last year , I knew there was something screwy going on .
Many of the newsletters I subscribed to had become unreadable , and SitePoint ’s own publications ( including the Tech Times ) were looking decidedly unhealthy .
I dutifully reported these rendering issues with the feedback mechanisms provided in the beta , and wrote them off as Internet Explorer 7 integration issues that would be resolved in the final release .
But late last month , a thread in the SitePoint Forums caught my eye .
Microsoft had published a pair of articles describing the support for HTML and CSS in Outlook 2007 , and the news was n’t good :
Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 uses the HTML parsing and rendering engine from Microsoft Office Word 2007 to display HTML message bodies .
The same HTML and cascading style sheets ( CSS ) support available in Word 2007 is available in Outlook 2007 .
The limitations imposed by Word 2007 are described in detail in the article , but here are a few highlights :
no support for background images ( HTML or CSS )
no support for forms
no support for Flash , or other plugins
no support for CSS floats
no support for replacing bullets with images in unordered lists
no support for CSS positioning
no support for animated GIFs
In short , unless your HTML emails are very , very simple , you ’re going to run into problems with Outlook 2007 , and in most cases the only solution to those problems will be to reduce the complexity of your HTML email design to accommodate Outlook ’s limited feature set .
With the release of Outlook 2007 , Microsoft is effectively adding an entirely new rendering engine to the mix — one that designers producing HTML email will not be able to ignore .
Not only that , but this new rendering engine is n’t any better than that which Outlook previously used — indeed , it ’s far worse .
With this release , Outlook drops from being one of the best clients for HTML email support to the level of Lotus Notes and Eudora , which , in the words of Campaign Monitor ’s David Grenier , " are serial killers making our email design lives hell . "
Why on earth would Microsoft do such a thing ?
Security ?
Microsoft has been shouting from the rooftops about the new security model in Internet Explorer 7 that prevents the nasty security issues that have plagued Outlook in the past .
It seems Microsoft does n’t buy its own publicity , however , because this move sends the message that Internet Explorer ’s security model is not to be trusted .
Where to from here ?
Well , as a first step , you ’ll want to use Microsoft ’s handy - dandy tool to tell you which parts of your lean , mean HTML emails need to be replaced with old - fashioned HTML sludge .
As a second step , you may want to consider giving your Outlook - based readers an easy way to switch to text - only email .
Bring on PDF email .
I ’m ready .

Testing gas mileage claims Drivers upset as hybrids fall short on fuel economy Diesel vs. hybrid : From Detroit to D.C. , and back Diesel vs. hybrid : Gas mileage diary E - Mail Newsletters

Diesel vs. hybrid : From Detroit to D.C. , and back Gasoline prices that have been averaging more than $ 2 a gallon have boosted interest in fuel - efficient gas- electric hybrid and diesel - powered vehicles .
To see if the technologies live up to their fuel - economy promise , USA TODAY reporter David Kiley drove a Volkswagen Jetta TDI diesel from suburban Detroit to suburban Washington , D.C. , last month .
He drove a Toyota Prius hybrid back from Washington to Detroit .
Here 's his report .
Testing a diesel Jetta and hybrid Prius on a drive between Detroit and Washington seemed a natural .
Volkswagen and Toyota each said I should be able to make the 500 - mile - plus one - way trip on one tank of gas .
Volkswagen 's Jetta GLS 2.0 , top , and Toyota Prius Volkswagen , Toyota
The route seemed appropriate because decisions that determine the future of hybrids and diesels will be made largely in corporate Detroit and political Washington .
The verdict : Prius is comfortable , a festival of technology and unquestionably cleaner - burning than the VW can be today with only high - sulfur diesel fuel available .
But the real - world mileage of pleasant - driving Jetta was better than that of Prius , and diesel fuel typically was 16 % to 20 % cheaper than unleaded gas .
Jetta lived up to its one - tank billing .
Prius did not .
The details : Setting out from my home in Ann Arbor , Mich. , in the Jetta , I wanted to top off the tank .
I went to three stations before finding diesel fuel .
But that was the only time I had to hunt for it .
FUEL ECONOMY
Find official fuel economy figures for late model cars , SUVs , pickup trucks and minivans .
The diesel pump was grimier than the others and offered plastic mittens for holding the nozzle .
I skipped the mittens but did n't get dirty or smelly .
The Jetta handled well , making the drive pleasant .
Its diesel had more of a pulsating and vaguely clattering sound than the steady growl of a gas engine , but it was n't objectionable .
The odometer said 535 miles when I arrived at USA TODAY headquarters in McLean , Va . The Jetta used 12.2 gallons of diesel fuel .
That 's 44 miles a gallon , on the nose for the car 's highway fuel economy rating .
The fuel cost $ 21.35 .
The trip from McLean back to Ann Arbor in the Prius using a slightly different route was 549 miles .
While in stop - and - go traffic , the Prius often ran on battery power , driving home the point that it is most efficient in crawling , urban traffic .
The gas - tank warning light flashed after 422 miles .
I drove 10 miles to the next gas station and filled up , putting 11.1 gallons into the 11.9 - gallon tank .
That would indicate 38 mpg , far short of the 51 mpg government rating .
The car 's trip computer told me it had been getting 51.7 mpg .
Irv Miller , Toyota vice president for corporate communication , says the mileage shortfall probably had to do with speed .
" The government test that puts the Prius ' highway mileage at 51 mpg is based on ideal driving conditions and going 55 mph , " he says .
I averaged 72 miles an hour on highways .
The company also says the computer is nearly 100 % accurate .
But how much gas its flexible bladder takes at the pump varies from less than 10 gallons to the full 11.9 gallons .
Toyota said I probably began the trip with less gas than I thought .
Toyota spokesman Mike Michels says the gas - tank variability is confusing to owners , and the company is working on a fix .
Possibly reflecting frustration with the problem , Prius owners ' biggest complaint was " fuel gauge not working " in the J.D. Power and Associates 2004 Initial Quality Study , which measures problems the first 90 days of ownership .
Gas bill for the trip home was $ 28.62 .
While the fuel price advantage on this trip goes to the diesel , the environmental advantage goes to the hybrid .
The Jetta spews out six times more sulfur particulates than Prius , which can run almost emission - free when using low - sulfur gasoline available in California but almost nowhere else .
Federal regulations require phasing in of low - sulfur gas and diesel the next few years , which will improve the emission performance of both gas and diesel vehicles .
The advantage in premium paid for the technology goes to diesel .
The premium for a hybrid version of a vehicle is about $ 3,000 .
The Jetta diesel is $ 1,200 more than a gas - powered Jetta .
VW 's Passat TDI diesel , which just went on sale , is only $ 205 more than the similar gas model .
And the VW Touareg TDI diesel , also just now on sale , is priced about the same as a similarly accessory - laden gasoline V - 8 .
The future : Both technologies are in demand .
Toyota can't keep up on Prius .
Some dealers wo n't take more 2004 orders until production is increased , although Toyota discourages that , Michels says .
Toyota plans to make 48,000 to 50,000 a year available in the USA , up from 36,000 now .
Ford Motor , which launches a hybrid version of the Ford Escape small sport-utility vehicle in August , said recently it had 30,000 potential customers for what is expected to be production of 20,000 .
Ford is investigating whether it can get enough batteries to build more than that .
Meanwhile , VW says it gets a limited number of diesels from Germany and sells all the TDI vehicles it has .
More hybrids and diesels are coming .
In addition to Civic and Insight hybrids , Honda will sell an Accord hybrid in the fall .
Toyota 's Lexus luxury brand will offer an RX 400h SUV later this year , and Toyota will have a hybrid version of Highlander SUV early next year .
Mercedes - Benz has brought its E Class diesel back to the USA .
Chrysler plans a Jeep Liberty diesel later this year .
Did you know that there was a space shuttle built in Russia , which has made a few successful flights but then the research project was closed due to lack of funding after the collapse of Soviet Union ?
The BURAN orbiter was the first reusable manned space vehicle in Russia .
The BURAN orbiter is the space airplane which may descent from an orbit and land to an airdrome .
The BURAN was Russian first vehicle capable not only to put pay - loads into Space , but also to provide their orbit maintenance and repair as well as return to the Earth .
The BURAN predecessors could execute only separate roles : VOSTOK and SOYUS vehicles were intended only for crew flights , PROGRESS – for cargo delivery onto the orbital station .
Put into the orbit by a rocket carrier of the average size they had modest transport potentials .
Whereas the cargo flow on the Earth - orbit line increased and the development of a reusable vehicles of large carrying capacity has become inevitable .
The BURAN orbiter is able to put up to 30 tons into Space and to return up to 20 tons of payload to the Earth .
The availability of a cargo compartment of impressive sizes on the vehicle permits to transport orbital station modules or large structures up to 17 m long and 4,5 m in diameter and not only 2 - 4 crew members but up to 6 passengers can be accommodated in a crew cabin .
Expendable space vehicles perform a ballistic or sliding descent in the atmosphere and parachute landing .
The necessity to provide a space vehicle return from the Space and to bring it to the airdrome forced the designers to decide many complex problems .
The gliding descent from the orbit through dense layers of atmosphere has stipulated the necessity to use a principally new reusable thermal protection system designed to sustain 100 flights .
For the BURAN orbiter three kinds of thermal protection have been developed :
– “ carbon - carbon ” material with maximum operating temperature up to 1650 degrees C for the components with the highest thermal load - the fuselage nose and wing leading edge ,
– ceramic tiles for parts heating up to 1250 degrees C ,
– flexible material for surface parts with the temperature not higher than 379 degrees C .
All of them surpassed by strength the materials used in the USA Space Shuttle construction .
The main differences between the space aeroplane Buran and Suttle - orbiter are follows :
– the automatic landing of Buran from orbit onto airdrome ;
– the absence ot the main rocket engine on the orbital aeroplane .
The main engine was placed onto a central block of a carrier - rocket ENERGIA which is able to launch into an orbit 120 tonns of payload against 30 tonns for Space Shuttle ;
– the hight lift - drag ratio of the space aeroplane Buran is 6.5 against 5.5 for Space Shuttle ;
– the space aeroplane Buran returned 20 tonns of payloads against 15 tonns for Space Shuttle orbiter from an orbit to an aerodrome ;
– the cutting lay - out pattern of thermoprotection tiles of Buran is optimal and longitudinal slits of tile belts are orthogonal to the flow line .
Sharp angles of tiles are absent .
The tile belts of the Buran fuselage and fin have an optimal position .
On the photos you can see how the shuttle Buran was transported by the biggest сargo airplane in the world , AN - 225 “ Mriya ” .
Here is Buran is being mounted to the main rocket .
And then transported to the launch site .
Here is Buran is ready to take off .
This is the Buran development team .
And here are the videos of the first Buran take off and landing .

Landing
It could be a very successful project of Russian Space Exploration era in general , if the Soviet union lasted a little bit longer or if the modern Russian could find a way to fund it .
October , 2005 : Managed String Library for C
Robert C. Seacord is Senior Vulnerability Analyst for CERT / CC and author of Secure Coding in C and C++ ( Addison - Wesley , 2005 ) .
He can be reached at [ email protected ]
Strings such as command - line arguments , environment variables , and console inputare of special concern in secure programming because they account for most of the data exchanged between an end user and a software system .
Graphic and web - based applications make extensive use of text input fields and , because of standards like XML , data exchanged between programs is increasingly in string form as well .
As a result , weaknesses in string representation , string management , and string manipulation have led to a broad range of software vulnerabilities and exploits .
Many of the vulnerabilities in existing C code result from interactions with standardized library calls that , by today 's standards , would no longer be considered secure ( strcpy ( ) , for example ) .
Unfortunately , because these functions are standard , they continue to be supported and developers continue to use them often to detrimental effect .
Common String - Manipulation Errors
Common string - manipulation errors include unbounded string copies , null - termination errors , string truncation , and improper data sanitization [ 6 ] .
Unbounded string copies occur when data is copied from an unbounded source to a fixed - length character array ( for instance , when reading from standard input into a fixed - length buffer using gets ( ) ) .
Reading data from unbounded sources creates an interesting problem for a programmer .
Because it is not possible to know beforehand how many characters a user will supply , it is impossible to know whether an allocated array is of sufficient length .
A common solution is to statically allocate an array that is much larger than anticipated and assume the length will not be exceeded .
While this approach works well with friendly users , malicious users can easily exceed a fixed - length character array .
Unbounded string copies are also common using functions such as strcpy ( ) and strcat ( ) that do not take the size of the destination buffer into account .
Another common problem with C - style strings is a failure to properly null terminate .
For example , strncpy ( ) is frequently recommended as a secure alternative to strcpy ( ) .
However , incorrect use of this function can still result in buffer overflows or null - termination errors , as in :
char buff [ 10 ] ; strncpy ( buff , " 1234567890 " , sizeof ( buff ) ) ;
In this case , the 10 - character string copied into buff completely fills the available space , leaving no room for a terminating null character .
Null - termination errors are difficult to find and can remain dormant and undetected in deployed code until a particular set of inputs causes a failure .
String - truncation errors are another example of a problem that has been caused , to some degree , by attempts to prevent buffer overflows .
In an effort to eliminate buffer overflows , security experts have recommend the use of functions that restrict the number of bytes copied ; for example , strncpy ( ) instead of strcpy ( ) , fgets ( ) instead of gets ( ) , and snprintf ( ) instead of sprintf ( ) .
While these alternative functions can be effective in mitigating buffer - overflow vulnerabilities , it is often at the cost of truncating strings that exceed the specified limits [ 3 ] .
This of course , results in a loss of data , and in some cases can also lead to software vulnerabilities .
Improper data sanitization can also lead to vulnerabilities , particularly when data is passed between different logical units .
John Viega and Matt Messier provide an example of an application that inputs an e-mail address from a user and writes the address to a buffer [ 7 ] :
sprintf ( buff , " / bin/ mail %s < /tmp/email " , addr ) ;
The buffer is then executed using the system ( ) call .
The risk is , of course , that the user enters this string as an e-mail address :
Current or Proposed Solutions
Ideally , a secure string library would mitigate security risks resulting from these common programming errors .
This string library should also be implemented with these goals in mind :
Succeed or fail .
Managed string library functions should succeed or fail loudly .
Copy and concatenation functions , for example , should copy the entire string or fail so that string truncation does not occur .
Undefined behavior , from copying overlapping objects , for example , must be eliminated .
Familiar to C programmers .
The managed string API should be familiar to C programmers to ease adoption and promote standardization .
Legacy system modernization .
The managed string API should provide similar semantics to existing , standard C library functions to simplify legacy - system modernization .
Not all of these objectives are fully compatible .
It is not possible , for example , to fully preserve existing APIs and provide an adequate level of protection against buffer overflows and other potential security flaws .
Because errors in string manipulation have long been recognized as a leading source of vulnerabilities in C - language programs , a number of libraries have been developed to prevent these common programming errors .
These libraries can be categorized as static or dynamic , depending on how they allocate space .
Libraries that implement a static approach allocate fixed - sized strings , meaning that once the character array has been filled , it is impossible to add data .
Examples of the static approach include the ISO / IEC TR 24731 Specification for Safer , More Secure C Library Functions [ 4 ] and OpenBSD 's strlcpy ( ) and strlcat ( ) [ 5 ] .
Because the static approach discards excess data , there is always a possibility that actual program data will be lost .
Consequently , the resulting string must be fully validated .
String libraries that implement a dynamic approach resize strings as required .
Dynamic approaches scale better and do not discard excess data .
The major disadvantage is that if inputs are not limited , they can exhaust memory and consequently be used in denial - of - service attacks .
Examples of dynamic approaches include the C String Library ( SafeStr ) from Matt Messier and John Viega [ 2 ] and Vstr by James Antill [ 1 ] .
ISO / IEC TR 24731 Functions
ISO / IEC TR 24731 defines alternative versions of C standard functions that are designed to be safer replacements for existing functions .
For example , ISO / IEC TR 24731 defines the strcpy_s ( ) , strcat_s ( ) , strncpy_s ( ) , and strncat_s ( ) functions as replacements for strcpy ( ) , strcat ( ) , strncpy ( ) , and strncat ( ) , respectively .
The ISO / IEC TR 24731 functions were created by Microsoft to help retrofit its existing , legacy code base in response to numerous , well - publicized security incidents over the past decade .
These functions were then proposed to the ISO / IEC JTC1 / SC22 / WG14 international standardization working group for the programming language C for standardization .
The strcpy_s ( ) function , for example , has this signature :
errno_t strcpy_s ( char * restrict s1 , rsize_t s1max , const char * restrict s 2 ) ;
The signature is similar to strcpy ( ) but takes an extra argument of type rsize_t that specifies the maximum length of the destination buffer .
( Functions that accept parameters of type rsize_t diagnose a constraint violation if the values of those parameters are greater than RSIZE_MAX .
Extremely large object sizes are frequently a sign that an object 's size was calculated incorrectly .
For example , negative numbers appear as very large positive numbers when converted to an unsigned type like size_t .
For those reasons , it is sometimes beneficial to restrict the range of object sizes to detect errors .
For machines with large address spaces , ISO / IEC TR 24731 recommends that RSIZE_MAX be defined as the smaller of the size of the largest object supported or ( SIZE_MAX >>
1 ) , even if this limit is smaller than the size of some legitimate , but very large , objects . )
The semantics are also similar .
When there are no input validation errors , the strcpy_s ( ) function copies characters from a source string to a destination character array up to and including the terminating null character .
The function returns zero on success .
The strcpy_s ( ) function only succeeds when the source string can be fully copied to the destination without overflowing the destination buffer .
The following conditions are treated as a constraint violation :
The source and destination pointers are checked to see if they are null .
The maximum length of the destination buffer is checked to see if it is equal to zero , greater than RSIZE_MAX , or less than or equal to the length of the source string .
When a constraint violation is detected , the destination string is set to the null string and the function returns a nonzero value .
In Listing 1 , the strcpy_s ( ) function is used to copy src1 to dst1 .
However , the call to copy src2 to dst2 fails because there is insufficient space available to copy the entire string , which consists of seven characters , to the destination buffer .
As a result , r2 is assigned a nonzero value and dst2 [ 0 ] is set to " \0 . "
Users of the ISO / IEC TR 24731 functions are less likely to introduce a security flaw because the size of the destination buffer and the maximum number of characters to append must be specified .
ISO / IEC TR 24731 functions also ensure null termination of the destination string .
ISO / IEC TR 24731 functions are still capable of overflowing a buffer if the maximum length of the destination buffer and number of characters to copy are incorrectly specified .
As a result , these functions are not especially secure but may be useful in preventive maintenance to reduce the likelihood of vulnerabilities in an existing legacy code base .
strlcpy ( ) and strlcat ( )
Many UNIX variants , including most BSD implementations and Solaris , offer the strlcpy ( ) and strlcat ( ) functions to copy and concatenate strings in a less error - prone manner .
These functions ' prototypes are :
size_t strlcpy ( char * dst , const char * src , size_t size ) ; size_t strlcat ( char * dst , const char * src , size_t size ) ;
The strlcpy ( ) function copies the null - terminated string from src to dst ( up to size characters ) .
The strlcat ( ) function appends the null - terminated string src to the end of dst ( but no more than size characters will be in the destination ) .
To help prevent writing outside the bounds of the array , the strlcpy ( ) and strlcat ( ) functions accept the full size of the destination string as a size parameter .
For statically allocated destination buffers , this value is easily computed at compile time using the sizeof ( ) operator .
Both functions guarantee that the destination string is null terminated for all nonzero - length buffers to prevent null - termination errors .
The strlcpy ( ) and strlcat ( ) functions return the total length of the string they tried to create .
For strlcpy ( ) , that is simply the length of the source ; for strlcat ( ) , it is the length of the destination ( before concatenation ) plus the length of the source .
To check for truncation , programmers need to verify that the return value is less than the size parameter .
If the resulting string is truncated , programmers now know the number of bytes needed to store the entire string and may reallocate and recopy .
Neither strlcpy ( ) nor strlcat ( ) zero - fill their destination strings ( other than the compulsory null byte to terminate the string ) .
This results in performance close to that of strcpy ( ) and much better than strncpy ( ) [ 5 ] .
The strlcpy ( ) and strlcat ( ) functions are not universally available in the standard libraries of UNIX systems ; in particular , they are not available for GNU / Linux .
Because they are relatively small functions , however , you can easily include them in your own program 's source whenever the underlying system does n't provide them .
It is still possible that the incorrect use of these functions results in a buffer overflow if the specified buffer size is longer than the actual buffer length .
Truncation errors are also possible if you fail to verify the results of these functions .
SafeStr
The C String Library ( SafeStr ) from Messier and Viega provides a rich string - handling library for C that has secure semantics , yet is interoperable with legacy library code in a straightforward manner .
The SafeStr library uses a dynamic approach for C that automatically resizes strings as required .
SafeStr accomplishes this by reallocating memory and moving the contents of the string whenever an operation requires that a string grow in size .
As a result , buffer overflows should not be possible when using the library .
The SafeStr library is built around the safestr_t type .
The safestr_t type is compatible with char * and allows safestr_t structures to be cast as char * and behave as C - style strings .
The safestr_t type keeps accounting information ( that is , the actual and allocated length ) in memory directly preceding the memory referenced by the pointer .
Error handling in SafeStr is performed using XXL , a library that provides both exceptions and asset management for C and C ++.
The caller is responsible for handling exceptions thrown by SafeStr and XXL .
If no exception handler is specified , the default action is to output a message to stderr and call abort ( ) .
The dependency on XXL can be an issue because both libraries need to be adopted to support this solution .
Listing 2 is a program that uses SafeStr and XXL .
This program allocates two strings and copies one string to the other .
The use of XXL provides a convenient mechanism for error checking .
Managed String Library
The managed string library was developed in response to the need for a string library that can improve the quality and security of newly developed C - language programs while eliminating obstacles to widespread adoption and possible standardization .
As the name implies , the managed string library is based on a dynamic approach , in that memory is allocated and reallocated as required .
This approach eliminates the possibility of unbounded copies , null - termination errors , and truncation by ensuring there is always adequate space available for the resulting string ( including the terminating null character ) .
The one exception is if memory is exhausted , which is treated as an error condition .
In this way , the managed string library accomplishes the goal of succeeding or failing loudly .
The managed string library also protects against improper data sanitization by ( optionally ) ensuring that all characters in a string belong to a predefined set of " safe " characters .
Listing 3 illustrates the structure of the managed string type string_m .
The string_m type is a structure consisting of a size and a character pointer .
The size contains the size of the memory allocated for the string , not the string length .
The character pointer references an array of size characters .
For compatibility with existing C - library functions , the string consists of a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by and including the first null character .
The str field in the string_m structure points to the initial character in the string .
The length of a string is the number of bytes preceding the null character and is always less than the size of the string .
This structure was created , in part , to apply software engineering principles of data encapsulation and data hiding .
Users of the managed string library should , under no circumstance , directly access the size or str fields of the string_m structure , as this could compromise the integrity of the data structure and the security of the library .
The managed string library handles errors by consistently returning the status code in the function return value .
This approach encourages status checking because the user can insert the function call as the expression in an if statement and take appropriate action on failure .
The greatest disadvantage of this approach is that it prevents functions from returning any other value .
This means that all values ( other than the status ) returned by a function must be returned as a pass - by - reference parameter , preventing a programmer from nesting function calls .
This tradeoff is necessary because nesting function calls can conflict with a programmer 's willingness to check status codes .
All functions in the managed string library operate on the managed string type string_m with the exception of the string creation function strcreate_m ( ) , which is used to create a managed string from a C - style string or string literal .
Listing 4 shows how strcreate_m ( ) is used to create the string " test . "
The managed string API also includes the getstr_m ( ) function , which can be used to extract a copy of a C - style string from a managed string .
This function is necessary to maintain compatability with functions that do not operate on managed strings .
For example , formatted output functions such as fprintf ( ) ( also referenced in Listing 4 ) are outside the managed string library .
The managed string library also supports the concept of a NULL string and an empty string to allow conversion between managed strings and C - style strings ( Listing 5 ) .
However , it is necessary to use isnullstr_m ( ) and isemptystr_m ( ) to test for null and empty strings .
When converting from a NULL managed string to a C - style string , the getstr_m ( ) function simply returns NULL ( no memory is allocated ) .
While the dynamic approach eliminates the possibility of unbounded copies , null - termination errors , and truncation , there is still the issue of improper data sanitization .
The managed string library includes a setcharset ( ) function to help solve this problem and eliminate vulnerabilities resulting from improper data sanitization .
Listing 6 shows how the managed string library supports data sanitization using the setcharset ( ) function .
The first call to strcreate_m ( ) creates a managed string containing a " valid " set of characters to be used by the data abstraction .
Once set by setcharset ( ) , the managed string API guarantees that newly created strings contain only those characters included in the set of valid characters .
This technique is called " white listing " and is the preferred approach for data sanization [ 6 ] .
The second call to strcreate_m ( ) in Listing 6 succeeds because it only contains valid characters , while the third call fails ( the character " d " is not in the set of valid characters ) .
Conclusion
It is clearly possible to implement an alternate version of the standard C string library using a dynamic allocation approach that fairly closely approximates the syntax and semantics of the existing , standard API .
Dynamically allocated memory will never be as efficient as static allocation by the compiler .
However , performance should be adequate for most tasks , and programmers can resort to traditional C - style strings in performance - critical code sections .
More work is necessary to determine whether this library will be broadly adopted by developers and embraced by the ISO / IEC JTC1 / SC22/ WG14 international standardization working group .
Further empirical studies must also be performed to determine whether the managed string library effectively reduces the number of vulnerabilities introduced in C - language programming .

" Title says it all " ;)
Researchers at UC
Irvine have found that how much detail one remembers of an event depends on whether a certain portion of the brain is activated to “ package ” the memory .
The research may help to explain why sometimes people only recall parts of an experience such as a car accident , and yet vividly recall all of the details of a similar experience .
In experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , the scientists were able to view what happened in the brains of subjects when they experienced an event made up of multiple contextual details .
They found that participants who later remembered all aspects of the experience , including the details , used a particular part of the brain that bound the different details together as a package at the time the event occurred .
When this brain region was n’t activated to bind together the details , only some aspects of an event were recalled .
The findings appear in the current issue of Neuron .
“ This study provides a neurological basis for what psychologists have been telling us for years , ” said Michael Rugg , director of UCI ’s Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory and senior author of the paper .
“ You ca n’t get out of memory what you did n’t put into it .
It is not possible to remember things later if you did n’t pay attention to them in the first place . ”
The scientists presented 23 research subjects with a list of words while they underwent an fMRI scan .
The words were in different colors and would appear in one of four quadrants on a screen .
The subjects had to decide whether the words represented an animate or inanimate object .
Later , the participants were presented the words again , interspersed with words they had not seen before , and asked if they remembered seeing those words before .
They were also asked if they remembered in what color the word had originally been and in which of the four quadrants it had originally appeared .
If the participant could later remember the color of the word , a particular area of the brain associated with color processing was especially active during learning .
If the subject later remembered the location of the word , activity was seen in an area associated with spatial processing .
But if the subject remembered the word , the color and the location , then another critical brain region became involved .
The researchers observed enhanced activity in the intra-parietal sulcus , a part of the parietal cortex .
It appears that this region is responsible for binding together all the features of a particular memory so that contextual details , as well as more central aspects of the event such as the identity of the word , can later be recalled .
“ We know that if the intra-parietal sulcus is damaged , then someone cannot attend to multiple aspects of the same object , such as its size and color , ” said Melina Uncapher , a graduate student researcher and lead author of the study .
“ This study provides empirical evidence for how critical this region is for bringing the constituents of a memory together in the brain .
“ Memory is more than a sum of its parts .
A complete memory of an event requires that the features of the event be brought together and processed by the brain as a common perceptual representation , before being stored . ”

Well , that tears it .
I read the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 on my sh*tty little dial - up connection here in the cabin , and immediately went to the pawn shop in Moab and bought another rifle .
Five of them now in the stash , plus a couple pistols .
Ready enough to arm seven people altogether .
Have you read the Military Commissions Act of 2006 ?
I mean , read it through to its poisonous black heart , its implication for our basic freedoms , its tolling that the system of checks enshrined in the Constitution and entrusted to the three balanced branches is gone ?
That ’s extreme language , I know , but it approaches the truth .
The Military Commissions
Act was offered by legislators in collusion with the Bush White House to legalize CIA and other government tactics of torture against so - called " unlawful enemy combatants . "
For this reason , the Military Commissions
Act is now referred to by its critics as the Torture Act .
In violation of the Geneva Convention and our own Anti-Torture Statute passed by Congress in 1994  legislation that makes torture a felony punishable by 20 years in prison  the Torture Act has now " legalized " a mind - shattering array of techniques for gleaning information from the " enemy . "
Conveniently , it also pardons ex post facto " our brave men and women " ( as George W. Bush describes them ) who since the dawn of the " war on terror " have been committing crimes against humanity .
The acts of torture now made legal and wholesome include the burning of flesh , the breaking of bones , the placing of needles under fingernails , the tearing of limbs , the disfiguring of faces , and the infliction of general bodily injury that may or may not entail  the fine print of the law is n’t clear , making it all the more nefarious , as fine print always is  the loss of a finger or a toe or a testicle .
This is horrific enough .
Upon further investigation of the document , however , one discovers that the enemy is not just the faceless Islamic horde but the American people  unsurprising from a regime , abetted by its legislative branch , that already illegally wiretaps its citizens .
According to the Torture Act , any American now can be declared an " unlawful combatant " to be arrested , held indefinitely without hearing or charge or trial , tortured without cease or until such time as hell freezes over .
There is no guideline for how the designation of " combatant " is to be made ; it simply falls from on high at the whim of the president ’s office .
This is the secret meaning of the document .
The right of habeas corpus , a right as old as the germ of democracy ?
Gone .
Never happened .
Confronting your accuser ?
Sorry .
Hearing the charges against you ?
Not applicable .
Right to counsel for a public trial ?
Forget it .
The protections against cruel and unusual punishment ?
Your hands and feet are tied , pal .
Our Congress passed this law , violating its own duty to protect the Constitution .
It is now federal law that the Bill of Rights no longer applies .
Our answer as citizens should be clear .
You can be paranoid and go out and buy more guns .
In the near term , this is probably a bad idea , though it certainly makes freaks like me sleep better at night , knowing there is a vast armed populace ready to defend against its own government .
But are Americans really willing to do so ?
Time will tell .
Violent insurrection against the United States by New Yorkers and Ohioans and Utahns together may be necessary at some future point when the televisions flicker out and the shelves at the Wal - Mart run short .
Until then , there are other possibilities .
Chief among them , in this vaunted election year , is not voting Democrat .
" The problem is that the Democrats are part of the problem , " observes political scientist Paul Craig Roberts here at Antiwar.com .
" Democrats , no less than Republicans , have permitted the Bush regime to violate the separation of powers and the rule of law .
A branch of government that no longer defends its power is a branch of government that no longer believes in its power .
Just as the Reichstag faded away for Hitler , the U.S. Congress has faded away for the Bush administration . "
Consider the significance of the sheer number of representatives and senators who voted in favor of the Torture Act .
In the House , 218 Republicans , 32 Democrats .
In the Senate , a vote of 65 to 34 , the yeas including Joe Lieberman , Chuck Hagel , Charles Grassley , and torture victim John McCain .
The fact is that every congressperson who voted for the Torture Act must take immediate action to repeal the law and then resign forever from public service .
The ancient Greeks suggest further remedies : banishment beyond the walls of the polis , to forever wander among the barbarians .
Our legislators in their exile can be assured that countries such as Syria , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and North Korea will welcome them , always looking for spokesmen to defend brutality in the name of security .
Failing this , we have the hope of the U.S. Supreme Court , which has shown its colors in the Hamdan decision striking down the Bush administration ’s military tribunals .
If both our federal gatekeepers fail us , state legislators should begin the process of nullification of the Torture Act , regarding it as a violation of the covenant between the separate states and the federal center and refusing to enforce it or abide it .
How would this play out on the ground ?
Let ’s say the federal government comes to your state looking for those who have been deemed , in a process as random as lightning touching down , " unlawful enemy combatants "  perhaps someone like yourself who reads too much .
The state government to whom you look for protection ( we hope ) rebukes the federal government ’s effort and refuses to hand you over .
Thus is a constitutional crisis provoked ( as if the Constitution is n’t already in crisis ) .
And from there things spin out of control .
We might actually witness the use of federal troops to enter into state territory to apprehend the " enemies " among us .
Would state militia in the form of the National Guard be called forth to defend against the encroachment ?
Would militiamen come forth from the homes of Americans ?
Would there be balls enough among the citizens collectively for us to even reach this far in the tragedy ?
Let ’s hope so , and hope it never comes to pass ; let ’s hope the democracy will survive the long beating of the last seven years to emerge from its shocked shell and re-engage .
But given Murphy ’s Law , we should be prepared otherwise .
For my part , understanding that the federal government , regardless of the party in power , actively connives against my interests as a free man , that my elected leaders in Congress no longer believe in the American experiment ( while spending my tax dollars in furtherance of its failure , galling thought ) , I am increasingly inclined to renounce the United States .
I renounce it in favor of Brooklyn , New York , and Moab , Utah , in favor of the local over the global , of the polis over the imperium .
Being anti-United States , I am most certainly pro-American .
This , under the constantly distending definitions provided by our Congress , might just make me an " enemy " worthy of having my skin pocked black and my arms broken .
Hence the new Lee-Enfield bolt action , bought at Yama & Sons ’ pawnshop in Moab , whose proprietors provided 12 free rounds of .303 ammunition , which among Army - surp suppliers costs about 0.2 cents a round , i.e. , goddamn cheap , ideal for readying an insurrection .
A rifle invented in 1895 , muzzle velocity 2,440 feet per second , maximum range 2,000 yards , deadly reliable , morbidly accurate , perfected throughout the first half of the 20th century for maintaining the falling British Empire ; now for possible use to end the American one .

The system currently exists as a laboratory model
An Israeli inventor has developed an underwater breathing system that literally squeezes oxygen directly from seawater , doing away with the need for compressed air tanks .
Called " LikeAFish " , the battery - powered artificial gill system aims to extract the small amounts of dissolved air that already exists in water to supply breathable oxygen to scuba divers , submarines and underwater habitats .
The device is the brainchild of Alon Bodner .
It utilises a high - speed centrifuge to lower the pressure of seawater in a small sealed chamber .
This allows the dissolved air to escape back into a gaseous state - much like the way carbon dioxide is liberated from a soft drink when you reduce the pressure on it by popping the bottle cap .
The air thus liberated is then transferred to an airbag for the diver to use .
Since every litre of water contains about 1.5 % of dissolved air , Bodner 's system must circulate around 200 litres of water per minute to accommodate the breathing needs of an average person .
Instead of being restricted to the amount of air that can be carried in a tank , a diver 's air supply would then depend only on the battery power available .
Prototype development " For a closed - circuit system , the diver would need to pump approximately 200 Litres - per- minute ( LPM ) of water under ideal conditions , to separate one LPM of oxygen , which a diver needs , " Bodner told the BBC News website .
" A one - kilo battery should be able to supply a diver with one hour of dive time . "
Right now , the system exists as a laboratory model with European patents approved and US applications pending .
Currently , Bodner is engaged in outfitting an underwater habitat in Australia with the system .
He eventually plans to reduce the size of the apparatus , taking it down to a small , lightweight vest for divers ; and estimates that a fully functional prototype is about two years away .
Though it promises to be a revolutionary new technology , experts share a number of concerns .
Hard work " Bodner makes the assumption that a closed - circuit re-breather diver will use one litre of oxygen per minute , " says Mike Rowley , a British Sub - Aqua Club ( BSAC ) National Instructor .
" However , this is by no means an absolute figure ; it 's based upon an average male adult engaged in light underwater swimming .
With work ( such as heavy swimming against a strong current ) , this figure can rise to at least 3.5 litres per minute .
Bodner believes his system would work well in the right setting " If we assume for the moment that his other assumptions are correct , the machine is going to have to have some form of reserve capacity to enable it to cope with lengthy periods of high oxygen metabolism .
" To do this , it will need some form of reserve or some means of increasing the flow of water , which in turn will need a larger centrifuge capacity .
Both of these consequences will have the effect of increasing the power requirement . "
In addition to limits that might potentially exist in pumping , the concentration of oxygen in water also varies .
" Dead zones " in lakes and oceans contain less dissolved oxygen , and what happens when the water contains contaminants or is heavily polluted ?
" I would n't adopt this new technology , as it introduces uncertainty over the oxygen supply when I could have a very reliable cylinder which I filled before hand , " said Craig Billingham , a technical diver / instructor with over 15 years of diving experience .
Greatest potential
For closed systems , the diver re-breathes the air again and again , after the carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is scrubbed .
Currently dive times are not limited by the amount of gas that can be carried but by how long the CO2 scrubber works , which is typically 3 hours .
" LikeAFish misses the point , as he is trying to eliminate the need to carry cylinders , " said Billingham .
" The limit of the equipment is still the scrubber , not the gas supply .
So I would take a cylinder ; it does n't need batteries and will last 10 hours anyway , whereas you will need a lot of batteries to get the equivalent time .
" Also batteries and seawater do n't mix .
It is n't a case of ' if ' it leaks but ' when ' . "
Bodner admits that it is undesirable to use the system if the water lacks oxygen or is polluted and states that a small compressed air tank , that 's built into the system , could act as a reserve in case of battery failure .
The device 's greatest potential could lie in underwater habitats .
While habitats have no shortage of electrical power , they all use compressed air or oxygen tanks for their air supply .
Bodner 's device could potentially reduce the habitats ' dependence on surface ships for air supply , freeing them of the need to replace the compressed tanks .
Energy to the habitat ( and the air separation system ) could be supplied , for example , by wave - tide generators .
" In conclusion , I would think that this system is unlikely to provide a practical alternative to the aqua-lung or the re-breather for a diver , " said Rowley .
" It may well be a practical solution for a submarine or a habitat .
However , I will certainly keep an open mind and watch its development with keen interest . "

Mast Qalandar
As promised in my earlier post on The Caps of Pakistan , it is now time to talk about Purgees , or turbans .
Turban in Pakistani culture is more than just a headwear .
It is also a symbol of one ’s honor .
Kicking the turban off a person ’s head ( pugree uchalna ) is tantamount to inflicting an insult on him .
On the other hand , dropping one ’s turban at someone ’s feet is a sign of extreme humility and asking forgiveness .
In southern Punjab and Sindh , a peasant or hari would drop his turban at the feet of the zamindar or the feudal lord when formally greeting him .
While doing so , he would also bend down to touch the zamindar ’s feet .
Some of the readers might recall the political slogan of Nawaz Sharif ’s campaign , back in 1988 : “ Jaag , Punjabi jaag .
Teri pug nooN lag gaya daagh ” ( Wake up Punjabi and look at your turban .
It is stained ! ) .
Sharif ‘s campaign advisors had coined this slogan to wean away the Punjabi voters from Benazir Bhutto , a Sindhi , by appealing to their ethnicity and chauvinism .
Even though it was a dumb idea to coin a divisive slogan like that , it does , however , show the importance a turban plays in the Pakistani value systems .
Another instance where the honor attached to a turban was dramatically highlighted was the popular TV serial of the 1980s , Waris .
Remember , how the protagonist in the play , Chaudhry Hashmat , takes pride in his lands , his haveli , his old feudal values — and , of course , his turban ?
In the poignant finale of the play , when the river breaks the dyke in high flood , and the water comes rushing into the village , everyone abandons the village except the Chaudhry .
He is seen standing in his haveli , in knee - deep water , with his turban sitting proudly on his head , as always .
He doe n’t want to abandon his lands , his haveli and his turban — his honor .
Eventually , when the water rises to his waist and then to his neck , the Chaudhry realizes he is going to drown .
Even then , instead of saving his life , he carefully takes off his turban and , as if handling something sacred , places it carefully on a high cornice in the room , and disappears in the rising floodwaters .
Let ’s now look at the different turbans , worn in Pakistan , and their anatomy .
First , the name – Turban – in English means any wrapping of cloth or fabric around one ’s head .
In Arabic it is called “ amaama ” , in Persian “ dastaar ” , in Urdu “ pugree ” or ” kullah ” in Punjabi “ pugree ” or “ pug ” , and in Pushto “ patkaiy ” or “ patka . ” ( I do not know the Sindhi or Balochi for turban .
Readers , please fill in ! ) .
Starting with NWFP , one of the traditional turbans is a two - piece affair .
One piece consists of a dome - shaped hard cap or kulla .
It is finely embroidered with golden thread .
The more intricate and dense the embroidery the pricier is the kulla .
The other piece , called lungi , consists of a long and narrow piece of cotton cloth ( not to be confused with the lungi that men in rural Punjab wear instead of a shalwar ) .
The lungi of the turban comes in different colors , often in stripes , is starched , carefully gathered and skillfully wrapped around the kulla .
( You can wrap the lungi around the kulla only when wearing the kulla , not otherwise . )
One end of the lungi is stuck in the folds and stands like the crest of a hoopoe or peacock ; it is called shamla .
The other end forms the tail , which hangs loosely at the back of the person .
Wrapping a lungi around the kulla requires a bit of skill .
This type of turban is also called Peshwari kullah .
It ’s a spectacular headwear but a bit bulky , and sits well on persons of larger frame .
Even though different caps and bare heads have become more common over the years , this flamboyant Peshawari turban is still worn in the NWFP , FATA and adjoining districts .
Whenever an important visitor descends on NWFP , he is presented the Peshawari turban and is made to wear it during the reception , sometime with comic results .
The other turban , which is worn mostly in the tribal areas , is a one - piece affair consisting of only lungi , which is wrapped around the bare head in a peculiar fashion .
There are slight variations in how this turban is wrapped around by different individuals or tribes , but it is a distinctive tribal headwear in the borderlands of NWFP .
It ’s worn without any cap or kulla and , unlike the Peshawari Kulla , the shamla or crest in this type of turban is not prominent .
Its tail is either hangs loose at the back of the person or , more often , pulled over the shoulder in front — and occasionally , depending on the fastidiousness of the wearer , serves as a handkerchief .
I have never quite understood how this turban is wrapped and how does it hold itself .
The Punjab , as I have said elsewhere , is and has been the land of turbans – pugrees and pugs – Their use , however , has declined over the years and bare heads and a variety of caps have taken their place .
In fact , in Lahore or any other urban center , one rarely sees a turban except on ceremonial occasions and marriages , where they make the bridegroom wear one – usually a cheap replica of the elite pugree .
Present day Chaudhrys of Punjab , unlike Chaudhry Hashmat of the TV play Waris , prefer to cover their pates with a comb - over or , occasionally , with braided peaked caps — and dark glasses — rather than with a traditional pugree .
However , in rural Punjab the pugrees and pugs are still widely worn .
A Punjabi pugree , like the Peshawari turban , is a 2 - piece affair except that its inner kulla is relatively soft and conical in shape and the outer wrapping is usually , but not always , white and is made of starched , coarse muslin .
Like the Peshawari turban the pugree too , has a prominent shamla or crest ( sometime called turra ) and a tail .
The height of the shamla or turra varies from individual to individual and place to place .
The uniform of the prestigious Aitchison College , Lahore , includes a flamboyant pugree as head - wear .
It has a golden embroidered kulla wrapped in a turquoise blue “ lungi ” .
Students are required to wear it once or twice a week or on special occasions .
Unlike the Peshawri turban it does not unravel easily with a tug at the tail .
Probably because of its softer kulla and the muslin lungi , which ties together pretty tightly .
The Punjabi pug on the other hand , is simply a long and narrow piece of coarse cotton , usually but not always white , wrapped around the head .
Peasants in villages will use a whole array of colors for the pug .
While the pugree is the headwear of the rural elite , commoners mostly wear the pug .
While the basic elements of both the pugree and the pug remain the same throughout Punjab , there are variations in the color of the materials used and the way the two are wrapped around the kulla or tied around the head .
Probably the most spectacular of turbans worn in Pakistan is the one worn by Baloch sardars .
It consists of fine , spotless white cotton wrapped around the head in a manner that only a Baloch can figure out and handle .
It does not have a crest or “ shamla ” Its tail , instead of hanging loosely at the back , comes down on one side of the turban , loosely snakes around the chin and then up on the other shoulder , the end tucked in the folds of the turban , thus framing the face of the person in the folds of white cotton .
The turban tail is also used to cover one ’s face during dust storms .
With his characteristic beard and mustache , a Baloch sardar cuts a striking figure in his white turban , and sometimes , when riding a horse , looks as if he has just walked off a Hollywood set .
Sindhi landlords of Baloch origin also wear the Baloch turban .
Sindhi peasants , however , other than wearing the Sindhi cap , wear a simple turban somewhat similar to Punjabi pug except that instead of white cotton they also use ajrak — a colorful , hand - printed , coarse cotton cloth — as wrapping .
There is one more turban that became ubiquitous in parts of the NWFP and Balochistan in the decade of 1990s and then almost disappeared after 9/11 .
We hope it does n’t come back .
If you have n’t guessed it , I am talking of the black turban of the Taliban .
Mast Qalandar dabbles in everything – history , culture , education , poetry , armchair politics and , when sufficiently provoked , religion .
He has lived mostly in Karachi , Lahore , Islamabad and Peshawar and also in several nooks and crannies of Pakistan .
Currently he divides his time between Islamabad and New York .

The HERA particle accelerator in Germany is set to call it quits in June , but a lone physicist is now campaigning for HERA to have one last hurrah .
He claims it could discover a particle believed by many to account for the unseen dark matter that constitutes the bulk of the universe ’s mass .
The particle in question is the axion .
Proposed in 1977 to solve a problem with the strong nuclear force , these hypothetical entities have been considered as strong candidates for dark matter , because they have very little mass and barely interact with matter .
One of the most tantalising hints of their existence came from the PVLAS experiment at the National Laboratories of Legnaro in Italy .
Last July , the PVLAS team announced a slight shift in the polarisation of a laser beam fired through a strong magnetic field .
The shift was 10,000 times larger than expected by standard physics , but could be explained if a tiny fraction of photons from the laser had turned into axions ( New Scientist , 15 July 2006 , p 35 ) .
However , the CERN Axions Solar Telescope ( CAST ) near Geneva , which searches for axions produced in the sun , has failed to corroborate the PVLAS result .
“ The axion community is still excited by the PVLAS result , but it needs independent experimental verification , ” says CAST spokesman Konstantin Zioutas at the University of Patras in Greece .
“ If someone found direct evidence for the presumed axion - like particle interpretation of the PVLAS data , both groups would deserve the Nobel prize , ” he says .

Now Krzysztof Piotrzkowski of the Catholic University of Louvain ( UCL ) in Belgium is proposing to do just that .
What ’s more , it would be cheap , easy to set up , and could deliver results in a week , he says .
Piotrzkowski’s idea is to exploit apparatus already in place at the Hadron - Electron Ring Accelerator in Hamburg , Germany .
At HERA , an intense beam of photons is generated as a by - product of the accelerator .
This beam passes through HERA ’s strong magnetic field , which runs parallel to the photons ’ electric field .
According to theory , if the energy of the photon beam is much larger than the equivalent mass predicted of axions , some of the photons will convert to axions , says Piotrzkowski .
To isolate the axions , he suggests a 50 - centimetre lead shield that would block the photons but let axions through .
Once the axions exit the lead , some will revert back to photons , which can then be detected ( www.arxiv.org/hep-ph/0701059).
Unfortunately , HERA is due to shut down at the end of June , so it ’s now or never for Piotrzkowski .
“ The experiment could in theory be carried out at other accelerators , but not without massive modifications to the apparatus , which really is n’t feasible , ” he says .
Zioutas says Piotrzkowski ’s method could provide a direct test for axions , but he is n’t convinced that it can produce definitive results within a week .
“ As an experimentalist , I can assure you , we always seem to underestimate the length of time needed by a factor of 10 , preparatory work not included , ” Zioutas says .
Meanwhile , HERA ’s managers are examining Piotrzkowski ’s proposal .
“ We are certainly interested in the axion search and this is something that we could do , ” says Manfred Fleischer of DESY , the German research centre that runs HERA .
“ It ’s unfortunate that we ’re only hearing this proposal so close to the end of our run .
It will be very , very tough to fit it into our schedule . ”
Piotrzkowski thinks it ’s to HERA ’s advantage to squeeze in the test .
“ HERA helped confirm many of the predictions of the standard model of physics , but as yet it has n’t had any spectacular results , ” he says .
“ If they find the axion , then they could go out in a blaze of glory . ”

Peter Naur has been awarded this year ’s ACM Turing Award .
He began his career as an astrophysicist , but soon after his Ph.D. became involved in computer science , more concretely in the definition of the Algol 60 : he was the editor of the 1960 Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60 in which the famous BNF notation for computer language grammars was introduced , as an improvement of the one used a year before by John Backus in a report on Algol 58 .
Nowadays , BNF belongs into every programmer toolset , not to mention the fact that Algol is the grandparent of all languages in the ( syntactical ) C family .
In 17 pages , Algol 60 introduced call by value and call by name , code blocks , local variables , two - branch conditionals , the for statement and dynamic arrays ( if you ’ve never seen Algol code before , here ’s how the Towers of Hanoi look like in Algol 60 ) .
Not bad for a forerunner , but not so surprising if you read the names of its authors , which include , for instance , J. McCarthy and Alan Perlis .
In his own Turing Award conference ( or PDF of the original manuscript ) , Edsberg Dijkstra mentioned Algol , its report and Naur in these terms :
[ … ] while the definition of LISP is still a curious mixture of what the language means and how the mechanism works , the famous Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 is the fruit of a genuine effort to carry abstraction a vital step further and to define a programming language in an implementation - independent way .
One could argue that in this respect its authors have been so successful that they have created serious doubts as to whether it could be implemented at all …
Naur programmed an Algol compiler for a Danish computer called Gier later on .
No wonder Dijkstra considered it a masterpiece .
As you can see in this commented bibliography , Naur has also made many contributions in the field of software engineering methodologies and life - cycle models .
But afterwards he became more and more interested in less practical stuff .

情報処理推進機構 （IPA）の2005年度上期未踏ソフトウェア創造事業で，東京工業大学大学院 情報理工学研究科 助教授の千葉滋プロジェクトマネジャー（PM）が採択したプロジェクトの報告会が2006年2月24日に開催された。Rubyで生物化学情報基盤を利用するためのライブラリ「BioRuby/ ChemRuby」，Webの操作だけで簡単にWebアプリケーションを作れる「 Tuigwaa」，次世代のRuby処理系「 YARV（Yet Another Ruby VM） 」 ，Javaのテンプレート・エンジン「 Maya」の4プロジェクト。いずれのソフトも完成度の高さが目立っていた。Java関連（Seasarファウンデーション）のソフトが二つ（TuigwaaとMaya），Ruby関連のソフトが二つ（BioRuby/ChemRubyとYARV）だったことから，さながら「
Java vs Ruby 」との声も聞かれた。
最初に千葉PMが「未踏ソフトウェア創造事業は賞金と思われているが，それは誤解。受託開発でちゃんと納期がある。（税金を使っているのだから）納税者の方々への説明責任がある」とあいさつした。
写真1 BioRuby / ChemRubyの開発チーム（左端が東京大学 医科学研究所の片山俊明氏） 写 真2 BioRuby on Railsのデモ
東京大学 医科学研究所 ヒトゲノム解析センター ゲノムデータベース分野 助手の片山俊明氏（写 真1）は ，BioRuby とChemRubyについて発表した。BioRuby自体は約5年前から開発されている。未踏ソフトでは「ドキュメントの整備」「ユニット・テストの追加」「インタラクティブなシェルの開発」「化合物を高速に検索するChemRubyの開発」を実施した。ドキュメントの一例としては，BioRubyへのコントリビュートの仕方を示した「readme.dev」を紹介。これにより開発者が増え，3～4個のモジュールが開発されたという。シェルは，Rubyのプログラムを書かなくてもコマンド形式でBioRubyを利用できるようにするもの。発表では，Ruby on Railsを利用してBioRubyシェルの実行結果をWebページに表示する「 BioRuby on Rails」のデモンストレーション（写真2）を披露した。
写 真3 西岡悠平氏（左）と染田貴志氏（右） 写 真4 Tuigwaaのデモ
フリーランスの西岡悠平氏と染田貴志氏（写真3）が開発したTuigwaa（写真4）は，アンケート集計システムなどデータベースと連携するWebアプリケーションを，Webブラウザからの操作だけで作成できるようにするソフト。Wikiの形式あるいはオフィス・ソフトのようなWYSIWSGの画面でWebページを作成できる。テーブルの新規作成/変更/削除や既存データベースの読み込みも可能。O/Rマッピング・ツールにはHibernateを利用している。発表では，この報告会の申し込みシステム自体がTuigwaaで作られたものであることも明かされた。会場からは，機能追加，デザインのカスタマイズ，国際化，スケーラビリティについて相次いで質問が飛び出すなど，大きな関心を集めた。
写真5 YARV 開発者の笹田耕一氏
東京農工大学大学院 工学部 博士後期課程の笹田耕一氏（ 写真5）は次世代 のRuby処理系であるYARVについて発表した。YARVは2004年度未踏ソフトウェア創造事業（未踏ユース）に採択されており，引き続き2005年度上期に未踏ソフトとして採択された。2005年度上期での改良点は3点。従来のYARVはRubyの拡張ライブラリとして利用する形態だったのに対し，Ruby自体と1体化できるようにした。また，現在のRubyはユーザー・スレッドを利用しているのに対し，YARVではネイティブ・スレッドを利用するようにした。1プロセスに1VM（仮想マシン）しか起動できない点も改良し，1プロセスで複数のVMを並列実行可能にした。YARVは，次期Rubyの公式実装であるRuby 2.0（Rite）で採用される見込み。
写真6 Seasarファウンデーション代表理事/グルージェント代表取締役の栗原傑享氏
Seasarファウンデーション代表理事でありグルージェント代表取締役の栗原傑享氏（写真6）は，Javaのテンプレート・エンジンMayaについて発表した。ちなみに採択時の名称はMayaだが，現在はMayaaという名称になっている（参考記事）。すでに，6月20日にカットオーバーする某証券会社のサイトに採用が決まっており，証券会社の実名を出した事例紹介を予定しているという。
最後に千葉PMが，自身が開発したJavaバイトコード変換ソフト「Javassist」を例に取り，「ソフトウエアを使ってもらうにはどうすればいいか」について講演した。講演の中では，Geoffrey Moore氏が提唱したChasm理論を紹介した。技術は「 Innovators（開拓者） 」 「 Early Adopters（先駆者） 」 「 Early Majority（現実派） 」 「 Late Majority（保守派） 」 「 Laggards（懐疑派）」の各ユーザーの順番に広まり，先駆者と現実派の間に「Chasm（越えられない谷間）」があるという有名な理論である。同氏は，あくまで私見と前置きしたうえで，各ソフトがどの位置にいると考えているかを示した。BioRuby/ChemRubyは「 Chasmを越えつつあるか越えたところ」，Tuigwaaは「これからEarly Adoptersを見つけるところ 」 ，YARV は「 Innovators とEarly Adoptersの間の溝を越えたところ 」 ，Mayaは「 Chasmを越える準備ができたところ」だという。
なお，この日 はRubyの13回目の誕生日でもあった。Seasar2について講演したひがやすを氏は冒頭で「Rubyの誕生日おめでとう」と祝福。Rubyの生みの親であるまつもとゆきひろ氏もRubyの未来について講演した。
Scientists have discovered a new species of bat that has large flat adhesive organs , or suckers , attached to its thumbs and hind feet .
This is a remarkable find because the new bat belongs to a Family of bats endemic to Madagascar - - and one that was previously considered to include only one rare species .
The new species , Myzopoda schliemanni , occurs only in the dry western forests of Madagascar , while the previously known species , Myzopoda aurita , occurs only in the humid eastern forests of Madagascar , according to new research recently published online in the journal Mammalian Biology .
The new species is obviously different from the known species based on pelage coloration , external measurements and cranial characteristics , according to the researchers .
Myzopoda are often found in association with broad - leaf plants , most notably Ravenala madagascariensis or the Travelers ' Palm , a plant that is endemic to Madagascar but has been introduced to numerous tropical countries .
Myzopoda are found in association with such plants because they can use their suckers to climb and adhere to the leaves ' flat , slick surface .
They are presumed to roost in the leaves during the day .
Myzopoda were considered endangered because of their limited distribution and the notion that the family included only one species .
The new research , however , modifies both of these ideas .
The researchers determined that Myzopoda is not endangered by the loss of the moist tropical forests because the bat appears to have adapted very well to the large broad - leaf Ravenala that are often pioneering plants in zones where the original forests have been cleared and burned .
" For now , we do not have to worry as much about the future of Myzopoda , " said Steven M. Goodman , Field Museum field biologist and lead author of the study .
" We can put conservation efforts on behalf of this bat on the backburner because it is able to live in areas that have been completely degraded , contrary to what is indicated or inferred in the current literature . "
This underlines the importance of basic scientific research for establishing the priorities for conservation programs and assessments of presumed rare and possibly endangered animals , the study concludes .
Due to the physical similarities between M. schliemanni and M. aurita , the researchers concluded that one species probably evolved from the other , most likely after the bat dispersed across the island from east to west .
Bats are the last group of land mammals on Madagascar that have not been intensively studied , Goodman said .
" Until a decade ago , these animals remained largely understudied .
On the basis of recent surveys and taxonomic research , about one - third of the island 's bat species were unknown to scientists until a few years ago , and the majority of these are new to science . "
Only about eight percent of Madagascar 's original forest cover remains , as the forests continue to be cleared by associated subsistence agricultural activities and to provide wood energy for urban zones .
The island , which is found off the eastern coast of Africa , remains one of the most critically threatened areas in the world , in terms of biodiversity .
Madagascar has a higher level of endemism ( with plants and animals found nowhere else ) than any other landmass in the world of comparable size .
" Still today , you can go out and discover things in Madagascar that have never before been seen by scientists , " Goodman said .
" The sense of discovery is almost levitating . "
The other co-authors of the research are Félix Rakotondraparany , lecturer in the Animal Biology Department at the University of Antananarivo , and Amyot Kofoky , graduate student at the University of Mahajanga .
The castle is one of Romania 's top tourist attractions
The family were turfed out of Romania 's 14th - Century Bran Castle by the communists after World War II .
It was returned to them in 2006 after a long legal battle .
But now Dominic Habsburg , a New York architect and son of the late Romanian Princess Ileana , says he is willing to sell it back for $ 78 m ( £ 40 m ) .
The local council has said it is willing to buy the castle , one of the country 's top tourist attractions .
It wants to prevent the castle being turned into a hotel or theme park , and is in the process of investigating a bank loan .
However , Romania 's culture minister said the local authorities would be " stupid " to pay such a hefty price .
' Best for people '
Mr Habsburg insisted the family was " trying to find the best way to preserve the castle in the interest of the family and the people of Bran " .
He said while the family welcomed the restitution of their asset , it had come with a " financial sacrifice " - the huge cost of upkeep .
" We would like Castle Bran to remain a symbol of everything that is honourable and good in Romania , " he told the Associated Press .
The castle rises dramatically from the forests in the foothills of the Carpathian mountains , 170 km ( 105 miles ) north of Bucharest .
It has been associated with novelist Bram Stoker 's vampire Count Dracula because it is thought to have hosted the infamous Prince Vlad " the Impaler " , on whom Dracula was based .
The debate over how the stones arrived at Stonehenge continues
In a new twist , Open University geologists say the stones were in fact moved to Salisbury Plain by glaciers .
Last year archaeologists said the stones came from the Preseli Hills .
Recent research in the Oxford Journal of Archaeology suggests the stones were ripped from the ground and moved by glaciers during the Ice Age .
Geologists from the Open University first claimed in 1991 that the bluestones at one of Britain 's best - known historic landmarks had not come from a quarry , but from different sources in the Preseli area .
The recent work was conducted by a team headed by Professor Olwen Williams - Thorpe , who said she and her colleagues had used geochemical analysis to trace the origins of axe heads found at Stonehenge and this backed up the original work .
There has been a great reluctance to allow facts to interfere with a good story
Dr Brian John
" We concluded that the small number of axes that are actually bluestone derive from several different outcrops within Preseli , " she said .
" Axes found at or near Stonehenge are very likely to be from the same outcrops as the monoliths , and could even be made of left - over bits of the monoliths . "
The research
Archaeologists claimed the stones came from a quarry at Carn Menyn
Dr Brian John , a geomorphologist living in Pembrokeshire , said he always thought the idea that Bronze Age man had quarried the stones and then taken them so far " stretched credibility " .
But he said the debate would go on until someone was able to prove beyond doubt what happened one way or the other .
" This is very exciting , and it moves the bluestone debate on from the fanciful and unscientific assertions of the past , " he said .
" Much of the archaeology in recent years has been based upon the assumption that Bronze Age man had a reason for transporting bluestones all the way from west Wales to Stonehenge and the technical capacity to do it .
" That has been the ruling hypothesis , and there has been a great reluctance to allow facts to interfere with a good story .
" Glaciers may move very slowly , but they have an excellent record when it comes to the transport of large stones from one part of the country to another . "
Bush says new technologies are the way forward
Speaking to British broadcaster ITV , he said he would instead be talking to fellow leaders about new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
But he conceded that the issue was one " we 've got to deal with " and said human activity was " to some extent " to blame .
Tony Blair is hoping for agreements on climate change and Africa when he hosts the summit in Scotland this week .
Mr Bush said he would resist measures that were similar to the 1997 UN Kyoto Protocol , involving legally binding reductions on carbon emissions , which Washington never ratified .
I think what matters more than the exact theology is where people end up
Margaret Beckett
UK Environment Secretary
African leaders ready for G8
" If this looks like Kyoto , the answer is no , " he said in an interview with ITV's Tonight With Trevor McDonald programme to be broadcast on Monday .
" The Kyoto treaty would have wrecked our economy , if I can be blunt . "
He said he hoped the other G8 leaders would " move beyond the Kyoto debate " and consider new technologies .
He said the US was investing in developing clean energy techniques such as sequestration of carbon dioxide in underground wells , hydrogen - powered cars and zero emission power stations .
Divided opinion
UK Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett told the BBC's Today programme that negotiations were likely to " go to the wire " .
" I think what matters more than the exact theology is where people end up , " she said .
French President Jacques Chirac has said he is hopeful of reaching a deal on climate change , but German environment minister Juergen Trittin said he was " very sceptical on the willingness of the US to move " .
One of Mr Bush 's main domestic critics on global warming , Senator John McCain , called the president 's approach on the issue " disgraceful " .
" I'm not quite sure how you 'll bridge the gap , " he told the BBC's Today programme , but he said he hoped the president and Mr Blair would be able to forge a compromise .
Farm subsidies
In the ITV interview , Mr Bush showed signs of coming into line with general world opinion by describing climate change as " a significant , long - term issue that we 've got to deal with " .

But he rejected the idea he should support the British prime minister 's G8 plan in return for his support over Iraq .
" Tony Blair made decisions on what he thought was best for keeping the peace and winning the war on terror , as I did , " he said .
" So I go to the G8 not really trying to make him look bad or good , but I go to the G8 with an agenda that I think is best for our country . "
HAVE YOUR SAY Even if Bush signs onto Kyoto , there 's no way the Senate will approve it

On the issue of tackling African poverty , President Bush signalled he was ready to abandon US farm subsidies - but only if the European Union was prepared to scrap its Common Agricultural Policy .
Farm subsidies are said to unfairly distort the world market faced by African farmers .
" We 've got agricultural subsidies , [ but ] not nearly to the extent that our friends in the EU have , " he said .
The G8 leaders - from Britain , Canada , Germany , France , Italy , Japan , Russia and the US - meet in Gleneagles on Wednesday for the start of the three - day summit .
Carol Lam , the former United States attorney for San Diego , is smart and tireless and was very good at her job .
Her investigation of Representative Randy Cunningham resulted in a guilty plea for taking more than $ 2 million in bribes from defense contractors and a sentence of more than eight years .
Two weeks ago , she indicted Kyle Dustin Foggo , the former No. 3 official in the C.I.A .
The defense - contracting scandal she pursued so vigorously could yet drag in other politicians .
In many Justice Departments , her record would have won her awards , and perhaps a promotion to a top post in Washington .
In the Bush Justice Department , it got her fired .
Ms. Lam is one of at least seven United States attorneys fired recently under questionable circumstances .
The Justice Department is claiming that Ms. Lam and other well - regarded prosecutors like John McKay of Seattle , David Iglesias of New Mexico , Daniel Bogden of Nevada and Paul Charlton of Arizona — who all received strong job evaluations — performed inadequately .
It is hard to call what ’s happening anything other than a political purge .
And it ’s another shameful example of how in the Bush administration , everything — from rebuilding a hurricane - ravaged city to allocating homeland security dollars to invading Iraq — is sacrificed to partisan politics and winning elections .
Fast forward a few years to 2009 . . .

No , it 's a convergence of a different sort .

Extremely high demand on the Internet is overwhelming available bandwidth , and regulations passed back in 2006 make it illegal for network operators to differentiate and prioritize content .
Welcome to the world of network neutrality , where all content is treated exactly the same . . . where somebody decided that a stupid network is better than a smart network .
“. . . our engineers started with the assumption that we should find technical ways of prioritizing certain kinds of bits . . . we seriously explored various “ quality of service ” schemes . . . [ but ] all of our research and practical experience supported the conclusion that it was far more cost effective to simply provide more bandwidth .
With enough bandwidth in the network , there is no congestion and video bits do not need preferential treatment . ”
Simple is cheaper .
Complex is costly .
At least Tom Giovanetti , of the Institute for Policy Innovation , a Bell - Funded Tank , writing in Friday 's Mercury News , did n't call it a " dumb " network when he wrote the following science fiction . . . Actually , Tom , I * noticed * that a stupid network was better than a smart network .
I looked at " reality . "
I saw email , and the Web , and eCommerce , and Mapquest , and blogging , and Instant Messaging , and streaming audio on demand , and multiplayer online games , and many other miracles too numerous to list here , miracles that never arrived via " intelligent " networks .
Too bad Tom G did n't hear about what Internet2 , the premier U.S. post -Bell - Labs network research effort found [ .pdf ] .
( Research is how we learn about " reality . " )
Let 's hum a few bars of Internet2 :
In other words , when Tankers like Tom Giovanetti or Austrian - style economists like Alex Jacobson ask who decides how to allocate scarce bandwidth , they 're asking the wrong question .
Most of the cost of a network is obtaining right of way and constructing the poles , conduits , towers , antennas , cables , etc .
Whether you provide a kilobit or a terabit is rounding error.needs to decide how to allocate scarce bandwidth .
It is more expensive to allocate it than to simply provide more .
Again , heed the research findings of Internet2 [ .pdf ] :
In fact , Internet2 finds that GigE with reasonable service decisions is 10 x more costly than simple GigE where the user decides what service to buy .
GigE is enough bandwidth to run a telephone network for a city of 100,000 people , yet we have GigE interfaces on our computers .
We could have GigE in our houses for little more than we now pay for 1000 times less capable services .
Backbones are even cheaper than access networks .
Thus , the only reason to ask , " How do we allocate scarce bandwidth ? " is if we 're behind on technology .
Even then , it is far more reasonable to ask , " How do we get ahead on technology ?
" And if the telcos and cablecos wo n't get us ahead on technology , we should be asking , " How should we replace the telcos and cablecos ?

A polyline is a series of connected line segments .
Xpoints and Ypoints are arrays which specify the x and y coordinates of each point as follows :
var Xpoints = new Array ( x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ) ;
var YPoints = new Array ( y1 , y2, y3 , y4,y5 ) ;
Instead of Xpoints and Ypoints you may of course use other names provided these follow the rules for JavaScript variable names .

Line thickness is either 1 px or the value most recently specified by .setStroke ( ) .
jg.drawRect(20,50,70,140 ) ; fillRect ( X , Y , width , height ) ;
Filled rectangle .
X and Y give the co-ordinates to the left top corner .
jg.fillRect(20,50,453,40 ) ; drawPolygon ( Xpoints , Ypoints ) ;
Polygon .
Xpoints and Ypoints are arrays which specify the x and y coordinates of the polygon 's corners as follows :
var Xpoints = new Array ( x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 ) ;
var Ypoints = new Array ( y1 , y2, y3 , y4,y5 ) ;
The polygon will be automatically closed if the first and last points are not identical .

fillPolygon ( Xpoints , Ypoints ) ;
Filled Polygon . Parameters as for drawPolygon ( ) jg.fillPolygon(new Array ( 10,85,93,60 ) , new Array ( 50,10,105,87 ) ) ; drawEllipse ( X , Y , width , height ) ;
Outline of an ellipse .
Values refer to the bounding rectangle of the ellipse , X and Y give the co-ordinates of the left top corner of that rectangle rather than of its center .
Line thickness is either 1 px or the value most recently specified by .setStroke ( ) .
jg.drawEllipse(20,50,70,140 ) ;
or
jg.drawOval(20,50,70,140 ) ; fillEllipse ( X , Y , width , height ) ;
Filled ellipse .
Values refer to the bounding rectangle of the ellipse , X and Y give the co-ordinates of the left - top corner of that rectangle rather than of its center .
jg.fillEllipse(20,50,71,141 ) ;
or
jg.fillOval(20,50,71,141 ) ; fillArc( X , Y , width , height , start - angle , end - angle ) ;
Fills a pie section of an ellipse .
Start - angle and end - angle may be integer numbers or decimalpoint values .
Like with the other ... Ellipse ( ) functions , X and Y specify the left - top corner of the bounding rectangle .
jg.fillArc(20,20,41,12,270.0,220.0 ) ; set Font ( " font - family " , " size+unit " , Style ) ;
This method can be invoked prior to drawString ( ) to specify or change font - family , - size and - style .
Values or font - family and - size may be whatever possible in HTML , and must be enclosed in quotation marks .
Available font styles :
Font .
PLAIN for normal style ( not bold , not italic )
Font .BOLD for bold fonts
Font .ITALIC for italics
Font .ITALIC_BOLD or Font.BOLD_ITALIC to combine the latters .
Example : see drawString ( ) below drawString ( " Text " , X , Y ) ;
Writes text to the location specified by X and Y . Differently from Java , these coordinates refer to the left top corner of the first line of the text .
The string passed to drawString ( ) must be enclosed in quotation marks .
( Non-escaped ) HTML tags inside the string will be interpreted .
For example , " Some Text < br > more Text " would indeed create a line break .
jg.setFont ( " arial " , " 15 px " , Font. ITALIC_BOLD ) ;
jg.drawString ( " Some Text " , 20,50 ) ; drawStringRect ( " Text " , X , Y , Width , Alignment ) ;
Like drawString .
Allows however to set the width of the text rectangle and to specify the horizontal text - alignment .
Text - alignment value must be a string ( i.e. enclosed in quotation marks or apostrophes ) and can be either " left " , " center " , " right " or " justify " .
jg.setFont (" verdana " , " 11 px " , Font. BOLD ) ;
jg.drawStringRect( " Text " , 20,50,300 , " right " ) ; drawImage ( " src " , X , Y , width , height ) ;
Draws image on the specified location .
" src " parameter specifies path , width and height parameters allow to stretch the image ( almost ) arbitrarily .
Optionally , drawImage ( ) accepts a fifth parameter which you can use to insert an eventhandler into the generated image tag .
Example :
jg.drawImage('an Img.jpg',8,5,95,70 , 'onmouseover = " YourFunc ( ) " ' ) ;
jg.drawImage (" friendlyDog.jpg " , 20,50,100,150 ) ; paint ( ) ;
Must be envoked explicitly to draw the internally - generated graphics into the html page .
To optimize performance it's recommended to restrain from calling paint ( ) in unnecessarily short intervals .
Avoid something like :
jg.drawEllipse(0 , 0 , 100 , 100 ) ;
jg.paint( ) ;
jg.drawLine(200 , 10 , 400 , 40 ) ;
jg.paint( ) ;
...
The following will be faster :
jg.drawEllipse(0 , 0 , 100 , 100 ) ;
jg.drawLine(200 , 10 , 400 , 40 ) ;
/*... further drawing methods ... */
jg.paint( ) ; jg.paint ( ) ; clear ( ) ;
Any content created by the Graphics JavaScript Library will be deleted ( within the canvas the graphics object refers to ) .
The default content of the canvas ( content not created by the script ) will remain untouched , i.e. neither be changed nor be deleted .
jg.clear ( ) ;
Any stuff the script has drawn to " myCanvas " is deleted ( assuming that " myCanvas " is the DIV for which ' jg ' has been created ) .
setPrintable ( true ) ;
By default , printing shapes is n't feasible since default printing settings of browsers usually prevent background colors from being printed .
Invoking setPrintable ( ) with the parameter true enables wz_jsgraphics.js to draw printable shapes ( at least in Mozilla / Netscape 6 + and IE ) .
However , at the price of a slightly decreased rendering speed ( about 10 % to 25 % slower ) .
jg.setPrintable ( false ) ;
The parameter false switches wz_jsgraphics.js back to non-printable mode .
The benefit from this , however , will be re-optimized rendering performance .
Researcher IDC recently surveyed more than 5000 developers from 116 countries , and found the use of open - source software to be " pervasive , used by almost three - quarters of organisations and spanning hundreds of thousands of projects " .
Government IT departments looking to cut costs associated with proprietary packages software are also being encouraged to embrace open - source software and , last week , India 's communist - run Kerala state announced plans to reduce Microsoft 's dominance in schools by promoting the use of Linux .
Popular flavours of Linux include Red Hat and SUSE and , while these are gaining traction at the enterprise level , a strong belief persists that the operating system is not ready for ordinary desktop users .
To set itself apart , Ubuntu markets itself as " Linux for human beings " and , while those who have joined the movement praise its easy installation and the range of pre-packaged software , James Dumay , a member of Sydney Linux User Group , said it had n't always been the case .
" Until recently Linux desktop applications were not ready for consumption by the general public because a lot of people were writing a lot applications to do various tasks and these did n't conform to any one standard .
This caused problems with usability and inconsistency across applications , " he said .
However projects such as GNOME have introduced new guidelines to ensure consistency across common desktop operations , he said .
Ubuntu can be downloaded or shipped in disk format free to users .
Also bundled with the OS is the OpenOffice software suite ( which includes word processor , presentation and spreadsheet applications ) , the Firefox browser , email and instant messaging tools , media player software and support for a wide range of peripherals such as webcams and printers .
However not all popular applications are available out of the box , especially when it comes to graphics and gaming .
Although users can choose from an enormous range of applications for the OS , such as image - editing program The GIMP , or Cedega for running PC games on top of Linux , these must be sourced and downloaded individually .
" Ubuntu does n't try to give you everything ; it just gives you sensible defaults , " said Mr Dumay .
Mahyar Goodarz , a government policy adviser from Victoria , said he switched over to the operating system from Windows XP about two weeks ago .
" I am really your granny user .
I only use my computer to do things like accessing the internet and word processing , " he said .
He said the system had proved straightforward to install and found the OpenOffice applications similar in functionality to Microsoft Office .
" The one thing that did n't work was my mobile phone syncing software , but I did n't have a problem with my two printers , or my digital camera .
I did n't have to install anything myself - it automatically just asked me if I wanted to install them , " he said .
Despite being happy with the system , he admits he did hit a bit of a bump in the road when he installed a new release of the operating system that caused his own system to crash .
However he said instructions to fix the flaw were promptly posted on the community website and the system had since been working well .
Web designer , Dave Green , has been running Ubuntu for a few months and said he had found it easier to install than Windows XP .
" OpenOffice 2 is a little bloaty but it can do stuff that Office can't and is just a lot more user friendly .
It does n't include a lot of hardcore functionality but for web surfing and email it 's very easy to use , " he said .
Melissa Draper , a member of the local Ubuntu community , said the number of local users was growing , with 169 people now on the Ubuntu community mailing list .
While this group was made up of mainly technical users and capable early adopters , she said : " We have seen a growth of low - end users who need basically email , web and office applications that have turned away from proprietary OSs . "

In a previous LRC column I touched on the subject of Mythology , arguing that mythology gets discarded when it no longer serves the needs of society .
In this essay I want to further that theme by touching on the subject of Republican Fiscal Conservatism , a myth that is a fallacy that needs to be discarded for political dialog and to provide data proving this assertion .
One of the main themes of the Republican Party since 1980 has been that Democrats are profligate spenders of tax dollars , irresponsibly incurring immense debt , and that electing Republican Administrations is a simple remediation for this vexing problem .
Presidents Reagan , Bush ( Father ) and Bush ( Son ) all vigorously campaigned using these arguments in their platforms .
This has been repeated ad nauseum by the talk radio pundits echoing this fallacy .
Repeating a lie does not make it true , even if it is believed .
American historical memory is notably fleeting ; fortunately the Federal Government records copious amounts of data , including the economic and financial .
A lot of this can be found on the Internet and can be used to remind those of us that are unable to commit this to memory .
I am not here to argue the precision and accuracy of this data in the statistical sense but to assume for arguments sake , that it is accurate within a few percent .
The conclusion shown will not be effected by a few percentage points of error in the input data .
The data source for all discussion herein is the Federal Reserve Bank in St. Louis MO .
The interested reader can find reams of data including what is presented here .
Public debt has been aggregated quarterly since 1966 .
The basis of my argument is that the public debt prior to 1966 will be ascribed to Democratic Administrations , just to give the Republicans a head start .
There have been many Republican Administration ’s since Andrew Jackson , a Tennessee hero , was the last President to pay off the National Debt .
Unfortunately , the St. Louis
Fed does not have data available during this period ( that I could find ) and so in the spirit of Rush Limbaugh I will blame it on those Blue State Democrats ( it will not change the outcome ) .
United States Federal Government public debt data is updated every quarter here .
A plot of this is shown below :
The public debt when the current data set begins was approximately 320 billion dollars , a small fraction of what is today at over 8 trillion dollars .
A spreadsheet of the quarterly data , in multiple formats can also be found at this site .
I used this spreadsheet to allocate by quarters the occupancy of the White House by Democrats and Republicans in the intervening forty years .
The Democratic results are shown , and then followed by the Republican .
If we take percentages of the aggregate debt on a partisan basis we get the following table :
( Millions USD )
% Total debt
Republican Debt Since 1966
6408637
78.16
Democrat Debt Since 1966
1790704
21.84
Bipartisan Total Since 1966
8199341
The results are astonishing , Republican Administrations have accrued , more than 3 fold , the debt that Democrats have .
This demonstrates that the self - applied rubric of " fiscal conservative " is not true for Republican Administration ’s unless we invert the accepted meaning of these words .
What about inflation ?
Will the varying value of the dollar ( downward sadly ) skew these results unfavorably ?
Since I am using Fed data , I will use another government statistic to gauge inflation , the consumer price index ( CPI ) .
The basis year is 1967 as 100 , which is close enough , for my argument to 1966 .
The data I used found 1966 at 97 , and 1998 at 475 .
I will be generous and blame Bill Clinton for another 125 points to be tacked onto the Bush years since 2001 to total 600 ( a nice Rovian touch ) .
Thus the initial Democratic debt in 1966 , in 2006 dollars is 1.8 trillion which when added to the unadjusted since 1966 dollars totals 3.6 trillion .
This is still a long way short of the Republican debt of 6.4 trillion dollars of just six Republican Administrations ( Nixon , Ford , Reagan , Bush I , Bush II ) .
These results demonstrate the mendacious nature of the assertion of Republican Fiscal Conservatism .
What does this bode for the republic ?
I cannot tell since I am not clairvoyant ; however , in the known history of the world a debt this large has never been paid off .

A HUGE fire devastated the set of the latest James Bond film today .
Up to 60 firefighters tackled the blaze at Pinewood Studios , in Buckinghamshire .
The roof of the warehouse - like sound stage - where filming for Casino Royale was said to have recently finished - caved in .
Witnesses said smoke from the blaze , which took firefighters 90 minutes to bring under control , could be seen up to 10 miles away .
Eyewitness Jen McVean , 27 , said flames could be seen shooting through the roof of the building , which is partly made from corrugated steel .
Mrs McVean , who owns a special effects company at Pinewood , said there was no doubt the building was badly damaged .
She said : " There was a very big plume of smoke and we went into the studios to check and we could see the Bond stage was on fire .
There were flames coming out of the roof .
" The roof has caved in .
It was a very big fire .
There were lots of fire engines there . "
Scenes from the latest Bond film Casino Royale , which is still in production , were shot at Pinewood .
The film , which reportedly has a budget of 72 million US dollars ( é39 m ) , is partly based in Venice .
The vast 007 stage had been transformed into a replica of the Italian city .
Speaking at the scene , Fraser Pearson , of Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service , said the badly - damaged set was a " sorry " sight .
He said oxyacetylene gas canisters may have exploded inside the building , and there were fears of further blasts .
A 200 m exclusion area has been created around the set as firefighters dampen it down .
They expect to remain at the scene until tomorrow .
Mr Pearson said : " I am not an expert in the construction industry but it is buckled and warped and blackened , especially at one end and towards the roof .
" It is a very sad to see such an iconic structure looking quite so sorry .
It is blackened and buckled and smoking and clearly has been quite badly damaged by fire .
" We do not know what the inside looks like because of the cylinders but the outside looks pretty bad so I am guessing the inside will be quite badly damaged as well . "
Firefighters were alerted to the fire at 11.18 am .
It is not he first time that a James Bond set at Pinewood Studios has been damaged by fire .
In 1984 an explosion ripped through a corrugated steel building built in 1976 for The Spy Who Loved Me and subsequently used to shoot four Bond movies .
The rebuilt set was reopened in January 1985 as the Albert Broccoli sound stage , named in honour of the producer of many Bond movies .

A week ago it was the turn of the US philosopher Daniel Dennett , second only to Dawkins in the global ranking of contemporary Darwinians , to be similarly feted at a series of lectures and debates across the UK launching his book on religion , Breaking the Spell .
The two make quite a team , each lavishing the other with generous praise as the philosopher Dennett brings to bear his discipline on the scientific findings of Dawkins .
The curious thing is that among those celebrating the prominence of these two Darwinians on both sides of the Atlantic is an unexpected constituency - the American creationist / intelligent - design lobby .
Huh ?
Dawkins , in particular , has become their top pin-up .
How so ?
William Dembski ( one of the leading lights of the US intelligent - design lobby ) put it like this in an email to Dawkins : " I know that you personally do n't believe in God , but I want to thank you for being such a wonderful foil for theism and for intelligent design more generally .
In fact , I regularly tell my colleagues that you and your work are one of God 's greatest gifts to the intelligent - design movement .
So please , keep at it ! "
But while Dembski , Dawkins and Dennett are sipping the champagne for their very different reasons , there is a party pooper .
Michael Ruse , a prominent Darwinian philosopher ( and an agnostic ) based in the US , with a string of books on the subject , is exasperated : " Dawkins and Dennett are really dangerous , both at a moral and a legal level . "
The nub of Ruse 's argument is that Darwinism does not lead ineluctably to atheism , and to claim that it does ( as Dawkins does ) provides the intelligent - design lobby with a legal loophole : " If Darwinism equals atheism then it can't be taught in US schools because of the constitutional separation of church and state .
It gives the creationists a legal case .
Dawkins and Dennett are handing these people a major tool . "
There 's no room for complacency , urged Ruse over lunch in London last week .
Last December 's court ruling against the teaching of intelligent design in some Pennsylvania schools may have been a blow , but now the strategy of the creationist / intelligent - design lobby is to " chisel away at school - board level " across the US .
The National Centre for Science Education believes that as many as 20 % of US schools are teaching creationism in some form .
Evolution is losing the battle , says Ruse , and it's the fault of Dawkins and Dennett with their aggressive atheism : they are the creationists ' best recruiting sergeants .
Ruse has got to a reckless stage of his career .
He prefaced the essay he submitted for Dawkins 's festschrift with the above quote from Dembski and went on to declare that he " felt intensely irritated with Dawkins ...
It 's bad enough having to fight the enemy without having to watch my back because of my friends . "
The editors were horrified and ordered a more deferential rewrite - which Ruse duly provided .
Even more reckless , Ruse put on the net an email exchange between himself and Dennett in which he accused his adversary of being an " absolute disaster " and of refusing to study Christianity seriously : " It is just plain silly and grotesquely immoral to claim that Christianity is simply a force for evil . "
Dennett 's reply was an opaque one line : " I doubt you mean all the things you say . "
But Ruse has got a point .
Across the US , the battle over evolution in science teaching goes on .
Just in the past month there have been bills in state legislatures in New York , Mississippi , Nevada and Arkansas promoting intelligent design .
Last November the Kansas education board promulgated a new definition of science that allowed for supernatural explanations of natural phenomena .
A school district in Kansas rebelled last month , accusing their board of " an utterly false belief that evolutionary science and the scientific method is based on atheistic philosophy .
Promoting this false conflict between science and faith erects unnecessary barriers . "
At the heart of many of these local controversies is the firmly held belief that Darwinism leads to atheism , indeed that it is atheism .
Across the US , a crude and erroneous conflict is being created between science as atheism and religion .
It 's important that Britain avoids the trap that America is falling into , not just because it endangers good science , but also because there is a fascinating debate worth having about what scientific method can reveal about faith , and what theologians have to say about science .
A raft of disciplines , from evolutionary biology and psychology to anthropology , are generating new insights into this persistent human phenomenon , religious belief .
In the best parts of his book Dennett draws on these , as does the scientist Lewis Wolpert in his new book , Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast .
Wolpert argues that the origins of religious belief are linked to our unique capacity to make tools ; Dennett links it to a survival instinct to attribute agency to phenomena .
Both Dennett and Wolpert acknowledge that religion may have provided evolutionary advantages for humans .
There 's good evidence for faith improving mental health and optimism , and reducing stress ; shamanism , with its placebo effect , was the best healthcare system for thousands of years .
Dennett cites those who argue that faith improves cooperation within groups ( though not between them ) .
This argument raises the crucial question of whether , in an era of globalisation and limited resources , religion has outrun its evolutionary advantage .
This is the kind of conversation we want to have in this country , but we 're not safe from American - style false dichotomies between faith and science yet ( which would have particularly sharp consequences for the thousands of young Muslims in this country studying science ) .
On the very day that Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury , made a useful and unequivocal intervention rejecting creationism , Charles Clarke , at a conference on faith and the state , was wobbling precariously on the proverbial pinhead : " in schools it 's a good debate to have " .
Little did he realise that he was using a line straight out of the creationists ' lobbying manual : " teach the controversy " .
Let 's be clear , Clarke is wrong - some debates are not worth having .
No one argues that it 's a useful project for year 10s to research flat - earth theories , so why intelligent design ?
But if we agree on that , then equally we can also agree that some debates are so corrupted by prejudice and ignorance that they are also not worth having .
All protagonists in a debate have a moral responsibility to ensure that the hot air they are expending generates light , not just heat .
It 's a point that escapes Dawkins .
His book on religion , The God Delusion , is to be published this autumn .
Dembski and the intelligent - design lobby must already be on their knees , thanking God .

1. Loop it or lose it – put your foot down
When traveling alone you will at some point find yourself in a crowded airport terminal or restaurant waiting with multiple pieces of luggage .
Professional thieves choose this high - commotion areas to target unsuspecting individuals because there are a lot of distractions and they can quietly snatch a bag while you are preoccupied with something else .
When I ’m at the gate and I know I ’ve got my boarding pass and I ’m good to go , I turn on the iPod and snooze before the flight .
And under normal circumstances if I were to leave my bags on the ground next to me , I would become a prime target for a thief to stroll by and lift them .
As simple as it sounds , here is a technique that prevents this :
Put your foot through the loop or strap .
When I lived in Ecuador there was a great deal of bus travel involved and fellow exchange students had their backpacks snatched multiple times .
This trick never failed me – in the best scenario it served as a deterrent for the observant bag snatcher and in the worst scenario it simple burglar alarm / leash that kept my bag on my person .
2. Improvise a bag handle
Using plastic bags as carry - ons is just never a good idea if you can avoid it .
Not only are they flimsy but they eventually turn your fingers into sausage links if they ’re loaded with heavy stuff and you have to carry them far .
If you have no other choice but the plastic bag as a carry - on , or even if your real luggage simply has a crappy handle , snag the cardboard tube from an empty toilet paper roll , cut it longitudinally and clip it over the bad handles .
Obviously you can use other material to achieve the same purpose but I ’ve found that the TP tube is a perfect solution and is guaranteed to be found anywhere you have a conventional toilet .
3. Ubiquitous travel doc accessibility
If you ’re traveling internationally you should have your travel documents on you at all times .
This is a no-brainer .
I use a leather pouch with a belt loop that flips inside my pants .
You should also store a copy of your passport and important docs in another location like your checked luggage while in transit or your hotel room while you ’re there .
Another great tactic is to scan all your important credentials and then email them to yourself .
Internet cafes are prevalent everywhere but the US so it works fairly well and you can get to your docs anywhere you can find Internet ( use an encrypted zip file if you ’re paranoid of storing them on gmail ’s server ) .
I came up with this idea last year– I happen to use gmail and emailed each scan to myself with the subject “ vitaldoc : passport ” etc .
This allows me to pull up all my critical info by searching my gmail for “ vitaldoc ” anywhere I am that has Internet .
I used this trick at the doctor ’s office the other day using my treo ’s web browser to get an insurance card I did n’t have in my wallet - very useful .
4. Protect your passwords on public Internet terminals
So how do you safely check email from public terminals while you ’re traveling ?
This technique will not protect you from hardware - based keyloggers but it should defeat most software - based ones .
Whatever you do , do n’t type your password directly into the password field on a public terminal , rather put the characters you need ( and then some ) in the url bar and cut and paste your password together piecemeal from there .
It ’s debatable how effective this technique is as some keyloggers can store things like cursor position and clipboard elements .
But , just like The Club ( TM ) , if you make it tricky enough to determine yours over someone else ’s , this should reduce the likelihood of someone jacking your credentials .
You can also put in a little time up front , bring a thumbdrive with the portable apps suite installed and setup secure POP to your email using the Thunderbird client ( thanks Benny for that suggestion ) .
At that point you also have the portable Firefox browser as well , so ideally with all your passwords stored in that instance you ’re not entering them in the browser via the terminal .
Just be sure to encrypt the thumbdrive , otherwise in the event you lose that , someone has direct access to all your accounts .
5 . Free headphones for the in - flight movie
When the flight attendant strolls down the aisle peddling those $ 5 crappy plastic headphones that have been worn by 100 people before you , kindly decline , smile and bust out your own set .
Airlines make a huge margin on those rental headphones so they ’re not very motivated to disclose that every armrest has the standard headphone jack already in it .
6 . The iPod hold button goes both ways
If you have an iPod you probably know that you can use the hold button to ensure that you do n’t mistakenly bump the control wheel and change tracks or volume while listening to music .
You may not know , however , that the hold button serves the same purpose of diabling the buttons when your iPod is off as well .
I learned this while tinkering after a trip where I had left my iPod in my pack and found the battery completely dead upon arrival from having the buttons bumped repeatedly and continuously turning it on while it was in the pack .
7 . Photos are n’t just for memories back home
If you ’ve got a digital camera or camera phone you can use it to snap a quick picture of things you need to remember while you ’re there like your hotel room number or parking space .
Thanks to my friend Josh for reminding me about this technique .
We used this trick extensively on our trip to Playa last year when we were bumped between three different hotels in order to remember our room number each time .
8. Diversify your portfolio
When traveling in Mexico especially , I will split both my cash and credit cards in two places so that if my wallet is stolen I still have dinero somewhere else .
If you travel with a money belt I recommend putting a credit card and a few bills there and leaving the rest in your wallet .
Cash is king in an emergency situation but the credit card ensures you have access to larger money if you need it .
Many banks have the ability to issue a short - term , expiring credit card if you know you ’ll be traveling .
Your money is insured either way if your card is stolen but it ’s a pain in the ass to cancel cards if you have any auto debits setup .
Plus you ’ll be without a card until the new one arrives when you return .
Instead get a temporary card that you can use while on vacation .
It ’s very similar in concept to the tactic in gmail of using youraddress+thisvendor@gmail.com to be able to have a disposable email address for suspect sites you think will be spamming you .
There ’s also a free service now that does the equivalent for phone numbers – same concept .
9 . Skype those International calls
Internet cafes love to sell international phone service because they make a killing on it .
Get yourself a skype account before you leave and make your international calls for pennies of what you ’d pay in phone charges .
You ’ll also find it ’s more convenient because skype will have your call history stored so you do n’t need to repeatedly look up phone numbers and type them in .
Plus you generally have to have the attendant at the Internet cafe place the call for you or at least unlock the phone .
10 . Retrieve your voicemails remotely without your phone
There are a couple ways to skin this cat .
The treo makes it trivial to forward your cell phone to your skype account via the call preferences menu so when you know you will be somewhere without cell service , it ’s easy to do ahead of time .
Get the skype - in service and you can potentially answer your phone from a computer on the other side of the world and at the very least have access to the voicemails and change your outbound message .
If you do n’t forward your cell , you can still probably call into your voicemail remotely but I ’ve heard people had problems doing this over skype and I know I ’ve personally had issues using skype to call businesses with automated phone systems .
Anyways , these are some battle - tested travel tips from someone who has done quite a bit of traveling .
Use them in good health .
Taking the Beat of Cadence 29 January , 2007
Gilad Bracha is a legend in Object Oriented Programming .
He is the Co-Author of the Java Language Specification and one of the major contributors to Strongtalk which has just been released by Sun under an Open Source License .
Gilad is forming a team at Cadence and is raising eye brows with his latest hires .
Eliot Miranda and Vassili Bykov recently left Cincom to join Gilad at Cadence .
Eliot is well - known known as a Master of Smalltalk Development .
Vassili Bykov was the lead tool builder of VisualWorks .
We ca n’t help wondering about the team of Gilad , Eliot , and Vassili .
I spoke with Gilad about Cadence , Smalltalk , and Open Source .
Ron : Gilad , thank you for taking the time to answer a few questions .
I ’m sure the question on everyone ’s mind is what is Cadence up too ?
Can you share anything about what you are working on ?
Are you developing in Java , Smalltalk , Strongtalk or creating something new ?
Gilad : Cadence develops tools for EDA – Electronic Design Automation .
This is the stuff engineers use to design chips , boards etc .
Almost every company developing electronics has some Cadence tools .
I ca n’t say much about our project , except that it is very cool .
The project brings together several issues that really interest me .
There is a very strong element of language design .
Domain specific languages are widely used in EDA .
There ’s an element of formal methods – EDA is probably the only area where formal methods are really used commercially in a big way .
Finally , there are a lot of OO infrastructure issues .
Altogether , I ’m having a blast .
We ’re using Squeak as our development environment at the moment .
However , we are not bound to any particular environment or engine .
If Strongtalk evolves to the point where it is stable enough , we might use it .
Or we might use something else .
We ’re keeping our options open .
Ron :
Can you share with us your feelings about Open Source development in general ?
I ’m interested in your opinion of the future of Open Source , business adoption of Open Source Software and Business Models for Software Development Companies engaging in Open Source projects .
Gilad :
Open source is a complex topic and I can’t begin to do it justice here .
I favor open source licenses that allow for commercial use , as opposed to the fanatics who want to force everything to be free .
I think open source and commercial software should , and necessarily will , continue to coexist .
The quality of a lot of open source work is a big concern .
Squeak is a case in point .
There are 5 ways to do everything , but none that are truly finished and polished .
Documentation is negligible .
So I get frustrated with it .
However , I ’m really glad it exists .
To solve these issues , we need a model where people do pay for software – not for the artifact , but for the service .
Subscriptions , where you pay regularly and get bug fixes and new features as long as you pay .
This could be coupled with backup , storage , network access etc .
I think this will be a while coming , but software as a service is the future .
Ron : Smalltalk has a long history as you know very well .
There are a lot of very talented people working with Smalltalk , as well as a number of companies that use Smalltalk .
We have a number of very interesting projects written in Smalltalk like : Seaside , Croquet , Sophie , Scratch , and OLPC .
Given your vast perspective can you give us your opinion of the future of Smalltalk ?
What changes , if any , are needed to help ensure its future ?
Gilad : I think the Smalltalk community needs to be more focused on issues like security , modularity , deployment and integration with the outside world .
The language itself may need to change to support that .
There needs to be a focus on providing valuable solutions .
One needs to able to show people how to solve daily programming tasks that they care about .
Frankly , there needs to be less focus on educating children .
I mean , what does our society pay a teacher ?
You can see that it does n’t value educating preschoolers – we just pay lip service to it .
It ’s a noble goal , but in the end if your language dies , you ca n’t educate anybody .
I think Avi Bryant ’s work is exemplary of what should be done : things like Seaside and DabbleDB .
We need lots more of that .
Another example of a good way to move forward is Fscript .
It needs to be easy to open a native window , or run a script that calls the OS , or drive a web application .
Look how much traction Ruby has .
There needs to be real source code – the file out format is a disgrace .
Ron :
The release of Strongtalk is very exciting for many in the Smalltalk community .
Will you be working with or supporting the Open Source development of Strongtalk ?
Gilad : Does moral support count ?
I really hope Strongtalk takes off , but it will certainly take time .
When it stabilizes , we may very well use it .
An open source community is germinating around Strongtalk .
David Griswold is coordinating the effort .
I ’m happy to answer questions about the type checker , the mirror system etc .
But the urgent thing is to stabilize the VM .
Alas , it ’s hard to get people with the right expertise to work on that for free .
There are people who want to learn about advanced VMs and are willing to take the time and effort to do so .
So there will be a learning curve , and it will take longer than we ’d like .
However , ultimately the technology is too good to pass up .
Ron :
Are you still forming a team at Cadence ?
How many more people are you looking to hire ?
Are you focused mostly on VM and internal language issues , or will you be taking on application development for Cadence ?
How is the team shaping up , are Eliot and Vassili happy ?
Gilad :
Yes , we are still looking for people – Smalltalkers or otherwise .
At this stage , the project is mainly seeking application programmers .
A familiarity with EDA , Modeling , Formal methods is a plus – but the main things we look for are really solid OO design skills , cleverness and above all , good taste .
I may also have openings for language types if the right person comes along .
We have a great team and I intend to keep it that way , so we are being extremely selective .
Eliot and Vassili are terrific , and I think they have every reason to be happy .
I know I am .

Green City Going Green By Adrian Duyzer
Published January 07 , 2007
( First published in Ade 's blog . )
The environment is Canada 's most pressing issue , according to a just - released poll of Canadians .
The same poll reports that 74 percent of Canadians believe Canada 's Conservative government is doing a poor job on the environment .
Prime Minister Harper knows he is vulnerable on the issue , which spurred him to shuffle his cabinet , booting Rona Ambrose as Minister of the Environment and replacing her with trusted lieutenant John Baird .
Newspaper headlines ran from " PM charts a greener course " ( The Globe and Mail ) to " Harper goes green " ( The National Post ) .
But if Harper really wants to go green , he should start by legalizing it .
Green , that is .
Yup , I 'm talking about marijuana .
Year of the CFL
Canada 's unique brand of football is increasingly popular .
As temperatures continue to rise , football is only going to get more popular : after all , winter sports require winter , which bodes ill for hockey .
But there 's a different CFL on the block , and this is its year .
Compact fluorescent lamps have finally hit their stride and they 're illuminating more homes than ever .
Even Wal - Mart has stepped into the fray , with the goal of single - handedly doubling sales of the bulbs in one year .
CFLs are popular because they last far longer than regular bulbs , they use far less electricity ( the 23 - watt CFLs I bought today put out the same amount of light as a 100 - watt incandescent bulb ) , and they no longer produce the harsh light normally associated with fluorescent lamps .
Using them is one of the easiest and most effective ways we can tackle global warming .
Every time I stop by Canadian Tire I see somebody in the lights aisle , mulling over which CFL to buy .
Lightin ' Up the Basement
Canadian
Tire , however , is not the only store in Hamilton where you can buy lights .
The local hydroponics store also has a fine selection , but they 're not selling energy - efficient CFLs .
Instead , you 'll find high pressure sodium and metal halide lamps that range in power from 400 to 1000 watts apiece .
Weed growers know that fluorescent lights might be useful for germinating seeds but to grow the fine bud , you need some proper lights .
It 's these lights that make hydroponic grow - ops such massive hydro users .
Four 600 - watt high pressure sodium lamps - about what 's necessary to grow pot in a large basement room - use as much electricity as it would take to light up 50 living rooms using 100 - watt equivalent CFL bulbs .
It 's unknown how many marijuana grow operations there are in Canada , but there at least tens of thousands .
The marijuana industry is thought to be worth $ 7 billion in British Columbia alone .
With all those lights burning to keep the pot growing , we 're talking about vast amounts of electricity and that means vast amounts of greenhouse gas emissions .
All to grow a crop that grows even better outside in Canada 's warm summer months .
Mr. Harper , do the planet a favour and go green on the green .

Das frei verfügbare Office - Paket OpenOffice soll schneller und hübscher werden sowie insbesondere bei seiner Tabellenkalkulation der Microsoft - Konkurrenz Excel verstärkt das Wasser reichen können .
Den entsprechenden Fahrplan stellte Michael Meeks , bei Novell für die Desktopforschung zuständig und dabei ganz auf die Arbeit bei OpenOffice.org ausgerichtet , am gestrigen Sonntag auf dem Free and Open Source Software Developers ' European Meeting ( FOSDEM ) in Brüssel vor .
Updates für die Software - Suite sollen zudem künftig in regelmäßigen dreimonatigen Abständen kommen .
" Wir hatten große Probleme , die Version 2.0 zu veröffentlichen .
Es hat über 20 Monate gedauert " , gestand Meeks alte Schwächen ein .
Er gebe aber sein Ehrenwort , dass die Situation besser werde und künftig viermal im Jahr neue Funktionen in die überarbeiteten Versionen integriert würden .
Große Aufmerksamkeit will das Entwicklerteam dem OpenOffice - Bestandteil Calc widmen , da auch die Redmonder laut Meeks gegenwärtig " ihre meisten Investitionen " im Office - Bereich in das Pendant Excel stecken .
Um mit Microsoft gleichzuziehen , die Interoperabilität zu verbessern und Funktionen kompatibel zu machen , sei noch Schwerarbeit erforderlich , betonte der Free - Software - Protagonist : " Kernel - Hacking ist ein Kinderspiel dagegen " .
So unterstütze Calc gegenwärtig 65.535 Reihen , während Excel über eine Million verarbeiten könne .
Derart große Zahlen würden viele kommerzielle Nutzer tatsächlich auch nachfragen .
Ein verstärktes Augenmerk richtet das Kern - Entwicklerteam weiter auch auf eine Verkürzung der Zeit zum Kalt - und Warmstart der OpenOffice - Applikationen .
Schon jetzt sei es möglich , das Paket mit in den Bootprozess des gesamten Systems zu integrieren , erläuterte Meeks .
Die Verwaltung des Arbeitsspeichers durch die einzelnen Programme bereitet ihm aber noch Sorgen .
Weiter gekommen sei man da schon bei Designaspekten insbesondere für das enthaltene Präsentationsprogramm , bei dem die Darstellung von Grafiken gerade bei Linien und Ecken deutlich schärfer geworden sei .
Zufrieden ist Meeks auch mit der guten Unterstützung von Makros , sodass OpenOffice in diesem Bereich " teilweise schneller als Excel " arbeite .
Weitere Themen auf Meeks Agenda sind die Unterstützung von 64 - Bit- Rechnerarchitekturen , einfachere Import - und Exportmöglichkeiten für Daten aus Microsoft Access sowie eine bessere Java - Unterstützung .
" Die Welt der Office - Anwendungen neu zu erfinden " schwebt dem Programmierer mit OpenOffice nicht vor .
Apple habe es mit der Präsentationssoftware Keynote zwar vorgemacht , dass in dem umkämpften Softwaresektor durchaus Innovationen möglich seien .
Generell komme es aber darauf an , angesichts der Funktionswucherungen in Microsoft Office gerade durch Vereinfachungen die Programme wieder nutzerfreundlicher zu machen .
Hier könne man vieles durch ganz einfache Design - Änderungen erreichen .
Generell hält Meeks die kontinuierliche Verbesserung von OpenOffice für den Punkt , an dem die Entwicklergemeinde " der Freiheit am besten dienen kann " .
Schließlich würden die Redmonder mit ihrem Office - Angebot 30 Prozent ihres Gesamtumsatzes erzielen , was sich in 2005 auf rund 12 Milliarden US - Dollar belaufen habe .
Gerade für kommerzielle Anwender sei der Anreiz groß , auf OpenOffice umzustellen .
Novell etwa habe auf diesem
Weg allein im vergangenen Jahr eine Million US - Dollar an Lizenzkosten eingespart .
Entscheidend für weitere Erfolge im Unternehmensbereich sei aber auch , dass sich offene Standards wie OpenDocument weiter durchsetzen würden und Microsoft mit Office Open XML kein eigenes Süppchen koche .
Zu dem Streit um eine stärkere Unabhängigkeit des OpenOffice - Projekts vom Hauptsponsor Sun Microsystems äußerte sich Meeks zurückhaltend .
In der Community sei es ja üblich , immer nach einem " Bösen " zu suchen , erläuterte er. " Aber Sun macht den Job gut , insbesondere was die Lizenzerteilung und andere Rechtsfragen angeht . "
So habe der IT - Konzern etwa erklärt , keinesfalls eventuell durch Codebestandteile verletzte eigene Patentansprüche gegen OpenOffice - Anwender durchzusetzen .
Insgesamt würde Sun ferner die meisten fest angestellten Entwickler für die Programm - Suite auf der Gehaltsliste stehen haben – vor Novell , Intel , Google und RedHat .

来生愿意当中国人吗 北京人回答 ……
更新 2006-02-21 9:33 PM
人气 6
【大纪元2月21日讯】(大纪元特约记者文霞、记者岳芸采访报导)
在北京的长安街头，一家日本通讯社拿着问卷调查，随机请市民回答一些问题。采访时没有摄像机，可以用笔名回答，愿意写住址就写，不写也不强求。北京市民认为这种民意测验挺好的，所抛出的访题很激进。
有一条问卷的提问是： “ 如果有来世，您是否还愿意做中国人？” 很多人回答：“ 下辈子不当中国人了 。 ” 有道问题是： “ 中国再发展五十年，能不能对上美国？” 还有道问题： “ 西方人看得起中国人吗？” 民众普遍回答： “ 西方人看不起中国人，尤其大陆的 。 ”
有道问题是 ： “ 日本强大您怕不怕？ ” 受访的市民答道： “ 不怕，我们也在发展呀！ ” 另有一道问题是： “ 如果有多党制的选举，您赞不赞成？ ” 很多人都说赞成，还说： “ 要选举的话，现在的政府肯定会够呛的、不赞成。 ” “ 如果不惜一切代价要统一台湾，您赞不赞成？ ” 受访市民说： “ 我不赞成，台湾人生活挺好的，为何要打人家，那就不人道了。” 采访者听了直乐。
北京市民的心 声
受访市民也谈到，当前的大陆是万事俱备，只欠东风；像干柴似的，就差一把火。到处在积怨，人都有点被逼疯了似的，主要是人的生存尊严没有，说话的权利没有，有一种压迫感。
“ 看大街上老百姓的面目表情，跟外国人就不一样，人家有一种特别自由的神情，中国人好像多少苦难压在身上一样。”北京市民谈到他的观察。大街上有人打架，碰他一下就打起来了，玩命似的。一般治安没像过去那样好，晚上有些地方天一黑就没人了。广播电台、电视也说，出行女子要结伴而行，反正是乱。
NEW ORLEANS , Nov. 9 - On a single day last June in Pigeon Town and Hollygrove , impoverished neighborhoods of worn frame houses at the city 's western edge , four men were killed , adding to the eight already slain there this year .
Young men brazenly sold drugs from street corners in broad daylight .
The gunfire was constant .
Residents were fearful .
But the bullets and the drugs and the fear are gone now , swept away by Hurricane Katrina , along with the dealers and gangs and most of the people .
There has not been a single killing in this violence - prone neighborhood , or anywhere else in New Orleans , since the chaos that immediately followed Hurricane Katrina subsided .
New Orleans , the nation 's most dangerous city , has suddenly become perhaps its safest , and what had easily been the country 's murder capital now has a murder rate of exactly zero .
Although several people were believed to have been killed in the disorder that followed the floods for several days , the last killing officially recorded by the police was on Aug. 27 , two days before the hurricane hit .
A bar owner was found shot to death that day in his establishment on Magazine Street .
And when the city was finally evacuated , the criminals left , too .
Since then some 60,000 to 80,000 residents have returned , a fraction of the city 's previous population of 450,000 .
What is remarkable to criminologists , though , is how few criminals seem to be among them .
For me , coming from a science background and being an introvert to begin with , the biggest eye - opener and the hardest thing to overcome was to accept that I needed to sell myself to employers and enhance my skills and experience on my resume .
Here are two common mistakes and their solutions that I learned about resume writing while in business school :
Cater your resume for the position .
Do n’t make the mistake of creating a one - size - fits - all resume .
So many people think that once you ’ve put all your work experience on a piece of paper , you ’re done .
Nothing could be further from the truth , especially in this age of keyword - scanning software .
In order to write an effective resume , you must research the positions you ’re applying for .
Gone are the days when you could mass mail your resume and a generic cover letter in the hope of getting bites from employers .
For example , if you ’re applying to a position in the marketing department as opposed to finance , you should probably change the emphases on some of your bullet points before sending out your resume .
Example : Let ’s say you worked on a project in which your interaction with customers resulted in an improvement to the bottom line of the department .
If you ’re applying to a finance position , you might emphasize the “ 25 % increase in ROI ” you achieved , whereas if you ’re applying to a job in the marketing department , they might be more interested how you “ developed innovative customer satisfaction surveys ” that resulted in such an increase .
Make your resume stand out by using the CAR method : Context , Action , Results .
Once you ’ve identified the sorts of skills required in the position you ’re seeking , present them in the right way by putting yourself in the position of the employer .
What is he or she looking for ?
Too many resumes out there are written too vaguely when it comes to showing off your skills and accomplishments .
Think about it : businesses for the most part focus on the bottom line : results .
Why not make your resume do the same ?
By the way , “ CAR ” is just a mnemonic .
ACR , RCA , whichever order works best for your bullet point is fine , and try to use them all so your resume does n’t sound stale and repetitive .
Context :
This gives the employer the background information about your accomplishment .
Did you do it while undergoing a period of high - growth ?
Was the department undergoing lots of change ?
If your accomplishment was part of a project , how big was it ?
How long did it take ?
You get the idea .
If there was some sort of unusual situation or demand , be sure to mention it .
Action : Explain the action you took , being sure to use action verbs like led , managed , created , developed , etc .
What specifics did YOU do , as opposed to people on your team ?
( As much as I hate this aspect because I find it somewhat silly , many employers out there want to know what you specifically contributed , nevermind if the project could n’t have been accomplished without a team effort . )
Results :
Here ’s where you get to hit the ball home .
How did what you did benefit the company ?
Be sure to quantify it as much as possible .
Did it result in a 25 % increase in ROI ?
An absolute $ 5 M savings ?
Did you receive a meaningful award for your accomplishment ?
( If so , be sure to describe the award , especially in terms of its rarity . )
Here ’s an example of the process in action :
Generic statement : Responsible for getting goods to the customer
Add Action : Delivered perishable goods
Add Context : Delivered perishable goods to key customers in a fast - paced environment
Add Result : Delivered perishable goods to key customers in a fast - paced environment , resulting in return customers and reduced waste
Final revision ( one possibility ) :
Improved delivery process of perishable goods to key customers in a fast - paced environment , resulting in a 50 % increase in return customers and an annual savings of $ 1 M from reduced waste
Compare the final revision with the original , generic statement .
Can you see the difference ?
As a stranger , you get a much better sense of the role of the candidate , what he did , and the benefits in which his actions resulted .
Remember , at each step , break down all the actions you took and see if there ’s anything of more value that you can add to your bullet point , especially as it relates to the position you ’re applying for .
I try to remind myself that resume writing as being part of “ the system ” whose rules you must learn in order to be successful , kind of like a game .
With practice and over time , it becomes easier and easier to do .
Reality is that there are probably lots of people applying for the position you ’re interested in , and the more you can make yourself stand out ( within the boundaries of honesty ) , the better your chances become .

Pentagon rolls out stealth PR By Matt Kelley , USA TODAY WASHINGTON  A $ 300 million Pentagon psychological warfare operation includes plans for placing pro-American messages in foreign media outlets without disclosing the U.S. government as the source , one of the military officials in charge of the program says .
Thousands of South Koreans wave U.S. and South Korea flags during a pro-U.S. rally in October .
By Lee Jin-man , AP Run by psychological warfare experts at the U.S. Special Operations Command , the media campaign is being designed to counter terrorist ideology and sway foreign audiences to support American policies .
The military wants to fight the information war against al - Qaeda through newspapers , websites , radio , television and " novelty items " such as T - shirts and bumper stickers .
The program will operate throughout the world , including in allied nations and in countries where the United States is not involved in armed conflict .
THE PROGRAM :
• Cost : Up to $ 100 million per contractor , $ 300 million total
• Contractors : SYColeman of Washington ; Lincoln Group of Washington ; Science Applications International Corp. of San Diego
• Awarded : June 7
• Length : Five years
• Purpose : " For media approach planning , prototype product development , commercial quality product development , product distribution and dissemination , and media effects analysis . "
Source : Department of Defense
The description of the program by Mike Furlong , deputy director of the Joint Psychological Operations Support Element , provides the most detailed look to date at the Pentagon 's global campaign .
The three companies handling the campaign include the Lincoln Group , the company being investigated by the Pentagon for paying Iraqi newspapers to run pro-U.S. stories .
( Related story : Contracts for pro-U.S. propaganda )
Military officials involved with the campaign say they 're not planning to place false stories in foreign news outlets clandestinely .
But the military wo n't always reveal its role in distributing pro-American messages , Furlong says .
" While the product may not carry the label , ' Made in the USA , ' we will respond truthfully if asked " by journalists , Furlong told USA TODAY in a videoconference interview .
He declined to give examples of specific " products , " which he said would include articles , advertisements and public - service announcements .
The military 's communications work in Iraq has recently drawn controversy with disclosures that Lincoln Group and the U.S. military secretly paid journalists and news outlets to run pro-American stories .
White House officials have expressed concern about the practice , even when the stories are true .
National security adviser Stephen Hadley said President Bush was " very troubled " by activities in Iraq and would stop them if they hurt efforts to build independent news media in Iraq .
The military started its own probe .
It 's legal for the government to plant propaganda in other countries but not in the USA .
The White House referred requests for comment about the contracts to the Pentagon , where officials did not respond .
Special Operations Command awarded three contracts worth up to $ 100 million each for the media campaign in June .
Besides the Lincoln Group , the contractors are Science Applications International Corp. ( SAIC ) of San Diego and SYColeman of Washington .
SAIC and Lincoln Group spokesmen declined to comment on the contract .
Rick Kiernan , a spokesman for SYColeman , says its work for Special Operations Command is " more in the world of advertising . "
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has emphasized that Washington must promote its message better .
" The worst about America and our military seems to so quickly be taken as truth by the press and reported and spread around the world , " he said last week .
The Iraq example may cause Arabs to doubt any pro-American messages , says Jumana al - Tamimi , an editor for the Gulf News , an English - language newspaper published in the United Arab Emirates .
Placing pro-U.S. content in foreign media " makes people suspicious of the open press , " says Ken Bacon , a Clinton administration Pentagon spokesman who heads the non-profit group Refugees International .
No contractor for the global program has made a final product , Furlong says .
Approval will come from Rumsfeld 's office and regional commanders .
Some of the development work is classified .
" Sometimes it 's not good to signal ... what your plans are , " he says .

Cheney is rather the sadistic sort would n't we say ?
I think he yearns for someone to cross him , gathering ammunition in the meantime .
That 's all he 's about .
It 's all a sick game .
Anyone who may show he 's wrong is a target .
And he LOVES to " send messages " .
Any way does n't some CIA person have to have tipped Cheney off early ?
In order for Libby to be ordered into hot pursuit ?
I can't imagine that Cheney can pull all of his " fact " from that tapeworm that was his gray matter .

IMHO , I think if the jury is serious they 'll have to listen to the tape , put faces to names , rehash , take their time .
I think they need time to convict - the more the better .
Say Tuesday ?
STILL , the investigation will go on wo n't it ?
Cheney next ?

Thank you Margie for laying out the time frame and names .

My bet --- it had something to do with Iran .
They conveniently thwarted CIA work that possibly would have shown that Iran was no where close to having nuclear weapons .

Imagine you are Cheney , making those 17 unprecedented trips to the CIA , trying to drum up excuses to go into Iraq , with the British insisting upon the UN route .
Now picture if you will , an agent at Langley and she keeps telling you there is nothing and she will not compromise the truth .
Seymour Hersh 's April 10 , 2006 article in the New Yorker quoted an anonymous official saying ,
“ A former senior intelligence official told me that people in the Pentagon were asking , What ’s the evidence ?
We ’ve got a million tentacles out there , overt and covert , and these guys ” — the Iranians — “ have been working on this for eighteen years , and we have nothing ?
We ’re coming up with jack shit . ”
Now she is messing with your plans to steal Iraqi oil and you are running out of time .
So you keep coming back to Langley to put pressure on her , but she sticks to her guns and the truth .
That is n't what you want to hear .
Now being the biggest Dick in the country , also makes you a vengeful prick .
So you start the process of revenge , because you know she is eventually going to be trouble .
Especially since Iran is next on the agenda .

Plame worked on the Counterproliferation Task Force ; she was working on WMD intelligence gathering activities regarding Iran .
If this were a great work of fiction , a moive script of epic proportions ...
Iran would Cheney 's nemesis , his Moby Dick , as it were ( tailgate party photos notwithstanding ) .
And he must get it , like Captain Ahab , he must do ... something .
Revenge ?
Just what has gotten into Dick ? )
It makes sense that he would need to remove Plame from the field for her Iran WMDs non-proliferation work and destroy that office 's years of contacts , shile simultaneously silencing a pesky critic of the first stage , thus any impediment to the successful implementation of the Long Occupation in Iraq , once Wilson 's Op - ed slipped out ... then use Iraq as an opportunistic proxy , a probably - bloodier - than - he - expected stand - in , for war with Iran .
Iraq becomes , intentionally or not , a geographically convenient staging ground for a " next phase " in this script .
But why ?
... that is , if this were a movie , or a great work of fiction .

Remember a few years ago when ZERO evidence had been produced and the whole thing was in a fog .
We hypothesized that since they are a top - down , decider in chief down , and lock - step regime , that Libby would do nothing on his own .
Independent thinking is not the way things are done at the regime building .
We concluded way back then that Cheney and Bush were the originators of the crime .
Hey time shows we were correct and accurate ... while Ricky said we were conspiracy nuts .

On this blog , I have also been calling the American Government during the 109th congress years the " republican dictatorship " .
I have been pointing out that we ought not look back to Hitler and Mussolini for examples of a dictatorship .
A modern dictatorship which has years of psyop type professional training is smooth and not apparent to those who are not watching closely .
Anything that thwarts the will of the people is a part of dictatorship .
A great mystery happened in the '08 election and the congress was transformed in part .
That was a signal to the republican dictatorship , and some republicans in congress do not want to be a part of the dictatorship any more .
But will it matter ?.
Check this out :
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged the Democratic - controlled U.S. Congress not to interfere in the conduct of the Iraq war and suggested President George W. Bush would defy troop withdrawal legislation .
( AP Report , emphasis added ) .
That makes it official that the scope of the republican dictatorship has been narrowed to the Bush regime .
But is it now more dangerous , since it is now in open defiance to the congress the people recently elected ?

A recent dailykos piece that got picked up in newspapers across the world made the startling point that the VP 's efforts were to discredit and thereby dismantle the CIA 's counterproliferation unit .
Haunting analysis that manages to makes sense of the big WHY in terms that make sense :

It has been said that Plame was the original target because with her expertize on the proliferation of WMD in Iran she would have to be removed so she would n't be there to refute the bullshit the administration is spewing about Iran now .
One has to remember that Iran has always been the target .
The saying in this administration has been , " Real men go to Tehran " .
Read PANC .
It 's all there .
There is a good case to be made that it was n't Wilson they wanted to neutralize , but Plame .

Months ago for one day only and no longer covered by any media was a story that she stopped some WMD from going into Iraq as planned by Cheney 's covert action so they could be discovered .

Hello ?
What about Brewster Jennings ?
I remember reading that , just prior to the " outing " of Plame , Brewster Jennings was responsible for the interception of a shipment of " WMDs " that were being transported to Iraq from along the Turkish border .
It was a black op , the mission of which was to plant WMDs in Iraq to falsely justify the invasion .
When Cheney got wind of the interception , he went ballistic .
THAT'S why , in a second Robert Novak column , Novak outs BREWSTER JENNINGS as the brass plate company within which Plame did her work .
No one seems to want to connect the dots to the Brewster Jennings interception .
Why is that ?

Let 's not forget , that they stole the 2000 election , too .
the stolen 2004 election was a result of the stolen 2000 election , so the 2000 one is worse .
So , we 're in this situation because of election fraud .
BUT ... how good was our system , if we were ONE stolen presidential election away from this ???
What 's the difference WHEN they stole it ?
If we were ONE stolen election away from FASCISM , then this democracy was n't setup good to begin with .
We need to impeach , the Dems need to impeach .
We need to clear up the radio and TV airwaves of propoganda , and we need to have elections in which EVERY SINGLE VOTE COUNTS !
Dems ???
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT ALL OF THIS ???
We need to start seeing people thrown in the slammer for what they did to our country !!!!!!!!!

The 2000 election , Bush was APPOINTED BY THE CROOKED SUPREME COURT AND SCALIA ... who had a conflict of interest in the case .
They overrode the STATE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA , proving that " conservatives " are full of shit , that they believe in STATE RIGHTS over FEDERAL ... another line of " conservative BULLSHIT " ...
The Supreme Court members should be treated like the treasonous criminals they are , and thrown in the slammer !!!

Reply to " Gonnuts " comment # 15 : I have not been reading Kos while sitting in on the trial , because I do n't want to be influenced unduly .
However , my friend Wayne Madsen was actually all over this topic back in 2005 .
See for example http://www.waynemadsenreport.com/2005_july.php: "
The untold story of Rovegate may be whether the White House not only leaked the name of Joseph Wilson 's wife for purely political retaliation but also to close down her and her Brewster Jennings ' team 's work on counter - WMD proliferation .
Some insiders believe that the CIA covert group was getting uncomfortably close to clandestine business deals that would have exposed members of the Bush family and their closest political and business friends . "

Since one juror was removed , over the objection of the prosecutor , from the 12 - person jury , I thought I would discuss it here .
The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in general terms requires a 12 - person jury :
Although a jury composed of as few as six persons is constitutional [ Williams v. Florida , 399 U.S. 78 ( 1970 ) ] , the current requirement in federal criminal trials is that a jury must be composed of twelve persons [ Fed. R. Crim .
P. 23 (a ) ]
Many states likewise require a 12 - person jury in criminal trials .
( §2.01 [ B ] , emphasis added ) .
There is an exception where an 11 - person jury will do :
After the jury has retired to deliberate , the court may permit a jury of 11 persons to return a verdict , even without a stipulation by the parties , if the court finds good cause to excuse a juror .
( Federal Criminal Rule 23 , emphasis added ) .
The key is " good cause " .
If Libby is found not guilty , Fitz would have the right to appeal and try to show that there was no " good cause " to use the 11 - person jury instead of using an alternate juror to bring the total back up to 12 persons .

Yes indeed , the cheney gang committed treason with two goals in mind :
1 ) protect their treasonous gun-running activities in the middle east , and
2 ) make sure it is impossible to get accurate intel on whether Iran has a nuclear weapons program .
One would have to assume from the actions of the neoscum and darth cheney that Plame and her undercover operation were well aware that Iran does not have a weapons program that is bearing any fruit .
She also may have been onto other treason activities of the bush crime family and the larger neocon menace besides gun running to our enemies .
It is indeed difficult to find any " people " on the planet more evil than dumbya , darth , abu gonzales ,

I 'll mention what I 've read and pieced together from others ' speculation .
The prez , v.p. , gonzo and more well known types had sealed - indictments against them over a year ago , Fitz learned some crazy stuff ( including 9/11 , Bush + Clinton crime families , etc. ) .
Some conspiratorial minded folks figure that if Fitz went for it there would suddenly be a major country - wide constitutional crisis exposing too many dirty politicians , or ...
Iran ' does something ' , ( or a terror attack , massive bird flu outbreak , etc. ) would change
All the rules overnight in BigBro 's favour .
A pro-bush friend also recently told me that the Prez stays in power in a declared war , so if enough stuff goes badly for the Admin .

Let 's not forget that according to Wilson 's book , it was the Washington Post reporter Walter Pincus who warned Wilson that the NY Times was about to out him as a result of inquiries about Kristof 's article .
It 's not hard to speculate that Judy may have been the one charged by the Times with crafting the never written hit piece .
Whatever she was meeting Scooter about ended up not seeing the light of day .
Could that have been related to Wilson 's decision to effectively out himself ?
Keller may not have known at that time that Wilson already had a standing invite to write his op - ed , which he initially took a pass on when the chance was offered .
Did Keller know what Judy was working on ?
After Pincus ' advice to Wilson , Wilson called his contact and the op - ed piece ran .
The rest is history .

No , a prosecutor can NEVER appeal an acquittal , only PRE - TRIAL motions related to evidence and charges ( and maybe other issues that do n't come to mind right now ) .
On the other hand , if Libby is convicted HIS attorney can claim the use of an 11 person jury denied him his rights .

WASHINGTON
NOBODY will quibble with President Bush ’s line Wednesday night that in Iraq , “ Victory will not look like the ones our fathers and grandfathers achieved ; there will be no surrender ceremony on the deck of a battleship . ”
Of course , that calls to mind his victory landing on the deck of the carrier Abraham Lincoln off the coast of California in May 2003 , which he followed with a speech declaring that , “ in the battle of Iraq , the United States and our allies have prevailed . ”
But let ’s not digress .
Mr. Bush has now scaled back his strategy for victory to a strategy for the best - we - can - hope - for .
So , it must be asked , what exactly is the best we can hope for ?
“ In the best - case scenario , we ’ll be in Iraq for 15 or 20 years , ” said Stephen Biddle , author of “ Military Power : Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle . ”
He offers the example of the Balkans , where everyone seems to have forgotten about the United States troops who have been there for years , helping keep a peace brokered in Dayton , Ohio , in 1995 .
定年退職した人たちが老後も生き生きと働ける社会は、高齢者と若者がガチで競争する社会のような気がするのは、僕だけか？
弾さんや分裂勘違い君劇場などが高齢者と若者について色々と書いているので、ちょっと違った視点から書いてみる。
先日、とある零細企業のホームページを作るための営業に行った。その社長さんの知り合いが、何でも.NETに対応しているショッピングモール付きのホームページを何と5万円で作ってもらったらしいよ、なんてことを嬉々と話していた。そのホームぺージを見てみると、確かに5万円とは思えないくらい、動的な言語でちゃんと実装されていて、ショッピングもちゃんとできたりする。その上、週に1度担当者がその会社に来て、メンテナンスやサポートもやってくれるらしい。これが、5万円。価格崩壊もいいところだなと、その制作会社を呪ったものだ。
もちろん、その社長さんはそういった事例を見ているので、「これくらいのホームページが5万円でできるのか」なんてことを思ってしまっている。そりゃあ、価格交渉も厳しくなる。
さて、では作ったのは誰かというのが、もちろん疑問に沸く。で、社長さんに聞いたところによると、何でも某大手システム開発会社を定年退職した高齢者が、暇つぶし程度に開発したものらしいのだ。もちろん、その人は年金だってもらっているだろうし、何より時間もある。5万円という金額を考えれば、単なる小遣い稼ぎという認識なのだろう。
これは稀有な事例なのかもしれない。しかし、僕の周りには高齢者でパソコンに詳しい人たちが、高齢者や主婦向けのパソコン教室を開いているということもある。私たちの商圏とは被っていないので、今のところ競争状態にはなっていないが、その人たちの商圏と被っている既存のパソコン教室から見れば、脅威だろう。
なぜか。圧倒的に価格が安いからだ。例えば既存のパソコン教室が2000円／1時間くらいだとすると、高齢者が主催するパソコン教室は500円／1時間くらいなのだ。
パソコン教室を趣味でやっているから、特段儲ける必要はない。だから、価格を低く抑えられる。パソコン教室なんて、教えることにそんな大差はないわけだから、価格が安いほうが絶対的に有利に立てる。
そんな事例をフツフツと思い出すと、最近流行の言葉、「生涯現役社会」というものにたまに疑問が沸く。もちろん、定年退職しようが自由に働く権利は認められるべきなんだろうけれど、僕たちみたいな世代は自分が食っていかないといけないから、それなりの対価を要求して事業を行う。しかし、高齢者は十分な年金を持っているので、そもそも儲ける必要がない。だから、価格をグッと低く抑えてくる。それで、競争しようということになる。何とも不条理な競争であるという気がするのだ。
もちろん、高齢者は黙ってゴルフでも旅行でもやっていればいいだろ！というのは、暴論であるのは分かっている。働くのは権利であるわけだから。ただ、この競争を打ち勝つためには、高齢者では持てないような新しい知識、技術、情報を常に武装していかなければならないことを思うと、ちょっとしんどいなと思うのである。
Coming from the .
Net world , I have many projects I have to support that require my machine to have IIS ( Internet Information Server ) installed .
Though Seaside is now my preferred development environment , and Apache my preferred web server , they need to all co-exist for me to do my job .
Seaside 's web server is n't built for handling the kind of load Apache and IIS are capable of , and there 's a lot of things a web site needs to serve up besides dynamic pages .
Offloading all the static content , images , Javascript , CSS , HTML , zip files , and any other large downloads , is handled much better by a battle tested web server like Apache or IIS .
So the question arises , why use Apache at all , why not just use IIS ?
The answer is quite simple , IIS sucks for anything but using ASP .
Net ; it 's not a pluggable web server like Apache is .
When I first started using Seaside , I tried to get IIS to reverse proxy for me , it was a no go , I 'd have to write code .
Reverse proxying is n't something IIS can do out of the box , yet it 's a simple configuration change in Apache .
Apache has far more capabilities as a web server , than IIS does , or ever will .
So I bit the bullet and learned how to use Apache , and I 'm glad I did , it 's an awesome web server .
Problem is , web servers want to run on port 80 , so which one gets to own that ?
You'd think that you could easily run them both on port 80 , and bind them to different IP addresses .
In fact , this is possible , but it 's a royal pain in the ass to accomplish , because IIS is n't well behaved and grabs onto whatever port it 's running on , on every address on the machine , even when it is n't configured to do so , preventing Apache from being able to bind .
There are instructions out there , on getting IIS to behave , but I gave up , it was n't worth the effort .
Apache on the other hand , behaves perfectly , and does exactly what you tell it to do .
Apache also supports reverse proxying out of the box .
Given these options , I decide to run Apache as my primary web server on port 80 , and run both IIS and Squeak on other ports and use Apache to simply reverse proxy to them both .
This configuration works great .
I went into my IIS sites in Internet Service Manager , changed each site to bind to port 81 instead .
In Apache , you 'll need to edit the httpd.conf ( equivalent of Internet Service Manager ) and bind to the local address on 80 ...
Listen 127.0.0.1:80
Uncomment the following ( I think they already are , but do n't recall ) ...
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
Enable virtual hosting ...
NameVirtualHost *:80
And then create a virtual host , this is where all the magic happens
< VirtualHost *:80 > ServerName localhost #bind hostname , could be onsmalltalk.com for example RewriteEngine
On #enable url rewriting ProxyVia Block #enable reverse proxy ProxyPreserveHost
On #make proxy rewrite urls in the output # for each .
Net app , add a rewrite rule to intercept and proxy it RewriteRule ^/ DotNetApp ( . * ) $
http://localhost:81/DotNetApp/$ 1 [ P , L ] #only allow Seaside rewrite rule to fire , when request does n't match an existing file RewriteCond C:/ Inetpub / websites / %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f # if no file was found , proxy the request to Seaside RewriteRule ^/(.* ) $
http://localhost:3001/$ 1 [ P , L ] </VirtualHost >
Which looks much simpler without all the comments
< VirtualHost *:80 > ServerName localhost RewriteEngine On ProxyVia Block ProxyPreserveHost On RewriteRule ^/DotNetApp (. * ) $
http://localhost:81/DotNetApp/$1 [ P,L ] RewriteCond C:/ Inetpub / websites /%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^/(.* ) $
http://localhost:3001/$ 1 [ P , L ] </VirtualHost >
And that 's it .
Apache now acts as the front end , enabling the seamless appearance of running all the web servers on port 80 .
Visual Studio fires up and binds to .
Net web sites without a hiccup , none the wiser that Apache is proxying the request .
Mod rewrite now allows me to pick , based upon anything in the URL , which web server needs to handle the request .
.
Net sites run great , Apache handles all the static content , and Squeak only receives requests for dynamic page generation .
Apache can also handle all the SSL requirements , certs , and leave Squeak blissfully unaware that the client is connecting through HTTPS .
I use essentially the same setup in production .
Roger Annies advised people how to reduce their junk mail
Residents ' reaction
Roger Annies composed and circulated a leaflet about the Royal Mail 's opt - out clause for unsolicited mail during his rounds in Barry , south Wales .
Residents are said to be annoyed at their postman 's suspension .
A Royal Mail spokeswoman confirmed that a postman employed in Barry was being investigated for " alleged misconduct " .
Mr Annies ' leaflet read : " As you will have certainly already noticed , your postman is not only delivering your mail ; he / she also has to deliver some ( anonymous ) advertising material called door - to - door items .
" For the near future , Royal Mail plans to increase your advertising mail .
This will mean a lot more unwanted post in your letterbox .
TO STOP JUNK MAIL , CONTACT : Unaddressed mail - Opt-Outs , Royal Mail , Kingsmead House , Oxpens Road , Oxford , OX1 1RX Addressed mail - Mail Preference Service ( MPS ) , Freepost 29 , LON 20771 , London , W1E 0ZT or call 0845 703 4599 Source : Postwatch
" If you complete the slip below and send it to the Royal Mail delivery office , you should not get any of the above - mentioned unwanted advertising . "
People who were receiving Mr Annies ' leaflets say they are in favour of his actions .
Anthony Vaughan , 64 , of Churchfields , Barry , said : " I 'm fed up with junk mail .
For every letter you receive , you have to put another 14 in the dustbin .
" God knows what businesses think about the amount of junk mail delivered to them .
" I thought it was a good idea and I was going to complete the form that he had delivered .
" Roger was just letting us know what Royal Mail should have told us in the first place .
I do n't agree with the suspension at all .
It 's ridiculous . "
' Environmental damage '
Father - of - two Mr Annies would not comment about his suspension while it is still under investigation .
Councillor Robert Curtis , who represents the Gibbonsdown ward on the east side of Barry , said : " The service mentioned by the postman is something that I was going to feature in my next newsletter so he has beat me to it .
" Millions of pounds are wasted on leaflets and the environmental damage that does is massive and it is just not needed .
" If we could stop junk mail at the origin we would certainly save councils a lot of money and prevent a lot of environmental damage .
" I suspect the postman should have got permission from his management but I support what he was doing as a principle . "
If we could stop junk mail at the origin we would certainly save councils a lot of money and prevent a lot of environmental damage
Councillor Robert Curtis
A spokesman for the Royal Mail confirmed that a postman has been given a " precautionary suspension " pending further investigations .
He said Royal Mail delivered less than a quarter of the UK 's unaddressed mail - officially known as " Door to Door items " - and that " if we do not deliver this mail then rival companies will . "
He added : " Royal Mail 's future depends on competing effectively in all parts of the market and that includes unaddressed mail , a service which is used by a great many firms and people , whose businesses depend on it . "
Profitable service
A Royal Mail spokesman also told the BBC that its code of conduct processes were " long established " .
He said : " Royal Mail has a long association with the unions and we work our way through these processes very carefully .
" We make money through direct mail by senders paying for their addressed mail to be delivered , or through having a contract with senders who post unaddressed mail , such as local government information or local takeaways . "
Bob Gibson , of the Communication Workers Union ( CWU ) said : " The CWU recognises the strategic importance of Door to Door in what is a financially lucrative and expanding market .
" We are already in negotiations with Royal Mail to conclude an agreement that will enable the number of weekly Door to Door contracts to be increased , whilst at the same time ensuring that all operational and health and safety requirements are in place and our members receive improved remuneration and longer term job protection . "
Your comments :
Roger Annies has done a great public service .
I was unaware of the financial incentive for Royal Mail to deliver unwanted mail through my letter box , nor how to stop it .
I do now , and will be able to act accordingly .
Tim Jones , Cornwall
According to Royal Mail , us mere consumers account for only 10 % of the market .
But business to consumer is 60 % .
Does n't take a genius to figure out they will focus and pander to the junk senders .
However if Royal Mail sacks him , Mr Annies should fight for unfair dismissal - it 's public domain information after all .
Flynn , London , UK
99 % of people are going to support this postie , junk mail is a pain and is largely unwelcome .
I 'm glad he did it , as this news story has effectively told me how to opt out of receiving some of this junk .
Personally I would like to see the Royal Mail be allowed to increase the price of a 1st class stamp by 10 p to increase their profitability , as I think even at 40 p a pop the 1st class letter service would be an absolute bargain , and perhaps then they would n't need to distibute colossal amounts of ( what ends up as ) waste paper .
Dave , Yeovil , Somerset
What really disturbs me about this story is not the Royal Mails bully boy tactics with the postman concerned ( hardly unexpected ) but the Unions attitude - quite happy to collaborate in RMs mission to bombard us with more junk mail so long as their members get a satisfactory back - hander .
Mr Annies should be applauded for actually putting his customers first , a rare talent these days .
Mike Honeyman , Northwich , England
I 'd be very happy if someone had informed me of ways to end the endless torrent of junk mail that comes through my door .
For him to be suspended is almost like saying the Royal Mail could challenge me if I told all my friends how to ban the junk .
Does the Queen get bothered by all this " Royal " Mail rubbish ?
Jason Lucas , Doncaster , England
I registered with the Mail Preference Service to cut out all the junk mail I was receiving .
That worked for a while but does n't seem to have any effect on what the leaflets the Royal Mail deliver .
Mine goes straight in the re-cycle bin - unread .
David Marshall , Huddersfield , UK
What does this mean for the charges to remove rubbish ?
Not only do we have to receive this postal garbage , but then we 'll also have to pay to dispose of it !
Someone tell me how to get out of receiving this ?!
I 'll pass on the info to everyone I meet !
Thanks to this conciencious postman for this very useful info .
Simon Fleming , Durham , Co. Durham .
It is so demoralising to open the door when you get home from work and find the doormat covered in junk mail which has to go straight in the bin .
It makes me feel annoyed and powerless .
I wholeheartedly support Roger Annies .

About the emulator
This emulator began in 2002 , as a personal project I started with the single aim of improving my Flash Actionscript skills .
As with any good personal project , you need a focal point , and mine was the Speak N Spell .
I 'd just bought one off Ebay , to go with the rest of my retro toys , and more importantly , I stumbled across a full set of sound files ' blown ' or sampled from a Speak N Spell .
I thought it'd be cool to create an emulator using the sound files , and since I 'd been working with Flash for a while , including being part of the beta test teams , it seemed like a good mix of idea and execution to improve my knowledge of Flash .
At the same time , I was on a Freehand ( R.I.P. ) beta too , so all the artwork was done using a pre-release version of Freehand ( note the bevelling around the red plastic ?
My first use of filters in Freehand ) .
Again , having a focus and goal makes it easier to set about with your software tools .
Unfortunately , my real Speak N Spell did n't work , so I did n't know the correct series of events or how the machine worked exactly , so I improvised , hence only one ' mode ' working .
I also wo n't be fixing anything or improving the Speak N Spell , as my time with Flash has passed .
I do have a full Speak N Maths drawn up and originally planned to do that too ... but no , I 'm leaving this page online so people can still enjoy Speak N Spell .
Have fun , enjoy , share .

I was reading John Hammond ’s biography entry , ( John discovered Bob Dylan , Aretha Franklin , Bruce Springsteen and yes , Count Basie ) and I noticed that he was independently wealthy .
Woz was n’t looking to make a lot of money when he invented the Apple computer , and Nolan Bushnell certainly did n’t imagine he was creating the video game industry when he invented Pong .
Cory and the rest of the boingboing team had no revenue for years , and Digg and Yahoo !
and dozens of other key websites were started without an eye on profit , never mind revenue .
The same thing is true for Julia Child and Gene Roddenberry and Dean Kamen .
In fact , the more I think about it , the more it seems that pioneers are almost never in it for the money .
The smart ones figure out how to take a remarkable innovation and turn it into a living ( or a bigger than big payout ) but not the other way around .
I think the reason is pretty obvious : when you try to make a profit from your innovation , you stop innovating too soon .
You take the short payout because it ’s too hard to stick around for the later one .
Irony # 1 is that business journalists always ask pioneers about the money .
And then they are incredulous when they hear the answer .
They make up bogus numbers or just assume the pioneer is lying .
They do n’t see the trend .
The second irony is that people who want to join the pioneers are often focused on a steady paycheck and juicy options … they would probably be better off seeking the edgiest thing they can find , run by the most devoted visionary .
The importance of that first job for future success also means that graduates remain highly dependent on the random fluctuations of the economy , which can play a crucial role in the quality of jobs available when they get out of school .
That is good news for this year 's graduates , who are entering the work force with the economy growing , but rather disturbing for recent graduates who were driven by recession into taking less - than - ideal first jobs and are now aiming to work their way up .
Consider the evidence uncovered by Paul Oyer , a Stanford Business School economist , in his recent paper , " The Making of an Investment Banker : Macroeconomic Shocks , Career Choice and Lifetime Income " ( National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 12059 , February 2006 .
http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/oyer/wp/mba.pdf).
Dr. Oyer tracked the careers of Stanford Business School graduates in the classes of 1960 to 1997 .
He found that the performance of the stock market in the two years the students were in business school played a major role in whether they took an investment banking job upon graduating and , because such jobs pay extremely well , upon the average salary of the class .
That is no surprise .
The startling thing about the data was his finding that the relative income differences among classes remained , even as much as 20 years later .
The Stanford class of 1988 , for example , entered the job market just after the market crash of 1987 .
Banks were not hiring , and so average wages for that class were lower than for the class of 1987 or for later classes that came out after the market recovered .
Even a decade or more later , the class of 1988 was still earning significantly less .
They missed the plum jobs right out of the gate and never recovered .
And as economists have looked at the economy of the last two decades , they have found that Dr. Oyer 's findings hold for more than just high - end M.B.A. students on Wall Street .
They are also true for college students .
A recent study , by the economists Philip Oreopoulos , Till Von Wachter and Andrew Heisz , " The Short - and Long - Term Career Effects of Graduating in a Recession " ( National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 12159 , April 2006 .
http://www.columbia.edu/~vw2112/papers/nber_draft_1.pdf), finds that the setback in earnings for college students who graduate in a recession stays with them for the next 10 years .
You may remember back to a simpler time when the SAT dealt with math , science , and analogies , not with Google searches and Wikipedia .
But as information and communication technology ( ICT ) have become crucial student skills in the last decade , organizations like the Educational Testing Service ( the group behind the SAT ) have created material to judge student performance in these new areas .
ETS has developed an ICT Literacy Assessment ( test a demo version ) that gives students short tasks ( 3 - 5 minutes , testing one particular skill ) and long tasks ( 15 minutes , testing skills in combination ) to complete on a computer .
These include things like sifting through e-mail and developing accurate search queries for academic databases , along with other , more business - related projects .
Another group , the National Forum on Information Literacy , has just announced the creation of an " ICT Literary Policy Council " that will review the ETS exam and issue recommendations for " cut points . "
These will be used to map exam scores to achievement levels , so that educators can determine " which students are proficient and which may need additional ICT literacy instruction or remediation . "
The local level
While having such national standards may be a boon for businesses and schools that want to know how to interpret the test scores , they are still under development .
What does a teacher today do if he wants to measure students '
IT literacy in an educational setting ?
Michael Lorenzen , a Michigan librarian , had his students visit an eclectic mix of websites and asked them to determine whether each was legitimate or not , and if so , whether it made a good source for information .
What he found was exactly what you might suspect : just because students have been exposed to the Internet for most of their lives does not make them magically able to discern the quality of Internet sources .
" The students had mixed success , " he says .
" They correctly identified the whale watching , shards of glass , male pregnancy , and tree octopus sites as being hoaxes .
They correctly identified the Texas independence and the human extinction movement as real .
They mistakenly labeled the Hawaiian and West Florida independence sites as hoaxes .
They also believed the Fredericton site [ a fake town ] and the Feorran site [ a fake language ] were real . "
One social science professor that we spoke with confirmed that properly evaluating and using sources remains a challenge even for college students , who might have been thought to have mastered the skill .
This professor instructed students in the importance of using scholarly sources in research papers .
He went so far as to show video clips from The Colbert Report which highlighted the fact that sites like Wikipedia were not reliable places for getting information on ( for instance ) elections in Estonia .
Nevertheless , upon grading these papers last week , the professor found that not one but three students had cited Wikipedia , and another quoted the Encyclopedia Britannica .
Will national , standardized exams help to solve such problems ?
If the exam is a fair metric of what students know , it can be used by educators and businesses to identify people who need a bit more ICT knowledge and give them extra assistance .
A more likely scenario , especially in business , will be the use of such exams to weed out job candidates , which could make an exam like the ICT Literacy Assessment as important for finding a white - collar job as the SAT currently is for getting into college .
When Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12 - step programs are examined in controlled studies , a new review reports , scientists find no proof that they are superior to any other intervention in reducing alcohol dependence or alcohol - related problems .
The researchers , led by Marica Ferri of the Italian Agency for Public Health in Rome , found little to suggest that 12 - step programs reduced the severity of addiction any more than any other intervention .
And no data showed that 12 - step interventions were any more — or any less — successful in increasing the number of people who stayed in treatment or reducing the number who relapsed after being sober .
Alcoholics Anonymous is a self - help group that offers emotional support for alcohol abstinence and holds that alcoholism is a spiritual and a medical disease .
In some of the studies reviewed , A.A. was compared with other psychological treatments including cognitive - behavioral therapy , which encourages the conscious identification of high - risk situations for alcohol use ; motivational enhancement therapy , based on principles of social and cognitive psychology ; and relapse prevention therapy , a variation on the cognitive - behavioral approach .
It was also compared with other spiritual and nonspiritual 12 - step programs .
AT FIRST glance , the prospect of a drought in England seems about as likely as that of floods in the Sahara .
But the popular perception of Britain as a uniformly dank and sodden island is misleading .
The south of the country gets the same amount of rain as parts of Syria , and London is a drier city than Dallas or Istanbul .
Recently , the skies have been unusually clear .
Months of below - average rainfall ( see map ) have raised the prospect of a summer drought — the worst for decades in parts of the south - east .
Elliot Morley , an environment minister , warned last week of standpipes in the streets .
Ministers ( and water companies ) are again encouraging everyone to use less water .
Despite the sometimes unsavoury nature of the advice offered — Britons have , in the past , been encouraged to refrain from flushing toilets — such exhortations do seem to work : Thames Water , which supplies London and large parts of southern England , reckons that a publicity campaign last year caused a 4 % fall in demand .
Economists argue that the best way to encourage people to be more frugal would be to price water properly .
Domestic use accounts for 70 % of the total , but the price that most consumers pay for water — unlike gas or electricity — bears no relation to how much they use .
Instead , costs are fixed according to the value of a house , encouraging over - consumption .
OFWAT , the industry economic regulator , water companies and government have all tried to persuade people to install water meters , mainly by holding out the prospect of lower bills .
But the heaviest users , who would end up paying more , have every reason not to switch .
“ Everyone has always regarded water as a free good , ” says Barbara Young , the head of the Environment Agency .
Because of that , officials have been reluctant to impose meters on an unwilling population , although there are powers to do so in an emergency ( something that Folkestone and Dover Water , one of the worst - affected companies , is trying to do ) .
They are fitted automatically to new homes and can be forced on people when they move house , but take - up has been slow .
OFWAT reckons that only around a quarter of homes use metered water .
There are problems on the supply side too .
Many blame the water companies for not fixing leaky pipes .
These are a big problem , especially in London , where parts of the infrastructure are over 150 years old .
Thames
Water , which supplies the capital , reckons a third of the water it pumps into the system soaks away into the ground .
Part of the problem is that OFWAT , with its duty to keep prices low , is reluctant to approve the price rises needed to fund a proper replacement programme — although Thames plans to spend £ 1 billion over the next five years patching up and replacing the worst bits of its network .
Frustratingly , none of these worries are new .
One of New Labour 's first acts after taking office in 1997 was a water summit , chaired by John Prescott , the deputy prime minister , to crack down on leakage and encourage efficient use in the face of rising demand .
But progress has been glacial .
A voluntary water - efficiency code for housebuilders is only now out for consultation , and Mr Prescott 's plans to build half a million new homes in the driest bit of the country have raised eyebrows .
Many water firms plan to build new reservoirs , but that will take several years .
In the short run , not much can be done .
The rune - readers at the Met Office , Britain 's weather - forecasting centre , predict a cold , dry February .
Even if the rains return later in the year , they will not help much : greater evaporation and thirstier plants mean that little summer rain makes it into rivers or aquifers .
But if a drought persuades officials and users to change some lazy old habits , it may be no bad thing .

Much of the used computer equipment sent from the United States to developing countries for use in homes , schools and businesses is often neither usable nor repairable , creating enormous environmental problems in some of the world 's poorest places , according to a report to be issued today by an environmental organization .
The report , titled " The Digital Dump : Exporting Reuse and Abuse to Africa , " says that the unusable equipment is being donated or sold to developing nations by recycling businesses in the United States as a way to dodge the expense of having to recycle it properly .
While the report , written by the Basel Action Network , based in Seattle , focuses on Nigeria , in western Africa , it says the situation is similar throughout much of the developing world .
" Too often , justifications of ' building bridges over the digital divide ' are used as excuses to obscure and ignore the fact that these bridges double as toxic waste pipelines , " says the report .
As a result , Nigeria and other developing nations are carrying a disproportionate burden of the world 's toxic waste from technology products , according to Jim Puckett , coordinator of the group .
According to the National Safety Council , more than 63 million computers in the United States will become obsolete in 2005 .
An average computer monitor can contain as much as eight pounds of lead , along with plastics laden with flame retardants and cadmium , all of which can be harmful to the environment and to humans .
Among extraordinary details due to emerge in the report by former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Stevens is the revelation that the US security service was bugging her calls in the hours before she was killed in a car crash in Paris .
In a move that raises fresh questions over transatlantic agreements on intelligence - sharing , the surveillance arm of the US has admitted listening to her conversations as she stayed at the Ritz hotel , but failed to notify MI6 .
Stevens is understood to have been assured that the 39 classified documents detailing Diana 's final conversations did not reveal anything sinister or contain material that might help explain her death .
Scotland Yard 's inquiry , published this Thursday , also throws up further intelligence links with the Princess of Wales on the night she died .
The driver of the Mercedes , Henri Paul , was in the pay of the French equivalent of M15 .
Stevens traced £ 100,000 he had amassed in 14 French bank accounts though no payments have been linked to Diana 's death .
Stevens 's conclusion is that Diana , her companion Dodi Fayed , and Paul himself died in an accident caused by Paul driving too fast through the Pont de l'Alma underpass in Paris while under the influence of drink .
The car was being pursued by photographers at the time .
Tests have confirmed that Paul was more than three times over the French drink - drive limit and was travelling at ' excessive ' speed .
The inquiry will quash a number of conspiracy theories that have circulated since 31 August 1997 , among them that Diana was pregnant .
It also found no evidence that the princess was planning to get engaged to Dodi , son of Mohamed Fayed .
The Harrods tycoon believes that Paul 's blood samples were swapped to portray him as a drunk in an elaborate cover - up by the establishment to stop Diana marrying Dodi , a Muslim .
Stevens is expected to concede that while there was a mix - up it was an accident and that the original French post - mortem which found that Paul was three - times over the French drink - drive limit was correct .
He is also expected to discount the role of the white Fiat Uno which struck Diana 's car shortly before the crash , even though British police officers have failed to track down the vehicle which left paintwork on the black Mercedes .
The inquiry will support the findings of the original French accident inquiry in criticising the paparazzi as a possible reason for encouraging Paul to speed .
The ' bright light ' theory - the claim that the driver was deliberately blinded by a beam immediately before the crash - is also dismissed by Stevens .
77 Million Paintings by Brian Eno
I 'm about to show you nine pictures created by Brian Eno which even he has not yet seen .
His latest project is ' 77 Million Paintings ' , a computer program for Windows or Mac that installs from DVD and creates paintings and music .
By combining and layering Eno's hand - made slides , the package is claimed to generate 77 million different artworks automatically .
Paintings continuously transform and change as new slides fade in and others fade away .
It 's like ambient music for the eyes .
I 'm guessing that a fair number of the 77 million paintings are almost indistinguishable , differing only slightly in colour or fade levels .
That 's not to say that there are n't plenty of images : even though one design motif has repeated in the time I 've been using the software , I have n't noticed any similar ' paintings ' .
You 're extremely unlikely to see anything that closely resembles the following pictures anywhere else .
The paintings are accompanied by a generative music soundtrack .
That means Eno 's set the parameters for the music , but the computer works within those to recreate a new performance each time .
There are no beats , and there 's no elaborate melody : just sounds to immerse yourself in .
If you 're familiar with Brian Eno 's ambient music CDs , you 'll be at home listening to this DVD .
The sound quality is a massive step up from Eno 's previous generative music release ' Generative Music 1 ' , probably because PC audio has moved on massively in the last ten years .
You 'll need to set aside 3GB of hard disk space to accommodate 77 Million Paintings .
Although , if you think of it as 42 bytes per picture , it seems a bargain .
There are only a couple of quibbles : the biggest is that there 's no facility to have the software kick in as a screensaver .
That 's a massive oversight .
It would be fantastic if idle PCs could turn themselves into ambient artworks , instead of somebody having to switch the art on .
There 's no built - in way to export images either , although you can hit print screen , use ALT + TAB to get the desktop back and then paste the screengrab into your favourite image editor .
This might be a deliberate omission , since the software is defined by how the images mutate and the sheer number of variations there are .
You could n't hope to catch them all , so perhaps you should just let them all float by .
There will be another goodie along in a minute .
If you do capture the images , Eno is making them available for non-commercial use , provided that the source is credited .
Eno said : " I think of these things as visual music .
The screen is not being used to tell a story - which is what screens normally do - but to show a painting that changes all the time ...
People now have larger screens , but these big objects sitting in their rooms are dormant for a lot of the time .
If you 're not actually watching television , what you have is a big black hole in the wall .
77 Million Paintings is intended to occupy that downtime so that , instead of having a dead hole in the wall , you have a living picture . "
' 77 Million Paintings ' poses interesting questions about what 's an original artwork , giving everyone access to the same opportunity to view art , while ensuring everyone has a unique viewing experience .
Most importantly , it 's intriguing and fun .
You can unwind by watching the soothing transitions and listening to the music .
Or you can just leave it running in the corner of the room , and be enchanted or delighted when you happen to glance at the screen .
Footnote
' 77 Million Paintings ' was produced in a numbered limited edition of 10,000 available at Amazon.co.uk among other places .
That edition has sold out , but there was a new 2007 edition .
As of April 2020 , it looks like both are out of print but still available through third party sellers on Amazon .
Update 2020
I wanted to try putting 77 Million Paintings on a laptop so I could run it on a TV screen easily .
The laptop did n't have a CD drive , but I found that you can copy the files from the DVD disc to the hard disk ( over a network , or using a USB key as an intermediary ) and then run the setup program as normal to install the software .
It 's working fine for me on Windows 10 .
The software says it requires a minimum resolution of 1024x768 but actually fails to work at higher resolutions .
Changing the resolution to 1024x768 got it working for me .
I now have a Brian Eno installation in my living room , on the biggest screen in the house !
For the next six weeks , Silka and roughly a dozen other senior personnel manned the parking - lot entrance , handing out bottles of Purell to the arriving doctors .
They started a Hand Hygiene Safety Posse that roamed the wards and let it be known that this posse preferred using carrots to sticks : rather than searching for doctors who were n’t compliant , they ’d try to “ catch ” a doctor who was washing up , giving him a $ 10 Starbucks card as reward .
You might think that the highest earners in a hospital would n’t much care about a $ 10 incentive — “ but none of them turned down the card , ” Silka says .
When the nurse spies reported back the latest data , it was clear that the hospital ’s efforts were working — but not nearly enough .
Compliance had risen to about 80 percent from 65 percent , but the Joint Commission required 90 percent compliance .
These results were delivered to the hospital ’s leadership by Rekha Murthy , the hospital ’s epidemiologist , during a meeting of the Chief of Staff Advisory Committee .
The committee ’s roughly 20 members , mostly top doctors , were openly discouraged by Murthy ’s report .
Then , after they finished their lunch , Murthy handed each of them an agar plate — a sterile petri dish loaded with a spongy layer of agar .
“ I would love to culture your hand , ” she told them .
They pressed their palms into the plates , and Murthy sent them to the lab to be cultured and photographed .
The resulting images , Silka says , “ were disgusting and striking , with gobs of colonies of bacteria . ”
The administration then decided to harness the power of such a disgusting image .
One photograph was made into a screen saver that haunted every computer in Cedars - Sinai .
Whatever reasons the doctors may have had for not complying in the past , they vanished in the face of such vivid evidence .
“ With people who have been in practice 25 or 30 or 40 years , it ’s hard to change their behavior , ” Leon Bender says .
“ But when you present them with good data , they change their behavior very rapidly . ”
Some forms of data , of course , are more compelling than others , and in this case an image was worth 1,000 statistical tables .
Hand - hygiene compliance shot up to nearly 100 percent and , according to the hospital , it has pretty much remained there ever since .
Cedars - Sinai ’s clever application of incentives is certainly encouraging to anyone who opposes the wanton proliferation of bacterial infections .
But it also highlights how much effort can be required to solve a simple problem — and , in this case , the problem is but one of many .
Craig Feied , a physician and technologist in Washington who is designing a federally financed “ hospital of the future , ” says that hand hygiene , while important , will never be sufficient to stop the spread of bacteria .
That ’s why he is working with a technology company that infuses hospital equipment with silver ion particles , which serve as an antimicrobial shield .
Microbes can thrive on just about any surface in a hospital room , Feied notes , citing an old National Institutes of Health campaign to promote hand - washing in pediatric wards .
The campaign used a stuffed teddy bear , called T. Bear , as a promotional giveaway .
Kids and doctors alike apparently loved T. Bear — but they were n’t the only ones .
When , after a week , a few dozen T. Bears were pulled from the wards to be cultured , every one of them was found to have acquired a host of new friends : Staphylococcus aureus , E. coli , Pseudomonas , Klebsiella .. . .
Home Matching Objects With Patterns Matching Objects With Patterns .
Burak Emir , Martin Odersky , and John Williams .
Data in object - oriented programming is organized in a hierarchy of classes .
The problem of object - oriented pattern matching is how to explore this hierarchy from the outside .
This usually involves classifying objects by their run-time type , accessing their members , or determining some other characteristic of a group of objects .
In this paper we compare six different pattern matching techniques : object - oriented decomposition , visitors , type - tests / typecasts , typecase , case classes , and extractors .
The techniques are compared on nine criteria related to conciseness , maintainability and performance .
The paper introduces case classes and extractors as two new pattern - matching methods and shows that their combination works well for all of the established criteria .

You know that feeling ... the awful sensation that you just can't possibly blog about anything .
Nothing inspires you enough .
Everything seems too mundane .
And , the more you think about blogging , the less you are inclined to blog .
What do you do in moments like these ?
Well , reading " 10 Ways To Create Content For Your Weblog " would be a bad idea .
And here is why :
Check your Inbox .
You do this already .
If you have a problem generating content , you have surely exhausted all the possibilities of email .
Start Blog Hopping .
Same objection as above , but worse .
The reason ?
If you read other people 's blogs for inspiration , you end up blogging about the same thing that other people are blogging about .
That 's not generating content .
That 's spreading existing content a little more thinly by doing exactly the same thing as everybody else .
This is a highly unimaginative thing to do , it dilutes and cheapens the overall quality of the blogosphere , and EVERYBODY ALREADY DOES IT ANYWAY .
Comment in Your Own Blog .
Mmm , this one comes with all the same objections as # 1 , but not only that , it 's narcissistic !
Also , this does n't actually generate new content .
It generates comments on old content .
Read , Listen To , or Watch the News .
Good idea , but make sure you read a neutral news source .
American news networks , and I say this in all honesty , are sensationalist , distort facts and , in the words of a famous man , are hurting America .
Read the BBC .
The BBC is legally required to present neutral , balanced coverage , and gets into trouble with the UK government if it does n't .
Read a neutral news source and FORM YOUR OWN OPINION instead of buying what the networks are telling you about everybody being about to die .
Give Memes or Collaborations a Go. AAAAAAAAAAAAARGH .
MY BRAIN .
To be more specific : Memes and collaborations are n't content .
Questionnaires , quizzes , " What [ noun ] are you ? " , top tens , top hundreds , collaborations , or indeed anything which loads of other people are doing : THESE DO NOT CONSTITUTE CONTENT .
They are the PRECISE OPPOSITE of content .
They are mindless , witless FILLER .
They contain zero originality .
They TAKE UP SPACE AND NOTHING MORE .
YOU ARE BETTER OFF LEAVING YOUR BLOG BLANK THAN ADDING STUFF LIKE THIS .
I AM TOTALLY SERIOUS .
Create Lists .
NO , NO , NO , NO , NO , NO , NO , NO , NO .
Once again : this is n't content .
This is anti-content .
This is a horrible , unimaginative , vacant , stultifyingly pointless activity .
DO NOT MAKE LISTS .
Play Games , Answer Surveys , or Take Quizzes .
GYARGH .
Blog at Random .
One way to do this is to pick up a dictionary or encyclopedia , open to a random page , and then write about a word , phrase or sentence that you find on that particular page ... [ etc . ]
Yeah !
Just write as much as you can on the subject of * opens dictionary at random * " pustule ( n. ) " .
That 's a GREAT way to come up with insightful prose : regimented BSing .
What the hell is this doing here ?
Why not just copy text from Wikipedia ?
Hey , how about we all just bash the keyboard at random for ten minutes and post whatever we come up with ?

But , Dr. Levy wondered , were there long - term effects of believing the stereotypes of aging ?
She found a study that could provide answers , the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement .
The two - decade - long study included 1,157 people , nearly every resident of Oxford , Ohio , who was 50 or older and was not suffering from dementia .
And it had questions about beliefs about aging .
It turned out that people who had more positive views about aging were healthier over time .
They lived an average of 7.6 years longer than those of a similar age who did not hold such views , and even had less hearing loss when their hearing was tested three years after the study began .
The result persisted when the investigators took in account the participants ’ health at the start of the study , as well as their age , gender , and socioeconomic status .
Some like Dr. Suzman were swayed , but Dr. Hodes urges caution .
As provocative as the data may be , he notes , the studies cannot tell for sure what is cause and what is effect .
It may be that people who had negative attitudes about aging somehow knew that they were not really well .
Dr. Hodes confesses that in this case indirect studies may be the best that can be done .
To obtain direct evidence would require randomly assigning some participants to keep hearing negative comments about themselves as they age and others to hear positive things .
“ How ethical would that be ? ” he asks .
If it is true that perceptions of aging affect memory , behavior and health — and many researchers are betting that they do — that may bode well for today ’s middle - age people , Dr. Levy says .
They may not be quite so willing to declare themselves old when they reach their 60’s and beyond and they may be less likely to believe the stereotypes of old age .
Still , Dr. Levy and others say , it can be difficult to resist the pervasive stereotypes of aging .
Many people may accept them without realizing it .
“ Then they become a self - fulfilling prophecy , ” Dr. Levy said .
But not for people like Dr. Butler or Mr. Bialokur , who managed to escape that trap .
Others , too , say they have thrived simply by ignoring the stereotypes .
WASHINGTON
SENATOR JOSEPH R. BIDEN’S characterization of his fellow Democratic presidential contender Senator Barack Obama as “ the first mainstream African - American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice - looking guy ” was so painfully clumsy that it nearly warranted pity .
There are not enough column inches on this page to parse interpretations of each of Mr. Biden ’s chosen adjectives .
But among his string of loaded words , one is so pervasive — and is generally used and viewed so differently by blacks and whites — that it calls out for a national chat , perhaps a national therapy session .
It is amazing that this still requires clarification , but here it is .
Black people get a little testy when white people call them “ articulate . ”
Though it was little noted , on Wednesday President Bush on the Fox News Channel also described Mr. Obama as “ articulate . ”
On any given day , in any number of settings , it is likely to be one of the first things white people warmly remark about Oprah Winfrey ; Richard Parsons , chief executive of Time Warner ; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ; Deval Patrick , the newly elected governor of Massachusetts ; or a recently promoted black colleague at work .
" The world produces about 85 million barrels a day , " Mr. Pickens said .
" That 's where demand is now , too .
And I 've seen forecasts that demand is going to be higher than that by the end of the year . "
What 's more , Mr. Pickens added , pre-Hurricane Katrina refining capacity was already at the breaking point , which is another point that is pretty unarguable .
" Refineries were operating at 96 percent , " he said .
" You can't operate anything at 96 percent .
It 'll start breaking down . "
That last paragraph , though , encapsulates the world view of the peakists : all the easy deals have been done .
One reason refineries are operating at such high capacity is that no new refineries have been built in the United States for some 30 years , which Mr. Simmons believes can be attributed to the shortsightedness of the industry .
" My theory was that if the industry did n't expand like crazy the U.S. would find itself running short of energy . "
It did n't , and we are .
Even more troubling , the pessimists believe that it is going to be increasingly difficult to replace the oil that we 're now using up .
" Let me give you a number that is pretty shocking when you hear it , " Mr. Pickens said .
" The world uses 30 billion barrels of oil a year .
There is no way we 're replacing 30 billion barrels of oil .
Just a million barrels a day is 1,000 wells producing 1,000 barrels .
That 's big . "
How do the economists counter the geologists ' arguments ?
They do n't deny that it is hard to find new oil .
But they believe that whenever tight supplies push up the price of oil , the rising price itself becomes our salvation .
For one thing , higher prices temper demand as people begin to change their energy habits .
( Mr. Pickens believes this as well . )
Surprisingly , this has not yet happened even as gasoline at the pump has more than doubled in the last year or so .
But inevitably , there will come a point when it will change behaviors .
Secondly , they believe higher prices spur innovation .
Oil that could n't be extracted profitably at , say , $ 15 a barrel , can be enormously profitable at $ 60 a barrel .
In the view of Mr. Yergin and his allies , in fact , this is exactly what has been happening .
They point to new oil that is coming out of the Caspian Sea , deepwater drilling in Brazil and the oil sands in northern Alberta as examples .
The 16 million barrels a day of new oil Mr. Yergin expects to see by 2010 , he told me , " is predicated on $ 25 - to - $ 30 oil . "
If oil stays higher than that , then there will be even more investment , and not just in ways to extract oil , but in new refineries and pipelines and other infrastructure .
If you mention this theory to a hard - core peakist like Mr. Simmons , you 'd better be ready for an earful .
" These economists are so smug , " he said derisively .
" All they talk about is the magic of the free market .
They do n't seem to understand that this is incredibly capital intensive . "
Five years after U.S. President George W. Bush launched his “ global war on terrorism ” ( GWOT ) , the world has become more unsafe , more divided , more strife - prone , more paranoid , and ironically , more vulnerable to terrorism .
The Middle East , the globe ’s most volatile region , now seethes with enormous anger , and more violence and conflict than it did before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on New York and Washington .
And South Asia , the political birthplace of the Taliban and al - Qaeda , and home to two nuclear rivals engaged in a half - century - long hot - cold war , remains a cauldron of discontent .
Globally , Bush ’s war has failed to tame , let alone destroy , al - Qaeda .
Not only do its two top leaders , Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri , remain at large , but “ al - Qaedaism ” as an ideology has spread and acquired strength in country after country .
The GWOT , waged by a primarily U.S. - British coalition , has deeply hurt and antagonized millions of Muslims the world over .
It has created rifts within the Western bloc and alienated the United States ’ own allies .
Worst of all , the GWOT ’s greatest manifestation , in Iraq , is regarded by a majority of the U.S. population as a mistake .
A recent poll finds that a third of the U.S. respondents think the terrorists are winning the war on terrorism .
In an earlier survey , 70 percent backed it .
“ The greatest political setback for the U.S. is that GWOT is now widely seen as a figleaf for America ’s imperial project , ” says Achin Vanaik , political scientist and author of several papers on terrorism .
“ American neoconservatives thought they could use GWOT to establish total and lasting U.S. global hegemony , a sort of modern - day Roman Empire which would allow no rival to emerge for decades .
Today , they are looking for an exit strategy . ”
Five years ago , Bush enunciated a new doctrine , arrogating to himself the right to act unilaterally against whatever he defines as “ terrorism . ”
He advocated preemptive attacks .
And he unfurled several banners to rationalize military force : regime change ( or forced removal of “ oppressive ” rulers ) , humanitarian intervention , promotion of democracy , etc .
He also famously stipulated the “ you are either with us or against us ” proposition , erasing the distinction between perpetrators of terrorism and the country where they might be based .
Today , the Bush doctrine is in tatters .
It ’s widely identified as the single most important cause of insecurity and instability in the world .
The three states that Bush named as forming the “ Axis of Evil ” ( Iran , Iraq , and North Korea ) have either emerged more powerful or become greater threats .
Iraq is a bloody mess , fast resembling Vietnam in the late 1960s .
The deaths of over 100,000 Iraqi civilians , a number estimated by the medical journal The Lancet , have produced deep resentments against the occupation , as have the excesses and human rights violations in Fallujah and Abu Ghraib .
Iraq may even be “ disintegrating , ” as U.S. military cables say .
It has certainly become unmanageable .
Five years on , Iran and North Korea have further advanced their nuclear pursuits .
And yet , the U.S. cannot coerce or compel them to fall in line with its demands .
“ The U.S. arrogated to itself overambitious goals , ” says Vanaik .
“ It did n’t describe the 9/11 attacks as a grave crime against humanity , which must be punished .
It described them as the first salvo in a ‘ war , ’ which must be countered by GWOT .
The use of these words was deliberate , not accidental .
In a war , you can act militarily at any time .
You need not wait for an attack on yourself .
And the battleground would now be the whole globe . ”
To wage the GWOT , the U.S. had to bypass and sabotage the United Nations and violate international law .
It did that in 2003 when it discovered it could n’t win a second vote in the UN Security Council , for invading .
This set a terrible example , encouraging lawlessness on the part of key U.S. allies , especially Israel .
Israel intensified its oppression of the Palestinian people by imposing more closures and blockades and immobilizing the Palestinian Authority leadership .
It emulated U.S. unilateralism by declaring it must act alone because there is “ no dialogue partner . ”
It killed the peace process .
Israel stepped up the construction of its illegal “ apartheid wall , ” and withdrew from Gaza only to expand its settlements in the West Bank .
In July , Israel invaded Lebanon .
Israel ’s actions , and U.S. support for them , have generated unprecedented anger and hostility in the Middle East and among the world ’s Muslims .
Like the detention centers at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Abu Ghraib in Iraq , punctuated by Bush ’s ill - conceived references to “ crusades ” and “ infinite justice , ” this ensured a huge propaganda victory for al - Qaeda .
Five years ago , bin Laden ’s claim that the West was engaged in a crusade against Islam convinced very few Muslims .
Today , it finds many supporters .
This claim is n’t far - fetched .
The GWOT targets “ Islamic terrorism ” almost exclusively .
Until recently , of the 36 organizations on the U.S. State Department ’s banned list , 24 were Muslim .
The rest were Basque and Irish separatists and leftist groups .
There were no Christian , Buddhist , or Hindu groups .
The State Department also lists 26 countries whose nationals represent an “ elevated security risk ” to the U.S. Barring North Korea , all are Muslim - majority countries .
This fits into growing anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S.
In a recent poll of 1,007 U.S. citizens , 39 percent said they felt at least some prejudice against Muslims .
The same percentage favored requiring Muslims , including U.S. citizens , to carry a special identification “ as a means of preventing terrorist attacks . ”
About one - third said U.S. Muslims were sympathetic to al - Qaeda , and 22 percent said they would n’t want Muslims as neighbors .
More and more Europeans see themselves as particularly vulnerable to terrorist attacks because of their governments ’ pro-U.S. foreign policy , especially on Iraq and the GWOT .
In Britain , the proportion is 73 percent , according to a poll this week .
The GWOT ’s effects on the Middle East stand further magnified after Israel ’s invasion of Lebanon .
This sharply polarized Arab opinion , turning a majority radically against the U.S. and Israel .
Washington ’s bullying tactics toward Iran have further antagonized Muslims , especially because the U.S. presumes Iran ’s guilt regarding its nuclear program , although it has n’t the slightest intention of giving up its own nuclear arms .
Israel ’s failure to substantially weaken Hezbollah in Lebanon complicates U.S. plans to weaken pro-Iranian forces in the Middle East .
Should it start a military misadventure in Iran , Washington will pay an onerous price .
In South Asia , the early phase of the GWOT dramatically changed strategic - political equations .
Pakistan , which had groomed the Taliban , turned against it .
The war in Afghanistan also strengthened radical Islamist forces in Pakistan ’s border provinces .
The unrest and secessionist violence in the Balochistan region is one long - term effect of this .
The Musharraf government has committed some 70,000 troops to the anti-Taliban fight in the border region of Waziristan , and provided military facilities to the U.S.
But doubts have been raised about its commitment to the fight .
Pakistan is loath to lose its influence in Afghanistan , especially among Pashtuns .
The accord signed last Tuesday between Pakistan and Waziristan ’s tribal leaders will allow pro-Taliban militants to operate more or less freely in the area .
In India , home to the world ’s second - largest Muslim population , terrorist incidents have increased in number and intensity .
Official counter - terrorism operations have also become more indiscriminate .
These are based on the U.S. model of understanding “ Islamic terrorism ” and fighting it by solely military means .
This has produced rights violations and widespread discontent among Muslim youth .
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh implicitly admitted on Tuesday that excesses had been committed .
He said it is “ unfortunate ” that terrorism has resulted in the selective targeting of certain sections of the population .
He advocated “ a proactive policy to ensure that a few individual acts do not result in tarnishing the image of an entire community , and remove any feelings of persecutions and alienation from the minds of the minorities . ”
He also said : “ No innocent person should be harassed in our struggle against terrorism .
If a mistake is made , effective remedial corrective measures must be taken well in time . ”
It is not clear if Singh ’s exhortations will be translated into action .
But it ’s plain that the U.S. war on terrorism , so long as it continues , will impede a transition to a sensible , rational , effective , and humane counter - terrorism strategy .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 28 — A bipartisan Congressional report documents hundreds of contacts between White House officials and the corrupt lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his partners , including at least 10 direct contacts between Mr. Abramoff and Karl Rove , the president ’s chief political strategist .
The House Government Reform Committee report , based on e-mail messages and other records subpoenaed from Mr. Abramoff ’s lobbying firm , found 485 contacts between Mr. Abramoff ’s lobbying team and White House officials from 2001 to 2004 , including 82 with Mr. Rove ’s office .
The lobbyists spent almost $ 25,000 in meals and drinks for the White House officials and provided them with tickets to numerous sporting events and concerts , according to the report , scheduled for release Friday .
The authors of the report said it was generally unclear from available records whether the aides reimbursed Mr. Abramoff for the meals or tickets .
Ethics rules bar White House officials from accepting lobbyists ’ gifts worth more than $ 20 .
Airline staff argued the T - shirt , which bears an image of the US President with the slogan " World 's number 1 terrorist " , was a security risk or an item likely to upset passengers .
The airline earlier prevented him from flying to Melbourne for Christmas with relatives on December 2 until he removed the shirt .
Domestic carrier Virgin Blue took the same action when Mr Jasson tried to catch a connecting flight to Adelaide , but on a return flight to Melbourne with Qantas on Friday , he successfully wore the shirt .
Mr Jasson said he cleared international security checks and arrived at the departure lounge in Melbourne for the flight home when he approached the gate manager , congratulated him over Qantas allowing him to wear the shirt and demanded an apology for his earlier treatment .
" I concede that I raised the issue , but I wanted primarily to thank Qantas for relenting when [ the gate manager ] told me : ' I 'm surprised you got this far , the staff should have stopped you , ' " Mr Jasson said .
Mr Jasson said he risked missing his chance of permanent residency if he spent more than two months out of Britain .
But the Adelaide - born former Melbourne resident said he was seeking legal advice to challenge the airline 's policy and recover costs .
" To be fair to Qantas , they have said I can take another flight if I do n't wear the T - shirt but I am not prepared to go without the T - shirt , " he said .
" I might forfeit the [ $ 2500 ] fare but I have made up my mind that I would rather stand up for the principle of free speech . "
When asked whether the stand was worthwhile , Mr Jasson said : " In Australia today it is very sad that that question has to be asked .
" It 's very sad that I find that question has to be asked in Australia .
It 's a very unhealthy situation and it makes me feel very sad .
" It 's one of the reasons that I now live in the UK . "
Reading from a prepared statement , a Qantas spokesman said : " Whether made verbally or on a T - shirt , comments with the potential to offend other customers or threaten the security of a Qantas group aircraft will not be tolerated . "

Their data is based on DNA changes in three populations gathered by the HapMap project , which built on the decoding of the human genome in 2003 .
The data , though collected to help identify variant genes that contribute to disease , also give evidence of evolutionary change .
The fingerprints of natural selection in DNA are hard to recognize .
Just a handful of recently selected genes have previously been identified , like those that confer resistance to malaria or the ability to digest lactose in adulthood , an adaptation common in Northern Europeans whose ancestors thrived on cattle milk .
But the authors of the HapMap study released last October found many other regions where selection seemed to have occurred , as did an analysis published in December by Robert K. Moysis of the University of California , Irvine .
Dr. Pritchard 's scan of the human genome differs from the previous two because he has developed a statistical test to identify just genes that have started to spread through populations in recent millennia and have not yet become universal , as many advantageous genes eventually do .
The selected genes he has detected fall into a handful of functional categories , as might be expected if people were adapting to specific changes in their environment .
Some are genes involved in digesting particular foods like the lactose - digesting gene common in Europeans .
Some are genes that mediate taste and smell as well as detoxify plant poisons , perhaps signaling a shift in diet from wild foods to domesticated plants and animals .
Dr. Pritchard estimates that the average point at which the selected genes started to become more common under the pressure of natural selection is 10,800 years ago in the African population and 6,600 years ago in the Asian and European populations .
Dr. Richard G. Klein , a paleoanthropologist at Stanford , said that it was hard to correlate the specific gene changes in the three populations with events in the archaeological record , but that the timing and nature of the changes in the East Asians and Europeans seemed compatible with the shift to agriculture .
Rice farming became widespread in China 6,000 to 7,000 years ago , and agriculture reached Europe from the Near East around the same time .
The vast numbers of folk trying to move through London 's airports this weekend were providing a good reason to show up at least two hours before departure , and though we were ready for the shuttle two - and - a - half hours before departure at the local hotel , the problems the shuttle had with traffic made it just barely possible for us to catch our plane .
As we headed across the waiting lounge , however , the thought of a ten - hour flight caused me to stop and snatch a copy of the recent Special Edition of Newsweek , dealing with the Energy Issue .
Since I just got back , I am not quite sure how much of this has already been covered , but perhaps I can provide comment to some of the articles in the issue .
For the past week I have been in the United Kingdom , beginning in South - West Scotland , where the weather was not kind .
I was struck , driving along beside the dams of the Galloway Hydro Scheme with the central dam spilling , and rain sheeting down , by the limits that there are on some forms of renewable power .
Here , with fields flooded ( all the way down to the Pennines ) the limited capacity of the system to store energy above a certain point is a bound that is also found in systems such as wind farms which generally produce power between two limiting wind conditions .
Seeking options in a Glasgow hotel for things to do , the front desk suggested either the bar or a movie in one 's room .
And while this is really the best of seasons for Hunting the Haggis we chose , instead to take a day in Edinburgh before taking the , surprisingly un-crowded , train down to London .
Our train was only slightly delayed by track - work to repair weather - related problems , which were not as bad as elsewhere
The plane had not even taken off before I realized that the magazine did not really see an energy supply problem .
The Editor in Chief notes that it " will take you on a tour of the startling changes underway , including the new geopolitics of oil , and how the imminent rise of natural gas will redraw the balance of power once again . "
The first article " What lies below ? " is by the ENI vice president Leonardo Maugeri , who has written for Newsweek before and about whom we have commented earlier .
I had assumed that as the Senior Vice President for Corporate Strategies he would know something about oil development .
However one reads in the article
Now doomsday forecasts are back , predicting the end of oil in this decade or the next .
The verdict of the new catastrophists may appear more convincing because they use statistical and probability models that appear to penetrate the mysteries of our planet 's subsoil .
In fact , they do no such thing .
In sum , what little is known about the world 's underground resources justifies a positive view of the future .
While the mainstream view is that oil resources are finite , no one knows just how finite they are .
And to complicate matters further , we are witnessing a minor revival of interest in an old Russian theory that oil can be born of chemical reactions in deep inner Earth , not of fossils decaying closer to the surface .
This holds the dim but intriguing prospect that oil might be a renewable resource .
Even the standard fossil theory leaves many mysteries .
It traces oil 's origins to organisms dying and decomposing , to be covered through many millenniums ( sic ) by layers of sediment and rock , and gradually filtering deeper into the Earth , until they hit an impermeable rock barrier , somewhere between 2,100 and 4,500 meters down .
There , pressure and high temperatures trigger chemical reactions that turn the organic sediments into oil and gas .
It then goes on to note : Yup , here we have a Senior VP of a major energy company giving credence to abiogenic oil formation , an idea criticised in some detail by Richard Heinberg among others .
He goes on to describe more conventional oil formation in a way that seems to indicate a lack of understanding of the process .
The impermeable rock barrier actually comes into play after the sediments have been buried deeply enough that they have been transformed into oil ( shallower ) or natural gas ( deeper and hotter ) , and as the fluids then start to percolate upwards , rather than downwards .
If the impermeable rock , overlying the migrating fluid , is shaped such that it can form a trap for the hydrocarbon , then an underground pool is formed , that can later be found and tapped .
Mr Maugeri has a similarly poor understanding of the capabilities of modern 3 - D seismic accuracy , which lack allows him to blandly assume that since only the US has been widely explored using exploration wells , that there is still a lot of unfound oil out there just waiting for an oil rig to come along and find it .
The final part of his argument about our " rolling in oil " deals with the limited amount of the oil - in - place that we now recover .
While the basis of his argument is sound - we leave a lot of the oil in the rock in place after the well is considered exhausted - and while , for example , mining the oil deposit might recover all of it ( vide the oil sands of Alberta ) the technology to economically do so is , I would suspect , at present no further along than , at best , lab scale .
Thus I find his final comment " But this is a new oil age , not the end of oil as we know it .
Not in this century , anyway , " to confirm that he is more likely one with a corporate management , rather than a geological background , and not really credible .
Moving on through the rest of the magazine I was struck by the lack of concern in the " debate " , for example Fareed Zakaria notes
There are only five countries that matter in the world of oil -- Saudi Arabia , Iran , Russia , Iraq and Venezuela .
In none of these , with the possible exception of Saudi Arabia , are serious efforts and investments being made to expand the supply of oil .
Russian production is growing at less than 3 percent a year .
Iran is flat , Iraq is in chaos and Venezuelan production has dropped 50 percent since Hugo Chávez took office .
What all these nations need is government that would invest the oil windfalls in expanding production and supply -- but that would take 10 to 15 years to bear fruit .
And all these dysfunctional regimes are too busy buying off their populations with cheap subsidies .
Unless these governments cease to behave as islands of corruption and dysfunction , they will slowly but surely sow the seeds of their own long - term decline .
. . . . . . . . . . . .
There 's an even bigger shift underway , from fuel to electricity .
In 1950 , 20 percent of U.S. economic output came from industries powered by electricity .
Today that number is 60 percent and rising fast .
All the growth sectors , from technology to services , are powered by the grid , not gasoline .
What will feed this grid -- coal , nuclear power or new technologies -- is another large subject , but one thing is certain : it will not be oil .
He makes no mention of the fact that the current contender is natural gas , and thus he can conclude his essay with the note that " After a century and a half , oil will be put in its proper place . "
The Secretary of Energy was given a page to list the Administration answers as : Develop cellulosic ethanol , harness the power of nature , build a hydrogen economy , power up the hybrids , use our own natural resources , clean up coal , get real about nuclear power , ( and nuclear waste ) , modernize our power grid and conserve .
Nothing exactly inspiring or illustrative of any new initiatives that might be anticipated .
Owen Matthews had an interestingly more realistic view of Russian future production , pointing out that they are not making the investments needed to sustain production .
The immediate threat : Russia lacks the capacity to pump oil fast enough to sustain exports at a time when domestic demand is accelerated dramatically , to 4.8 % in 2006 , up from an average of 2 % in the previous five years .
. . . . . .
Aramco plans to spend $ 25 billion by 2010 on opening new wells and raising production .
Meanwhile Russia needs to spend about that much every year for at least the next decade just to replace the oil and gas it is now pumping .
Despite those concerns the article concludes that Russian exports will keep world prices down and that , as a result reduce the imperatives for change .
Daniel Yergin anticipates that all these changes will lead to major investments in new technology .
In contrast to our ENI vice - president he sees
Around the world , the " digital oilfield of the future " is becoming the digital oilfield of the present .
The large - scale conversion of natural gas into high - quality diesellike fuel is getting closer .
Renewables have captured the public 's imagination and are coming into their own .
Wind power is the one that is closest to becoming conventional .
This is not just the result of market forces .
The development of renewable resources is being driven by mandates and subsidies of the European Union and of the federal and state governments in the United States , and by similar programs in countries like India and China .
But it is working .
. . . . . . . .
When it is all added up , there has never been so much activity in new energy technologies .
If it stays at this pace , expect dramatic results .
The Newsweek issue went on to talk about programs for coal liquefaction , nuclear power and the need to find an alternative source for plastics .
I brought it home , and will slip it into my library , so that , perhaps five years from now , I can look back and see how right they all were .
Perhaps you might want to do the same .
But , unfortunately , in the meantime I suspect that it has just continued to suggest to the general public that there really is no problem .
And so , again , realistic solutions will likely not get enough funding , despite Dr Yergin 's predictions - from the other side of the fence I can tell you that the optimism he anticipates is flowing into new projects is not visible at the levels or covering as much of the territory as he thinks is there .
Oh !
It may be that you might find this a bit bleak , particularly the bit on Scotland , so I will close instead with a picture that the Engineer took of the younger members of the party on the Southern Upland Way at the beginning of the visit , I was just the driver and so did not do the 12 km they did .
Perhaps it is a bit prophetic ?

Epica drills have extracted ice from deep under the surface
The in - depth analysis of air bubbles trapped in a 3.2 km - long core of frozen snow shows current greenhouse gas concentrations are unprecedented .
The East Antarctic core is the longest , deepest ice column yet extracted .
Project scientists say its contents indicate humans could be bringing about dangerous climate changes .
" My point would be that there 's nothing in the ice core that gives us any cause for comfort , " said Dr Eric Wolff from the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) .
" There 's nothing that suggests that the Earth will take care of the increase in carbon dioxide .
The ice core suggests that the increase in carbon dioxide will definitely give us a climate change that will be dangerous , " he told BBC News .
The Antarctic researcher was speaking here at the British Association 's ( BA ) Science Festival .
Slice of history
The ice core comes from a region of the White Continent known as Dome Concordia ( Dome C ) .
It has been drilled out by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica ( Epica ) , a 10 - country consortium .
The column 's value to science is the tiny pockets of ancient air that were locked into its millennia of accumulating snowflakes .
Each slice of this now compacted snow records a moment in Earth history , giving researchers a direct measure of past environmental conditions .
Not only can scientists see past concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane - the two principal human - produced gases now blamed for global warming - in the slices , they can also gauge past temperatures from the samples .
This is done by analysing the presence of different types , or isotopes , of hydrogen atom that are found preferentially in precipitating water ( snow ) when temperatures are relatively warm .
' Scary ' rate
Earlier results from the Epica core were published in 2004 and 2005 , detailing the events back to 440,000 years and 650,000 years respectively .
Scientists have now gone the full way through the column , back another 150,000 years .
The picture is the same : carbon dioxide and temperature rise and fall in step .
Like tiny time capsules , bubbles trap ancient samples of atmosphere
The " scary thing " , he added , was the rate of change now occurring in CO2 concentrations .
In the core , the fastest increase seen was of the order of 30 parts per million ( ppm ) by volume over a period of roughly 1,000 years .
" The last 30 ppm of increase has occurred in just 17 years .
We really are in the situation where we do n't have an analogue in our records , " he said .
Natural buffer
The plan now is to try to extend the ice - core record even further back in time .
Scientists think another location , near to a place known as Dome A ( Dome Argus ) , could allow them to sample atmospheric gases up to a million and a half years ago .
Some of the increases in carbon dioxide will be alleviated by natural " sinks " on the land and in the oceans , such as the countless planktonic organisms that effectively pull carbon out of the atmosphere as they build skeletons and shell coverings .
But Dr Corinne Le Quéré , of the University of East Anglia and BAS , warned the festival that these sinks may become less efficient over time .
We could not rely on them to keep on buffering our emissions , she said .
" For example , we do n't know what the effect will be of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems .
There is potential for deterioration , " she explained .
More CO2 absorbed by the oceans will raise their acidity , and a number of recent studies have concluded that this will eventually disrupt the ability of marine micro-organisms to use the calcium carbonate in the water to produce their hard parts .
Unless the life chances of children raised by single mothers suddenly improve , the explosive growth of the U.S. Hispanic population over the next couple of decades does not bode well for American social stability .
Hispanic immigrants bring near–Third World levels of fertility to America , coupled with what were once thought to be First World levels of illegitimacy .
( In fact , family breakdown is higher in many Hispanic countries than here . )
Nearly half of the children born to Hispanic mothers in the U.S. are born out of wedlock , a proportion that has been increasing rapidly with no signs of slowing down .
Given what psychologists and sociologists now know about the much higher likelihood of social pathology among those who grow up in single - mother households , the Hispanic baby boom is certain to produce more juvenile delinquents , more school failure , more welfare use , and more teen pregnancy in the future .
The government social - services sector has already latched onto this new client base ; as the Hispanic population expands , so will the demands for a larger welfare state .
Since conservative open - borders advocates have yet to acknowledge the facts of Hispanic family breakdown , there is no way to know what their solution to it is .
But they had better come up with one quickly , because the problem is here — and growing .
The dimensions of the Hispanic baby boom are startling .
The Hispanic birthrate is twice as high as that of the rest of the American population .
That high fertility rate — even more than unbounded levels of immigration — will fuel the rapid Hispanic population boom in the coming decades .
By 2050 , the Latino population will have tripled , the Census Bureau projects .
One in four Americans will be Hispanic by mid-century , twice the current ratio .
In states such as California and Texas , Hispanics will be in the clear majority .
Nationally , whites will drop from near 70 percent of the total population in 2000 to just half by 2050 .
Hispanics will account for 46 percent of the nation ’s added population over the next two decades , the Pew Hispanic Center reports .
But it ’s the fertility surge among unwed Hispanics that should worry policymakers .
Hispanic women have the highest unmarried birthrate in the country — over three times that of whites and Asians , and nearly one and a half times that of black women , according to the Centers for Disease Control .
Every 1,000 unmarried Hispanic women bore 92 children in 2003 ( the latest year for which data exist ) , compared with 28 children for every 1,000 unmarried white women , 22 for every 1,000 unmarried Asian women , and 66 for every 1,000 unmarried black women .
Forty - five percent of all Hispanic births occur outside of marriage , compared with 24 percent of white births and 15 percent of Asian births .
Only the percentage of black out - of - wedlock births — 68 percent — exceeds the Hispanic rate .
But the black population is not going to triple over the next few decades .
As if the unmarried Hispanic birthrate were n’t worrisome enough , it is increasing faster than among other groups .
It jumped 5 percent from 2002 to 2003 , whereas the rate for other unmarried women remained flat .
Couple the high and increasing illegitimacy rate of Hispanics with their higher overall fertility rate , and you have a recipe for unstoppable family breakdown .
The only bright news in this demographic disaster story concerns teen births .
Overall teen childbearing in the U.S. declined for the 12th year in a row in 2003 , having dropped by more than a third since 1991 .
Yet even here , Hispanics remain a cause for concern .
The rate of childbirth for Mexican teenagers , who come from by far the largest and fastest - growing immigrant population , greatly outstrips every other group .
The Mexican teen birthrate is 93 births per every 1,000 girls , compared with 27 births for every 1,000 white girls , 17 births for every 1,000 Asian girls , and 65 births for every 1,000 black girls .
To put these numbers into international perspective , Japan ’s teen birthrate is 3.9 , Italy ’s is 6.9 , and France ’s is 10 .
Even though the outsize U.S. teen birthrate is dropping , it continues to inflict unnecessary costs on the country , to which Hispanics contribute disproportionately .
To grasp the reality behind those numbers , one need only talk to people working on the front lines of family breakdown .
Social workers in Southern California , the national epicenter for illegal Hispanic immigrants and their progeny , are in despair over the epidemic of single parenting .
Not only has illegitimacy become perfectly acceptable , they say , but so has the resort to welfare and social services to cope with it .
Dr. Ana Sanchez delivers babies at St. Joseph ’s Hospital in the city of Orange , California , many of them to Hispanic teenagers .
To her dismay , they view having a child at their age as normal .
A recent patient just had her second baby at age 17 ; the baby ’s father is in jail .
But what is “ most alarming , ” Sanchez says , is that the “ teens ’ parents view having babies outside of marriage as normal , too .
A lot of the grandmothers are single as well ; they never married , or they had successive partners .
So the mom sends the message to her daughter that it ’s okay to have children out of wedlock . ”
Sanchez feels almost personally involved in the problem : “ I ’m Hispanic myself .
I wish I could find out what the Asians are doing right . ”
She guesses that Asian parents ’ passion for education inoculates their children against teen pregnancy and the underclass trap .
“ Hispanics are not picking that up like the Asian kids , ” she sighs .
Conservatives who support open borders are fond of invoking “ Hispanic family values ” as a benefit of unlimited Hispanic immigration .
Marriage is clearly no longer one of those family values .
But other kinds of traditional Hispanic values have survived — not all of them necessarily ideal in a modern economy , however .
One of them is the importance of having children early and often .
“ It ’s considered almost a badge of honor for a young girl to have a baby , ” says Peggy Schulze of Chrysalis House , an adoption agency in Fresno .
( Fresno has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in California , typical of the state ’s heavily Hispanic farm districts . )
It is almost impossible to persuade young single Hispanic mothers to give up their children for adoption , Schulze says .
“ The attitude is : ‘ How could you give away your baby ? ’
I do n’t know how to break through . ”
The most powerful Hispanic family value — the tight - knit extended family — facilitates unwed child rearing .
A single mother ’s relatives often step in to make up for the absence of the baby ’s father .
I asked Mona , a 19 - year - old parishioner at St. Joseph ’s Church in Santa Ana , California , if she knew any single mothers .
She laughed : “ There are so many I ca n’t even name them . ”
Two of her cousins , aged 25 and 19 , have children without having husbands .
The situation did n’t seem to trouble this churchgoer too much .
“ They ’ll be strong enough to raise them .
It ’s totally okay with us , ” she said .
“ We ’re very close ; we ’re there to support them .
They ’ll do just fine . ”
As Mona ’s family suggests , out - of - wedlock child rearing among Hispanics is by no means confined to the underclass .
The St. Joseph ’s parishioners are precisely the churchgoing , blue - collar workers whom open - borders conservatives celebrate .
Yet this community is as susceptible as any other to illegitimacy .
Fifty - year - old Irma and her husband , Rafael , came legally from Mexico in the early 1970s .
Rafael works in a meatpacking plant in Brea ; they have raised five husky boys who attend church with them .
Yet Irma ’s sister — a homemaker like herself , also married to a factory hand — is now the grandmother of two illegitimate children , one by each daughter .
“ I saw nothing in the way my sister and her husband raised her children to explain it , ” Irma says .
“ She gave them everything . ”
One of the fathers of Irma ’s young nieces has four other children by a variety of different mothers .
His construction wages are being garnished for child support , but he is otherwise not involved in raising his children .
The fathers of these illegitimate children are often problematic in even more troubling ways .
Social workers report that the impregnators of younger Hispanic women are with some regularity their uncles , not necessarily seen as a bad thing by the mother ’s family .
Alternatively , the father may be the boyfriend of the girl ’s mother , who then continues to stay with the grandmother .
Older men seek out young girls in the belief that a virgin cannot get pregnant during her first intercourse , and to avoid sexually transmitted diseases .
The tradition of starting families young and expand - ing them quickly can come into conflict with more modern American mores .
Ron Storm , the director of the Hillview Acres foster - care home in Chino , tells of a 15 - year - old girl who was taken away from the 21 - year - old father of her child by a local child - welfare department .
The boyfriend went to jail , charged with rape .
But the girl ’s parents complained about the agency ’s interference , and eventually both the girl and her boyfriend ended up going back to Mexico , presumably to have more children .
“ At 15 , as the Quinceañera tradition celebrates , you ’re considered ready for marriage , ” says Storm .
Or at least for childbearing ; the marriage part is disappearing .
But though older men continue to take advantage of younger women , the age gap between the mother and the father of an illegitimate child is quickly closing .
Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties tries to teach young fathers to take responsibility for their children .
“ We ’re seeing a lot more 13 - and 14 - year - old fathers , ” says Kathleen Collins , v.p. of health education .
The day before we spoke , Scott Montoya , an Orange County sheriff ’s deputy , arrested two 14 - year - old boys who were bragging about having sexual relations with a cafeteria worker from an Olive Garden restaurant .
“ It ’s now all about getting girls pregnant when you ’re age 15 , ” he says .
One 18 - year - old in the Planned Parenthood fathers ’ program has two children by two different girls and is having sex with five others , says health worker Jason Warner .
“ A lot of [ the adolescent sexual behavior ] has to do with getting respect from one ’s peers , ” observes Warner .
Normally , the fathers , of whatever age , take off .
“ The father may already be married or in prison or doing drugs , ” says Amanda Gan , director of operations for Toby ’s House , a maternity home in Dana Point , California .
Mona , the 19 - year - old parishioner at St. Joseph ’s Church , says that the boys who impregnated her two cousins are “ nowhere to be found . ”
Her family knows them but does n’t know if they are working or in jail .
Two teen mothers at the Hillview Acres home represent the outer edge of Hispanic family dysfunction .
Yet many aspects of their lives are typical .
Though these teenagers ’ own mothers were unusually callous and irresponsible , the social milieu in which they were raised is not unusual .
Irene ’s round , full face makes her look younger than her 14 years , certainly too young to be a mother .
But her own mother ’s boyfriend repeatedly forced sex on her , with the mother ’s acquiescence .
The result was Irene ’s baby , Luz .
Baby Luz has an uncle her own age , Irene ’s new 13 - month - old brother .
Like Irene , Irene ’s mother had her first child at 14 , and produced five more over the next 16 years , all of whom went into foster care .
Irene ’s father committed suicide before she was old enough to know him .
The four fathers of her siblings are out of the picture , too : one of them , the father of her seven - year - old brother and five - year - old sister , was deported back to Mexico after he showed up drunk for a visit with his children , in violation of his probation conditions .
Irene is serene and articulate — remarkably so , considering that in her peripatetic early life in Orange County she went to school maybe twice a week .
She likes to sing and to read books that are sad , she says , especially books by Dave Pelzer , a child - abuse victim who has published three best - selling memoirs about his childhood trauma .
She says she will never get married : “ I do n’t want another man in my life .
I do n’t want that experience again . ”
Eighteen - year - old Jessica at least escaped rape , but her family experiences were bad enough .
The large - limbed young woman , whose long hair is pulled back tightly from her heart - shaped face , grew up in the predominantly Hispanic farming community of Indio in the Coachella Valley .
She started “ partying hard ” in fifth grade , she says — at around the same time that her mother , separated from her father , began using drugs and going clubbing .
By the eighth grade , Jessica and her mother were drinking and smoking marijuana together .
Jessica ’s family had known her boyfriend ’s family since she was four ; when she had her first child by him — she was 14 and he was 21 — her mother declared philosophically that she had always known that it would happen .
“ It was okay with her , so long as he continued to give her drugs . ”
Jessica originally got pregnant to try to clean up her life , she says .
“ I knew what I was doing was not okay , so having a baby was a way for me to stop doing what I was doing .
In that sense , the baby was planned . ”
She has not used drugs since her first pregnancy , though she occasionally drinks .
After her daughter was born , she went to live with her boyfriend in a filthy trailer without plumbing ; they scrounged food from dumpsters , despite the income from his illegal drug business .
They planned to get married , but by the time she got pregnant again with a son , “ We were having a lot of problems .
We ’d be holding hands , and he’d be looking at other girls .
I did n’t want him to touch me . ”
Eventually , the county welfare agency removed her and put her in foster care with her two children .
Both Jessica and her caddish former boyfriend illustrate the evanescence of the celebrated Hispanic “ family values . ”
Her boyfriend ’s family could not be more traditional .
Two years ago , Jessica went back to Mexico to celebrate her boyfriend ’s parents ’ 25th wedding anniversary and the renewal of their wedding vows .
Jessica ’s own mother got married at 15 to her father , who was ten years her senior .
Her father would not let his wife work ; she was a “ stay - at - home wife , ” Jessica says .
But do n’t blame the move to the U.S. for the behavior of younger generations ; the family crack - up is happening even faster in Latin America .
Jessica ’s mother may have been particularly negligent , but Jessica ’s experiences are not so radically different from those of her peers .
“ Everybody ’s having babies now , ” she says .
“ The Coachella Valley is filled with girls ’ pregnancies .
Some girls live with their babies ’ dads ; they consider them their husbands . ”
These cohabiting relationships rarely last , however , and a new cohort of fatherless children goes out into the world .
Despite the strong family support , the prevalence of single parenting among Hispanics is producing the inevitable slide into the welfare system .
“ The girls are n’t marrying the guys , so they are married to the state , ” Dr. Sanchez observes .
Hispanics now dominate the federal Women , Infants , and Children free food program ; Hispanic enrollment grew over 25 percent from 1996 to 2002 , while black enrollment dropped 12 percent and white enrollment dropped 6.5 percent .
Illegal immigrants can get WIC and other welfare programs for their American - born children .
If Congress follows President Bush ’s urging and grants amnesty to most of the 11 million illegal aliens in the country today , expect the welfare rolls to skyrocket as the parents themselves become eligible .
Amy Braun works for Mary ’s Shelter , a home for young single mothers who are homeless or in crisis , in Orange County , California .
It has become “ culturally okay ” for the Hispanic population to use the shelter and welfare system , Braun says .
A case manager at a program for pregnant homeless women in the city of Orange observes the same acculturation to the social - services sector , with its grievance mongering and sense of victimhood .
“ I ’ll have women in my office on their fifth child , when the others have already been placed in foster care , ” says Anita Berry of Casa Teresa .
“ There ’s nothing shameful about having multiple children that you can’t care for , and to be pregnant again , because then you can blame the system . ”
The consequences of family breakdown are now being passed down from one generation to the next , in an echo of the black underclass .
“ The problems are deeper and wider , ” says Berry .
“ Now you ’re getting the second generation of foster care and group home residents .
The dysfunction is multigenerational . ”
The social - services complex has responded with barely concealed enthusiasm to this new flood of clients .
As Hispanic social problems increase , so will the government sector that ministers to them .
In July , a New York Times editorial , titled young latinas and a cry for help , pointed out the elevated high school dropout rates and birthrates among Hispanic girls .
A quarter of all Latinas are mothers by the age of 20 , reported the Times .
With the usual melodrama that accompanies the pitch for more government services , the Times designated young Latinas as “ endangered ” in the same breath that it disclosed that they are one of the fastest - growing segments of the population .
“ The time to help is now , ” said the Times — by which it means ratcheting up the taxpayer - subsidized social - work industry .
In response to the editorial , Carmen Barroso , regional director of International Planned Parenthood Federation / Western Hemisphere Region , proclaimed in a letter to the editor the “ urgent need for health care providers , educators and advocates to join the sexual and reproductive health movement to ensure the fundamental right to services for young Latinas . ”
Wherever these “ fundamental rights ” might come from , Barroso ’s call nevertheless seems quite superfluous , since there is no shortage of taxpayer - funded “ services ” for troubled Latinas — or Latinos .
The schools in California ’s San Joaquin Valley have day care for their students ’ babies , reports Peggy Schulze of Chrysalis House .
“ The girls get whatever they need — welfare , medical care . ”
Advocates for young unwed moms in New York ’s South Bronx are likewise agitating for more day - care centers in high schools there , reports El Diario / La Prensa .
A bill now in Congress , the Latina Adolescent Suicide Prevention Act , aims to channel $ 10 million to “ culturally competent ” social agencies to improve the self - esteem of Latina girls and to provide “ support services ” to their families and friends if they contemplate suicide .
The trendy “ case management ” concept , in which individual “ cases ” become the focal point around which a solar system of social workers revolves , has even reached heavily Hispanic elementary and middle schools .
“ We have a coordinator , who brings in a collaboration of agencies to deal with the issues that do n’t allow a student to meet his academic goals , such as domestic violence or drugs , ” explains Sylvia Rentria , director of the Family Resource Center at Berendo Middle School in Los Angeles .
“ We can provide individual therapy . ” Rentria offers the same program at nearby Hoover Elementary School for up to 100 students .
This July , Rentria launched a new session of Berendo ’s Violence Intervention Program for parents of children who are showing signs of gang involvement and other antisocial behavior .
Ghady M. , 55 and a “ madre soltera ” ( single mother ) , like most of the mothers in the program , has been called in because her 16 - year - old son , Christian , has been throwing gang signs at school , cutting half his classes , and ending up in the counseling office every day .
The illegal Guatemalan is separated from her partner , who was “ muy malo , ” she says ; he was probably responsible for her many missing teeth .
( The detectives in the heavily Hispanic Rampart Division of the Los Angeles Police Department , which includes the Berendo school , spend inordinate amounts of time on domestic violence cases . )
Though Ghady used to work in a factory on Broadway in downtown L.A. — often referred to as Little Mexico City — she now collects $ 580 in welfare payments and $ 270 in food stamps for her two American - born children .
Christian is a husky smart aleck in a big white T - shirt ; his fashionably pomaded hair stands straight up .
He goes to school but does n’t do homework , he grins ; and though he is not in a gang , he says , he has friends who are .
Keeping Ghady and Christian company at the Violence Intervention Program is Ghady ’s grandniece , Carrie , a lively ten - year - old .
Carrie lives with her 26 - year - old mother but does not know her father , who also sired her 12 - year - old brother .
Her five - year - old brother has a different father .
Yet for all these markers of social dysfunction , fatherless Hispanic families differ from the black underclass in one significant area : many of the mothers and the absent fathers work , even despite growing welfare use .
The former boyfriend of Jessica , the 18 - year - old mother at the Hillview Acres foster home , works in construction and moonlights on insulation jobs ; whether he still deals drugs is unknown .
Jessica is postponing joining her father in Texas until she finishes high school , because once she moves in with him , she will feel obligated to get a job to help the family finances .
The mother of Hillview ’s 14 - year - old Irene used to fix soda machines in Anaheim , California , though she got fired because she was lazy , Irene says .
Now , under court compulsion , she works in a Lunchables factory in Santa Ana , a condition of getting her children back from foster care .
The 18 - year - old Lothario and father of two , whom Planned Parenthood ’s Jason Warner is trying to counsel , works at a pet store .
The mother of Carrie , the vivacious ten - year - old sitting in on Berendo Middle School ’s Violence Intervention Program , makes pizza at a Papa John ’s pizza outlet .
How these two value systems — a lingering work ethic and underclass mating norms — will interact in the future is anyone ’s guess .
Orange County sheriff ’s deputy Montoya says that the older Hispanic generation ’s work ethic is fast disappearing among the gangbanging youngsters whom he sees .
“ Now , it ’s all about fast money , drugs , and sex . ”
It may be that the willingness to work will plummet along with marriage rates , leading to even greater social problems than are now rife among Hispanics .
Or it may be that the two contrasting practices will remain on parallel tracks , creating a new kind of underclass : a culture that tolerates free - floating men who impregnate women and leave , like the vast majority of black men , yet who still labor in the noncriminal economy .
The question is whether , if the disposition to work remains relatively strong , a working parent will inoculate his or her illegitimate children against the worst degradations that plague black ghettos .
From an intellectual standpoint , this is a fascinating social experiment , one that academicians are — predictably — not attuned to .
But the consequences will be more than intellectual : they may severely strain the social fabric .
Nevertheless , it is an experiment that we seem destined to see to its end .
Tisha Roberts , a supervisor at an Orange County , California , institution that assists children in foster care , has given up hope that the illegitimacy rate will taper off .
“ It ’s going to continue to grow , ” she says , “ until we can put birth control in the water . ”
Elves Of Valinor Warn Of " Critical Security Flaw "
In Palant�r Browsers The Elves of Valinor , creators of the popular palant�ri " browsers " used throughout Middle - Earth to view distant lands , announced today that the Seeing Stones contain a critical security flaw which could leave users open to attacks by malicious Dark Lords .
The vulnerabilities , according to an ElviNor monthly bulletin , could permit malignant gods to monitor the location and activity of users , or allow persons peering into the Palant�ri to be taken over and used to execute remote commands .
ElviNor urged those in possession of a Palant�r to contact the Order of the Istari and request a magical patch to address the problem .
Critics , meanwhile , seized upon the announcement as further proof that ElviNor hardware is inherently insecure , and urged consumers to switch to reliable mithril products .
Said Thorin III Stonehelm of Khazad - d�m , " you 'll never get this kind shoddy craftsmanship from a dwarf . "

I ’ve come to discover that people who struggle to code do n’t just struggle on big problems , or even smallish problems ( i.e. write a implementation of a linked list ) .
They struggle with tiny problems .
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 .
But for multiples of three print “ Fizz ” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “ Buzz ” .
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “ FizzBuzz ” .

The interviewer merely wanted to go through the motions of demonstrating you could program .
Now she ’s going to have to get into a discussion with you about how your solution works , which is irritating and wastes time that could have been invested more profitably on a design question ;
The interviewer might presume that you will always find the most indirect route to the destination and decide you belong in an ivory tower ;
The interviewer might not understand your solution at first glance but will make up for this by “ bikeshedding ” and grilling you about some minor nit like the failure modes of using && and || instead of the if statement or the ternary operator ;
and instead of the statement or the ternary operator ;
The interviewer might have just finished The Seasoned Schemer and grill you over why your solution does n’t use the Y Combinator to implement compose ( snap ! ) .
Update
Do n’t Overthink the Interview Either
Love to program but you need to use Java ?

Every serious Java programmer should own a copy .

and
does the code run and produce the desired output
Update
I noticed some traffic coming to my post on juggling from Using FizzBuzz to Find Developers who Grok Coding .
Like me , the author is having trouble with the fact that 199 out of 200 applicants for every programming job ca n’t write code at all .
I repeat : they ca n’t write any code whatsoever .
UPDATE : If you think that I just claimed that 199 out of 200 working programmers cannot code , stop immediately and either read my follow - up explaining the math , or read Joel ’s article on why companies are n’t as picky as they think they are .
Thank you .
So the author has decided to set the bar ridiculously low .
As the post says : He gives an example of a “ tiny ” problem that is quite suitable for a phone interview :
One of the nice things about using a tiny problem is that anyone who has written actual code in the last six months will solve it in less than ten minutes .
This is good because ( a ) it leaves more time for talking about important things , and ( b ) if the candidate ca n’t solve the problem you will find out right away and save yourself a lot of grief .
As you can imagine from a post like this , quite a few people have stepped forward with creative solutions .
Here ’s mine : Right away I think you want to be careful if you ever trot a solution like this out in an actual interview .
Here are some of the things that could go wrong :
Of course , some interviewers are just looking for an excuse to talk about technical issues and will not prejudge you in any way .
Speaking for myself , I would laugh if you wrote something like this out .
But then again , I once worked for someone who had won the second International Obfuscated C Contest
If you are conducting an interview and you receive a cryptic answer , or an impossibly concise one - liner , or perhaps something like the above that is redolent of Higher Order Functions , do you embrace the candidate as a genius ?
Or perhaps avoid them as someone who cannot write clear , maintainable code ?
I suggest the best answer is .
Stay on track : you asked the question for the purpose of eliminating the 199 out of 200 that have absolutely no hope of ever producing working software .
You have just identified that this person is the one in two hundred applicants who can actually code .
Mission accomplished .
You are n’t trying to get to HIRE or NO HIRE over the phone .
Invite them in for an interview : that ’s the place where you can drill down and obtain their views on professional programming .
Remember , this is aproblem .
Unless you load the question down with requirements that their answer resemble production code , why should you have any expectation that the candidate only knows one way to write software ?
This is like trying to hire programmers who know both languages , FORTRANCOBOL .
If you do ask them for production code , do n’t be surprised if the best candidates decide not to work for you : they will rightly point out that FizzBuzz is not a realistic example of a production problem .
Overall I think the best approach as an interviewer is the simplest : pose the simple question .
Indicate it is a screener designed to confirm that they are the person described on the resume .
If anything , tell them that there is no need for production artifacts like documentation and unit tests , you just want working code in as little time as they are able .
The no -hopers wo n’t get it no matter how simple the question , and the good people wo n’t waste a lot of time with JavaDoc and xUnit .
And then make your decision based on one objective fact : .
Everything else is superfluous to the question of whether the candidate should be asked into your office for a face - to - face meeting .

Welcome to the classics section .
Not all the authors here are dead , but all the books are classics .
Some books are classics by virtue of quality , some by virtue of age , and some by virtue of length .
Which is which , is up to you to determine .

The year 2006 could rightly be called the German secret service 's annus horribilis .
In the last 12 months , Germany 's Federal Intelligence Agency ( BND ) has been investigated for its alleged roles in the Iraq war , extraordinary rendition and torture of terrorist suspects , and the spying on and employment of German journalists at home and abroad .
Now , one of the secret services overseers , Wolfgang Neskovic , has issued a warning that the German intelligence apparatus is out of control and that the Parliamentary Control Committee ( PKG ) , the government body which supervises the BND , has no idea what is going on .
Neskovic said in an interview published by Der Spiegel magazine on Monday that the PKG , in its present form , should be abolished and that the nine members of the Bundestag committee do not have the faintest idea what 6,000 secret service employees actually do .
Inadequate training for PKG members
The former high court judge -- and himself one of the nine members of the committee -- told Der Spiegel that the fact that the German parliament had put the PKG in charge of controlling the intelligence services was " a joke " and " absurd . "
The training the committee members had in terms of learning about the secret services before taking up their posts amounted to a week - long visit to the BND headquarters in Pullach .
El - Masri's case is just one the committee has heard
Neskovic was among the committee members who visited Pullach .
" Since taking part in the training period , I am even more sure that we should immediately abolish the controlling committee in its current form , " he said .
He also called the promotion of the PKG as a body set up to manage and moderate the secret services a " public deception … a placebo . "
Neskovic demanded that specialist analysts and experienced secret service experts be assigned to assist the committee members and that the committee be given special powers to adapt into an investigating body should a scandal arise .
At the moment , the committee has limited investigative authority and needs permission to publicly announce any findings .
Inquiries into Iraq , rendition involvement
The PKG has been investigating the BND as well as members of the former Social Democratic - Green party coalition government after it was revealed that German agents were involved in the early stages of the US - led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
A week of training in Pullach is not enough
It has since been involved in an inquiry into the abduction of Khaled el - Masri , a German of Lebanese origin , who claims to have been arrested as a suspected terrorist while in Macedonia in December 2003 , handed over to the CIA and flown to Afghanistan where he was imprisoned , interrogated and tortured .
A similar case involving German - resident Murat Kurnaz , a former Guantanamo Bay detainee , is also being investigated after Kurnaz claimed that he was tortured by German special forces in Afghanistan before being flown to Cuba .
The BND has also been linked to a media scandal since last year .
It admitted recruiting journalists in high - profile news magazines , such as Focus and Der Spiegel , to spy on their colleagues so it could identify the sources of leaks , and then was accused of paying 20 overseas journalists to spy on its behalf .
PARIS , Jan. 16  At a time when most world powers have forged a united front against Iran because of its nuclear program , President Jacques Chirac arranged to send his foreign minister to Tehran to talk about a side issue , then abruptly canceled the visit earlier this month in embarrassing failure .
Mr. Chirac ’s troubles stemmed from his deep desire to help resolve the crisis in Lebanon before his term runs out in May .
To that end , he decided to seek the support of Iran , which , along with Syria , backs the radical Shiite organization Hezbollah , three senior French officials said in describing the effort .
So he planned to send Foreign Minister Philippe Douste - Blazy to Tehran , only to call off the trip two days before it was to have taken place , said the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly on diplomatic issues .
Both Mr. Douste - Blazy and senior Foreign Ministry officials concluded that such a trip was doomed to fail and that it would send the wrong signal just weeks after the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved sanctions intended to curb Iran ’s nuclear program , they added .
Ten days after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , President Bush was told in a highly classified briefing that the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein to the attacks and that there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda , according to government records and current and former officials with firsthand knowledge of the matter .
The administration has refused to provide the Sept. 21 President 's Daily Brief , even on a classified basis , and wo n't say anything more about it other than to acknowledge that it exists .
The information was provided to Bush on September 21 , 2001 during the " President 's Daily Brief , " a 30 - to 45 - minute early - morning national security briefing .
Information for PDBs has routinely been derived from electronic intercepts , human agents , and reports from foreign intelligence services , as well as more mundane sources such as news reports and public statements by foreign leaders .
One of the more intriguing things that Bush was told during the briefing was that the few credible reports of contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda involved attempts by Saddam Hussein to monitor the terrorist group .
Saddam viewed Al Qaeda as well as other theocratic radical Islamist organizations as a potential threat to his secular regime .
At one point , analysts believed , Saddam considered infiltrating the ranks of Al Qaeda with Iraqi nationals or even Iraqi intelligence operatives to learn more about its inner workings , according to records and sources .

Chris Sherman announced Google 's new Toolbar 4 Beta .
No doubt this effort was nicely timed to help boost the stock as Google is reporting Q4 earnings tomorrow ...
Chris notes that the new toolbar comes with query suggestions , similar to the version on Google Firefox toolbars :
The new query suggestion feature is similar to the " auto suggest " feature that 's currently available in the Google toolbar for Firefox , with a few new twists .
In addition to suggesting popular queries that match the words you 're typing in the search box , the new feature also suggests spelling corrections and also presents potential options from your own toolbar search history and bookmarks .
The features work across different computers , so if you search for something on one computer Google lets you access that on another computer .
Perhaps this is why Google has been so slow with marketing something like Del.icio.us ?
It looks like they are trying to kill off the misspelled keyword market , but I am not sure of what I think of the new spell suggest feature , especially when combined with search suggest .
Lets say young Timmy , a second grader , is trying to use Google to remember how to spell Jenna .
Google rewards his correct spelling by suggesting that he view a couple pornstar websites ( as the top couple most frequently searched for Jenna results are pornstar names ) .
Google also opened up the toolbar with this release , allowing third parties to create custom buttons .
The API looks pretty simple .
New buttons can act as a custom RSS reader , and it is easy to submit your button , although the TOS prohibit gambling and certain other sites .
Some of the early listed sites on Google 's button pages surprise me .
The new toolbar is an IE only US only release .
The government measures graduation rates as the percentage of first - time undergraduates who obtain a degree within six years .
On average across all American universities , the rate is 55 percent .
Dr. Pepicello said this was a poor yardstick for comparing other universities with his , which serves mostly older students who started college elsewhere .
Alongside the 16 percent rate , the university Web site also publishes a 59 percent graduation rate , but that is based on nonstandard calculations and does not allow comparison with other universities , he said .
The official rates at some University of Phoenix campuses are extremely low — 6 percent at the Southern California campus , 4 percent among online students — and he acknowledged extraordinary attrition among younger students .

“ We have not done as good a job as we could , ” he said , adding that the university was creating tutoring and other services to help keep students .
“ The university takes quality in the classroom seriously , ” he said .
The university brings a low - overhead approach not only to its campuses , most of which are office buildings near freeways , but also to its academic model .
About 95 percent of instructors are part - time , according to federal statistics , compared with an average of 47 percent across all universities .
Most have full - time day jobs .
Courses are written at university headquarters , easing class preparation time for instructors .
The College Board reports the university ’s annual tuition and fees as $ 9,630 , about half the average at private four - year colleges and twice that of four - year public colleges .
Students take one course at a time , online or in evening classes , which meet for four hours , once a week , for five or six weeks , depending on degree level .
As a result , students spend 20 to 24 hours with an instructor during each course , compared with about 40 hours at a traditional university .
The university also requires students to teach one another by working on projects for four or five hours per week in what it calls “ learning teams . ”
Government auditors in 2000 ruled that this schedule fell short of the minimum time required for federal aid programs , and the university paid a $ 6 million settlement .
But in 2002 , the Department of Education relaxed its requirements , and the university ’s stripped - down schedule is an attractive feature for many adults eager to obtain a university degree while working .
But critics say it leaves courses with little meat .
The NYT has an article , Odds Are , They ’ll Know ‘ 08 Winner , on Intrade.com , a trading exchange for prediction markets based in Dublin .
Over the last few years , Intrade — with headquarters in Dublin , where the gambling laws are loose — has become the biggest success story among a new crop of prediction markets .
Another company , Newsfutures , helps the world ’s largest steel maker , Arcelor Mittal , run an internal market on which executives predict the price of steel .
At Best Buy , a company called Consensus Point has helped start a market for employees to guess which DVDs and video game consoles , among other products , will be popular .
Google and Eli Lilly have similar markets .
The idea is to let a company ’s decision - makers benefit from the collective , if often hidden , knowledge of their employees .
According to the article , Intrade ’s odds correctly forecast the outcome in all 50 states in the 2004 US presidential election .
What do they say about the 2008 election ?
Intrade now makes John McCain the favorite for the Republican nomination , followed by Rudy Giuliani .
For the Democrats , Hillary Rodham Clinton has about a 50 percent chance of being the nominee , more than twice as much as anyone else .
The most counterintuitive forecast is that Mrs. Clinton is given a better - than - even chance of winning the general election if she is nominated , while Mr. McCain — perhaps because he wants to keep fighting the war in Iraq — is not .
Markets go up and they go down , so we ’ll see how things progress .

Steven Best , professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso , had intended to travel to the UK to take part in an event to celebrate the closure of a farm breeding guinea pigs for research .
The closure of the Newchurch Farm business following years of harassment and intimidation , including the theft of a grandmother 's ashes from the local cemetery , was widely condemned by scientists and politicians last week .
In the wake of the London bombings of July 7 , the Home Office announced it would not allow people to enter the UK who " foment , justify or glorify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs ; seek to provoke others to terrorist acts ; [ or ] foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to serious criminal acts . "
In July Dr Best spoke at an international animal rights conference in England .
At that conference , he was quoted by the Daily Telegraph as saying : " We are not terrorists , but we are a threat .
We are a threat both economically and philosophically .
Our power is not in the right to vote but the power to stop production .
We will break the law and destroy property until we win . "
According to the newspaper , he added that activists did not want to " reform " vivisectionists but to " wipe them off the face of the earth " .
The Home Office cited these words in a letter to Dr Best last week banning him from entering the UK .
Dr Best , who claims his words have been taken out of context , said he was not surprised by the ban .
" It was only a matter of time , especially after July 7 .
The climate in Britain is totally unbelievable .
It 's very fascist .
It 's becoming a police state , " he told the Chronicle of Higher Education .

Introduction
Log5 is a Common Lisp logging framework organized around five things : categories , outputs , senders , messages and contexts .
Categories organize log messages into groups .
They are like log4j's Loggers only they 're not necessarily arranged hierarchically ;
Senders take care of getting log messages somewhere useful .
The correspond to log4j 's Appenders ;
the Outputs of a Sender specify what actually gets sent , printed , spoken , and so on .
Messages are the actual log statements in your code
and the Context provides a way to annotate log messages dynamically ( useful , for example , if an application serves multiple clients ) .
Log4j calls this a * Nested Diagnostic Context * but that 's too high - faluting for me .
For more details , see the overview or the user - guide .
Getting Log5
log5 is implemented and stabile .
metabang.com is switching from darcs to git for source control ; the current log5 repository is on github and you can clone it using :
git clone git://github.com/gwkkwg/log5
You can use ASDF - Install or just download a tarball .
It 's also on the CLiki .
Common - Lisp.net hosts the project 's mailing list :
You can also follow development ( such as it is :-) ) on unCLog .
Share peace !

Brendan Scott has been studying the BSD license , particularly in the context of Australian law , and he has come up with some startling questions .
Is the BSD license as permissive as we 've thought ?
The paper is principally for lawyers to consider , but it 's certainly of interest to everyone , and note his disclaimer :
Nothing in this paper is legal advice or a statement of the law .
This paper is an exposition of an ( untested ) argument as to the effect of the BSD license .
Scott will be speaking at the Gaming Miniconf at LCA2007 in Australia on Tuesday at 11:15 if anyone wants to discuss the paper afterwards .
The paper is also available in PDF format .

BSD  The Dark Horse of Open Source

Abstract
We observe that there exists a broad misconception that the BSD permits the licensing of BSD code and modifications of BSD code under closed source licenses .
In this paper we put forward an argument to the effect that the terms of the BSD require BSD code and modifications to BSD code to be licensed under the terms of the BSD license .
We look at some possible consequences and observe that this licensing requirement could have serious impacts on the unwary .
Note / Disclaimer :
This discussion is limited to likely effects under Australian law .
Some of the arguments made are of a generic nature and might be profitably applied in other common law jurisdictions , such as the UK and the US  but , then again , they might not .
Open source licenses have been subject to little judicial scrutiny to date .
Nothing in this paper is legal advice or a statement of the law .
This paper is an exposition of an ( untested ) argument as to the effect of the BSD license .
1 . Discussion and Assumptions 1.1
It seems that the collective wisdom is that once you acquire BSD code , you can license it to others under any terms you like , including on the terms of a closed source license .
The received wisdom is that the BSD has minimal restrictions on what can be done with the code .
In particular , there is the view that its terms do not need to apply to derivative works made from BSD code .
Take the view of Microsoft , for example : " The BSD license places no substantive restrictions on software developers as to subsequent use in derivative programs and licensing of those programs .
The BSD license allows programmers to use , modify and redistribute the source code and binary code of the original software program , with or without modification .
Derivative works can be either open source or commercially licensed . " [ presumably , taken in context , " commercially licensed " means licensed under a license other than the BSD ] 1.2
This nature of the BSD is something which can easily be taken on faith .
We do n't assert that this view is universal ( as some of the references in the rider show ) , but it certainly does appear to be prevalent .
We consider that the view evidenced by the references set out in the rider is , more likely than not , incorrect .
In this paper we look at a number of scenarios and analyze some consequences of the application of the BSD to software code .
1.3
An assumption made by this paper is that licensees are granted their license by distributors , and not by the original licensor .
The mechanics of license propagation is not one specifically addressed by most open source licenses .
There seems to be an assumption that when a person gives a copy of ( open source ) software to a third party , the giver also grants a license over that software to that third party .
This method of licensing is assumed in this paper .
There is another interpretation of the license mechanism , which is that the original licensee has already granted a license over the software to everyone , and the giver is simply notifying the recipient of the terms of that license .
We note that draft 2 of version 3 of the GPL specifically addresses this issue , adopting a hybrid position by which the original licensor grants a license to the recipient automatically at the time of receipt of the code .
Where relevant , comments on the effect of this alternative licensing interpretation ( ALI ) are made in the article .
These are marked  ALI  .
2 . What are the terms of the License ?
2.1
The text of the BSD is as follows ( our numbering  it is this numbering which is used when we refer to clause x of the BSD ) : 1 Copyright ( c ) , [ YEAR ] , [ OWNER ]
All rights reserved .
2 Redistribution and use in source and binary forms , with or without modification , are permitted provided that the following conditions are met : 3 * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice , this list of conditions and the following disclaimer .
4 * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice , this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and / or other materials provided with the distribution .
5 * Neither the name of the [ organization ] nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission .
6 * THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS " AS IS " AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES , INCLUDING , BUT NOT LIMITED TO , THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED .

2.2
The logical flow for this analysis is to consider distribution of BSD code in source and object form , with and without modification .
We consider each of these scenarios separately in the following paragraphs .
3 . Redistribution in Source Form without Modification 3.1
Consider the situation where code licensed under the BSD license is redistributed in source code form and without any modification .
Normally , the reproduction of the source code of software involved in such a redistribution would be an infringement of copyright .
Therefore in order to distribute the code legally , the distribution would need to be permitted by a license .
Clause 2 clearly permits a person to redistribute that code providing that they comply with clause 3 .
Clause 3 requires the retention of  the above copyright notice and  this list of conditions  .
3.2
This begs the question : what is the legal effect of being required to retain  this list of conditions .
Are they just there for show ?
Do they have some other effect ?
In determining this , a court will look to the objective meaning of the clause and , potentially , the objective intention of the party granting the license .
In this case , the actual subjective intention of the party granting the license ( and what they thought the words meant ) is irrelevant .
What the court is looking to determine is what the reasonable person ( ie an idealized and dispassionate citizen who is called on to assess the scope of the license ) would make of the words .
3.3 Consider first the warranty disclaimer .
If there is a requirement to retain a copy of the warranty disclaimer in a redistribution , is a court likely to say the warranty disclaimer is intended to be effective or not ?
For example , could the disclaimer be retained but framed by a redistributor in such a way that the disclaimer had no legal force ?
It is likely that the reasonable person would read the license and think that the licensor intended that the warranty disclaimer was to run with the redistribution without qualification .
3.4
On this analysis , the warranty disclaimer travels with the distribution and the distributor has no ability to qualify it .
The question then becomes what about the other clauses ?
What about clause 2 which permits redistribution and use of the source code ?
If , in the case of the warranty disclaimer , the objective intention of the requirement to retain or reproduce the warranty disclaimer is that the warranty disclaimer is a condition of the distribution , why should the same reasoning not apply to the terms in the list of conditions  ?
Moreover , if the warranty disclaimer is operative as a condition , what basis can there be for arguing that the other clauses are not ?
3.5
If the other license terms are operative , then the combined effect of clauses 2 and 3 is that redistribution of the source form must occur on the terms of the BSD license .
A similar argument leads to the same result in respect of redistribution in object form .
There is a certain element of common sense to this conclusion .
If the license terms are not operative , any later taker could legally vary the requirement that the warranty disclaimer be included .
Moreover , if anyone could license the code under different terms , then any person redistributing the unmodified code could remove the warranty disclaimer and other terms , removing the protections expressly included by the copyright holder .
3.6
It is a corollary of the above that if a copyright holder wants a warranty disclaimer to travel with the code , then they must include a condition to that effect , and that condition must travel with the code to at least the same extent that the disclaimer is intended to .
In short : to be effective licenses which include a disclaimer must be infective .
ALI 3.7
Under the ALI the conclusion in this section follows automatically because the ALI assumes that third parties have already been licensed under the BSD and that the inclusion requirement simply puts the recipient on notice of the license terms .
Note that the ALI would not permit licensing in this case under a different license as it assumes that the giver is not licensing at all .
4 . Reproduction in Source Form With Modification 4.1
We now turn our attention to the case where modifications are made to the source code , and redistribution of the source code with those modifications occurs .
Above , we concluded that the BSD license applies to the unmodified source code .
Does it also apply to the modifications ?
4.2 Clause 3 simply talks about  Redistributions of source code .
A distribution of modified source is a distribution of source code , so clause 3 applies  a copy of these terms must be included with the modified source code .
The wording does not support identification of a specific subset of the source code ( ie the portion which is unmodified ) for the license to apply to .
Assuming our analysis above applies , then by including the license terms with the modified source code will make those terms ( in particular , the rights to distribute and use in clause 2 ) apply to the whole of the modified source code as redistributed .
ALI 4.3
The situation under the ALI is probably similar to the argument above about framing the warranty disclaimer .
By definition under the ALI no license is granted by the giver over the original code .
This raises a question about the gap between the original code and the code as modified .
This gap can't be licensed by the original licensor since it 's not theirs to license .
However , the original licensor has mandated specific wording to be included which purports to apply to the code as a whole ( ie as modified ) .
The question would become  is it reasonable to read these words as permitting a similar form of framing to that discussed above ( in paragraph 3.3 / note 9 ) ?
In this respect , two clauses ( the warranty disclaimer and the clause 5 ) imply that the terms of the license are intended to address some of the interests of contributors to the software .
The references to contributors  in these clauses would be meaningless if the license terms only applied to the original code and when assessing competing interpretations of the license .
As these references to contributors appear to be very deliberate , it would be inappropriate to prefer an interpretation in which they have no meaning .
As such , it is unlikely that the license would be interpreted as permitting such framing and the ALI is therefore likely to lead to the same result .
Under the ALI there may now be two licences , one from the original licensor relating to the original code , and one from the contributor relating to the modifications .
4.4 A counter argument may be that the copyright statement ( clause 1 ) may be wrong in the case of modifications and the BSD does not provide an option for the addition of other copyright notices .
This is difficult , but not impossible , to reconcile with the interpretation above  for example , if clause 1 of the BSD is intended to vest copyright in modifications in the original author it will be consistent with the above interpretation ( and , incidentally with the ALI ) .
Such an interpretation would , no doubt , cause some alarm and therefore should not be preferred without substantially more analysis .
In this context that clause 6 exquisitely draws both the distinction between the copyright holders ( plural ) and contributors and the copyright owner ( singular ) and contributors .
However , if not reconciled ( either in this way or as a drafting error ) , it is difficult to see how the BSD can be consistent ( under the ALI ) except by reading the references to contributors in clauses 5 and 6 as having no meaning .
5 . Binary Form of Modifications 5.1
A similar argument to that for source code applies in relation to modified binaries .
Arguably therefore , if you have modified the object form of BSD licensed software then when you distribute it your modifications must also be licensed under the terms of the BSD license .
5.2
One might argue that , in the case of binaries , most people do n't actually modify the binary form of some software .
Rather they modify the source code , and compile new object code from that modified source .
That is , the object code is not the original binary  with modifications  .
Rather , both of them are derived from a common source .
5.3 In Australia the compilation of source code into object code is itself a reproduction of the source code .
In fact , any derivation of object code from source is such a reproduction .
As such , if you modify the source code , you need the original copyright holder 's permission to compile it and to subsequently distribute it .
Where is that permission to be found in the BSD ?
If the new object code is not the source or binary [ form ] , with or without modification  then there is no right to distribute that new object code .
Either the compilation of the modified source is a binary form which is subject to the BSD , or it will be an infringement to distribute it at all ( in the absence of an additional license ) .
6 . Can BSD Code be Licensed Under a Different License / Closed Source License ? 6.1
We asserted above the collective wisdom that BSD code can be licensed under other licenses .
There does not appear to be any basis for this wisdom in the terms of the license .
Further , the terms of the BSD license do not appear to allow more restrictive licensing terms .
This is not to say that the BSD terms forbid them .
Rather , the BSD 's usage and distribution rights are so broad , that additional ( parallel ) restrictions would appear to be ineffective .
There is not even any basis on which modifications to the code can be used to leverage a different license  because , as we have concluded above , ( if part of a redistribution ) those parts which are the original with or without modification must be licensed under the BSD terms .
6.2
We should also note here that , in the world of licensing , the appropriate starting point is to assume that what is not permitted is prohibited ( at least to the extent that it is prohibited by copyright or other laws ) .
The BSD does not include an express permission to license under different terms , so the ability to license under other terms can only be arrived at by implication .
There does not appear to be any basis in the words of the license which supports such an implication .
6.3
One might also argue that the actions of the community can be taken into account when determining the scope of the license .
This argument may have force in certain specific circumstances ( for example , where a specific licensor has clearly adopted this broader practice and made their adoption known ) , but is probably lacking substance in the general case .
First , it is something of a circular argument  if the license defines what the community is permitted to do , anything outside the license is illegal .
How can the illegal actions of members in the community ( even en masse ) render their own illegal activity legal ?
Second , how are the actions of the community  to be established ?
Third , why should these actions be implied in the general case ?
For example if I write some software , then walk outside and give it to a passer - by with a copy of the BSD attached , why should that person 's license be determined by anything other than the words of the BSD included with the software ( as it comprises their entire knowledge of the license and its context ) ?
Moreover , why should the actions of the community  be binding on me as a licensor when I choose this form of words for my license , especially if I do not reference those actions in the wording of the license ?
7 . Does the BSD Require Availability of Source Code ? 7.1
The BSD license does not have any express provision requiring that source code be distributed along with a binary .
You could argue that by distributing a binary version of the software you are granting a license over the corresponding source code ( even if the source code or modified source code is not distributed ) since clause 2 of the BSD permits use and redistribution of the program in source form .
However , if this argument is correct , it would still not lead to the provision of access to the source code .
7.2
So , even if : ( a ) modified source code is required , in the event of distribution , to be licensed under the terms of the BSD license ; and ( b ) the binary form of the modified source must , if distributed , be licensed neither of these by itself , nor both taken together , ensure that anyone will be entitled to access to the source code for that binary .
7.3
It is here that the BSD 's common wisdom has its force .
While a license of object code under the BSD license would presumably require that the source code for that binary also be licensed under the BSD license it does not require that access to that source code be provided .
We argue below that this may lead to a false sense of security for those developing on top of BSD code .
8 . Some Questions 8.1
Assuming that the conclusion of this paper is true , this raises the following questions ( which this paper leaves open ) : ( a ) is it legal / effective to modify the attribution clause in the old BSD terms ?
Arguably , the practice of modifying the license terms to add attributions is inconsistent with the license  later takers would only need to comply with the original attribution clause and would be free to fail to comply with the additional attribution requirements ; ( b ) how can the GPL also apply to software licensed under the BSD ?
The additional requirements of the GPL would not appear to be enforceable in respect of the BSD code .
If they are not enforceable , how can the conditions in the GPL , and in particular the requirements of clause 2 be complied with ?
( c ) the absence in the BSD of a requirement to make available the source code brings into question whether the BSD ought to have been approved by the Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) ( for failure to comply with clause 2 of the Open Source Definition ( OSD ) ) .
There has been inconclusive discussion in relation to this on the OSI 's license - discuss mailing list in 2002 , the upshot of which was that OSD # 2 does not impose a requirement on the terms of the license and is , rather , a pragmatic requirement relating to the software itself and the circumstances under which it is distributed in practice .
This leads to the troubling conclusion that it is possible for software to cease being open source software even if its license terms remain the same ; ( d ) when a company incorporates BSD code into some software , then ( to the extent the binaries are modifications of that BSD code ) the company is , by assumption , required to license that software ( including their own modifications and the source code for their modifications ) under the terms of the BSD .
We saw above that this does not mean that the source code must be released at all .
However , what of the situation where the source code subsequently becomes available ?
If that was the case , would there be no copyright infringement for copying and distributing that source code ?
This is discussed further below ; ( e ) what is the difference between a modification  and a derivative work ?
If they are the same , the scope of the BSD 's licensing requirement will be very similar to that of the GPL .
Note also that the BSD only permits the distribution of modifications , so if there exist derivative works which are not modifications the BSD does not address whether they can be distributed or even created  and in the world of licensing that is the same as a prohibition .
Compare the GPL which expressly ( but conditionally ) permits the creation and distribution of derivative works ; ( f ) can BSD software be included in compilations and are there circumstances in which a compilation including BSD code is a modification of that code ?
9 . The BSD Blind Spot 9.1
The troubling aspect about the BSD is not so much the scope of the license , but the common wisdom that its use entails no risks .
Assuming the argument above is correct there exists a risk ( set out below ) to organizations modifying BSD code .
This risk is perhaps not likely to eventuate but , if it does , its effects would be substantial .
9.2
If an organization modifies BSD code and releases a modified version then , as we noted above , the modified version will need to be licensed under the terms of the BSD license .
Further , we have assumed that that the terms of the BSD license give a recipient a right to copy the source code for that software , even if they only receive the binary .
While it will be of great comfort to know that the BSD license does not require the production of the source code , the BSD license permits anyone who already has access to the source code to distribute it .
Of itself , this would appear to substantially reduce , if not remove , the confidential character of the source code .
While a person may have held that source code previously under an obligation to maintain it confidential , is it not possible that the granting of a BSD license to that person will remove the requirement to keep it confidential ?
9.3
We must therefore pose the question  can an employee ( or , more likely , an ex- or soon - to - be - ex employee ) who has access to the modified source code disclose that source code to others if they acquire a copy of the released BSD binary ( i.e. as released by the organization ) ?
Even without this requirement , if the license of a binary version can affect the confidential nature of the source code for that version , then , depending on the timing , this may affect the ability to apply for patents which relate to the source code version .
9.4
The realization of this risk does require the confluence of a number of different circumstances , not least the enforcement of the original BSD license .
It should not be viewed as an automatic consequence of the adoption of BSD code .
Nevertheless , the risk of the BSD is that an organization may make a substantial investment in BSD code on the assumption that that investment code will remain protected by non disclosure only to find that they cannot prevent an employee , or third party who gains access to the code , from making that code public under the BSD license .
The end result here is very similar to that of other licenses ( such as the GPL ) , with the proviso that organizations adopting the GPL will usually do so with their eyes wide open to the consequences .
Those adopting the BSD may find themselves not only blindsided , but to devastating effect .
ALI 9.5
This risk would presumably be exacerbated under the ALI as each person is automatically assumed to have received a license  so the risk would not be contingent upon a person receiving a copy of the licensed binary .
10 . Conclusion 10.1
If the arguments in this paper are correct then we can draw a number of conclusions : ( a ) the BSD appears to require that modifications be distributed only under the terms of the BSD , and that this requirement therefore cascades down to subsequent generations of code ; ( b ) the license does not appear to permit the relicensing of BSD code under the terms of any other license , at least in so far as any restrictions in other licenses would seem not to be binding ; ( c ) there may be some scope for arguing that the term modification to the code is restricted or limited in some fashion .
However , as the license only permits redistribution of modifications  the BSD does not permit the redistribution of any derivative work which is not a modification ; ( d ) the BSD does not have a requirement for the distribution of source code .
It is not clear whether this means there is a deficiency in the Open Source Definition .
10.2 Use of the BSD is not without consequences .
While unlikely , the worst case scenario could be the inability to prevent the disclosure of modifications made to BSD code  in some cases a catastrophic result .
Use of the BSD license requires the same careful consideration as the use of any other open source license .
The safest option to follow in these circumstances is to assume modifications made to BSD code are themselves subject to that license , and that disclosure of those modifications may not be able to be prevented .
Rider What Does The Community Think About BSD Relicensing ?
There is an inherent problem with attempting to ascribe views to a large group of people , only the minority of which have been interviewed or reviewed .
As such , technically , this paper asserts without proof that the
BSD relicensing view is widely shared .
Posing any number of references may only be evidence of a specific subset of the community which holds the view , rather than the community as a whole .
However , in support of this paper 's assertion , we include a collection of quotations from documents which purport to be reference documents on the meaning of specific open source licenses or on open source licensing .
Except as stated otherwise each of these pages were accessed on 17 February 2006 , and the most recent version of the document which could be located has been used .
Note the new BSD license is thus equivalent to the MIT License , except for the no-endorsement final clause .
[ Note : on the analysis in this paper they would not be equivalent ]

The BSD License grants permission to do whatever you want , as long as you incorporate the copyright and a disclaimer of liability .
This is one of the earliest open source licenses .
Under its terms you may do virtually whatever you want .
For example , you could adapt BSD - licensed source code to create a proprietary , commercial product .

Licensing
The so - called new BSD license applied to FreeBSD within the last few years is effectively a statement that you can do anything with the program or its source , but you do not have any warranty and none of the authors has any liability ( basically , you cannot sue anybody ) .
This new BSD license is intended to encourage product commercialization .
Any BSD code can be sold or included in proprietary products without any restrictions on the availability of your code or your future behavior .
and
Developers tend to find the BSD license attractive as it keeps legal issues out of the way and lets them do whatever they want with the code .

The BSD gives very broad and extensive permissions to second parties .
But one permission it does not give is the right to change the license .
( 28 Jan 2000 ) Certainly someone could take my BSD source , compile it , and distribute it binary only .
However , those binaries still have my license on them and the recipients have the right to redistribute them themselves .

If you are just the slightest bit familiar with Linux then I am sure that you have heard of XGL .
It is what adds all of the realistic 3D effects to the windows that you drag around and the virtual desktops that you switch between .
Of course , one of the most popular features is probably the 3D cube for switching between your virtual desktops .
There is a new Firefox extension in town and it is called Tab Effect ( the screenshot above is from the extension , not XGL ) .
With the assistance of a little DirectX 8 ( and beyond ) it is able to provide transitional effects when switching between your tabs .
Now it is n’t exactly like XGL where you can manually rotate a cube for switching between tabs , but the animation makes it look like you are rotating a cube each time you switch tabs .
Honestly , this is the most amazing visual effect that I have ever seen in Firefox .
If you ’re one of those people who does n’t like a little extra “ eye candy ” then this extension wo n’t be for you …it does n’t make you more productive or add any useful features .
So now for the downside .
I ’m not sure if this will happen for everyone , but whenever I tried to create a new blank tab Firefox would crash if I was running this extension .
If I was just opening a link to a site in a new tab it would be fine , but that is still quite a huge drawback for me .
The extension was just released yesterday so there are a lot of kinks that needed to be worked out ( and reading through the comments confirms that ) , but I ’m sure it will continue to be developed since it is a new extension .
Not to mention that this could put Firefox ahead of other browsers in terms of visual effects .
Once it stabilizes I will definitely be adding this to my small collection of extensions !

“ Had Genarlow had intercourse with this girl , had he gotten her pregnant , he could only have been charged with a misdemeanor and punished up to 12 months , ” said Brenda Joy Bernstein , Mr. Wilson ’s lawyer .
Her client is not eligible for parole , only a reprieve that would not remove his name from the sex offender registry , Ms. Bernstein said .
The prosecutor , David McDade , the district attorney in Douglas County , west of Atlanta , says he has repeatedly offered Mr. Wilson the opportunity to resolve the case with a plea deal , adding that he would have to be treated similarly to the other defendants in the case , who are serving five - to seven - year prison sentences with a chance at parole .
They , too , will have to register as sex offenders .
Mr. Wilson is adamant that he will not plead .
“ Even after serving time in prison , I would have to register as a sex offender wherever I lived and if I applied for a job for the rest of my life , all for participating in a consensual sex act with a girl just two years younger than me , ” he told a reporter for Atlanta magazine last year , adding that he would not even be able to move back in with his mother because he has an 8 - year - old sister .
“ It ’s a lifelong sentence in itself .
I am not a child molester . ”
On New Year ’s Eve in 2003 , Mr. Wilson and several friends rented a hotel room for a party at which they planned to have plenty of alcohol , marijuana and sex .
One friend , goofing around with a video camera , captured much of the action on videotape .
A 17 - year - old girl reported after leaving the party that she had been gang raped .
The tape showed that she was severely intoxicated .
A second girl , 15 , also attended the party , but did not drink or smoke .
She had what she later said was consensual oral sex with Mr. Wilson .
But according to the law , a 15 - year - old is below the age of consent .
Mr. Wilson went to trial on charges of rape and aggravated child molesting .
After watching parts of the tape , the jury decided that Mr. Wilson had not raped the older girl .
But it was bound by law to find him guilty of molesting the 15 - year - old .
Jurors said afterward they did not know that the charge carried a minimum sentence of 11 years , including 10 without parole .
Juannessa Bennett , Mr. Wilson ’s mother , said her son was crushed by the Supreme Court decision .
“ We ’ve got people that is in power that do n’t have no emotions , ” Ms. Bennett said .
“ They do n’t sympathize . ”

Von Marion Kraske
I thought it unfortunate that the controversy kicked up by a few ( now retracted ) passages in Brian Fioca ’s article about WASP detracted from a proper discussion of the article ’s real flaw .
I addressed the controversial , less interesting sentiments in comment over there , but wanted to take a few moments for a longer commentary .
It took a while , but here we go .
The true failing in that article is a terminal case of corporate - management world view .
Let me quote a little out of order to highlight this :
Sure , you can write spagetti code in PHP 5 , but if you have a well designed framework that keeps PHP code outside of your HTML and in tightly structured classes , you ’re more likely to end up with code that looks and works and feels like Java .
The implication appears to be that anyone in the real world , if only they ’re using Java , writes well structured and maintainable code .
I think the real world has a few surprises in store for people who think that way .
As the saying goes , real programmers can write Fortran in any language .
Deemed “ hacker ” languages , scripting languages can be quick to write , but since they do not have many of the advanced features of compiled languages like C++ and Java , they have been prone to lax design practices , leading to code that is n’t efficient , stable , or maintainable enough for large solutions .
With the correct mindset and help from structured frameworks like WASP , this no longer has to be the case .
This claim is a crock .
PHP has a very low barrier to entry ; consequently , a lot of eye - wateringly bad programmers are writing code in it ; hence , a lot of code written in PHP is awful .
This is arguably a good thing : a lot of people who have small needs are empowered to meet them on their own despite having little skill , which would never happen if Java were the only option available .
To conclude that if these programmers did learn Java , they would suddenly turn out maintainable code , or that if a good programmer changed camps from Java to PHP , the quality of his code would suddenly degrade , is fallacious .
Again , you can write pretzel logic in any language .
Until recently , platforms like Java were more likely to provide a stable , proven foundation to design and build well designed code , however by their nature they introduce a level of complexity that takes extra time to overcome .
The entire “ more likely ” clause is a myth , perpetuated by a middle management population that has absolutely no clue whatsoever what makes code good .
Using scripting languages like PHP tended to produce code in a faster time frame , but it was often impossible to maintain the architectural integrity necessary for building maintainable , extendable applications .
This is true – in an extremely local sense .
The overall design of large Java systems will tend to be more convoluted than that of almost any system written in a dynamic language , simply because the contortions forced by Java require larger overall designs .
Java buries the intention of code under a thick layer of implementation details and typing bureaucracy .
Programmers are drilled to execute the requisite gruntwork in repeatable , predictable ways .
Moreover , doing so conditions them to design their own system to cater to these reflexes .
A maintainance programmer who comes in later will therefore easily be able to make changes to the mortar of an application .
Unfortunately , that does not ensure good high - level designs nor does it translate to easy refactoring of convoluted architecture .
Dynamic languages abstract away huge swathes of gruntwork and require less structure .
This means small systems have small implementations , which directly translates to better maintainability .
The price is a loss of exemplary structure and of conditioning , which requires better innate architectural skills and stronger discipline when building larger designs ; neither are strong points of the average programmer .
However , designs in such languages are n’t frequently large , because the language does not require large architecture for modestly sized systems – which the majority are .
I have seen as many examples of truly terrible designs in Java as I have seen examples of completely unreadable code in Perl .
Maintenance problems may manifest in apparently different ways , but their cost does not degrade appreciably when they afflict a system written in a “ more maintainable ” language .
The only objectively measurable difference is in the amount of required code .
Why would you want to stick with PHP even in situations when you can use Python , Ruby , or anything else ?
Simple .
Because it ’s cheaper to hire programmers that can write code in PHP .
And if you have a good technical lead and a well implemented framework , your cheap programmers are going to pick it up and run and write good ( and maybe even less ) code .
( Brian writes this in a response in the comments , not in the article . )
This is a fear - based middle - management hiring strategy .
Good developers know that “ cheap programmers ” will never hit the high notes .
You can hire 100,000 code monkeys and they will never produce the same quality as 5 stellar programmers .
All these quotations are pervaded by a disregard for the fact that programmers are craftsmen ; for the fact that that the language , framework , and whatever else they use in the course of their work is a tool .
Good tools matter , but the stated opinions read as if the programming language is the principal factor in the quality of the result , when the truth is that it ’s the programmers who ultimately matter .
If you hire good programmers , maintainability wo n’t intrinsically be affected by whether your in - house software development has standardised on Java , PHP , Perl , Ruby , Lisp , Smalltalk , Haskell , or Self .
Good programmers can appreciate and can create good design regardless of language , and they can absorb a new language easily enough .
Or as Joel Spolsky says :
I have never met anyone who can do Scheme , Haskell , and C pointers who ca n’t pick up Java in two days , and create better Java code than people with five years of experience in Java , but try explaining that to the average HR drone .
But whether your system is written in Java or an exotic programming language , every single programmer you hire will have to get acquainted with its architecture – which is hence the major factor in its maintainability .
Comparatively , the chosen language is barely more than a neglibility , assuming it has a good impendance match with the type of application being written .
In thinking about this issue , I am in fact tempted to recommend that you hire programmers who are unfamiliar with the language your system is written in – because if they still struggle with the basics of a new language after a month , you might want to reconsider their future with your company .
But that may be too bold a claim .
Even if , in lesser form , it has been made before .
The bottom line is that you need people capable of producing a clean , flexible and only - as - complex - as - necessary architecture for the problem they were tasked with solving .
And you wo n’t get that from an army of code monkeys , even if you hire 1,000,000 of them .
PERIGUEUX , France , Aug. 24 ( UPI ) --
From the point of view of Washington and Tel Aviv , Tehran 's latest offer of " serious talks " on nuclear matters is not being taken seriously .
Iran 's cat - and - mouse game over its nuclear project continues and the deadline of Aug. 31 for Iran to stop enriching uranium is just a week away .
But from Tehran 's point of view the diplomacy is going rather well , despite ( or perhaps because of ) Iran 's evident role in the dangerous brinkmanship that its client Hezbollah has staged this summer in Lebanon .
The fact that Hezbollah seems to have got away with it and Israel has been discomfited has boosted Iran and left the Bush administration looking even less capable of directing the affairs of the Middle East .

A detailed new report issued this week from Britain 's top foreign policy think tank , the Royal Institute of International Affairs , says " Iran 's influence in Iraq has superseded that of the United States , and is increasingly rivaling the U.S. as the main actor at the crossroads between the Middle East and Asia . "
Moreover , the report says , the Bush administration has directly helped strengthen Iran to become a major regional power .
" The war on terror removed the Taliban and Saddam Hussein -- Iran 's two greatest regional rivals -- and strengthened Iran 's regional leverage in doing so , " it says , adding that " Israel 's failure to defeat Hezbollah has reinforced Iran 's position as the region 's focal point against U.S. - led policy . "

Iran 's role within other embattled areas in the region like Afghanistan and southern Lebanon has now increased hugely , says the report , which was prepared with considerable input from British officials and diplomats , as well as academics and regional experts .
" While the U.S. has been playing poker in the region , Iran has been playing chess .
Iran is playing a longer , more clever game and has been far more successful at winning hearts and minds , " says Nadim Shehadi , one of the report 's authors and a fellow of the Institute 's Middle East department .
The report stresses that the Bush administration and its allies have yet to appreciate the extent of Iran 's regional relationships and standing -- a dynamic which is the key to understanding Iran 's newly found confidence and belligerence towards the West .
As a result , the U.S. - led agenda for confronting Iran is " severely compromised by the confident ease with which Iran sits in its region . "
" While the U.S. may have the upper hand in ' hard ' power projection , Iran has proved far more effective through its use of ' soft ' power , " the report says .
" The Bush administration has shown little ability to use politics and culture to pursue its strategic interests while Iran 's knowledge of the region , its fluency in the languages and culture , strong historical ties and administrative skills have given it a strong advantage over the West . "
This is not what the Bush administration wants to hear , least of all from the foreign policy establishment of its closest ally , and just a week away from the deadline by which Iran is supposed to stop enriching uranium -- or else .

The problem is whether the " or else " is remotely credible , given the obvious reluctance of China and Russia to help the Bush administration out of the briar patch .
China 's Foreign Ministry said Beijing " has always believed that seeking a peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic talks is the best choice and in the interests of all parties concerned . "
And a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Russia will continue " seeking a political , negotiated settlement concerning Iran 's nuclear program . "
Not much sign there of a solid international front against Iran , despite Tehran 's track record as detailed by the International Atomic Energy Agency as a proven cheat on nuclear matters .
It is increasingly clear to Tehran that the United Nations Security Council is not about to authorize any serious measures that might bring pressure on Iran to inhibit its sovereign right under the non-proliferation treaty to develop and build nuclear power stations and to run them with enriched uranium .
Study the small print of the NPT and the most remarkable features of this keystone treaty on the control of nuclear technology are how little it can do to prevent countries from going nuclear and how much they can get away with while staying within the letter of the law .
The treaty 's controls against proliferation are quite feeble -- just ask Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , North Korea or Iran , to name just three of those who made giant strides towards nuclear power status while supposedly constrained by the NPT .
And if Iran decides to walk out of the NPT , there is nothing under international law that the United States can do about it .

Moreover , the international controls that are available can prove surprisingly flexible when it suits the United States .
Under the deal that President George W. Bush negotiated with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , India is being given a painless way back into legality and " compliance " with the NPT ( which it has never signed ) because the Bush administration thinks it makes strategic sense to have a nuclear balance in Asia against China .
By contrast , the Bush team understandably thinks it strategically dangerous to allow the Ayatollahs , and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with his rhetoric of " wiping Israel off the map , " to develop nuclear weapons .
And so Bush has gritted his teeth and offered Tehran carrots as well as sticks , joining Britain , Russia , China , France and Germany to offer Iran a package of incentives -- including help with civilian nuclear technology -- if Iran suspends enrichment .
Will it work ?
A similar package of incentives failed to stop North Korea , which simply pocketed what bribes it could , and opened a secret new nuclear program after suspending the old one .
Iran may well do the same .
Or Tehran may buy time by proposing to sit down with IAEA , Russia , French and Chinese officials to draft an agreement of compliance and inspection that would allow Iran to undertake sufficient enrichment for nuclear power but put controls on the more intensive enrichment required to make nuclear weapons .
More cunningly still , Iran could offer to abide by the same rules that are being applied to India .
The point is that Tehran seems to have more options than President Bush , who right now seems to be faced with the choice of accepting a nuclear Iran , trying to impose some hollow sanctions , or looking at that military option that he always says is on the table .

Natural gas from Shakh Deniz will be fed into the Baku - Tbilisi - Erzerum pipeline , which is almost ready to receive and deliver the gas .
Note that this is a different pipeline to the recently completed Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline , which carries oil and which , between January and October carried some 4.8 million ( though it does not say if this is tonnes or barrels ) .
Interestingly gas from Shakh Deniz was also scheduled to be supplied to Georgia at a price of $ 120 per thousand cubic meters ( tcm ) .
This is just over half the price that the Russians have been asking .
However , since Georgia needs about 2 billion cu m per year it will still need to buy 1.1 bcm from Russia at the higher price .
Azerbaijan has been supplying around 80,000 bd of oil to Russia through the Baku - Novorossiysk oil pipeline which belongs to the Russian pipeline company Transneft .
Part of the intent of the increase in price to Azerbaijan was , apparently , to reduce their ability to supply Georgia .
Azerbaijan bought 4.5 bcm of natural gas from Russia last year at a cost of $ 500 million .
Apparently the thought was that , at the higher price , Azerbaijan would have to cut back on imports , and thus have less to make available to Georgia .
However , by switching their power stations to oil - burning , they appear to have thwarted this idea .
Well the situation East of Georgia continues to evolve .
I thought to begin there since , as mentioned in an earlier post , there are a number of small countries in the strip that runs south of Russia and over into China where oil and gas issues will make the nations a bit more internationally prominent .
Consider , for example , Azerbaijan .
It was only a couple of days ago that , in the face of Russia doubling the gas price that Azerbaijan cut off its oil flow to Russia .
It shut down its oil exports in order to fuel some of the power stations that would no longer be supplied with the Russian gas .
The original plan was to do this until the gas from the Shakh Deniz field becomes available in April ( though that may now have slipped to June ) .
Shakh Deniz has had a bit of a troubled start .
Back in 2002 , for example Rigzone noted that BP was delaying the start of the project , because of concerns with Turkey ’s commitment to buying the gas that would become available .
By December of last year test flows of gas had begun but there was still debate on the agreement between
Turkey and Azerbaijan , let alone letting some of the gas be sold to Georgia .
Unfortunately also immediately after the field came on production there was a leak in the one well in production .
Azerbaijan 's Shakh Deniz gas field has halted production due to a leak , just after its launch by operators BP and Norway 's Statoil this month , Azeri state energy firm Socar said on Tuesday .
The news is second major setback for BP in less than a month as the oil major was forced to cut oil production at the neighbouring Caspian Sea oilfield due to technical problems and reduce exports via a giant pipeline to Turkey .
. . . . . . .
A gas leak was discovered on the first well ...
Works have been halted and the problem is not expected to be resolved before January , " Socar 's first deputy head Khoshbakht Yusifzade told reporters .
Yusifzade said the leak had been discovered last week some 800- 900 metres deep in the well , which was expected to pump 5.6 million cubic metres of gas and 2,500 tonnes of gas condensate a day .
It was the only well pumping gas from the field while more wells should be drilled next year .
Socar 's President Rovnag Abdullayev said the first well should resume production within 20 days or around mid-January .
Industry sources have said BP cut oil output by around 40 percent to 400,000 barrels a day at the giant Caspian Sea oil deposit called Azeri - Chirag - Guneshli or ACG , from early December .
BP said production was back to normal on Dec. 13 .
In the meanwhile Georgia will still purchase some gas from Azerbaijan , though from other fields
And it appears that the agreement with Turkey has finally been agreed
As well as the 90 - day Azeri contract , Georgia will see additional volumes arrive from Azerbaijan when gas starts to flow from Azerbaijan 's Shah - Deniz field along a pipeline to Turkey from February .
Georgia will receive its own quota of 250 million cubic meters of gas per year at a price of $ 64 per 1,000 cubic meters , while Turkey has agreed to cede 800 million cubic meters of its 3 billion annual quota to Tbilisi at an undisclosed price .
And while some of the press is reporting that the dispute between Belarus and Russia is over , there are also reports that an agreement is not yet in place .
Russian government spokespeople declined to confirm Wednesday reports that President Vladimir Putin and his Belarus counterpart Alexander Lukashenko had reached a compromise over their two countries ' trade dispute .
. . . . .
However , representatives of the Kremlin press service , and the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade said they were unaware of any new developments .
The news agency ITAR - Tass subsequently cited the Kremlin as confirming the two presidents had at least spoken to each other .
Meanwhile Belarus has told Poland to be ready to start receiving oil again .
Incidentally , should the problem continue for some time , there is a potential for some relief for the west , via the pipelines of Ukraine .
Unsurprisingly , in reaction to the Belarusian - Russian conflict , Ukrainian officials of various levels made several statements , in particularly , that Ukraine was ready to replace Belarus and increase transit of both Russian oil and gas to Europe .
About 37,600 km of gas transporting pipelines with diameters of from 500 to 1400 mm and working pressure from 5.4 MPa to 7.5 MPa .
The Russian gas is delivered to the country from several terminals located along the Russian border and from Belarus .
Most of exported gas transits via Slovakia and then goes to other European countries .
Apart from it , part of the gas is transported to Romania , Hungary and Poland ( via Drohobych , Ukraine ) .
Total amount of gas transit via Ukraine , most of which is sent to Western Europe , from the time of independence in 1991 increased from 118 billion cubic meters in 1991 to 140 billion cubic meters in 2002 , after that it decreased up to 136 billion cubic meters in 2005 .
Under reports by Ukrainian Fuel and Energy Ministry , the figure is 78 % from the Ukrainian system capacity .
However the situation is not as useful in regard to shipping oil .
The oil transporting network in Ukraine contains 19 main pipelines and has a capacity of 114 million tons per year at entrance and 56.3 million ton at exit .
The oil transporting system consists of three main pipelines : Druzhba , Pridneprovsky and Odessa - Brody .
The Druzhba pipeline , which became notorious in recent days , divides into two branches in Mozyr ( Belarus ) and its southern branch comes across nine Ukrainian provinces and reaches borders of Hungary and Slovakia .
The rest pipelines have no exit to the western border .
The Odessa - Brody pipeline has exit to Polish Plock on paper only and , in reality , runs into Druzhba .
As Russia paid much more attention to diversification of its oil export to Europe in comparison to gas export , amounts of oil transported via the Ukrainian territory have been decreasing starting from 92 million tons in 1991 to 46.7 million tons in 2005 .
So , for the Ukrainian oil pipelines , which are almost idle now , extra amount of procurement could have been a good Christmas gift , however , it is not clear , how such plan can be implemented in a technical way .
In the meantime Hungary has started releasing oil from its strategic reserve , to cover the loss .
2007 Technology To Watch : Solar Thermal
Nice to be back after the holidays .
Before I get to the 2007 Technology to Watch , let 's take a minute to review last year 's prediction .
On January 1 , 2006 , I predicted that 2006 would be the Year of Thin Film Solar .
Well , let me be clear .
Despite some nice breakthroughs and interesting developments , I would not call 2006 the Year of Thin Film Solar .
Maybe I was a few years too early .
The company I mentioned in last year 's post , Heliovolt of Austin , won a Time Magazine award for the top 10 innovations of the year .
Honda ( ADR : HMC ) Dupont ( NYSE : DD ) , and General Electric ( NYSE : GE ) all entered the field .
Despite this good news , actual demonstrable products are in short supply and installed capacity is even more scarce .
Keep an eye on this one , though .
Solar Thermal is my pick for the 2007 Sustainable Technology to Watch .
This is not a new innovation .
It has been around for years , but this year , I predict that government policy , along with some nice technological breakthroughs will put this technology on the same level as more mainstream methods of energy generation , especially if oil and gas prices resume an upward swing .
By attaching the word " solar " to the technology , you are probably thinking about giant solar panels nailed onto your local treehugger 's roof .
Solar Thermal is not that technology .
This technology involves calibrating mirrors to concentrate the sun 's rays in a spot where water ( or some other liquid ) is heated .
Heated water can then be used to generate steam .
Steam is the driver of most turbines at most power plants , except that the heat is usually created from burning coal or natural gas .
With solar thermal , there is no carbon byproduct .
For years , solar thermal has found a niche in water heaters and heated swimming pools .
The technology is getting to where it can function on a utility scale now .
Manufacturing a set of mirrors with the size and integrity to do the job is a surprisingly difficult task , but manufacturing methods are getting better and the number of companies involved keeps increasing Regulatory actions will make this alternative attractive to many utilities .
Renewable Portfolio Standards are gaining traction nationwide , instigated by wholesale price spikes brought on by the oil shortages .
Put simply , these are mandates from state legislatures that a specific percentage of overall electricity generated needs to come from renewable resources .
The other renewable alternatives are facing obstacles .
For utility scale solar ( panel ) generation , silicon is still facing supply constraints .
As for wind , the size and scale of the new turbines is leading to some NIMBY - ism .
The status of some very important wind generation tax credits also remains - ahem - up in the air .
Finally , 2006 saw an awakening of the potential of clean energy among institutional investors .
Bill Gross , founder of technology incubator Idealab , founded a company call Energy Innovations , which makes rooftop solar collectors for commercial buildings .
New Energy
Finance predicts that 2006 venture and private equity investment in clean technologies to be up 167 percent over 2005 when all is said and counted .
What is most significant is that this investment continued even after oil prices dipped back toward historical levels .
This shows that the clean tech bandwagon has some serious legs .
Ne boste me kupili za bak šiš ali slo novinarstvo je šlo v kurac
Nekaj dni sem intenzivno že polna gnusa ( prej pa v manjših dozah do iste problematike ) .
In če naj bi bil gnus indikator , da svet ni prav dobro urejen in da ga ni mogoče preprosto urediti , potem je čisto upravičen tale moj gnus do slovenskega medijskega sveta , do nepravičnosti plačevanja , necenjenosti novinarskega poklica ...
In gnus se kar kopiči .
Pomaga , če se dobim s kolegi novinarji , in skupaj se nam vse skupaj še bolj gnusi .
" Najboljši " je bil nekoč novinarski kolega , celo predsednik Društva novinarjev Slovenije , ki je rekel , da smo si sami novinarji krivi , da se ne zorganiziramo .
Halo , v čem zorganiziramo ?
Novinarstvo je najbolj necenjen ( še posebno zato , ker ga " cenijo oz . poznajo " le po nekaj komprimitiranih osebkih ) , neplačan poklic v Sloveniji , kateremu cene določajo lastniki medijev ( in ne " nezorganizirani " novinarji ) , ki šparajo na ta način , da filajo mediji z blesavimi vsebinami .
Ker take teme ne potrebujejo pametnih in dobrih novinarjev , lahko to naredi že vsak za malo tolarjev .
In tako je že vsak novinar ali fotograf .
Ha , ha .
In zato , ker je lažje prevesti ali celo ukrasti reportažo in fotke iz neke tuje revije , ker so prevedene licenčne revije najcenejše , ker dobre " home made " reportaže , intervjuji , portreti , te prave novinarske zvrsti , ki jih pri nas sploh več ne zaslediš , ne zvišujejo prodaje .
Pravo novinarstvo je poklic , ki zahteva ob vseh mogočih " pacientih " , s katerimi delaš , skorajda bonificiran staž , veliko know - howa , raziskav , premisleka , ponovnih branj ...
In poklic , ki ima zelo majhen možen krog kakovostne zaposlitve , kar pomeni take , kjer se lahko resnično izpolniš .
Na prste ene roke lahko našteje dobre novinarske projekte - sobotna Dnevnikova priloga Objektiv me zadnje čase navdušuje , čedalje slabša Mladina in zraven bom prištela tudi " našo " revijo Jaz , ki nabr ž ne bo preživela zaradi vseh mogočih revij , kot so Nova , Lady , Moje stanovanje ipd .
Očitno v Sloveniji , kjer imamo tako in tako zelo zelo omejen ( s številom bralcev in ogaševalcev ) medijski prostor , še ni prišlo do kritične mase , do velikega poka , ko se bo vse obrnilo - na najslabše ali na boljše .
A kaj je bilo prej - kura ali jajce ?
Ali prej slabi bralci , ki berejo nezahtevne ( tipa ali Saška Lendero pije tako ali drugačno kavo zjutraj ) ali blesave vsebine ( nasveti za vsa mogoča področja življenja in izmišljije o slovenskih kvazi zvezdah ) , ki poneumljajo , ali slabi uredniki , lastniki medijev .
In na vzgojno ( ne govorim o otrocih ) medijsko vlogo ob takih vsebinah kar pozabite .
Bralci sploh več ne ločijo , kaj je dobra fotografija in dober članek in kaj je poden za 2000 tolarjev .
" Ampak ne boste me kupili za bakšiš " ( bak šiš je v arabskem svetu neke vrste podkupnina , ponavadi so to malenkosti , kot so malo denarja , Marllboro cigarete ... - vse te magične stvari , ki ti povsod " odpirajo vrata " ) , je rekla kolegica , ki mesečno z novinarskim delom ( za dva najuglednej ša slovenska medijska projekta , mimogrede ) zasluži 150.000 neto ( kar je mimogrede odlično za ta poklic ) .
Tarife za intervjuje so recimo 30.000 tolarjev , portreti 15.000 SIT , reportaže prav tako bedno plačane .
Sramotno .
In sarmotno je tudi to , da v novinarstvu sploh ne zaposlujejo več .
" Honorarci " je naša etiketa .
Če nočeš , pač letiš na cesto .
Novih honorarcev stoji dovolj v vrsti , pravijo .
Ko pa sama kot urednica iščem nov , DOBER kader , ga NI .
Pred dnevi berem v Financah , da odpuščajo na Delu , Dnevniku , najprej seveda honorarce , potem tistih veliko , ki po nepotrebnem sedijo na uredništvih .
Ni novinarskih novoletnih zabav , kaj šele božičnice ( na KAD - u , v tej državni firmi , pa npr. dobijo 250.000 SIT ) .
Še najmanj zaskbljujoča v medijskih vodah pa je novica , da so bili na Delu primorani odpovedati novoletno zabavo za svoje novinarje s Severino :-)

Mathematics and Computer Science Problem Seminar ( by Donald E. Knuth !)
Video lectures : CS204 ( Stanford University , 1985 )
Notes on problems ( pdf ) During the course students with Professor Knuth solve 5 problems which have not been solved .
According to D. E. Knuth course is given only once in two years because it takes him two years to think of good enough problems .
The goal of the course it to understand problem solving in general and not just to solve those 5 problems and to get into as many of the different areas of computer science research as possible .
" This was an experimental project where we'd have three or four cameras in a basement studio and we would film classes of about an hour , " says Knuth .
" We got a bunch of our brightest students and gave them extremely difficult problems .
You could literally see the Aha taking place .
People can watch the problem - solving process as it occurred . "
Over 25 hours of these sessions are available for viewing .

Also available are two five - session short courses about TeX ( 1981 ) ; twelve lectures about the implementation of TeX ( 1982 ) ; video recordings of eight history sessions about Computer Science at Stanford , taped in 1987 and featuring many alumni of our department ; and some reminiscences by Professors Feigenbaum , Floyd , Golub , Herriot , Knuth , McCarthy , Miller , and Wiederhold about the founding of Stanford 's Computer Science Department , The Living Legends ( 1997 ) .
Questions from audience and students are important to the learning process , according to Knuth .
Sometimes the expression of a more mature idea is n't the most interesting or effective way to learn you may learn more from how a professor reacts to an idea or a question .
He pauses , and then adds , People might learn a lot from watching me fumble around to answer a question .
