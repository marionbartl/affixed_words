Need to see a thousand meters in the dark ?
Want one eye that 's perfect for reading and another for long distances ?
Some eye surgeons are already at work reshaping corneas not only to fix patients ' vision , but fit their careers .

Laser eye treatment is two decades old , and adept surgeons have gone far beyond giving patients 20:20 vision .
Times
Online has profiled several such doctors , who offer to tailor their clients ' eyesight to their occupation .
Julian Stevens , who practices at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London , has given special forces members and fighter pilots the aforementioned ability to see a thousand meters in the dark , and he notes that taxi drivers could benefit from a similar procedure .
Stephen Trokel , who helped pioneer laser eye surgery , operated on a soprano who wanted to be able to read the music in the front row of the orchestra , as well as a New York Yankees catcher who needed to be able to see the ball coming out of the light .
Another group that favors the occupational ocular enhancements ?
US presidential candidates , several of whom have received " monovision , " which allows them to easily read with one eye and see far away with the other .
This combination eliminates the need for reading glasses or bifocals , and some politicians hope it creates a sense of youthfulness .

What do we have to thank for this custom technology ?
The space program .
Wavefront technology , which was developed by NASA to improve the focus of the Hubble Space Telescope , has translated neatly to the human eye .
The technology allows physicians to map the cornea and iris , enabling surgeons to make small , specific tweaks to the eye that result in custom eyesight made to order .

Junie Browning was recently arrested for assaulting three nurses at St. Rose Dominican Hospital in Henderson , Nevada , after The Ultimate Fighter ( TUF ) 8 alum was admitted for taking 16 pills of Klonopin -- an anti-anxiety drug -- " in an attempt to harm himself , " according to the Las Vegas Review Journal .
Browning , who was brought to the medical facility by two concerned friends , allegedly pushed a female nurse , as well as struck two male nurses , when attempting to discharge himself against their better judgment .
He then reportedly warned the staff :
" Do you know who I am ?
I will kill you and rape your family . "
Browning was labeled a " bad boy " after several drunken , and sometimes violent , episodes on the Spike TV mixed martial arts reality series .
He was nearly kicked off the program several times ; however , UFC President Dana
White gave him numerous chances to redeem himself .
Until now .
Apparently the severity of this latest incident has forced White to part ways with Browning and release the troubled fighter from the promotion , according to Yahoo Sports .
From White :
" He was given an amazing opportunity , but he has some serious issues that are beyond me and what I can do .
I ’m there for guys and I realize nobody is perfect and guys are going to get into trouble .
When that happens , I want to try to help and do something for them .
But he needs more help than I can give him .
I did what I could for him . "
The Kentucky native faces three counts of battery on a health care provider .
He was released yesterday from the Henderson Detention Center .
Browning most recently lost to Cole Miller via first round submission ( guillotine choke ) at UFC Fight Night 18 back in April .

1 . The big job boards like Monster and Dice have become practically useless for hiring top tier talent .
It is easy to quickly obtain a pile of resumes using these services .
However , this approach will have you shucking a heck of a lot of oysters to find a truly great Perl programmer .
Several professional recruiters I know have given up on these boards except for staffing entry level positions like help - desk and phone support jobs .
The odds of finding the proverbial rock star programmer on Monster are growing increasingly slim .
2 . Niche job boards will get you qualified leads , but not very many of them .
High - end job boards like TheLadders charge a fee to the candidates and are as much a den of recruiters as the mainstream sites .
I find it hard to believe that top - tier talent is likely to pay to be listed on a job board .
Caveat : I have not personally used TheLadders as part of my recruiting efforts , but did briefly have a subscription as a candidate .
The really niche job boards like the one at JoelOnSoftware do a good job at pre-qualifying the candidates through self - selection , but maybe too much so .
I ’ve listed a few jobs on this site for opportunities in Austin that generated almost no response .
I suspect this is a better tool if you are in a bigger market like NYC or the silicon valley .
Actually Joel ’s board does have a compelling strategy to draw higher quality candidates :
Trim back recruiter nonsense by forcing the advertiser to disclose in the ad who the candidate would actually be working for .
Asking advertisers to post their Joel ’s Test score .
Candidates who care about this are more likely to be passionate about their craft .
Despite my limited success with it , I ’d still recommend the site given that there really is no financial risk .
I can personally attest to Joel ’s “ If it does n’t work , you do n’t pay ” guarantee .
We got our money back promptly with no hassle when the listing did n’t net any interview - worthy candidates .
3. Use LinkedIn Strategically
I have it on good authority that LinkedIn is a pretty strong source of candidates who are only passively looking and currently employed , which are generally traits of the better candidates .
However , programmers do n’t seem to frequent the job board on this site as much as sales and management types .
That said , I ca n’t really vouch for its job board when looking for developers based on my experience .
However , never before have you had such unprecedented access to the innards of another company ’s org chart as Linked In provides .
A few quick searches containing the name of other companies in your industry will usually reveal developers with relevant experience in your industry .
This site is also used as a stealth way of looking for another job for people who do n’t want their employer to catch them on a job board .
I was just NETWORKING , I promise !
4 . The best candidates are n’t going to come to you .
There are exceptions to this , but I ’m betting that you would n’t have read this far if you are recruiting within a company that the best programmers already yearn to work for .
This advice is for the rest of us who do n’t have the luxury of offering a job that would be a showstopper on a resume or turn heads at RenFest / Comic - Con .
Some managers , especially new ones , whose only experience with recruiting has been as a candidate desperately seeking an audience with a choice company , have the impression that their role as a hiring manager is akin to sitting atop a throne as candidates compete for their favor .
Not exactly .
There is a pool of candidates who are going to come to you , and their names will quickly become familiar because they will apply to every job posting you open even over several years .
In most cases , there is a reason that someone else has n’t snapped up these people and absent evidence to the contrary you probably do n’t want to hire them either .
If you are n’t willing to be proactive in your search and sometimes take on a more subservient posture when dealing with candidates , you are eventually going to force yourself to choose from this pool .
The top guns may only hit the open job market once in their careers , and from that point forward get subsequent jobs through networking , which brings me to my next point .
5 . Networking is as essential for you as it is for the candidate .
Networking as a job - hunting strategy is a no- brainer , right ?
So what are you doing to make sure you are on the other end of that network for the right candidate ?
Your existing team of developers is often a great entry point into a pretty substantial network of developers .
Referral bonuses are the tried and true way to enlist employee help with the recruiting process , but often the prospect of working with a favored peer is a more powerful motivator .
Other benefits of this approach include :
The person who made the referral will to be invested in the success of the employee and likely will take an active role in bringing the new person up to speed .
Barriers to acceptance into the team will be reduced because the new person already has a relationship with at least one person .
You are more likely to get a true picture of what you are getting with the candidate without as much puffery as you might get interviewing strangers .
Warning :
This does n’t work so well with the mediocre programmers .
The best developers try to hang with people smarter than themselves .
Mediocre ones will seek out people to make them feel smarter .
Do n’t hire the wing - men .
6 . Focus your search on finding developers , not job hunters .
Employers are going to hang on to their best people and keep them away from recruiters , recruiting events , and by extension you .
I ’m not trying to imply that their bosses are actively prohibiting them from these types of contacts , but rather that they work hard to keep them happy and busy enough to not even try .
Developer conferences and user groups are a great way to contact engaged developers who may not be actively looking for work .
They even triage themselves into sessions so you can more readily identify them by their area of expertise .
The best emissary to send to such an event is a development manager or supervisor .
HR types are going to scare away the fish by being too sales -y and saying things like “ Do you know Sea Pound ? ” and many programmers tend to be too introverted to make a lot of contacts .
I ’ve a friend who recounted a tactic that had worked well at these events for him .
He wore a t - shirt to the conference that read : “ I ’m hiring developers . ”
7. Programming competitions
If you need a lot of developers and want them to triage themselves by skill AND aptitude , you might try sponsoring a programming competition .
I ’ve no personal experience with this approach , but I ’ve seen a number of companies try it .
It definitely sounds good , but be careful to understand what you are looking for .
These competitions seem to appeal to people who love puzzles , and those are types of programmers can often exhibit a pathology where they like tinkering and optimizing at the expense of getting a good - enough solution out the door .
8 . Do n’t expect to pay median salaries for top talent .
Often I see companies that claim to hire only the best , but their HR people argue that they should only have to pay the median salary as determined by salary surveys .
Try that argument at a jeweler or sports car dealership and let me know how that works out .
How can you charge $ 200 K for that diamond necklace when I can prove that the average piece of jewelry retails for $ 150 ?
If you want the top 10 % of developers , you should expect to pay at least in the top 25 percentile , and you are only going to get off that cheap if you bring something else to the table like a cool product to work on , good benefits , private offices , or some other perk .
9 . Get the muggles out of the process as early as possible .
If at all possible , do n’t force the candidates to endure even a phone interview with a non-technical person .
If you ca n’t avoid it , at least strip out any technical questions from the interview script that the person performing the interview does n’t understand well enough to talk about competently .
Let HR / Recruiters manage the scheduling , resume screening , benefits discussions , etc. , but do n’t give them a phone interview script with technical questions and let them lose on the candidate .
10 .
Be flexible with your requirements .
If you need a .NET developer , do n’t be a stickler for C# or VB.NET .
The best programmers can become quickly proficient in just about any language , make sure that the person screening resumes understands what keywords are acceptable substitutes for the ones in the job description .
11 . Branding is not just for cattle and marketing .
Branding is the act of creating and maintaining a positive image to grease the skids for selling people on your team or company .
It is often confused with advertising , but it is a distinctly different animal .
Branding is about managing your reputation and advertising is just one means to that end .
Creating an identity for your team that is attractive to potential recruits not only helps with sourcing candidates , but also adds ballast to your side of salary negotiations .
Brand characteristics that resonate with developers :
We have and hire the best developers – Top developers want to work with other top developers .
We work on cool products that your friends and family will be familiar with .
Our company is a meritocracy that values technical know - how above politics .
Our team keeps up with the latest technology and invests in training for developers .
Some techniques for advertising and reinforcing your brand :
Sponsoring developer conferences and events
Developer Oriented User Groups –
Often you can get a plug on the cheap by buying the pizza or contributing a few give - away items like t- shirts or books .
Support Open Source Projects under the name of the company .
Offer unusual perks that appeal to programmers and then submit a press release about it to local media outlets .
12 . Understand your needs and recruit for that .
This seems too obvious to mention , but is probably the easiest mistake to make .
Clearly define what you expect the new hire to do every day and hire someone that can do that job every day and enjoy it .
Some guidance in this area :
Do n’t hire based on interviewing skills unless you need a sales guy .
Do n’t hire based on management skills unless there is potential for them to lead or manage in the near term .
Do n’t hire a clone of yourself or your best employee , you already have that .
Hire someone that complements what you already have .
what you already have .
Hire for what you need NOW , not what you think you will need later .
13 . Ignore your instincts during the interview
Your tendency during an interview is to form an opinion quickly at the start .
Your mind is wired to preserve its own worldview and will often fight against all evidence to protect that initial judgment .
To remain objective and overcome jumping to conclusions , consciously decide to go harder on the people you like and easier on the ones you do n’t .
Otherwise you will be inclined to do the opposite and just reinforce a your initial impressions and waste a chance to learn more about the person in front of you .
14 . Trust your instincts when making the final hiring decision
Trust your gut whenever you are the slightest bit uneasy .
At my own peril I have several times learned the hard way that losing a good candidate is far preferable to hiring a bad one .
For the dozens of people I have hired in my career , there have been a number of people I was sure would be great and turned out to be just so - so , but I have never hired someone that I was unsure about that turned out to be a great employee .
At each step of the process separate your candidates into two piles :
Yes : From what I know so far , I could hire this person without reservation .
No : Everyone that does n’t pass the criteria for the yes pile .
Includes anyone who is a “ Maybe ” or a “ Yes , but … ”
15 . Just say no to puzzle problems .
First , see item 7 about the problem with logic puzzles .
Second , these things tend to annoy really good programmers who do n’t like make - work or meta problems .
Do n’t kid yourself that “ you just want to see how they think . ”
Knowing that someone can come up with a clever way to estimate the number of boat trips required to determine which switch turns off Mt. Fuji is fun conversation , but a waste of everyone ’s time .
Alternative approaches to evaluating a candidate :
Rough - out an application architecture on the white - board for this scenario .
Role - play with them a troubleshooting scenario for a challenging problem you have worked through .
Get code samples .
Ask them to describe an application they have built and ask probing questions to make sure you understand their level of contribution to that project .
16 . Write an interview script and test it on your current team
Write interview scripts ( for each job title / level ) and keep your notes for each candidate .
Good reasons to use standardized interview script
Less room for ad - hoc questions helps you avoid favoritism ( see # 13 ) .
Documentation of equal treatment of candidates to defend against potential hiring discrimination claims .
Easier apples - to - apples comparison of candidates ..
Tips for refining your interview script
Test it on current employees – Did it draw out the important positive and negative aspects of that employee ?
Tweak it until it does .
Get current employee feedback on the script – Any offensive / insulting questions ?
Do they think it would help or hurt the perception of the company for the interviewee ?
Review your interview notes one year after the hire .
Were there any surprises ?
Tweak the script to prevent similar surprises next time .
Review your script for and remove questions that require specialized knowledge that only a current employee would have .
17 . Do n’t leave people hanging .
If your company ’s recruiting process is interminably slow and out of your control , take it upon yourself to call your short - list candidates and frequently re-assure them that things are progressing .
The best developers are going to be highly recruited .
Do n’t assume that just because someone submits a resume that they are somehow locked - in and will be forced to give you first right of refusal .
I ’ve heard and been part of stories of companies calling back EIGHT MONTHS after a resume was submitted to ask for an interview .
This is crazy .
Even if by some miracle that person was still on the market after that long , clearly they have been passed over by just about everyone else in the interim .
Why would you even want them after so much time has passed ?
18 . Recruit former employees
Face it , your top people get recruited heavily and eventually will jump ship to see if the grass is greener , even if it is n’t .
Good employees that have left your team in are a great source of new hires for several reasons :
You know what you are getting and so do they .
Previous employees can become productive much more quickly .
You can recoup some of your previous training investment .
Even if you ca n’t convince them to come back , the fact that you want them back is an ego boost for them and will often create some goodwill and improve your branding by creating an advocate that works with a lot of other developers who you might be interested in recruiting .
Some preemptive steps to increase your odds of re-hiring a good employee later :
Give them a final chance to give honest feedback about the aspects of the job they did n’t like and communicate your desire to fix those things for the rest of the team .
Organize a happy hour and give them a great send - off .
Give them a souvenir of their employment to take with them that will remind them of their friends at the job .
Keep in touch , and not just when you need something .
Call to ask how their new job is going and solicit advice on things they like about the new job that you could try .
Continue to make sure they are invited to happy hours to keep the ties with their former co-workers strong .
I have re-hired several employees during my career as a software development manager who have turned out to be some of the best programmers on the team .
19 .
Mind your karma and do n’t make enemies
Do n’t be an ass when developers leave the company , whatever the circumstances .
It does n’t matter if you never want to see this person darken your doorstep again .
Also , treat every candidate who took the time to apply with respect , even if they were completely unqualified .
Word of mouth is a powerful thing and this industry is n’t as big as you might think .
Chances are that these people will talk to someone about your company that you one day will want as an employee or customer .

Even as we speak Iran is potentially starting the beginnings of a very possibly quite almost - real hypothetically nuclear weapons program !
Q : Oh no !
How many nuclear weapons does Iran already have ?
A : Counting warheads , ICBMs , mid- and long - range missiles , ABMs , tactical nukes , bunker - busters and submarine - based weaponry , the full nuclear arsenal of Iran at this moment is very rapidly just beginning to quite possibly approach a number just short of one !
Q : That makes them almost as deadly as the rogue nation of Whoville or the Islamic Republic of Candyland !
A : And they could be just months away from an actual bomb !
Q : But they 've been just months away from a bomb
A : I know !

A : Bombing them must be on the table , because it is an option , and all options are on the table .
Q : What about starving them to death with sanctions ?
Is starving them to death with sanctions on the table ?
A : In that an option ?
Because if it is an option , then it must be , as we have mentioned before , on the table .
Q : What about bombing their cities and burning their children and raping their livestock and feeding their people to thousands of millions of man-eating ants and piling their skulls into a heaping bonfire on the White House lawn while the President and the Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs of Staff dance naked in circles ejaculating wildly into the flesh - filled smoke ?
Is that on the table ?
A : It would be irresponsible for this option not to be on the table , given that all other options , as we have said , are on the table .
Q : What about leaving Iran alone ?
Is that on the table ?
A : No .
That is not on the table , because it is not an option .
Q : Are you sure ?
It looks like an option .
A : It may look like an option , but in fact it is the East Tunisian mock option , which over the course of many years has evolved to mimic the distinctive coloring and plumage of the true American option , in order to better evade and intimidate predators .
Q : If Mahmoud Ahmadinejad drops a penny off the top of the Empire State Building , will it kill whoever it hits on the ground below ?
Q : If Mahmoud Ahmadinejad drops a nickel , will he kill five people ?
If he drops a quarter , will he reestablish the Caliphate ?

A : And each and every time we plan to kill them , and each and every time we 're in the middle of killing them , and each and every time we plan to kill them again .
Q : And every time we go to kill them , we of course take every possible precaution we can possible take to avoid killing them , except of course for not actually killing them .
A : In a way , you could say that by killing them so conscientiously , we are actually doing them a favor .
Q : In a way , you could say that our killing them is the nicest thing anyone 's ever done for them .
A : In a way , you could say we have a moral responsibility to keep killing them , because if we ever stopped , who knows who might kill them then ?

Q : At the mercy of the Belgian threat .
Q : Could we one day live in a world without threats ?

Remember the classic “ Trek ” episode , “ By Any Other Name ” where Captain Kirk had to fend off an alien invasion by a group from the Andromeda galaxy ?
Well , it may be that our fictional hero was on to something .
No , our galaxy has n’t been invaded by aliens from Andromeda .
But a new study of the Andromeda galaxy reveals that it ’s a cannibal .
And that it ’s eventually headed our way .
Astronomers have long suspected Andromeda of being a space predator , consuming dwarf galaxies that wander too close .
Now , cosmic detectives are doing a massive search of the neighborhood and have found proof of Andromeda ’s sordid past :
They ’ve spotted leftovers in Andromeda ’s wake .
Early results of a massive telescope scan of Andromeda and its surroundings found about half a dozen remnants of Andromeda ’s galactic appetite .
Stars and dwarf galaxies that got too close to Andromeda were ripped from their usual surroundings .
“ What we ’re seeing right now are the signs of cannibalism , ” said study lead author Alan McConnachie of the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Victoria , British Columbia .
“ We ’re finding things that have been destroyed … partly digested remains . ”
Their report is published in Thursday ’s edition of the journal Nature .
Andromeda and our Milky Way are the two big dogs of our galactic neighborhood .
Andromeda is the closest major galaxy to us , about 2.5 million light years away .
A light year is about 5.9 trillion miles .
The massive mapping of Andromeda is looking half a million light years around Andromeda .
Astronomers have known for decades that galaxies consume each other , sometimes violently , sometimes just creating new mega - galaxies .
But this study is different because “ of the scale of the cannibalism and we ’ve found evidence directly in front of our eyes , ” said co-author Mike Irwin , an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge in England .
This type of galactic crash is common and the paper makes sense , said Harvard astronomer Mark Reid , who was n’t part of the Andromeda mapping team .
And just because Andromeda consumes a galaxy , it does n’t make it disappear , he added .
The cannibalism often just strips stars from where they had been , rearranging the night sky .
Most of a galaxy is empty space , so there is little if any crashing of stars and planets going on , Irwin said .
“ It would be a beautiful night sky , ” he said .
“ It would be quite spectacular . ”
The once and future main victim of Andromeda is a dwarf galaxy that circles it called Triangulum .
Eventually , in about 3 billion years , Triangulam , which once came too close to Andromeda and was stripped of some stars , will spiral into Andromeda , about the same time it comes crashing into our galaxy , said study co-author John Dubinksi of the University of Toronto .
The Milky Way and Andromeda are heading toward each other at about 75 miles per second .
They are so far away from each other that the big crash is a few billion years away .
And even that might be nothing more than a reshuffling of the night sky or the creation of one super - sized galaxy , McConnachie said .
Medical marijuana has been legal in California since 1996 , but its dispensaries and their proprietors have periodically faced crackdowns from federal authorities who do not recognize the state law , which was passed as Proposition 215 .
Supporters of the drug ’s medical use have been cheered , however , by recent remarks from Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. that those abiding by state law will not be made a target by federal agents .
California , whose $ 26 billion budget crisis has dispirited many residents , has toyed with the idea of legalizing marijuana , with a bill that would legalize and tax the drug scheduled to be taken up by the Assembly later this year .
The dispensaries already pay some $ 18 million a year in state sales tax , according to the Board of Equalization .
Laura Thomas , deputy state director for the Drug Policy Alliance in San Francisco , which lobbies for changes in drug policy , said the recession was forcing many states to consider “ untouchable topics ” as potential revenue streams .
“ In hard budget times people are willing to be more creative , ” Ms. Thomas said .
In Oakland , Measure F raises the tax on “ gross receipts ” at a handful of dispensaries to $ 18 per $ 1,000 worth of goods sold , and is expected to raise about $ 300,000 in new taxes .
That is not much money  the city just closed an $ 83 million budget gap  but even so , a spokesman for Mayor Ron Dellums said the mayor was grateful for “ all measures that will help with our budget situation . ”
For Mr. Lee , who plans to introduce a ballot measure this week  with an eye toward getting it on the ballot in 2010  seeking to legalize personal , nonmedical use of the drug , the election victory means he would pay about $ 42,000 more in taxes .
Not that he minds .
Not only is Microsoft reselling select Windows 7 PCs normally sold by its hardware partners , but the company is making sure they come only with the software it wants .
Yes , that means that if you buy a PC from Microsoft , it wo n't come with the usual " crapware , " though it wo n't be a clean install either .
Microsoft is still bundling its own software , including Windows Live Essentials and Microsoft Security Essentials , as well as Adobe software .
Last Thursday when Windows 7 officially arrived , Microsoft opened up its first store in Scottsdale , Arizona ( a second store is to follow in Mission Viejo , California ) .
As expected , the store was stocked with Windows 7 PCs from various OEMs , and Microsoft even went the extra mile by selling them at its online store , though only in the US .
It did n't become clear until recently , however , that Microsoft was doing more to these PCs than just picking them up and putting them on display .
" Trial ware is removed from the PC , " a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed with Ars.
" Microsoft Signature pairs the best PC hardware with a thoughtfully tuned software and services suite , taking your typical ' ready to assemble ' PC ownership experience to ' ready to run . '
For customers who purchase a Signature PC in one of our stores , our knowledgeable staff will help customers set up their passwords and networks , and tailor their browser , e-mail and other applications to their personal preferences before they walk out the door , so they can immediately enjoy their PC .
Microsoft Signature PCs also come with 90 days support . "
The new " Microsoft Signature PCs " initiative means the software giant is removing all preinstalled software from the computers it is selling , and loading them instead with full versions of programs of its own choosing .
We decided to check for ourselves , and there are indeed Microsoft Signature PCs from every PC maker Microsoft 's stores sell : Acer , Asus , Dell , Fujitsu , Gateway , HP , Lenovo , Samsung , Sony , and Toshiba .
They 're all crapware - free .
For the uninitiated , " crapware " is the term used to describe bundled software , usually trial versions or unwanted programs , which other companies pay computer makers to preinstall on their PCs .
This keeps PC prices competitive , but it also clogs up computers with useless well , crap .
A typical PC from an OEM can come with any number of third - party applications , many of which are a pain to remove .
Our favorite way to deal with such software is PC Decrapifier , a freeware program designed to remove or uninstall a specific list of unwanted software in an unattended fashion .
It currently can remove a total of 63 applications ( though this spans different versions ) that it labels as crapware , eight of which are Microsoft 's own software ( most are Office trials ) .
None of those , however , are being installed on Microsoft Signature PCs .
According to the Microsoft Store , Redmond is bundling the following applications on the PCs it is reselling : Microsoft Security Essentials , Bing 3D Maps , Zune 4.0 , Playready PC Runtime ( for WMC ) , Adobe Flash Player for IE , Adobe Acrobat Reader , Windows Live Sync , and Windows Live Essentials ( which includes Windows Live versions of Messenger , Mail , Photo Gallery , Movie Maker , Writer , Family Safety , Toolbar , as well as the Office Live Add - In and Silverlight ) .
Of that list , the first and the last are the ones most worth noting .
Microsoft announced in September 2008 that Windows Mail , Photo Gallery , and Movie Maker would be stripped away from Windows 7 and the company would instead be offering Windows Live versions of the products as part of Windows Live Essentials .
The company said it would not force ( but would encourage ) OEMs to include the suite on new PCs , and it would be including links in Windows 7 to download it .
Microsoft Security Essentials , on the other hand , does not have its own download link in Windows 7 , and the company said the software was being specifically targeted at users who did not already have an antivirus .
Microsoft also said it was perfectly happy with consumers choosing other security software , as long as they were protected .
While slightly different decisions were made for the two Essential suites , Microsoft 's reasoning for both has been quite clear : no deals regarding bundling in order to avoid antitrust issues at all costs .
It looks like Microsoft has found a loophole for its own rule .
The company 's lawyers have apparently come to the conclusion that Microsoft as a retailer wo n't have to worry about antitrust issues when including its own software on PCs that it sells .
Most Windows
PCs will of course not be purchased from Microsoft stores , so the initiative will only really be successful if users see real value in the software Redmond is preinstalling .
We personally prefer the software that is being offered on Microsoft Signature PCs compared to the usual crapware , as there are no trial versions and most of it we install on the Windows PCs we encounter anyway .
That said , we would still end up uninstalling some of the applications Microsoft is listing .
In March 2008 , Sony decided to offer consumers the opportunity to pay $ 50 to get a PC without all the useless software installed .
The test did n't get very far though ; the company killed it after the move raised the question as to whether or not crapware is acceptable at all .
Microsoft has been angered by crapware on machines for ages , but it particularly got annoyed in January 2007 , at the start of the Vista age .
The company made a lot of changes in the development of Windows 7 and marketing of Windows 7 ; now it appears the company is trying to change the software that comes with Windows 7 .
It 's a shame that OEMs are unlikely follow suit .
Hat tip to TechFlash .
The dream is over .
At least for one side .
“ Chicago was eliminated in the first ballot of voting for the 2016 Olympics on Friday , a stunning defeat for the city that was expected to be one of the two finalists , ” the Associated Press reports .
“ Not even the presence of President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama – nor a long list of celebrities – was enough to help the United States ’ third - largest city . ”

After Tokyo was also eliminated , the last two cities left standing were Rio de Janeiro and Madrid .
Rio won out , and will now host the 2016 Olympic games .
The Olympics bid became a political issue the last week as conservatives criticized President Obama for getting behind the Chicago bid effort .
As McClatchy reported Thursday :
Some Republicans and right - wing commentators are blasting him for going , saying it ’s a waste of presidential time when he should be doing other things , such as deciding on an Afghanistan strategy .
Some say Chicago itself is unworthy , calling it a crime - ridden city filled with corrupt Obama cronies waiting to line their pockets with Olympic - sized graft .
Some openly suggest that the United States should lose the competition .
A bold red headline on The Drudge Report gloats , “ WORLD REJECTS OBAMA : CHICAGO OUT IN FIRST ROUND . ”
Not completely satisfied , Drudge later added “ THE EGO HAS LANDED ” to his banner .

Another AP report notes , “ Thousands of people gathered in downtown Chicago stood in stunned silence Friday after watching the International Olympic Committee choose someone else for the 2016 Summer Olympics . ”
“ An audible gasp could be heard from the crowd , ” the AP report added .
“ Many stood for a few minutes , staring at the screen , and at least one flung his hands into the air in a crude gesture toward the TV screen . ”
Photographer Chris Jordan has published a series of images identified as dead albatross on Midway Atoll whose bodies are filled with bits of plastic they ingested .
Midway Island is an anemic little line of sand and coral reefs , way out in the middle of the Pacific .
Now , I do n't know Mr. Jordan personally , and have n't fact - checked the story behind the photos — but presuming it 's all as presented , this really is a horrifying set of images .
Birds that live as far away from civilization as you can imagine , their innards packed with petroleum flotsam ?
Wow .
The nesting babies are fed bellies - full of plastic by their parents , who soar out over the vast polluted ocean collecting what looks to them like food to bring back to their young .
On this diet of human trash , every year tens of thousands of albatross chicks die on Midway from starvation , toxicity , and choking .
To document this phenomenon as faithfully as possible , not a single piece of plastic in any of these photographs was moved , placed , manipulated , arranged , or altered in any way .
These images depict the actual stomach contents of baby birds in one of the world 's most remote marine sanctuaries , more than 2000 miles from the nearest continent .

For every action , there is an equal and opposite reaction .
This is true in the physical world , and even if you cannot clearly see how it applies in the social world , the fact cannot be denied that every action taken by a person or group of people has the potential for negative consequences .
A book written , a news program aired , a video filmed , a law enacted , a precedent set , all of these , no matter how benign the intent , have the potential to , and often do , affect our society , and therefore the lives of all , in various ways .
Turn off your TVs , folks , and find out the facts yourselves .
When faced with such potentially consequential actions , it is a natural reaction for people to feel overwhelmed and apprehensive , questioning in what directions they may take us and our society .
In the mainstream media in America , however , such questions are often dealt with in one of two ways : they are either left unaddressed , or portrayed as the most extreme version of those negative consequences , allowing for their quick dismissal .
An example of the former can be seen in the reporting on the protests at the G20 in Pittsburgh last month .
Few mainstream news articles and reports mentioned the fact that LRAD devices , or sound weapons , were used on the American people for the first time , but even those that did , decided not to even question whether or not this was a good idea .
This is but one example of many , including but not limited to coverage of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , third party presidential campaigns , the passing of 1,000 page bills like the Patriot Act or the stimulus bill , the appointment of a sitting president to the head of the UN security council , secret meetings of heads of state , the illegal arrest and detainment of American citizens without a trial and so on and so forth .
This list could go on for pages , so I will spare you the wasted screen space and move on .
An example of the latter can be observed in the media ’s version of the healthcare reform debate , in which the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research , a real panel of 15 individuals created in the Stimulus bill to determine the agenda of healthcare research in order to discover what ’s “ effective ” in healthcare ( see H.R. 1 , Title VII ) , and being given more authority in the proposed healthcare reform act to make recommendations to healthcare providers so that they may “ more informed healthcare decisions ” ( see H.R. 3200 , Title IV , Subtitle A ) , is reduced to a paranoid delusion about “ death panels . ”
Thus , real concerns about the council , such as the fact that the individual in charge of bioethics , Ezekiel Emmanuel , has written that doctors take their Hippocratic oath too seriously , and that healthcare priorities should be focused on those aged 15 - 40 , and not wasted on those younger or older , are never dealt with .
[ efoods ] Again , “ death panels ” are just one of a litany of reductive terms that obfuscate serious and legitimate concerns and turn them into fodder for smirking pundits ( “ birther , ” “ conspiracy theories , ” and “ tea - bagging , ” to name a few ) .
I would also include in that list anything that reduces a concern to a “ left - wing , ” “ right - wing , ” “ liberal ” or “ conservative ” issue , as it automatically eliminates that concern ’s credibility to those who identify with one team or the other .
So , now we must turn to the meta- question : why have such questions been stifled ?
Why has the mainstream media abandoned their watchdog role and begun reducing serious and normal public concerns to dust ?
What are the consequences of the media ’s actions ?
That is something to seriously be considered and dealt with ( although , of course , you wo n’t see it seriously addressed in the media ) .
We now have a situation in this country where people are being paid to discredit us .
Enough is enough .
We can no longer trust these people to research the issues for us .
I do n’t care if you sometimes agree with what they say .
Turn off your TVs , folks , and find out the facts yourselves .

Of the eight characters , three have been announced : classic characters T. Hawk and Dee Jay ( Dee Jay 's reveal coming in the latest issue of Famitsu , below ) , and newcomer Juri .
The rest could be anyone ; new characters , old favourites , a mix of the two .
We have no idea !

In terms of improvements to the game itself , producer Yoshinori Ono says that every character has been changed slightly based on comments from both players and the dev team , while an improved online experience is also promised .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Which begs the question : why an all - new title , and not just a range of DLC ?
Ono says the changes are so extensive that they could n't just be tacked on , so a disc release was necessary .
Those crying " RIP OFF " should know that the game " wo n't be sold at full price " , and that those owning both the original and Super will are in store for an as - yet - unspecified treat .
It 's due in Spring 2010 for the PS3 and 360 .
We 'll ask what 's up with the PC version .

Location : law school
it 's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests
Using that IRAC method we 've been learning about , a compelling brief on why we should hump each other ’s brains out .
FACTS : You ’re in my class at law school .
You are tall , dark and very masculine .
I find you quite attractive and it ’s really distracting .
I find reasons to look in your direction during class and I blatantly stare at you whenever we pass by one another .
You seem to be returning the looks but I can’t figure out if you ’re eye - raping me back , or if it ’s more of a “ what the fuck is this girl staring at ” kind of look .
I ’m not Megan Fox , but if I was a guy , I do n't think I 'd kick me out of bed , so I dare to hope it ’s the former ?
Anyway , we ’re expected to absorb class material sufficiently enough to one day pass the bar exam , and this is difficult when I ’m more focused on what ’s behind your zipper .
It ’s probably distracting to you as well for some chick to be gawking at you while you ’re trying to cram massive amounts of information into your brain .
( And I ’m thinking about cramming appendages of yours into orifices of mine . )
ISSUE : Should we have wild , crazy , meaningless animal sex ?
RULE : Distractions can be very detrimental to success in law school , and should be eliminated whenever possible .
ANALYSIS : As detailed above in the facts , my desire to be plowed by you is a major distraction from my studies .
It ’s got to be a distraction to you as well since it ’s probably unnerving to be stared at by a predatory sex - starved woman as if she wants to take a bite out of you .
Per the above rule , this distraction to both of us needs to be eliminated for us to graduate from law school and pass the bar exam .
Solution ?
We get it on !
I get it out of my system .
You not only get laid , but you get the added benefit of not feeling my eyes burning into the side of your head ( or your crotch ) all through class .
We move happily along with our legal education unimpeded by the distraction of sexual tension .
Afraid of possible disadvantages ?
I ’ll address any potential concerns here .
The quotes are you , and my response follows .
“ Will I catch any diseases ? ” Nope .
Clean as a whistle .
Just got out of a long - term relationship and have only been with one person for the past 3 years .
Got tested anyway though , and all is well in My - Vagina Land .
( Except for its burning desire to be filled with your throbbing manhood . )
“ Will you stalk me , or expect a relationship or commitment in return ? ” NO .
You get free NSA sex .
As mentioned above , I ’m recently out of a long - term relationship .
I ’m not ready for another one nor do I have the time .
“ What if it ’s really bad , and we end up having to awkwardly avoid one another in class for the next 4 years ? ”
I do n’t plan on it being bad , at least on my end .
Hopefully our encounter ( or encounters , if it was so crazy awesome we decided to make it an ongoing FB arrangement ) would go as follows :
We leave class after our respective long days of work and school , both cranky , irritable and in desperate need of blowing off some steam .
We go to your place or mine , whichever is closer .
Maybe we engage in various acts of foreplay , or maybe we ’re both ready to get to the main attraction so fuck it .
You look like you would be HUGE , but I will still bravely tackle that monster and try my best to deep throat the whole thing .
You then throw me down on the bed , floor , or any available surface , and have your way with me .
This would ideally involve some spanking , hair pulling , and / or explicit dirty talk .
“ What if a lot of women in the class stare at me , and I ’m not sure which one you are ?
What if you ’re one of the old or fat chicks , or really ugly ? ”
I ’m not going to describe my exact appearance because I will die of embarrassment if someone else in the class sees this and even speculates as to who I am .
( Particularly a man I have dubbed Leery McPervert who stares at me the way I probably stare at you .
I do n’t want that dirty old man getting a boner knowing I ’m all juiced up in class . )
Yes I know I have n't even identified the law school , but I 'm paranoid so bite me .
( I mean that in the vernacular sense .
But if you want to take it literally , I 'd enjoy that too . )
Anyway , I ’m close to your age ( twentysomething ) .
When I look at myself I see “ cute ” but I get told I ’m pretty , “ beautiful ” even .
I ’m not perfect , but I get hit on , catcalled and sexually harassed frequently enough to assume I must be at least somewhat doable .
I even think I ’ve seen you giving me a look or two .
Or maybe it ’s just wishful thinking .
CONCLUSION : For both of us to succeed in law school and ultimately pass the bar exam ( and for me to not end up on the Megan 's Law website for losing all self - restraint , walking across the room in the middle of class , and mounting you ) , we will need to have sex ASAP .
Sexual proposition affirmed .

One of the most remarkable aspects of the Obama Presidential agenda is how little anyone has questioned in the media or elsewhere why at all the United States Pentagon is committed to a military occupation of Afghanistan .
There are two basic reasons , neither one of which can be admitted openly to the public at large .
Control of the Afghan drug market is essential for the liquidity of the bankrupt and corrupt Wall Street financial mafia .
Behind all the deceptive official debate over how many troops are needed to “ win ” the war in Afghanistan , whether another 30,000 is sufficient , or whether at least 200000 are needed , the real purpose of US military presence in that pivotal Central Asian country is obscured .
Even during the 2008 Presidential campaign candidate Obama argued that Afghanistan not Iraq was where the US must wage war .
His reason ?
Because he claimed , that was where the Al Qaeda organization was holed up and that was the “ real ” threat to US national security .
The reasons behind US involvement in Afghanistan is quite another one .
The US military is in Afghanistan for two reasons .
First to restore and control the world ’s largest supply of opium for the world heroin markets and to use the drugs as a geopolitical weapon against opponents , especially Russia .
That control of the Afghan drug market is essential for the liquidity of the bankrupt and corrupt Wall Street financial mafia .
Geopolitics of Afghan Opium
According even to an official UN report , opium production in Afghanistan has risen dramatically since the downfall of the Taliban in 2001 .
UNODC data shows more opium poppy cultivation in each of the past four growing seasons ( 2004 - 2007 ) , than in any one year during Taliban rule .
More land is now used for opium in Afghanistan , than for coca cultivation in Latin America .
In 2007 , 93 % of the opiates on the world market originated in Afghanistan .
This is no accident .
It has been documented that Washington hand - picked the controversial Hamid Karzai , a Pashtun warlord from the Popalzai tribe , long in the CIA ’s service , brought him back from exile in the USA , created a Hollywood mythology around his “ courageous leadership of his people . ”
According to Afghan sources , Karzai is the Opium “ Godfather ” of Afghanistan today .
There is apparently no accident that he was and is today still Washington ’s preferred man in Kabul .
Yet even with massive vote buying and fraud and intimidation , Karzai ’s days could be ending as President .
The second reason the US military remains in Afghanistan long after the world has forgotten even who the mysterious Osama bin Laden and his alleged Al Qaeda terrorist organization is or even if they exist , is as a pretext to build a permanent US military strike force with a series of permanent US airbases across Afghanistan .
The aim of those bases is not to eradicate any Al Qaeda cells that may have survived in the caves of Tora Bora , or to eradicate a mythical “ Taliban ” which at this point according to eyewitness reports is made up overwhelmingly of local ordinary Afghanis fighting to rid their land once more of occupier armies as they did in the 11980 ’s against the Russians .
The aim of the US bases in Afghanistan is to target and be able to strike at the two nations which today represent the only combined threat in the world today to an American global imperium , to America ’s Full Spectrum Dominance as the Pentagon terms it .
The lost ‘ Mandate of Heaven ’
The problem for the US power elites around Wall Street and in Washington is the fact that they are now in the deepest financial crisis in their history .
That crisis is clear to the entire world and the world is acting on a basis of self - survival .
The US elites have lost what in Chinese imperial history is known as the Mandate of Heaven .
That mandate is given a ruler or ruling elite provided they rule their people justly and fairly .
When they rule tyrannically and as despots , oppressing and abusing their people , they lose that Mandate of Heaven .
If the powerful private wealthy elites that have controlled essential US financial and foreign policy for most of the past century or more ever had a “ mandate of Heaven ” they clearly have lost it .
The domestic developments towards creation of an abusive police state with deprivation of Constitutional rights to its citizens , the arbitrary exercise of power by non elected officials such as Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and now Tim Geithner , stealing trillion dollar sums from taxpayers without their consent in order to bailout the bankrupt biggest Wall Street banks , banks deemed “ Too Big To Fail , ” this all demonstrates to the world they have lost the mandate
In this situation , the US power elites are increasingly desperate to maintain their control of a global parasitical empire , called deceptively by their media machine , “ globalization . ”
To hold that dominance it is essential that they be able to break up any emerging cooperation in the economic , energy or military realm between the two major powers of Eurasia that conceivably could pose a challenge to future US sole Superpower control — China in combination with Russia .
Each Eurasian power brings to the table essential contributions .
China has the world ’s most robust economy , a huge young and dynamic workforce , an educated middle class .
Russia , whose economy has not recovered from the destructive end pf the Soviet era and of the primitive looting during the Yeltsin era , still holds essential assets for the combination .
Russia ’s nuclear strike force and its military pose the only threat in the world today to US military dominance , even if it is largely a residue of the Cold War .
The Russian military elites never gave up that potential .
As well Russia holds the world ’s largest treasure of natural gas and vast reserves of oil urgently needed by China .
The two powers are increasingly converging via a new organization they created in 2001 known as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) .
That includes as well as China and Russia , the largest Central Asia states Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan .
The purpose of the alleged US war against both Taliban and Al Qaeda is in reality to place its military strike force directly in the middle of the geographical space of this emerging SCO in Central Asia .
Iran is a diversion .
The main goal or target is Russia and China .
Officially , of course , Washington claims it has built its military presence inside Afghanistan since 2002 in order to protect a “ fragile ” Afghan democracy .
It ’s a curious argument given the reality of US military presence there .
In December 2004 , during a visit to Kabul , US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld finalized plans to build nine new bases in Afghanistan in the provinces of Helmand , Herat , Nimrouz , Balkh , Khost and Paktia .
The nine are in addition to the three major US military bases already installed in the wake of its occupation of Afghanistan in winter of 2001 - 2002 , ostensibly to isolate and eliminate the terror threat of Osama bin Laden .
The Pentagon built its first three bases at Bagram Air Field north of Kabul , the US ’ main military logistics center ; Kandahar Air Field , in southern Afghanistan ; and Shindand Air Field in the western province of Herat .
Shindand , the largest US base in Afghanistan , was constructed a mere 100 kilometers from the border of Iran , and within striking distance of Russia as well as China .
Afghanistan has historically been the heartland for the British - Russia Great Game , the struggle for control of Central Asia during the 19th and early 20th Centuries .
British strategy then was to prevent Russia at all costs from controlling Afghanistan and thereby threatening Britain ’s imperial crown jewel , India .
Afghanistan is similarly regarded by Pentagon planners as highly strategic .
It is a platform from which US military power could directly threaten Russia and China , as well as Iran and other oil - rich Middle East lands .
Little has changed geopolitically over more than a century of wars .
Afghanistan is in an extremely vital location , straddling South Asia , Central Asia , and the Middle East .
Afghanistan also lies along a proposed oil pipeline route from the Caspian Sea oil fields to the Indian Ocean , where the US oil company , Unocal , along with Enron and Cheney ’s Halliburton , had been in negotiations for exclusive pipeline rights to bring natural gas from Turkmenistan across Afghanistan and Pakistan to Enron ’s huge natural gas power plant at Dabhol near Mumbai .
Karzai , before becoming puppet US president , had been a Unocal lobbyist .
Al Qaeda does n’t exist as a threat
The truth of all this deception around the real purpose in Afghanistan becomes clear on a closer look at the alleged “ Al Qaeda ” threat in Afghanistan .
According to author Erik Margolis , prior to the September 11,2001 attacks , US intelligence was giving aid and support both to the Taliban and to Al Qaeda .
Margolis claims that “ The CIA was planning to use Osama bin Laden ’s Al Qaeda to stir up Muslim Uighurs against Chinese rule , and Taliban against Russia ’s Central Asian allies . ”
The US clearly found other means of stirring up Muslim Uighurs against Beijing last July via its support for the World Uighur Congress .
But the Al Qaeda “ threat ” remains the lynchpin of Obama US justification for his Afghan war buildup .
Now , however , the National Security Adviser to President Obama , former Marine Gen. James Jones has made a statement , conveniently buried by the friendly US media , about the estimated size of the present Al Qaeda danger in Afghanistan .
Jones told Congress , “ The al - Qaeda presence is very diminished .
The maximum estimate is less than 100 operating in the country , no bases , no ability to launch attacks on either us or our allies . ”
That means that Al - Qaeda , for all practical purposes , does not exist in Afghanistan .
Oops …
Even in neighboring Pakistan , the remnants of Al - Qaeda are scarcely to be found .
The Wall Street Journal reports , “ Hunted by US drones , beset by money problems and finding it tougher to lure young Arabs to the bleak mountains of Pakistan , al Qaeda is seeing its role shrink there and in Afghanistan , according to intelligence reports and Pakistan and U.S. officials .
For Arab youths who are al Qaeda ’s primary recruits , ‘it ’s not romantic to be cold and hungry and hiding , ’ said a senior U.S. official in South Asia . ”
If we follow the statement to its logical consequence we must conclude then that the reason German soldiers are dying along with other NATO youth in the mountains of Afghanistan has nothing to do with “ winning a war against terrorism . ”
Conveniently most media chooses to forget the fact that Al Qaeda to the extent it ever existed , was a creation in the 1980 ’s of the CIA , who recruited and trained radical muslims from across the Islamic world to wage war against Russian troops in Afghanistan as part of a strategy developed by Reagan ’s CIA head Bill Casey and others to create a “ new Vietnam ” for the Soviet Union which would lead to a humiliating defeat for the Red Army and the ultimate collapse of the Soviet Union .
Now US NSC head Jones admits there is essentially no Al Qaeda anymore in Afghanistan .
Perhaps it is time for a more honest debate from our political leaders about the true purpose of sending more young to die protecting the opium harvests of Afghanistan .

Following are remarks delivered by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper to New York business leaders .
Good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
First of all , thank you Marie - Josée Kravis for your very kind and warm introduction .
Greetings to the former U.S. Ambassador to Canada , Gordon Giffin , and to our Canadian Consul General here in New York , Dan Sullivan .
Greetings as well to Kelly Johnston , chair of the Canadian - American Business Council , and to John Moore , president of the Canadian Association of New York .
I want to thank to both of you and the distinguished members of your respective organizations for hosting me here this evening .
I especially want to thank you for the work you do to strengthen Canada - U.S. relations .
Ours is not only the largest two - way trading relationship in human history , not only one of its most enduring alliances , but it is a deep friendship unmatched by any other two nations .
It is a very close relationship , a family - like relationship , and like any such relationship , it requires care , dialogue and understanding , so I salute both of your organizations for the ongoing contributions you are making to strengthening the ties that bind us .
I 'm very glad to have this opportunity to speak to you tonight during this , one of the most extraordinary times in our economic history .
As a student of economics , I spent much of my early life studying and learning about the powerful economic forces that shape our lives and our destinies .
The first global recession of the 21st century has taught us all some new lessons or , I would be inclined to say as an economist , reminded us of some older lessons about those economic forces .
And governments , policy - makers and business leaders around the world are now assessing these lessons and drawing the conclusions that will guide future action .
As this comparative work is carried out , I 'm here to draw attention to the Canadian experience , and let me summarize it .
None of the roots of the recession are to be found in Canada , and Canada , while it has been significantly impacted , is emerging from the global recession in a strong position .
Despite the turbulence of recent months , Canadian banks are secure , our markets are expanding , our stimulus is working , our taxes are falling , our long - term fiscal position is solid , and our broader economic assets remain intact .
If we stay the course , Canada 's future has never looked so bright .
Now , ladies and gentlemen , the foundations of this strong position are rooted in a sound economic philosophy .
Our Conservative Government is committed to open borders and free markets , while understanding that markets require prudent , transparent regulation and oversight .
Markets are also supported over time by a commitment to social cohesion and responsible social objectives .
But likewise , those require long - term fiscal discipline with low and predictable taxes .
This is the approach that has guided our actions from the day we took office almost four years ago .
Now , of course , Canada is still first and foremost part of the global economy .
So let me just comment for a moment on the global situation .
I would say this : while we all recognise hopeful signs , the global recovery is fragile .
None of us are fully through it , but the light is there at the end of the tunnel if we are clear on the way forward and stay the course .
In particular , we must not waver in our focus on the economy .
This was the message I brought to Washington this week , and this will be the message Canada brings to the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh next week .
The G20 countries must continue their efforts to fix the financial sector .
There are still toxic assets that must be purged from the international financial system .
Where they have failed , better systems of domestic oversight must be put in place , and there should be international peer review of those domestic regulations .
We cannot repeat the mistakes that almost created a financial collapse worldwide a year ago .
This is what President Obama said here in New York a few days ago , and I share his view on that .
We must also maintain a concerted effort to beat back the forces of protectionism and keep our trade flows expanding .
And we must continue implementing stimulus measures until we see a much stronger rebound in private investment .
But at the same time , there must be exit plans put in place from high levels of government deficits and debt so that capital investment in the private sector is not eventually crowded out .
I mentioned that Canada 's situation , though seriously hit by the global recession , remains relatively strong .
As Marie - Josée mentioned , Canada was the last major industrialized country dragged into the global recession .
As late as last summer , our economy was still expanding .
We had a low unemployment rate , net job creation and government surpluses .
Although our economy had been strong , we 'd also at the same time avoided certain excesses , the so - called bubbles in the housing , consumer and financial sectors .
But Canada was hit late last fall and early this year by the effects of the global recession , and of course affected by it principally through the effects on our export sector .
And yet , as early as the second quarter of this year , we have started to see significant upticks in home investment and consumer spending , especially in auto sales .
By June , according to the latest data , Canada 's economy had edged back into positive growth territory .
The trend is expected to continue through the last half of this year and through next year .
In August , Canada defied expectations and recorded a net increase in employment led by the creation of nearly 50,000 new jobs in the private sector .
Canadian housing starts have also exceeded expectations , advancing 12 percent in August alone .
Now , all of this still only adds up to the beginnings of a fragile recovery , as I said .
Far too many Canadians are still out of work and still suffering genuine hardship .
But proportionally speaking , we lost less than half as many jobs as the U.S. over the past 18 months .
Our unemployment rate is now a full percentage point lower than yours , something which has not happened in more than 30 years .
In fact , in relative terms , it has been a more moderate recession in Canada than in most other developed countries .
The reasons for this are many and complex .
But they have much to do with Canada 's underlying strengths .
To paraphrase Warren Buffet , as the tide went out last year , the crisis exposed those who had been swimming naked :
But it turns out that Canada was not only no skinny - dipper , she was also one of the strongest swimmers .
First , Canada 's financial sector , Canada 's banks in particular , are strong .
Thanks to their good management as well as to our prudent but not overly heavy - handed financial regulatory system , Canadian banks largely stayed out of sub - prime mortgages and mortgage - backed securities .
They remained well capitalized , stable and secure .
None have needed bailouts .
When our banks were squeezed with the worldwide credit crunch , our government worked with them to bolster liquidity and to help ensure access to credit for Canadian consumers and business .
But let me be clear : our government does not today own any commercial bank in Canada .
It is an entirely private sector .
In fact , three of the top ten banks in North America are now Canadian .
Our share of the international financial services sector is growing , as is our global reputation for prudent regulation of our financial system .
That 's one of the reasons we have been co-chair of the G20 working group on Enhancing Sound Regulation and Strengthening Transparency .
In that capacity , Canada has been leading the world on dealing with these questions at the international level .
A second reason for Canada 's relatively strong economic performance is our unwavering commitment to free trade and open markets .
In fact , tonight in Montreal we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the coming to office of the Mulroney Government , the Conservative Government that initiated the first modern comprehensive free trade agreement between our two countries , which of course subsequently became NAFTA .
These agreements finally laid to rest the ambivalence Canada had had , through much of our history , towards free trade .
In response to the economic crisis and its effects on trade and the rise of protectionist forces , we in Canada have redoubled our efforts to keep trade flowing .
We 've been very outspoken about this at the international level .
Our domestic stimulus package did not include domestic procurements .
In fact , on the contrary , it included unilateral cuts to Canadian tariffs .
We 've also been aggressively pursuing new free trade agreements .
Canada has concluded agreements with eight more countries since our government took office , and we are in numerous other talks , including historic economic partnership negotiations with the European Union .
And of course , we have been working diligently with the White House and Congress to maintain Canada - U.S. trade flows and improve the security and efficiency of our border crossings .
The third reason Canada 's economy has held up comparatively well has been our effective implementation of stimulus measures .
In the first year of the crisis - in fact , way back in fall of 2007 - we cut taxes aggressively while maintaining a balanced budget .
This helped keep our domestic economy out of recession for some time .
When the situation became more serious , as I mentioned , through the export sector , we responded with large - scale spending , we cut red tape in project approvals , and we have implemented it rapidly in coordination with our provinces and municipalities .
Our Economic Action Plan mobilizes more than four percent of Canada 's GDP , making it one of the largest stimulus packages in the G7 .
It began in March .
By June , 80 percent of the money was already committed to specific projects .
This is sustaining and creating jobs .
It is helping the workers and communities hardest hit by extending Employment Insurance benefits and expanding skills training , and it is keeping credit flowing to ensure that affordable financing is available to Canadian consumers and businesses .
But despite the benefits of these measures in the short term , the thing I want to emphasize to you is that Canada 's stimulus spending is overwhelmingly focused on investments of a long - term nature : highways , ports , borders , border crossings , excuse me , bridges , universities and colleges , scientific and technological research and development .
We are investing in the critical economic architecture of Canada 's future prosperity .
I also want to assure you that we are clear on our exit strategy from these fiscal measures .
First of all , as I 've mentioned before , Canada 's budget was in surplus when the recession began , which is obviously an enormous advantage in exiting .
Second , because our focus has been on rapid implementation of projects that could be launched immediately , we have made our funds time - limited .
Stimulus spending will end in the second year , when we expect a robust recovery to be taking hold .
All this means that despite our large - scale spending , our deficit is one of the smallest in the developed world .
Our debt - to - GDP ratio , which was the lowest in the G7 going into this recession by far , will be the lowest at the end of this recession , by far .
In fact , it will be less than half the G7 average .
While other countries will have to raise taxes and employ significant absolute reductions in government spending , our taxes will continue to fall while our budget balance gradually recovers .
For example , we have been and will continue to be cutting the general corporate income tax rate , as was mentioned .
It was 22 percent , over 22 percent in fact , when we took office .
It is 19 percent today .
It will be at 15 percent by 2012 , and we will achieve the lowest overall tax rate in the G7 on new business investment by next year .
On the personal tax side , Tax Freedom Day in Canada now arrives 20 days earlier than when our Conservative Government first came to office .
In fact , the federal tax burden in Canada is falling to its lowest level in almost 50 years .
Our performance has vaulted Canada into ninth place in the World Economic Forum 's national economic rankings this year , up from 13th place in 2007 , now ahead of Britain , South Korea , Hong Kong and the Netherlands .
These comparative financial , economic and fiscal strengths make Canada one of the most attractive places in the world to invest .
In fact , I would argue , make it the platform from which to do business in North America in the coming generation .
But they do n't tell the whole story , the full story .
Canada does have other attributes worth mentioning .
I could go on at length : our highly educated and mobile workforce , our culturally diverse yet harmonious society .
But the one I do want to emphasize with you is our resource endowment , particularly in that most vital of resources , energy .
Canada holds a vast storehouse of the energy resources that will fuel the next round of global growth .
We are the world 's seventh largest crude oil producer with the second largest proven reserves .
We are the third largest natural gas producer , the third largest hydroelectric generator , the largest producer of uranium , and by far the largest supplier of all of these commodities to the United States .
We are also - and this is important , because it is more than a question of volume - we are also an American energy supplier that is simultaneously growing , stable and market - oriented .
In other words , we are not just critical to the volume of your energy , but to the security of your energy supply as well .
In short , Canada is emerging as an energy superpower , and through the Canada - U.S. Clean Energy Dialogue , we are working closely with the Obama administration going into the Copenhagen meeting on climate change .
We want to also develop clean energy technologies and a North American approach on emissions reductions to ensure we are a green energy superpower as well .
Now , ladies and gentlemen , let me just conclude by observing that historically we Canadians have been known as a polite , quiet and self - effacing people , but in my view , as you may have noticed , this is no time for Canadians to hide our light under a bushel .
A few months ago , The Economist magazine carried a headline calling Canada , quote , " A country that got things right . "
We have all suffered from the global economic recession , but Canada 's management of its economy and its financial system is a success story of which we can be justifiably proud , and on which we can build .
In other words , Canada got it right .
We are emerging from the global recession in a strong position , and our government is committed to the economic philosophy which is the basis of that strength .
We are also equally committed to being a positive and productive contributor to the resolution of the economic and other challenges with which the world is confronted , and in all of those things , let me remind you that there is no relationship to which we are more committed and of which we are prouder than our relationship with the government and the people of the United States of America .
So on that note , thank you once again for inviting me here this evening , to this great city .
# 30 For the Man Who Has Everything - GTA 4
Oct. 28 , 2009  --
What might seem mundane to some -– a person 's feet or the sound of somebody 's sneeze - – can be a real turn on for others .
Take the Texas man , for instance , who was arrested last month after investigators learned he had been blowing pepper into an employee 's face to make her sneeze .
The man , whose identity was not revealed at the time of his arrest , told authorities that he finds a woman 's sneeze to be sexually arousing .
A man in Malaysia was arrested earlier this year for stealing more than 70 pairs of panties from women to satisfy his underwear fetish .
And , in Florida , a 35 - year - old man is awaiting sentencing after confessing that his foot fetish led him to break into the homes of sleeping children so he could touch their feet .
Sneezes , underwear and feet are among the many objects of arousal experienced by patients suffering from paraphilia , the medical term for the sexual deviance triggered by objects or situations that are not typically considered erotic , medical professionals say .
" If it 's out there , somebody somewhere is sexually attracted to it , " said Joseph Plaud , the director of Applied Behavioral Consultants in Whitinsville , Mass . , and a practicing clinical psychologist .
Plaud , who has never encountered a person with a sneezing fetish , said the most common fetishes he treats are those stemming from specific parts of a body .
" I 've seen it all by now but the most common fetishes involve human body parts , like feet , hands or elbows , " Plaud said .
Fetishes involving women 's underwear is also not unusual , said Plaud , explaining that they are likely attractive to people because of their proximity to a woman 's genital region .
" It 's that sexual excitement via association , " said Plaud , adding that feet are often the object of fetishes because they lead to a leg , which leads to genitals .
He 's also familiar with hair and leather fetishes .
An estimated 2 to 4 percent of males have a fetish arousal pattern , said Washington , D.C. , psychologist Barry McCarthy , who authored the 2008 book " Men 's Sexual Health . "
While it is commonly believed that men alone develop fetishes , more and more women have been seeking treatment in recent years , psychologists told ABCNews.com .
" Fetishes usually develop in childhood or adolescence and are controlled by this combination of high secrecy , high eroticism and high shame , " McCarthy said .
" It 's a poisonous combination .
" There are some men who are extremely erotically charged to full - length boots on women and would not be charged by anything else .
Usually , this is due to an experience in childhood that , for whatever reason , gave a powerful sexual charge to that object that the man then masturbated to exclusively . "
Dr. Mark Schwartz , a practicing psychologist in St. Louis , said patients who develop fetishes have often been victims of sexual trauma earlier in life .
" Usually , when someone has a bizarre arousal pattern , there has been something in their past that has made them susceptible to something deviant , or something unusual occurred , " Schwartz said .
Schwartz said that individuals who are molested as children by a predator who used a pillow to keep them from screaming might later develop a fetish for erotic asphyxiation .
" In the first 10 years of someone 's life , there is hardwiring of sexual arousals and then , at puberty , it sort of turns on , " Schwartz said .
" Then , over time , [ the fetish ] gets cemented through the repetition of masturbation to the arousing object and it becomes relatively permanent . "
The permanency of an individual 's fetish can sometimes be made worse by the Internet , a place where there is often a group or chat room dedicated to even the most outlandish sexual desires , he said .
" I treated a patient who would try to strangle somebody in order to get aroused ; he went online and 25 people came back to him and shared pictures of themselves doing the same thing and the fetish became more normative , " Schwartz said .
Can Fetishes Be Treated ?
While some sexual variance can be healthy in a relationship , fetishes can become a problem when they interfere with the ability to enjoy intimate , interactive sexual activity , McCarthy said .
" A lot of women will say that when they have a partner with a fetish arousal , that he's not really there during sex , " McCarthy said .
" He 's there physically but he 's not really there . "
But fetishes do n't have to be permanent and are often treatable to the degree that the individual is able to go on and have a healthy sex life .
Schwartz said that when he treats patients with fetishes , he revisits the original trauma that triggered the fetish .
" By reactivating that original trauma and getting in that high susceptible state , we are able to change some of the core arousal patterns , " Schwartz said .
" You can begin to see where the arousal came in and , in the future , when it comes to your conscious mind , you think back to the traumatic event . "
McCarthy , who described fetishes as a sort of " sexual heroin , " said that they can be much like an addiction to drugs .
" People give up heroin because they realize it 's really hurting their lives , " he said .
" What a person with a fetish has to understand is the value of intimate sex .
While it wo n't be highly erotically charged , it will fit more into the reality of his life . "
Unemployment Rises to Highest Level Since 1983 ; 263,000 Jobs Cut in September VP Biden : " Bad news " does not change confidence in recovery .
Oct. 2 , 2009  --
The nation 's unemployment rate in September rose to 9.8 percent , its highest level since June 1983 , as 263,000 jobs were cut from payrolls , the Labor Department announced Friday .
The 263,000 jobs lost during the month were far more than most economists had expected .
The consensus forecast was that around 175,000 jobs had been shed in September .
" One job lost is one job too many , " said Vice President Biden this morning , flanked by chair of the Council of Economic Advisors Christina Romer ; OMB Director Peter Orszag ; Director of the National Economic Council Larry Summers ; and Executive Director of the Middle Class Task Force Jared Bernstein .
The vice president tried to project optimism that the Obama Administration 's policies are having a positive effect on the economy .
" As bad as things are they would be far worse without the recovery plan , " and other economic measures put in place this year , Biden said .
Biden used the word " bad " four times .
" Today 's bad news does not change my confidence in the fact that we are going to recovery , " he said .
Noting that the jobs lost in the third quarter of this year was an improvement from the first quarter , Biden said that was not enough .
" We do n't think that less bad is good .
Less bad is not our measure of success , " he said .
Unemployment Rate Rises in September
The numbers released today are , indeed , bad .
Since the start of the recession , 7.2 million people have lost their jobs , more than the populations of Los Angeles , Chicago , and Baltimore combined .
That number of people could fill Tampa Bay 's Raymond James Stadium , where the 2009 Super Bowl was played , 116 times .
A total of 15.1 million people are now unemployed , with six times as many people seeking work as there are available jobs .
Critics have wasted no time in using the numbers as evidence that the administration 's stimulus is not working .
" Clearly , the policies of ' Obamanomics ' have failed , " Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas , said in a statement .
" You can't have a jobless recovery .
No jobs , no recovery . "
Analysts viewed today 's numbers as a sign that the country 's economic recovery will not be a smooth upward swing in the shape of a " V . "
" [ The ] combination of weak average hourly earnings -- up 2.5 percent year - over - year -- and job losses suggest household income gains [ will be ] limited and therefore consumer spending will underperform the typical recovery pace , " said John Silvia , chief economist for Wells Fargo .
" Recovery yes -- boom no , no V - shaped recovery . "
On Thursday evening , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner noted that unemployment remains " appallingly high . "
" We 're only just beginning to see the signs of recovery , " he said in a question - and - answer session at the Newseum in Washington , D.C .
However , the administration 's critics have also started to use the jobs numbers as ammunition to jab at President Obama 's 24 - hour trip to Copenhagen to speak on behalf of Chicago 's bid for the 2016 Olympics .
" While the president is in Copenhagen , " House Minority Leader John Boehner said Thursday , " the American people are going to wake up and find out that hundreds of thousands more Americans have lost their jobs . "
President Obama is set to make remarks on the new unemployment numbers upon his return to Washington Friday afternoon .
Another problem confronting the country is that many Americans have now been out of work for an extended period of time .
Some 5.4 million people , more than one of every three currently unemployed , have now been unemployed for over six months , the Labor Department said .
The effects of extended unemployment can in turn have a devastating effect on the nation 's economic recovery .
When people lose their jobs , they cut back on spending .
Since consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic growth , a downturn in consumer spending can prove very harmful .
Job losses can also worsen the housing crisis .
The first wave of home foreclosures was widely chalked up to the subprime mortgage meltdown as borrowers with less - than - stellar credit received loans they could not repay .
Now , as job losses mount , a second wave of foreclosures has been blamed on a growing number of people out of work .
ABC News ' Dan Arnall and Zunaira Zaki contributed to this report .
Humans are not laboratory mice , whose lives can be styled to best eliminate confounding factors from studies that aim to demonstrate a nice , neat correlation between cause A and result B .
So when you study humans for decades , living their complicated and individualistic lives , you get all the confounding factors you can handle and then some .
Take studies of fat , for example , and the strong correlation between extra body fat carried over the years , age - related illness , and a shorter life :
American researchers observed more than 17,000 female nurses with an average age of 50 in the U.S.
All of the women were healthy when the study began in 1976 .
Researchers then monitored the women 's weight , along with other health changes , every two years until 2000 .
For every one - point increase in their Body Mass Index , women had a 12 percent lower chance of surviving to age 70 in good health when compared to thin women .
Researchers defined " healthy survival " as not only being free of chronic disease , but having enough mental and physical ability to perform daily tasks like grocery shopping , vacuuming or walking up a flight of stairs .
...
For every 1 kilogram ( 2.2 pounds ) gained since age 18 , women 's odds of surviving past 70 dropped 5 percent , researchers found .
Women who were already overweight at age 18 and then gained more than 10 kilograms ( 22 kilograms ) later in life only had about a 20 percent chance of surviving to age 70 in good health .
The most commonly reported diseases were cancer , heart disease , and diabetes .
Fairly straightforward , you might think .
But wait : excess body far is also inversely correlated with wealth :
The point here is that sickness , poverty , and obesity are spun together in a dense web of reciprocal causality .
Anyone who 's fat is more likely to be poor and sick .
Anyone who 's poor is more likely to be fat and sick .
And anyone who 's sick is more likely to be poor and fat .
Interestingly , wealth is n't all that correlated with longevity in comparison to body fat :
The billionaires lived 3.5 years longer than average American males .
The results would be even more dramatic if we took into account average life expectancies from around the world , since the billionaires on our list are of all different nationalities .
According to a 1999 study in the British Medical Journal , higher income is , in fact , " casually associated with greater longevity . "
But when it comes to living longer , billionaires may not be that much better off than mere millionaires .
" While an extra dollar of income is protective , " the study reads , " the amount of protective effect tails off as total income rises . "
But we can't forget that measures of intelligence correlate with wealth , health , and keeping slim :
Some studies contend that rich live longer because of intellectual Darwinism .
" Social status , " Seligman writes , " correlates strongly and positively with IQ and other measures of intelligence , and intelligence correlates strongly with health literacy - the ability to understand and follow a prescription for disease prevention and treatment . "
This theory is not without evidence : Seligman cites a 2003 study by psychologist Ian Deary of the University of Edinburgh that found mortality rates to be 17 % higher for each 15 - point falloff in IQ .
At this point the layman shrugs his shoulders and points out that people who are better off tend to have become better off by taking an interest in becoming better off - an attitude which does n't stop at making money .
For the vast majority , those people lucky enough to have avoided snake eyes in the genetic lottery , being healthy is both a choice and a vocation .
Some people work at it , and some people do n't .
Those who take an interest in their health and do the work required tend to reap the rewards .
From my point of view , I think that the evidence is very strong for extra body fat - visceral fat , to be specific - as a major contributory cause of accelerated age - related degeneration .
By this I mean a direct and biochemical cause , not merely a correlation ; people are n't degenerating more rapidly as a direct result of a lack of dollars or IQ points , but changes to the operation of human biochemistry brought about by the presence of larger visceral fat deposits are very damaging over the long term .
Aging is absolutely a matter of how much damage your biochemistry has sustained , and the present consensus is that fat - induced inflammation has a lot to do with accumulated damage :
Chronic inflammation spurred by an immune system run amok appears to play a role in medical evils from arthritis to Alzheimer 's , diabetes to heart disease .
There 's no grand proof of this " theory of everything . "
But doctors say it 's compelling enough that we should act as if it were true - which means eating an " anti-inflammatory diet , " getting lots of physical activity , and losing the dangerous , internal belly fat that pumps out the chemicals that drive inflammation .
We have previously demonstrated that surgical removal of visceral fat ( VF ) in rats improves insulin action , thus , we set out to determine if VF removal affects longevity .
We prospectively studied lifespan in 3 groups of rats : ad libitum fed ( AL ) , 40 % caloric restriction ( CR ) and a group of ad libitum fed rats with selective removal of VF at 5 months of age ( VF - ) .
We demonstrate that compared to AL , VF - rats had a significant increase in mean and maximum lifespan and significant reduction in the incidence of severe renal disease .
You might also take a look at this mouse study for a fairly direct demonstration that fat shortens life :
It 's all something to think about , especially given that being overweight is a choice .
An easy , seductive choice perhaps , but a choice nonetheless .
You could do something about it , and hence improve your chances of living to see an era in which longevity medicine restores the elderly to health and vitality .
Full - fat , low - fat or skim ?
Used to be , there were n’t many choices to make over what to pour on your cereal .
But the number of alternatives to cow ’s milk -- soy , goat ’s , hemp milk , more -- has steadily grown .
Each has its fans : those who swear by goat ’s milk ’s creamy texture or who love almond milk ’s subtle , nutty flavor .
But when it comes to nutrition , there ’s no clear winner .
Cow ’s milk is a good source of protein but can be high in saturated fats .
Hemp milk offers little protein but is rich in certain essential fatty acids .
For some , an allergy is the main concern when choosing milk .
For others , digestibility drives the decision .
“ There are dozens of differences in all of these milks , ” says Alexandra Kazaks , professor of nutrition at Bastyr University in Kenmore , Wash .
Here ’s a look at the nutritional pros and cons of standards and newcomers in the dairy case .
See Page E3

Cow ’s milk
Whole cow ’s milk packs 150 calories per cup , and about half of those calories come from fat .
( See the related chart for a nutritional breakdown of all these different milks . )
The 8 grams of fat in a cup of whole milk includes 5 grams of saturated fat , which can raise blood cholesterol .
The American Heart Assn. recommends limiting saturated fat intake to 7 % or less of daily calories :
An adult consuming 1,800 calories per day would get more than one - third of that in an 8 - ounce glass of whole milk .
Skim and reduced - fat milks provide the same amount of protein without the high levels of saturated fats or the cholesterol whole milk also contains .
They also retain all of the calcium found in whole milk -- up to 300 milligrams , about one - third of the recommended daily intake .
According to the Institute of Medicine , adults require between 1,000 and 1,300 milligrams of calcium a day for optimum bone strength .
And cow ’s milk has long been promoted by nutritionists and dietitians as a good source of this important mineral , as well as the vitamin D needed to absorb the mineral .
But “ there ’s a fair amount of controversy in that whole area , ” says Larry Kushi , associate director for epidemiology in the division of research at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in Oakland .
The issue is just how important calcium -- and milk as a source of calcium -- truly is for bone health .

Scientists increasingly began to question the relationship after several studies , including two unusually large ones , failed to find evidence linking increased milk consumption to a decreased risk of fractures , a sign of bone health .
A 12 - year study of more than 77,000 women , conducted by Harvard researchers and published in 1997 , found that women who drank two glasses of milk a day had roughly the same risk of hip or forearm fractures as women who drank one glass or less per week .
A 2003 investigation of the same population found that although vitamin D intake reduced the risk of hip fractures in post - menopausal women , high calcium and milk intake did not .
The science on the relationship between cow ’s milk and cancer is also somewhat murky , and researchers are working to clarify this .
Population studies have produced good evidence that increased dairy consumption , including that of milk , may decrease the risk of colorectal cancer .
But studies also suggest that the risk of prostate cancer may increase with increasing milk consumption .
The evidence for female cancers -- including breast , ovarian and endometrial cancers -- is more mixed .
Studies conducted several decades ago were less likely to demonstrate a link between dairy consumption and female cancers than more recent ones , and some nutrition experts think this difference may be linked to industrial practices that have increased the levels of the hormone estrogen in cow ’s milk .

Then there ’s the issue of milk allergy , an immune - system reaction to any of the several types of casein , whey or other proteins in milk .
About 2.5 % of children develop cow ’s milk allergies in their first year , according to the National Institutes of Health , and 80 % outgrow it in adulthood .
Other individuals suffer from lactose intolerance , the inability to digest the dominant sugar found in milk .
The intolerance ( which causes gas , bloating and diarrhea ) stems from a lack of lactase , the enzyme required to break down the milk sugar lactose .
It is far more common than milk allergy .
“ Most of the world ’s population ca n’t digest milk , ” says Dr. Scott Sicherer , professor of pediatrics at the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York , and co-author of the 2009 book “ The Complete Idiot ’s Guide to Dairy - Free Eating . ”
“ Our bodies are not made to drink this stuff . ”
Goat ’s milk
The popularity in the U.S. of cow ’s milk makes us a bit of an anomaly : Globally , goat ’s milk is a far more popular drink .

But Americans may be getting a taste for it .
Tracy Darrimon , director of marketing for Turlock , Calif . - based Meyenberg Goat Milk Products , the top producers of commercially available goat milk in the U.S. , says that over the last four years the company has increased production more than 30 % to keep up with demand .
Consumers choose goat ’s milk because they perceive it as less allergenic , easier to digest and more healthful all round than cow ’s milk .
Some of those perceptions may be wrong .
Since goat ’s milk , like cow ’s milk , is derived from mammals , “ It ’s much more likely to have similar effects on long - term health , ” Kaiser ’s Kushi says .
Consumers looking to avoid saturated fat and cholesterol , for instance , may do well to eschew whole goat ’s milk :
It has more saturated fat than cow ’s milk and similar levels of cholesterol and is higher in calories and total fat .
And goat ’s milk , like cow ’s milk , contains lactose .
Though the levels can be slightly lower than those in cow ’s milk , “ It ’s not enough to really make a difference if someone has lactose intolerance , ” Bastyr ’s Kazaks says .
In Europe , where goat ’s milk consumption is far more common than in the U.S. , a few studies have suggested that goat ’s milk is less likely to cause allergies than cow ’s milk .
But Ohio allergist Dr. Julie McNairn , a spokesperson for the American Academy of Allergy , Asthma and Immunology , doubts that this is true .
She says the proteins triggering allergy to cow ’s milk are very similar to those found in goat ’s milk .

More than 90 % of the time , people allergic to cow ’s milk are allergic to goat ’s milk , Sicherer adds : “ If someone ’s allergic to cow ’s milk , I tell them to stay away from mammalian milks . ”
Soy milk
Because soy milk is made from a plant , it contains no cholesterol and negligible amounts of saturated fat : just half a gram per cup .
Compared with whole cow ’s or goat ’s milk , it is lower in calories too , but a glass still provides the same levels of key nutrients present in those milks , including calcium , protein , vitamin A , vitamin D and potassium .
That ’s partly because soybeans contain calcium , protein and potassium .
But soy milk is also fortified to be nutritionally comparable to cow ’s milk .

Soy milk ’s lack of cholesterol and low levels of saturated and total fat have made it a popular choice for people looking to improve their heart health , says Stacey Krawczyk , a research dietitian with the National Soybean Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
For the last 10 years , soy foods have been allowed to bear the FDA - approved claim that a low - fat , low - cholesterol diet containing 25 grams of soy protein per day may reduce the risk of heart disease .
Soy milk may have another benefit :
In recent decades , several large population studies have suggested consuming soy may be linked to a lower risk of cancer , including prostate , colorectal and breast cancer .
But the relationship between soy milk consumption and cancer remains unclear -- largely because most studies have focused on populations , such as those in Asia , that consume whole soy products , such as tofu , tempeh and edamame , as a large part of their diet .
Studies on the general U.S. and European populations have not been able to replicate the findings , in part because soy consumption levels here are much lower , Kushi says .
This protective effect against cancer , if there is one , is thought to be at least partly due to estrogen - like compounds in soy that may compete with human estrogen in the body , hindering it from prompting the cell proliferation that can trigger cancer .
But the link between soy consumption and cancer may invert in women after menopause , when natural estrogen levels plummet .
“ The evidence is still unclear , ” Kushi says .

Soy can be a good dairy alternative for most people with allergies to cow ’s milk .
Soy allergies affect 0.4 % of children -- more common than most food allergies but far less common than ones to milk .
Soy milk allergy in children is often outgrown .
And though people allergic to cow ’s milk are often likely to have another food allergy , the differences in the two milks ’ proteins means an allergy to one does n’t automatically translate into an allergy to the other , McNairn says .
Soy milk also lacks lactose , so it ’s easier for people with lactose intolerance to digest it .
A downside ?
Because soybeans have an inherently bitter taste , soy milk is often heavily processed -- and sweetened -- to mask that flavor , says Kantha Shelke , a food chemist with the Chicago - based food - science think tank Corvus Blue .
Sweeteners are often high on the list of ingredients in soy milks , adding sugar and calories that consumers might not be aware of .
Still , with about 5 grams of sugar per cup , even the more sugary soy milks contain fewer sugars than the 12 grams per cup in cow ’s milk .
( Soy milks labeled “ unsweetened ” contain about 1 gram . )
Soy milk presents its own digestibility challenges , Kazaks says .
The milk contains high levels of oligosaccharides , carbohydrates that are hard for the body to break down .
“ It can really cause a lot of gas in some people , ” she says .

Almond milk
“ With almond milk , it ’s more about what you do n’t get ” than what you do , says Sam Cunningham , an independent food scientist and consultant specializing in nuts , who helped develop almond milk for Sacramento - based Blue Diamond Growers as an employee of the almond processor in the 1990s .
Like soy milk , almond milk contains zero cholesterol .
It ’s free of saturated fats , so it ’s a healthful option for people with , or at risk for , heart disease .
It does n’t contain lactose , so it ’s an option for people with lactose intolerance .
And it ’s even lower in calories and total fat than soy milk : a glass contains just 60 calories and 2.5 grams of fat to soy milk ’s 100 calories and 4 fat grams .
But although almonds , among nuts , are a good source of calcium and protein , almond milk ’s calcium and protein levels do n’t compare to the levels in cow ’s , goat ’s or soy milks .
A glass of almond milk provides just 1 gram of protein .
Some brands provide up to 20 % of the daily recommended calcium intake ( about 10 % less than the other milks ) , but other brands provide none .
Advertisement
Almonds are also a good source of iron , riboflavin , vitamin E and some essential fatty acids .
A cup of the ground - up nuts contains more than 11 grams of omega - 6 fats ( but very few omega - 3s ) .
In recent years , several studies have hinted at a link between nut consumption and lower blood cholesterol and a reduced risk of heart disease .
Since 2003 , the Food and Drug Administration has allowed almonds ( and other nuts ) to bear the claim that eating 1.5 ounces of nuts daily , as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol , may reduce risk of heart disease .
Still , nuts are one thing -- almond milk is another .
The fraction of almond milk that ’s actually comprised of finely blended almonds varies between products and can be minimal , Kazaks says .
In many commercially available almond milks , almonds are the second or third ingredient , after water and sweeteners .
( The same is true for many soy milks as well . )
So despite the high vitamin E and omega - 6 content of almonds , a glass of almond milk may contain none of the vitamin and just 300 to 600 milligrams of the omega - 6s .
Almond milk is a fine alternative for people allergic to cow ’s and soy milks , Jaffe ’s Sicherer says , but almonds pose their own allergenicity hazards .
Allergies to tree nuts , including almonds , are among the top allergies in the population , affecting 0.2 % of children .
And although cow ’s and soy milk allergies are often outgrown , nut allergies are more likely to persist .

Rice milk
Like almond milk , rice milk ’s main advantages are what it does n’t contain .
It is free of cholesterol and saturated fat .
It does n’t contain lactose .
Allergies to rice are rare .
In fact , rice milk manufacturers commonly promote their product as safe for people with any of a number of allergies or intolerances -- including cow ’s milk , soy and nut allergies , as well as lactose and gluten intolerance .
( Gluten , found in wheat and other cereal grains , is not present in any of the milks mentioned here . )
Rice milk , like soy and almond milk , is formulated to contain levels of calcium , vitamin A and vitamin D similar to ( albeit lower than ) those in cow ’s milk .
But it is not a good source of protein , with just 0.67 grams per serving , and often contains more calories than almond or soy milk : about 113 calories per cup .
Its vitamin E levels exceed that of cow ’s , goat ’s and soy milk but do n’t compare with that of some almond milks .
Advertisement
One more thing rice milk does n’t have : flavor in need of masking with sweeteners .
“ It ’s a very mild - flavored product , ” Corvus Blue ’s Shelke says .
Hemp milk
Among plant - based milks , hemp milk is unique , and not just because the cannabis plant it ’s made from poses legal challenges for farmers .
A glass of hemp milk contains the same number of calories as soy milk , one - third to one - half of the protein , but 50 % more fat : 5 to 6 grams .
However , most of the fats in hemp milk are omega - 3 and omega - 6 essential fatty acids , key for nervous system function and healthy skin and hair .
Certain omega - 3 and omega - 6 fats also appear to reduce inflammation and lower blood lipid levels .
Advertisement
Plant oils typically have an excess of omega - 6 fats relative to omega - 3s -- and the hemp seed is no exception .
A cup of hemp milk ( which is made from the “ nut ” of the hemp seed but can also contain some of the hull ) often provides about 1 gram of omega - 3s and 3 to 4 grams of omega - 6s .
Still , that level of omega - 3s is high for plants , making hemp milk a useful source of them -- especially given that American diets typically provide too few omega - 3 fats and too many omega - 6s .
In fact , some nutrition experts recommend a dietary ratio of omega - 3s to omega - 6s of between 1:1 and 1:3 , a ratio that occurs naturally in hemp milk .
But the story is more complicated than that .
It is unclear whether the predominant omega - 3 fat in hemp , alpha linolenic acid ( ALA ) , has the same heart - health benefits of those found abundantly in fish oils ( known as EPA and DHA for short ) , says William Harris , director of the Cardiovascular Health Research Center at the University of South Dakota .
Like soy milk , hemp milk is low in saturated fat and cholesterol - free .
It ’s also free of lactose , and allergies to hemp are rare .
Christina Volgyesi , vice president of marketing for Portland , Ore. - based Living Harvest Foods , which makes hemp milk , says the milk is made from different cannabis varieties than those used to produce marijuana , and contains none of the mind - altering active ingredient THC .

Hemp milk contains many of the nutrients found in cow ’s milk ( including calcium , vitamin A and vitamin D ) since it ’s fortified .
In fact , some brands provide 40 % to 50 % of the daily recommended allowance of calcium , as compared with the 30 % found in cow ’s milk .
Nutritionally , hemp seeds are similar to flax seeds , which have become increasingly popular sources of essential fatty acids in recent years .
But not all seeds rich in the fats lend themselves to a palatable milk alternative .
“ Flax milk would probably be dark brown , ” Shelke says .
“ We are probably not prepared to drink something dark brown in color . ”
Unless , of course , it ’s chocolate milk -- be it of cow ’s , goat ’s , soy , almond , rice or even hemp .

Did you realise ?
Hello !
My friend Emmy and I drew a short back - and - forth comic .
The topic was pineapple .
Emmy drew the first one , I drew the second , etc .
I think you should be able to tell them apart .
10/7/09
Chairman Chris Dodd US Senate Committee on Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs 534 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington , DC 20551
Dear Chairman Dodd and members of the Banking Committee ,
We are writing to ask you to postpone the confirmation of Ben Bernanke until the Federal Reserve releases documentation that will allow the public and the Senate to have a full understanding of the commitments that the Federal Reserve has made on our behalf .
Without such an understanding , it is impossible to know whether Chairman Bernanke is fit to serve another term and fulfill the Federal Reserve ’s dual mandate to ensure price stability and full employment .
A list of said documentation is enumerated below .
Since 2007 , the Federal Reserve has expanded its balance sheet by $ 1.2 trillion and taken on substantial credit , interest - rate and foreign exchange risk .
It has lent immense sums to some financial institutions against overvalued collateral , while refusing to lend to others with no clear standards as to who was rescued and who was not .
It has set up holding companies using no -bid contracts , and guaranteed substantial liabilities of Citigroup , all the while keeping information about its actions secret from the public and Congress .
This is in stark contrast to the analogous period in the 1930 ’s , when the Reconstruction Finance Corporation fully disclosed loans and collateral to Congress .
Today , big banks are being bailed out and have a substantially lower cost of capital through an implicit government backstop even as Americans themselves are seeing their pay cut .
This lower cost of capital — at government expense — coupled with increased scarcity of credit is resulting in the banks recapitalizing by charging American consumers higher credit costs , including record overdraft fees and much higher credit card rates .
As you know , the Federal Reserve has a chartered mandate of both price stability and " full " employment .
Since 2002 , the Bernanke joined the Federal Reserve board has aligned himself with Alan Greenspan ’s activities , the incomes of Americans have actually declined in absolute terms , with incomes projected to decline a further 5 % in 2009 .
One quarter of all mortgage holders owe more than they own , with that number projected to rise to nearly 50 % by 2010 .
Consumer asset prices , most importantly housing , continue to fall , and unemployment continues to rise .
This raises real questions about Bernanke ’s tenure as Federal Reserve chairman , and about where trillions of dollars have gone .
Federal Reserve secrecy must be understood in the context of an intellectual dogma which Alan Greenspan inculcated into the fabric of the Federal Reserve and the economic profession , and which has severely harmed ordinary Americans .
Bernanke ’s " Great Moderation " speech in 2004 did n’t even consider the idea that the economy was becoming more unstable , even as risks were being built into the system by the politics he encouraged .
He ignored evidence of a crisis , saying in 2007 that the turmoil was contained to subprime mortgages , ignoring the bankruptcy of over 100 mortgage originators , and the clear evidence the crisis would spread .
Now , even as the crisis is said to be subsiding , we still do not have credit markets that are able to function without substantial government support , we have not addressed institutions that are " too big to fail " which the Fed oversees , bank credit availability is again shrinking ( posing risk of further increasing already high unemployment ) , and toxic assets in the system on the books of both private banks and the Federal Reserve have still not seen price discovery .
Chairman Bernanke ’s policy - making errors might be chalked up to errors of judgment , and it ’s possible to argue that he has been chastened by the last few years of turmoil .
What is more disturbing is how the Federal Reserve has refused to disclose the details of its commitments to the bankers who came close to destroying the economy .
The Bernanke Fed ’s execution of its dual mandate cannot be judged without consideration of those commitments , which would require the Fed to disclose documents which it still contends the public has no right to see .
Specifically , we ask that you postpone the confirmation of the Chairman until after the Federal Reserve discloses :
(1) Information that Bloomberg reporter Mark Pittman has requested via a Freedom of Information Act Request on the Bear Stearns rescue and that the Federal Reserve is contesting in the courts , * and which Manhattan Chief US District Judge Loretta Preska has ordered be turned over by the Federal Reserve .
(2) Information that Rep. Grayson requested in February at a hearing and the follow - up letter on which institutions received the $ 1.2 trillion added to the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet , how much each institution received , and what was promised in return .
(3) All Federal Reserve documents that went to Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ’s office relating to the Bank of America / Merrill Lynch merger in which potentially illegal and coercive activity might have occurred , as well as all Federal Reserve documents relating to the lawsuit pursued by the Merrill Lynch shareholders in the US District court for the Southern District of New York .
(4) Transcripts of all Open Market Meeting Minutes up to and including that of June 2009 , transcripts of which are normally withheld from the public for five years .
(5) Full disclosure of all terms and conditions of all off - balance sheet Fed Transactions in the past three years .
The Federal Reserve must become transparent and open with Congress and the public about its behavior during the financial crisis .
Thank you for your consideration of this matter .
Best ,
Alan Grayson , Member of Congress Ron Paul , Member of Congress

I ’m ambivalent about Banned Books Week , which runs through Saturday .
On the one hand , we clearly still need such a public affirmation , as the recent tumult over Sarah Palin and her “ rhetorical ” inquiries to the Wasilla , Alaska , public library show .
On the other , Banned Books
Week offers up the sort of toothless , feel - good spectacle that makes us less likely to consider the actual ramifications of free expression .
The basic message here is one of astonishment :
Why would anyone ban books when literature is such a positive and ennobling force ?
Yet while I agree with that , I also believe that some books truly are dangerous , and to ignore that is simply disingenuous .
Lest this make me seem an apologist for the book banners , nothing could be further from the truth .
In fact , I ’m against restricting anything other than material that graphically portrays certain illegal acts .
Yet it ’s foolish , self - defeating even , to pretend that books are innocuous , that we do n’t need to concern ourselves with what they say .
If that ’s the case , then it does n’t really matter if we ban them , because we have already stripped them of their power .
Books do change things :
Just think of “ Common Sense , ” which lighted the fuse of the American Revolution , or “ Mein Kampf , ” which laid out the blueprint for Hitler ’s Germany .
These are very different books -- one a work of hope and human decency , the other as venal a piece of writing as I ’ve ever read -- but what they have in common is a kind of historical imperative , the sense that , at the right place and time , a book can be a galvanizing factor , for good or ill .
“ Mein Kampf ” is a title you do n’t hear a lot during Banned Books Week ; the focus is more on classics such as “ Song of Solomon ” or “ The Catcher in the Rye ” that have been challenged in libraries and schools .
That ’s understandable , but again , it reduces the territory of censorship and free expression to something neatly clarified , rather than the ambiguous morass it is .
What happens when our ideals require us to defend a piece of writing that is reprehensible , that stands against everything we stand for ?
It ’s easy to condemn those who would remove “ The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ” from a library , but what about “ The Turner Diaries ” or “ The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ” ?
Or for that matter , “ Tintin in the Congo , ” which Little , Brown dropped from its “ Tintin ” reissue series last fall after controversy arose about the book ’s racist overtones ?
These are not just academic questions ; they are the heart of the matter , regardless of where you stand on the ideological divide .
How do we defend one book without defending all ?
Such a notion can’t help but make us uneasy , but then , that ’s one of the most essential things books can do .
We read for many reasons -- to be educated , entertained , illuminated , challenged -- but more than anything to confront someone else ’s ideas .
Much of the time , this is miraculous : I think of all the books that have transformed me , that literally changed the way I thought .
What would my life have been like if I had never encountered Kurt Vonnegut , or read Joan Didion ’s “ Slouching Towards Bethlehem , ” the first book ever to make me think of nonfiction as a literary art ?
Yet we forget the world is complicated , that it is full of opposing viewpoints and beliefs that , in many cases , we ca n’t accommodate , at our own peril .
What to do , then ?
Sweep them under the rug ?
Or face them and consider what we ’re up against ?
This is the conversation we ought to be having during Banned Books Week , a conversation that encompasses not just a love of reading and a disdain for those who would restrict it but also the implications of the free flow of ideas .
Even the most horrific things have something to teach us , something about human darkness , our capacity to go wrong .
I was thinking about this recently while reading Irvine Welsh ’s new novel , “ Crime , ” which deals with a ring of pedophiles .
It ’s a squeamish , tricky read , and yet , like other writers who deal with transgressive or repugnant material , Welsh has a larger moral vision :
His story is not about sex but sensibility , an investigation into the twisted landscape of the soul .
There are those who ’d argue that the subject he explores in “ Crime ” is not just provocative but detrimental , something we ’d be better off without .
I could n’t agree less ; the more troublesome a piece of writing , the more we need to take it into account .
" [ T ] he peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion , ” John Stuart Mill wrote in “ On Liberty ” ( in a quote featured on the American Library Assn. website ) , “ is that it is robbing the human race ; posterity as well as the existing generation ; those who dissent from the opinion , still more than those who hold it .
If the opinion is right , they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth : if wrong , they lose , what is almost as great a benefit , the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth , produced by its collision with error . ”
Here we have the point entirely , for if books do n’t make us uncomfortable , they ’re not doing their job .
To call that a mixed blessing is an understatement in a world where a work like “ Mein Kampf ” can continue to exert its awful pull .
And yet to suggest otherwise is to declare that writing is unessential , which is even worse .

Sen .
Joe Lieberman , the Democrat - turned - Independent from Connecticut , said Tuesday that he will not vote for a healthcare reform bill that includes a government - run insurance plan .
This means that as things now stand , Democrats will not have enough votes to pass healthcare reform with a so - called public option unless Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidGOP senators confident Trump pick to be confirmed by November Durbin : Democrats can ' slow ' Supreme Court confirmation ' perhaps a matter of hours , maybe days at most ' Supreme Court fight pushes Senate toward brink MORE ( D - Nev. ) can pick up unexpected GOP votes .
Sen. Olympia Snowe ( Maine ) , the only Republican to vote for the Senate Finance Committee ’s healthcare bill , said Tueday that she would vote against bringing up a bill that included a government - run insurance program unless the implementation of such a program were set to a trigger .

Lieberman said he would vote with Reid and other Democrats on a motion to begin debate on a healthcare bill because he believes it is an important issue that needs to be considered .
But he said he would not lend his support to an effort to cut off debate on a bill including a government - run insurance program .
Lieberman said he told Reid of his position in a recent conversation and that the leader “ respected and understood .
”
“ We ’re trying to do too much at once , ” said Lieberman .
“ To put this government - created , government - run insurance company on top of everything else is just asking for trouble for the taxpayer , for the premium payer and for the national debt .
I do n’t think we need it now .
” Lieberman said he was not placated by allowing states to opt out of the public option “ because it still creates a whole new federal government entitlement program , for which taxpayers will eventually be on the line .
” The motion to begin debate and the motion to move to a final vote are two actions that would require 60 votes and are considered the highest hurdles to passing a reform bill through the Senate .
Several centrist Democrats , including Sens. Evan Bayh ( Ind. ) and Ben Nelson ( Neb. ) , said they have not yet decided whether they would vote to begin debate on healthcare reform next week or the week after .
“ I do n’t think there is much difference between process and policy at this particular juncture , so I ’m going to be looking at those two things as one and the same , ” said Bayh , who added that he might vote to block debate .
“ I want to see what the bill has to say and if I think they have major substantive flaws in it , they may have to be corrected before we go to the floor for debte .
” Unlike Lieberman , Bayh said the public option is a relatively minor concern for him .
“ I have some qualms about that but that has not been my greatest concern , ” he said .
Bayh said he is more concerned about whether the reform bill “ is fiscally responsible and [ to ] make sure we ’re not setting up something that will explode into huge deficits . ”
Bayh also wants to make sure that the legislation does not drive up premiums for Americans who now have insurance .
Nelson said he would wait to review the written provisions of the reform bill before making a decision on whether to vote to begin debate .
“ Nobody ’s read it other than the leader and maybe some staff , ” Nelson said .

Suspending a cat between life and death is one of the best - known thought experiments in quantum mechanics .
Now researchers from Germany and Spain are proposing a real experiment to probe whether a virus can exist in a superposition of two quantum states .
Such superpositions are typically the domain of smaller , inanimate objects such as atoms .
But the team believes that their technique , using finely tuned lasers , will soon allow for the superposition of something much closer to a living organism .
They outline the experiment in a paper posted to the arXiv pre-print server .
At its most fundamental level , quantum mechanics says that particles can only exist in discrete states .
For example , researchers can measure the direction a particle spins as either ' up ' or ' down ' , but nothing in between .
Yet , as long as no one is looking , the particle exists in a combination of both states simultaneously , a strange blend known as a superposition .
In the 1930s , Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger described the now - famous cat experiment , intending it as a caution against applying quantum rules to the real , ' classical ' world .
He imagined placing a cat inside a box that contains a vial of hydrogen cyanide .
A hammer , suspended above the vial , would be set to smash it if triggered by the decay of a tiny chunk of radioactive material .
As long as the box is closed , the radioactive material behaves like a spinning particle because it exists in two states -- decayed or not decayed .
That means the cat is left in a limbo of being simultaneously dead and not dead .
Only when scientists actually measure whether the radioactive substance has decayed will the superposition break down into one or other of the two possibilities .
Oriol Romero - Isart at the Max Plank Institute for Quantum Physics in Garching , Germany , and his colleagues now say they hope to attempt a similar ' Schrödinger 's virus ' experiment in the lab .
Chilled out virus
The team hope to trap a virus in a vacuum using an electromagnetic field created by a laser .
Then , with another laser , the team would slow down the virus 's movement until it sits motionless in its lowest possible energy state .
Once the virus is fixed , the team will use a single photon to put the virus into a quantum superposition of two states , where it is either moving or not .
Until it is measured , the virus should exist in a superposition of motion and stillness .
The team suggest that tobacco mosaic virus , a rod -shaped plant virus measuring about 50 nanometres wide and almost 1 micrometre long , would be an ideal candidate for the experiment .
While there is still debate about whether such viruses can really be classed as alive , the experiment could even be extended to tiny organisms , the scientists say .
Microscopic tardigrades , or water - bears , can survive in the vacuum of space for days , and may be suitable for the same sort of Schrödinger treatment .
Other physicists are sceptical about how much the experiment will show .
There 's no reason to believe that a virus would behave any differently than a similar - sized inanimate object , says Martin Plenio a physicist at Imperial College in London .
" I 'm absolutely convinced that a virus would behave exactly the same as an inorganic molecule , " he says .
Still , he concedes , testing relatively large objects , whether viruses or molecules , could prove interesting .
According to quantum mechanics , it should be possible for macroscopic objects like cars and people to enter superpositions , but that never appears to happen .
Studying relatively large objects , says Plenio , may help physicists learn where the quantum world ends and the our macroscopic world begins .
On October 21 , 1940 ,
Ernest Hemingway
’s novel For Whom the Bell Tolls was first published
by Charles Scribner 's Sons
.
It ’s a classic war story about an American , Robert Jordan , who goes to Spain to fight with anti-Fascist rebels during the Spanish Civil War .
Along the way , he falls in love with a rebel girl named Maria .
The title of the novel is taken from a famous line written by British poet John Donne : “ ... never send to know for whom the bell tolls ; it tolls for thee . ”
Those oft - quoted words are from Donne ’s book Devotions upon Emergent Occasions , published in 1624 .
They come at the end of a passage that includes another famous quote by Donne : “ No man is an island . ”
Hemingway ’s novel For Whom the Bell Tolls was a huge bestseller that generated some famous lines of its own .
The first comes in Chapter 7 .
As Robert and Maria are about to kiss for the first time , Maria asks the somewhat unbelievably naïve question : “ Where do the noses go ? ”
That quote was immortalized by the immensely popular 1943 film adaptation of the book , in which Ingrid Bergman , as Maria , says it to Gary Cooper , playing Robert Jordan .
In Chapter 13 of the novel , there ’s another famous quote : “ But did thee feel the earth move ? ” ( Hemingway used “ thee ” and other antiquated terms of speech in the novel supposedly as a way of translating what was being said in Spanish . )
Jordan poses this question to Maria after they have sex .
According to a flowery previous paragraph describing their coupling , it did move for Jordan .
He supposedly “ felt the earth move out and away from under them . ”
Maria answers Jordan ’s question in the affirmative .
Later , when one of the rebel leaders asks Maria if something happened between her and Jordan , she says simply : “ The earth moved . ”
When the novel was published in 1940 , the use of the phrase “ feel the earth move ” was not a yet a humorous reference to enjoyable sex .
But the use of the phrase in both the book and the movie made it familiar enough to make it that – and to give songwriter - singer Carol King the title and refrain of her hit song “ I Feel the Earth Move ” ( 1971 ) .
In Chapter 43 of For Whom the Bell Tolls , there ’s another oft - quoted line : “ The world is a fine place and worth fighting for . ”
It ’s included in many books of quotations and one of its many admirers is Senator John McCain .
He used the variation Worth the Fighting For as the title of his autobiographical book published in 2003 .
Ironically , McCain ’s campaign nemesis , President Barack Obama has named Hemingway ’s For Whom the Bell Tolls as one of the books that have inspired him .
I live near Key West , where Ernest Hemingway lived from late 1920s to the late 1930s .
He worked on some of his most famous novels and stories there , including For Whom the Bell Tools , A Farewell To Arms , To Have and Have Not and the short story “ The Snows of Kilimanjaro . ”
Hemingway ’s former house in Key West , now called the Hemingway Home and Museum , is a big tourist attraction that is famous for the dozens of “ polydactyl ” ( six - and seven - toed ) cats that hang out there .
They ’re descendants of the polydactyl cats Hemingway had there in the Thirties .
As a Keys resident , I should probably like Ernest Hemingway more than I do .
But the truth is his books and stories never really made the earth move for me .
Plus , I ’m just not macho enough to appreciate the fine arts of bullfighting , big game hunting and killing beautiful big fish – three of Hemingway ’s favorite sports .
Nor do I find it easy to overlook the way he treated his wives , lovers and kids .
But I really like his polydactyl cats .

Java VisualVM was released more than year and a half ago , but its still worth blogging since most people do n’t know about it .
VisualVM is an open source tool for monitoring and profiling your Java applications .
VisualVM is now integrated with JDK 6 update 7 release and also available as a stand - alone setup .
Java 7 plans to integrate next version 1.2 .
So , from now on you need not pay a hefty price for licensing third party profilers .
In this article we ’ll walk through the features of VisualVM and see how it is different from commercial profiling tools .
Let ’s see what the entire buzz is all about .
It provides a nice graphical user interface for monitoring and troubleshooting Java applications and integrates several troubleshooting features introduced in JDK 5 and 6 as command - line utilities into this single GUI tool .
I liked their screen - cast that shows VisualVM in action .
It should help you get started :
VisualVM , Java ’s own monitoring , profiling and performance benchmarking tool .
Even though many monitoring and diagnostics features are enhanced and introduced in Java 6 , still it has been lacking an out - of - the - box bundling of a convincing visual Java application monitoring or profiling tool , until the most recent JDK6 Update 7 .
You can find VisualVM under the bin directory of your JDK6 u7 installation .
Just double click the exe and its there the VisualVM .
The main window of VisualVM opens when you launch the application .
By default , the Applications window is displayed in the left pane of the main window .
The Applications window enables you to quickly see the Java applications running on local and remote JVMs .
The Applications window is the primary entry point for viewing further details about a particular application .
Right - clicking an application node opens the popup menu where you can choose to open the main application tab or take thread or heap dumps .
If you have used the Netbeans platform , you can easily recognize that VisualVM is also built upon the Netbeans Platform .
Now that you have VisualVM running you can do several things like
1 ) Create and visually view heap Dumps
2 ) Profile memory usage
3 ) Profile CPU Usage
4 ) Profile Threads
In the past you had to use one or more commercial tools to get the above tasks done .
But with VisualVM you have one integrated tool that can do all the above .
VisualVM allows you to do much more than traditional monitoring and profiling .
1 ) You can take a snap shot of the thread status and heap status and save them for analyzing offline .
2 ) You can monitor multiple applications both local and remote from a single VisualVM instance .
You can also take simultaneous thread dumps of multiple applications for analyzing distributed dead locks .
3 ) No need for complex configuration .
Traditional memory profilers either require you to run your applications in a special , modified JVM or start your applications with the profiler agent .
But with VisualVM , you start your java applications normally and VisualVM automatically lists the Java applications running on your local machine .
4 ) VisualVM is extensible .
Yes we love plugins , and since VisualVM is built on the NetBeans Platform , its architecture is modular and easy to extend with plugins .
There are several plugins already available for VisualVM like :- MBeans Browser , JConsole Plugins Container , VisualVM Extensions , Visual GC Plugin , GlassFish Plugin , BTrace Plugin , TDA Plugin .
VisualVM , the lightweight profiler and troubleshooting tool is available to build as part of IcedTea6 for 32 and 64 bit arch .
The whole thing builds from source — NetBeans platform7 and profiler2 ( visualvm_preview2 ) , and finally VisualVM 1.0 .
A binary launcher `jvisualvm` is put in the $ {JDK} / bin directory along with the rest of the tools .
Here are some VisualVM Screenshots : Screenshot1 : Benchmark CPU usage and Heap memory usage during execution of a JavaFX web gallery .
Screenshot 2 : Method , class Execution Profiler
This tool has a lot of potential .
A while back I used to benchmark JavaFX .
And today , it ’s my first choice for benchmarking any application .
Finding memory leaks , performance bottlenecks ,
Heap usage optimizations , all can be done graphically , goodbye to other tools .
For many situations , this tool can prove out to be a great reverse - engineering tool at Runtime .
For instance when you have a jar , war , ear running and it is misbehaving and there is no traces in the logs , visualVM can help .
This tool will let you know what part of code was executed that caused peaks in CPU / memory usage , or potential memory hogs in your application .
Threads tab , like many other debuggers , will give you complete info on all the running threads :
Time , state , id , etc .

" They have to learn to serve .
They should not make the tribals feel they are doing them a favour . "
Highlighting the problems of the area , he says farming depends on the rain and tribals are jobless with no avenues of income for eight months in a year .
To add to that , there is no availability of food in Melghat from March to October .
Milk is scarce and irrigation facilities are absent .
Before 1978 , tribals used to hunt and eat small animals like the rabbit to sustain themselves but after the region was declared as a tiger reserve , hunting became illegal .
Since there are no veterinarians , the cattle owned by the tribals often die without the right medication .
There are 20 artificial insemination centres but are all shut for want of vets .
The Melghat area shot into the national limelight last year because of infant deaths due to malnutrition , but Dr Koelhe said it was wrong to label them as ' malnutrition deaths . '
" It is more like starvation , " he had said when I met him last year while reporting the infant deaths .
" There is no availability of food here from March to October .
The mother is therefore malnourished , and thus we have neo-natal deaths , " he explained .
Milk is in short supply because the milk co-op closed down due to the competition between the Jersey and Indian cow .
" The Jersey does n't get enough nutrition here and the Indian cow does not give milk here .
The reason being , the cow does not get enough nutrition .
Where does it have the energy to give milk ? " he said .
The tribals are unable to rear poultry for their livelihood because the chicks often die within the first two days .
" There is a vaccination that has to be given in the first 36 hours after birth , but how do we give it ?
Since the tribals are a scattered population , it is not possible . "
The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme , the government 's programme to provide rural employment for 100 days , was started here , but was then halted .
Bhandu Sane , the founder of the non governmental organisation Khoj , told rediff.com that the NREGA was not functioning in the Dharni and Chikaldhara talukas .
Moreover , workers who had worked under the NREGA had not been paid wages totalling Rs 3 million in the Chikaldhara taluka .
Wages were also pending in Dharni .
Dharni has been declared a drought hit area .
Many areas in Chikaldhara also face drought .
" What we need is awareness .
There are 400 schemes to look after the tribals from the womb to the grave , but the tribals do n't even know what these schemes are .
And those who know are not interested in implementing them , " says Dr Koelhe resignedly .
The tribals have to be provided with safe drinking water and need well stocked ration shops in every village .
" The agricultural board is closed .
It has to start again .
Irrigation facilities to store water are needed and tribals have to be taught the use of fertilizers and pesticides . "
" The best thing the government has done here is to open more than 300 schools .
In those days there were no teachers .
The even better thing that the government did was to introduce Korku text books in 1985 .
Now primary education is in the Korku language .
This has gone a long way in making the tribals literate and given them confidence to attend school . "
As of today , 1,976 infections are considered active cases statewide , with a total of 10,298 patients now classified by health officials as “ released from isolation , ” or 82.98 % of those infected , according to the state ’s official count .
Following an all - out assault by several hundred insurgents on two US outposts in Nuristan earlier this month , the US quickly abandoned both sites .
The Pentagon maintains that they had been planning to abandon the bases at any rate , and that it was only a coincidence they were attacked just a few days before the move .
Two other US posts in Nuristan has been attacked last year , and were also abandoned .
Those two outposts were America ’s last in the area , and this has meant that the eastern province has only a handful of US troops now , protecting the governor , and that Nuristan Province is now under the de facto control of a Taliban faction run by Qari Rahman .
Nuristan lies along the border with Pakistan ’s tiny Bajaur Agency , which the US launched a rare drone attack against late last week .
Militants linked to Rahman , having effectively secured Nuristan , say they have their sights set on Bajaur , and the US strike was likely a last ditch American effort to stave off that eventuality , the last thing Pakistan needs after starting a major offensive on the other side of the tribal areas under intense US cajoling .
Of course , he spoke in French , but even I could follow it .
I remembered Frédéric ’s mantra — bureaucrats exist to make our lives miserable — and I watched the clock slowly sweep off another 30 minutes .
At that point , I could n’t take it anymore .
I walked up to the desk and asked for news of mon mari .
The gatekeeper turned to his colleague : had Madame been to the counter already ?
No ?
This was the première fois ?
Very well .
He called into the back , and in a few minutes , a technician came to fetch me .
I was escorted to my husband ’s cubicle , which he was sharing with a Frenchman who collapsed while getting off the Paris - Tours train .
A doctor arrived .
Her English was worse than my French , so with my little Collins dictionary I translated my husband ’s symptoms .
They took him and also his cellmate away for X - rays and left me and the cellmate ’s partner to sit on their beds .
The partner , a chic young woman , blond , extremely thin , was carrying a fat book called “ L’Anorexie . ”
Judging by her own size , I wondered if it was a guide , but she explained that she was training to help people with eating disorders .
Bulimia and anorexia were severe problems in France , she told me : women , and increasingly men , are prey to a cultural mystique that proclaims they must be both fashionistas and foodinistas .
Bulimia in particular is widespread , she said , and people smoke heavily to suppress their appetites .
Meanwhile , my husband ’s heart and lungs were examined inside and out .
He and his cellmate were both suffering from pneumonia , not heart attacks .
They were given antibiotics .
At 2 a.m. , when we were discharged , I offered my MasterCard to the surly gatekeeper .
He said they would send us a bill .
The doctor apologized for having to bill us , but we were not citizens , after all .
Six months later , the bill arrived .
For X - rays , an EKG , 10 hours in the emergency room , a doctor , a cardiologist , technicians , nurses , drugs and even the surly gatekeeper , we were required to pay $ 220 .
I might put up with a lot of ugly bureaucrats for that .
ROME , Italy ( CNN ) --
The Vatican said Tuesday it has worked out a way for groups of Anglicans who are dissatisfied with their faith to join the Catholic Church .
The Vatican says more Anglicans have expressed an interest in joining the Catholic Church .
The process will enable groups of Anglicans to become Catholic and recognize the pope as their leader , yet have parishes that retain Anglican rites , Vatican officials said .
The move comes some 450 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England , forerunner of the Anglican Communion .
The parishes would be led by former Anglican clergy -- including those who are married -- who would be ordained as Catholic priests , said the Rev. James Massa , ecumenical director of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops .
" This sets up a process for whole groups of Anglicans -- clergy and laity -- to enter in to the Catholic Church while retaining their forms of worship and other Anglican traditions , " Massa said .
The number of Anglicans wishing to join the Catholic Church has increased in recent years as the Anglican Church has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy and blessed homosexual partnerships , said Cardinal William Joseph Levada , the head of the Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith .
Their talks with the Vatican recently began speeding up , Vatican officials said , leading to Tuesday 's announcement .
" The Catholic Church is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the Holy See from groups of Anglican clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion , " Levada said .
Levada said " hundreds " of Anglicans around the world have expressed their desire to join the Catholic Church .
Among them are 50 Anglican bishops , said Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia of the Congregation for Divine Worship .
While married Anglican priests may be ordained as Catholic priests , the same does not apply to married Anglican bishops , Levada said .
" We 've been praying for this unity for 40 years and we 've not anticipated it happening now , " Di Noia said .
" The Holy Spirit is at work here . "
One interested group is the Traditional Anglican Communion , an association of churches that is separate from the Anglican Communion and has hundreds of thousands of members worldwide .
The TAC in 2007 petitioned the Vatican for unity with the Catholic Church with the stipulation that the group retain its Anglican rites .
The TAC 's primate , Archbishop John Hepworth of Australia , said in a statement Tuesday that the Vatican 's announcement " more than matches the dreams we dared to include in our petition two years ago . "
That is because the Vatican 's move involves not only the TAC but other Anglican groups that want to unite with the Catholic Church , said the Right Rev. Daren K. Williams , bishop ordinary of the western diocese of the Anglican Church of America , which is part of the TAC .
The Vatican has yet to release all details of the offer , and the TAC 's leaders will meet and discuss how to respond when it does , Williams said .
But Williams said he believes much of TAC will respond favorably .
Williams , who also is rector of All Saints Anglican Church in Fountain Valley , California , said his parishioners have generally been " very warmly receiving " Tuesday 's announcement .
" It is encouraging for them to know their worship experience would n't be turned upside down by the Roman Catholic Church , " Williams said .
" The person in the pew should see very little difference in the way we pray .
We might be asked to pray aloud for any pope who happens to be in office , in addition to praying for our primate .
" Really , there 'd be very little other difference . "
The parishes retaining the Anglican rites would answer not to Catholic bishops but to regional or nationwide " personal ordinariates " who would report to the pope , Massa said .
Those officials often will be former Anglican clergy , Vatican officials said .
The Church of England said the move ends a " period of uncertainty " for Anglican groups who wanted more unity with the Catholic Church .
Both groups have a " substantial overlap in faith , doctrine and spirituality " and will continue to hold official dialogues , the archbishops of Canterbury and Westminster said in a joint statement .
" Those Anglicans who have approached the Holy See have made clear their desire for full , visible unity in the one , holy , catholic and apostolic church , " Levada said .
" At the same time , they have told us of the importance of their Anglican traditions of spirituality and worship for their faith journey . "
Preserving Anglican traditions , such as mass rites , adds to the diversity of the Catholic Church , he said .
" The unity of the church does not require a uniformity that ignores cultural diversity , as the history of Christianity shows , " he said .
" Moreover , the many diverse traditions present in the Catholic Church today are all rooted in the principle articulated by St. Paul in his letter to the Ephesians : ' There is one Lord , one faith , one baptism . ' "

Two cyclists were looking for a fight before an incident that led to assault charges being filed against a California driver , the driver ’s attorney suggested in court Monday .
The attorney for Dr. Christopher Thomas Thompson also suggested that one of the cyclists may have simply fallen on his own accord .
Thompson is on trial in Los Angeles Superior Court , charged with assault with a dangerous weapon and other violations in connection with a July 4 , 2008 , confrontation in a Los Angeles area canyon and an earlier incident involving a cyclist on the same road .
Prosecutors say Thompson , 60 , a former emergency room physician , purposely braked in front of the two riders as they descended Mandeville Canyon Road .
Defense attorney Peter Swarth tried to show a jury that injured cyclists Christian Stoehr and Ron Peterson were already looking for trouble before the confrontation and collision last year .
Swarth also suggested that at least one of the cyclists may have simply succumbed to the inherent instability of his bicycle , lost balance and fallen over .
In testimony last week , Stoehr told prosecutors that he hit the back of Thompson ’s Infiniti sedan , rolled over the top of the car and fell into the left lane of the road .
Stoehr suffered a grade - 3 shoulder separation and road rash in the incident .
Peterson , the more seriously injured of the two , crashed through the car ’s rear window .
The impact broke his nose , nearly severing it and shattered several of his teeth .
Surgeons used more than 90 stitches to reattach his nose .
On Monday , Swarth finished Stoehr ’s cross-examination , with questions largely centered on details of his cycling clothing .
Swarth questioned Stoehr about his explanation regarding his impact with the rear of the car , wondering aloud how Stoehr ended up on the ground in front of the car .
When Stoehr had difficulty explaining the physics involved , Swarth suggested that Stoehr simply lost balance and fell down .
’ My face did that . ’
Deputy District Attorney Mar Stone then called Peterson to the stand , taking him through his history as a cyclist , his coaching business , the location of the accident and the nature of the holiday ride , before moving on to the incident .
Peterson said that before the impact , Thompson pulled alongside him and spoke through the open passenger window .
He said several words before Peterson said he clearly made out , “ Ride single file . ”
He testified that Thompson seemed angry and , because his car was within a foot of Peterson , he felt “ he was bullying me . ”
Peterson said he responded by saying , “ Fuck you . ”
Peterson said Thompson then pulled ahead and stopped .
The back of the car “ felt like a wall , ” he said .
Stone displayed a photo of the back of the car .
Peterson pointed to a hole in the rear window and said , “ My face did that . ”
Then , pointing at large red drops on the trunk , he said , “ That ’s my blood . ”
Peterson said after he pulled himself out of the window and got off the car , Thompson got out .
Peterson responded , “ Get the fuck away from me . ”
Asked about what he said next he admitted he told Thompson , “ I ’m going to fuck you up . ”
“ What happened next ? ” Stone asked .
“ I sat down , ” Peterson said .
“ I was hurt and I was n’t doing anything .
I said it .
I ’m not proud . ”
Stone asked if any of Peterson ’s injuries resulted in long - term problems .
“ I still ca n’t feel my nose , ” Peterson said as he pointed to scars across the bridge of his nose , on his lip and chin .
Peterson added that will have to undergo further surgery to remove the scars .
Testimony then turned to his bicycle and for the court some description was required to convey what would be obvious to any cyclist , that the head tube was broken and separated from the top and down tubes .
No other damage was discussed .
In cross-examining the witness , Swarth suggested that “ bicycles are inherently unstable , ” a point Peterson vigorously disputed .
Most of the cross-examination focused on Thompson ’s proximity to Peterson and the known statement , “ Ride single file . ”
Swarth spoke rapidly and frequently interrupted Peterson and even sometimes the judge .
The court sustained six separate objections from the prosecution that Swarth was mischaracterizing Peterson ’s statements or questioning him in an argumentative manner .
“ You were out of control , ” Swarth told Peterson at one point .
“ You wanted him to stop .
Why shout ‘ fuck you ? ’
There ’s something dangerous about saying ‘ fuck you , ’ is n’t there ? ”
“ Only in this case , ” Peterson responded .
’ I want justice ’
Swarth proceeded to pick apart Peterson ’s previous testimony that Thompson ’s car was stopped when he hit it .
Peterson had conceded in earlier testimony that Thompson ’s car probably had not yet come to a full stop by the time he hit it .
But Peterson , stuck to his guns , saying , “ That was my perception .
It felt like I hit a wall . ”
Swarth finished his cross-examination by questioning Peterson ’s motives for participating in the criminal case .
“ You ’re furious , ” he said .
“ That ’s not the right word , ” Peterson responded .
“ I ’m not happy .
It ’s complex .
I want justice . ”
’ They flipped me off .
I slammed on my brakes ’
Investigating officer Robert Rodriguez testified that when he arrived at the accident , Thompson told him , “ I live up the road .
There were bikes in front of me , three across the road .
They flipped me off .
I stopped in front of them .
I wanted to teach them a lesson .
I ’m tired of them . ”
Stone then played Thompson ’s 911 call in which Thompson can be heard saying , “ Get your bike out of the road , why do n’t you ? ”
“ There are three bikers in the road .
They flipped me off .
I slammed on my brakes . ”
When the operator asked if there were any serious injuries , Thompson responded , “ not really , but they ’ll tell you that . ”
Cross-examination of Rodriguez begins on Tuesday .
“ The Bravest Woman in Afghanistan , ” Malalai Joya did two CNN interviews on Thursday .
Joya is an elected member of the Afghanistan parliament who has been suspended for “ insulting fellow members of parliament ” in a television interview .
She is articulate and firm in her position that the Western occupation is feeding the violence .
The first interview was broadcast on CNN ( US ) .
In the middle of the interview , as Joya made clear she opposed US occupation , interviewer Heidi Collins said “ occupation would certainly be your word , a lot of people would take great issue with you calling the US presence in your country an ‘ occupation ’ . ”
Joya went on to defend her position as Collins ’ interrupted snidely .
As Joya tried to respond to Collins , she was cut off .
The second interview took place on CNN International .
Joya ’s anti-occupation position was highlighted up front and the interviewer was polite and respectful .
One simple way to see some of the problems that concurrency can cause is to try printing to the terminal concurrently .
Try loading up GHCi , and typing import Control .
Concurrent followed by :
mapM_ ( forkIO . putStr . replicate 100 ) [ 'a ' , 'b ' ]
This code spawns off two threads : one that prints 100 ‘a ’s , and one that prints 100 ‘ b’s .
Your results will likely differ from mine , and the results will likely differ each time , but here ’s a sample ( with line breaks added for readability ) :
aabababababaaaaaaaaaaaaabababababababababababababababababab ababababababababababababababababababbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Technically , this is non-determinism : the observable behaviour of the program is different each time , even though there is no obvious randomness in our program .
The theoretical implications can wait for another day — this is also a practical issue .
If we have several concurrently executing processes wanting to write to stdout , how can we stop this messy interleaving from occurring ?
We want to get all 100 ‘a ’s together , and all 100 ‘b ’s together .
In CHP , the answer is the printer process .
The printer process continually reads Strings from its input channel , and prints them :
printer :: Chanin String -> CHP ( ) printer input = forever $ readChannel input >>= liftIO .
putStr
We need to connect this printer process to the processes that want to do the printing .
A naive attempt might be :
unsafePrinting :: CHP ( ) unsafePrinting = do c <- oneToOneChannel printer ( reader c ) < |*|> writeChannel ( writer c ) ( replicate 100 'a ' ) < |*|> writeChannel ( writer c ) ( replicate 100 'b ' )
This is unsafe , however .
The reason is implied by the name oneToOneChannel :
CHP ’s standard channels are designed for use by one writer and one reader at a time .
Using the output twice in parallel as shown above will sometimes give a run-time error ( sometimes you may get away with it , which can make locating the bug hard ) .
The compiler will not stop you writing this code , as encoding the safe - usage restriction in the type system would be very cumbersome .
Instead , you must use a shared channel .
We want to share the writing end , but do not need to share the reading end ; thus we need an anyToOneChannel , allowing anyone ( of multiple writers ) to send to one recipient .
With this channel , we must use a claim function to grab the shared writing end for ourselves — a form of mutual exclusion .
Hence we can get 100 ‘a ’s together and 100 ‘b ’s together ( in either order ) by using :
safePrinting :: CHP ( ) safePrinting = do c <- anyToOneChannel printer ( reader c ) < |*|> claim ( writer c ) ( flip writeChannel $ replicate 100 ' a ' ) < |*|> claim ( writer c ) ( flip writeChannel $ replicate 100 ' b ' )
The claim function takes a shared channel end ( e.g. Shared Chanout String ) , and a function that takes the claimed end ( which has the same type as a normal end : Chanout String ) and performs some block of code .
The claim function claims the channel - end for the duration of the call ; releasing is automatic at the end of the block .
If you try to use a shared channel - end without claiming it , you ’ll get a type error .
You can perform multiple communications on the channel during the claim block — we could choose to write “ a ” to the channel 100 times rather than 100 ‘a ’s at once , and the resulting output would still have the ‘a ’s uninterrupted .
You would use this printing process in your real application by running it in parallel with the whole system ( probably at the very top level ) , and passing out the shared channel - end to any process that may want to print a message .
Each process will then have to claim the channel to send messages , and it is really this claiming process that serialises the messages .
Only the printing process actually prints the messages on stdout , which has the effect of stopping any concurrent use of stdout ( and hence stopping this garbledness ) .
You could make the printing process print to stderr or to a logfile , if you want to use this method to keep track of errors / warnings / debug messages in your concurrent application .
Today we 're excited to announce the next step for Google Maps for mobile : Google Maps Navigation ( Beta ) for Android 2.0 devices .
This new feature comes with everything you 'd expect to find in a GPS navigation system , like 3D views , turn - by - turn voice guidance and automatic rerouting .
But unlike most navigation systems , Google Maps Navigation was built from the ground up to take advantage of your phone 's Internet connection .
Here are seven features that are possible because Google Maps Navigation is connected to the Internet :
When you use Google Maps Navigation , your phone automatically gets the most up - to - date maps and business listings from Google Maps — you never need to buy map upgrades or update your device .
And this data is continuously improving , thanks to users who report maps issues and businesses who activate their listings with Google Local Business Center Google Maps Navigation brings the speed , power and simplicity of Google search to your car .
If you do n't know the address you 're looking for , do n't worry .
Simply enter the name of a business , a landmark or just about anything into the search box , and Google will find it for you .
Then press " Navigate " , and you 're on your way .
Typing on a phone can be difficult , especially in the car , so with Google Maps Navigation , you can say your destination instead .
Hold down the search button to activate voice search , then tell your phone what you want to do ( like " Navigate to Pike Place in Seattle " ) , and navigation will start automatically .
Google Maps Navigation gets live traffic data over the Internet .
A traffic indicator light in the corner of the screen glows green , yellow or red , depending on the current traffic conditions along your route .
If there 's a jam ahead of you , you 'll know .
To get more details , tap the light to zoom out to an aerial view showing traffic speeds and incidents ahead .
And if the traffic does n't look good , you can choose an alternate route .
For those times when you 're already on the road and need to find a business , Google Maps Navigation searches along your route to give you results that wo n't take you far from your path .
You can search for a specific business by name or by type , or you can turn on popular layers , such as gas stations , restaurants or parking .
Google Maps Navigation uses the same satellite imagery as Google Maps on the desktop to help you get to your destination .
Turn on the satellite layer for a high - resolution , 3D view of your upcoming route .
Besides looking cool , satellite view can help you make sense of complicated maneuvers .

And since locating an address can sometimes be tricky , we 'll show you a picture of your destination as you approach the end of your route , so you 'll know exactly what to look for .
Since there 's nothing quite like seeing the product in action , we made this video to demonstrate a real - life example :
The Lakers :
Their point guards are these guys : Derek Fisher , Jordan Farmar and Shannon Brown .
Derek Fisher is 48 years old at this point and though he did hit two clutch shots to drown the Magic in the Finals I think he missed a 108 shots in a row up to that point .
He ’s kind of like Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon 4 , he ’s been too old for this for too fucking long .
Jordan Farmar has a lot of talent , he can shoot it , he ’s quick and he ’s got hops but he has n’t shown anything in the playoffs so far in his career .
He has the potential to be a legit threat in this league but it ’s not going to happen this season .
Then we ’re on to Shannon Brown , a guy who earned his stripes in last season ’s playoffs .
He ’s got a lot going for him , athleticism , decent shooting and nice handles but he ’s not a guy you ’re afraid of .
I like him .
I like his game as long as he plays within himself .
I saw a couple pre-season games and he was shooting an awful lot .
I do n’t think the Lakers are winning a lot of games when Shannon Brown takes more than 10 shots .
Another note I ’d like to make .
The Lakers did n’t really beat anybody when they won the title last year .
They just made sure they did n’t beat themselves .
Now that Ron Artest is in town that might not be the case this year .
Seriously , he ’s at a level of crazy I have n’t seen in a while .
I have no clue what he might do this year .
Kill a guy .
Win a championship .
Buy a motor home .
Adopt a kid , seriously , everything ’s in play .
The Spurs :
Like the Poltergeist 2 ad campaign said : “ they ’re back ! ”
The Richard Jefferson trade was so good it makes me want to shave my beard because it makes me look like a young Gregg Popovich .
I hate this team .
I hate them so much because they do n’t make mistakes , ever .
They only make good decisions on and off the field .
The only good thing about them is that they ’re old and they get hurt easily .
I think Manu Ginobili last played a painless game when he was 15 and Tim Duncan ’s knees might need an engine change after the season , they ’ve got a lot of mileage on them .
If they stay healthy , they win the league .
If Manu , Jefferson , Parker or Duncan get injured they ’ll lose to the Lakers .
The Cavaliers :
The Shaq signing does n’t really make them better , the Anthony Parker and Jamario Moon acquisitions , on the other hand , do .
I have a bad feeling about this season for the Cavs .
They ’ve shoved all of their money to the center of the table and they do n’t really have the hand to back it up , or a steady stream of cash to fall back on if they lose .
It ’s do or die for them this year and the Shaq thing smells of desperation .
It was the sort of , “ we need to do something right now ” trade that never works .
Ask Isiah Thomas .
Lebron will have to carry the team again and he just might be able to do it .
You see , it ’s not just a make or break season for the Cavs , in a sense , it ’s also a make or break season for Lebron ’s career .
If he does n’t get a championship now and goes to New York or L.A or wherever he goes , it changes the complexion of his career .
He wo n’t be the guy who stuck with his state to the very end .
He wo n’t be the guy who finally brought a championship to Cleveland .
He ’ll be a great player who might or might not get a couple rings and breaks some more statistical records .
It ’s a desperation season and I have a bad feeling about it .
The Magic :
Turkoglu was n’t THAT good .
Vince Carter is a better player .
Bill Simmons also makes a very good point in his recent NBA preview that this is the first legit contender that Vince has played on .
Maybe he steps up .
I ’m worried that they ’ve turned themselves into a conventional team .
Not with the acquisition of Vince Carter but rather with the acquisition of Brandon Bass .
He ’s too short to be a backup center , he ’s too slow and lumbering to be a backup small forward .
In short : he ’s a conventional power forward .
Even though the Magic did , at times , play Gortat and Howard together last season they always had the 6 - 10 Turkoglu out there creating match - up problems .
Brandon
Bass does not create match - up problems and neither does Air Canada ( or is it Southwest Airlines at this point ? )
Talent wise they are better though .
The Celtics :
Ahh the Celtics , you bunch of unlikable douche bags .
Okay , Ray Allen is likable but that ’s about it .
They , much like the Spurs , rely on their aging stars ’ health .
Kevin Garnett ’s knee looks fine for now .
I ’ve seen him in pre-season action and he seems to be moving around pretty well .
Ray Allen is always in perfect shape and has n’t had a serious injury since that ankle thing a couple years ago .
Paul Pierce has n’t missed action for a while now and Brian Scalabrine is still the whitest guy in the league .
Okay that last bit had nothing to do with anything .
All of the guys I just mentioned are past their prime and they have a lot of mileage on .
Since they also have Rasheed Wallace who has similar issues , they ’re like a used car dealership - except they ’re all quality cars …
I think I ’ve taken the analogy too far .
I ’m just putting this out there but I would n’t put money on Kevin Garnett ’s knee .
I just would n’t .
I have no reason to believe that it ’s not fine .
But I have no reason to believe that it ’s going to be okay for another 100 game season either .
No Garnett , no title and that ’s that .
Rasheed Wallace is a good guy coming of the bench , he still has something left in the tank and he has some valuable experience but he does n’t put them over the top .
The only thing standing between the Celtics and another title is a slight slip or a misjudged landing from Mr. Garnett and they wo n’t win another title for a long time .

Historical Outline on the Question of Swiss NuclearArmament
Jurg Stussi - Lauterburg , April 1996 ( Federal Administration , Bern )
Preface
This paper consists of an introduction , a chronicle of the years1965 to 1988 and a summary .
While the Introduction is largely aresum‚ of known facts from a time for which the files areaccessible to researchers in the Federal Archives , the Chronicleconcerns the subsequent period based on the collection ofinternal files collected by the Head of General Staff , CorpsCommander Arthur Liener , on instruction by the President of the Federal Council , Kaspar Villiger .
1. Introduction
Specialised circles of researchers in Switzerland had alreadydevoted attention to the question of the atom bomb before it evenexisted .
The physicist Paul Scherrer ( 1890 - 1969 ) , Professor atthe Eidgen ” ssische Technische Hochschule Z�rich ( SwissConfederate Technical College ) ) even succeeded in inviting hisGerman specialist colleague Werner Heisenberg to present a guestlecture in the Limmat - metropolis [ i.e. Z�rich ] and to introducehim to an American who was associated with the Office ofStrategic Services and whose task it was to establish how far the German efforts with respect to an atom bomb had progressed .
Thomas Powers proves this quite remarkably in his book " Heisenberg 's war " ( London : Jonathan Cape , 1993 , EMB ( FederalMilitary Library No. ) D 1329 ) based on the American files .
Thefact that Scherrer thereafter became our key man for the furtherdevelopment , is well - known , inasfar as the civilian side ofthings is concerned :
The Institutes of Villigen and W�renlingen , united under his name , are the monument that a practically - oriented people has set to an eminent scholar .
Due to a lack ofsource materials ( or , respectively , a lack of time to search forand evaluate the materials available in internal and foreign , particularly American archives ) , it is a open question exactlywhich role Scherrer played in the military endeavour , startingas early as 1945 , toward the development of nuclear energy forthe benefit of the country , i.e. for the construction of a bombas a means of dissuasion .
However , it has been established thatthe " Study Commission for Nuclear Energy " worked out thefundamental principles since 1945 .
The Federal Council of Ministers who officially appointed the SKA ( Study Commission forNuclear Energy ) on 8 June 1946 , requested from Parliament afederal resolution on the promotion of research in the field ofnuclear energy .
Karl Kobelt , Minister of State , emphasised themilitary aspects of this issue strongly enough , but also statedthat a nuclear armament was not planned , which was nearly self - evident in the situation of 1946 and given the objectiveconditions ; however , this was a rather liberal interpretation ofclassified instructions to the SKA .
Had he stated the contrary , he would have made the plan impossible because this would havetriggered irresistible political pressure from abroad .
Thesematters have already been , and will continue to be , the subjectof historical investigations .
However , around 1955 , it can be assumed that the efforts towardsa Swiss nuclear bomb would have slowed down somewhat .
The so - called Chevalier - Initiative of 2 December 1954 , named after itsinitiator , which aimed at cutting military expenditure by halfand utilising the funds released thereby in specified projects , was declared null and void by Parliament .
Samuel Chevaliersubmitted two further initiatives with similar intent on 17 October 1956 .
His lack of realism was , however , all too clearlyunderlined by the bloody suppression of the uprising of the Hungarian people by Soviet tanks as from 5 November 1956 .
Theacute phase of the Cold War had begun .
Decisive factors wouldhave been the shooting down of an American U - 2 reconnaissanceaircraft by the Soviet Union in 1960 , and the Cuban Crisis in theyear 1962 , when a mere word held the balance between the worldand a nuclear exchange of blows : President John FitzgeraldKennedy decreed a Quarantine against Fidel Castro 's island .
Hadhe , with the exact same behaviour of the American navy , ordereda Blockade , this would have constituted a deed of war underinternational law .
In this situation , where world politics were anything butreassuring , the authorities and sovereign of a neutral smallstate , the majority of whom had been moulded by their experienceof holding out against Adolf Hitler 's Reich , had to find a pathto modern security politics .
As in other fields , the variousoptions on the issue of a possible nuclear armament were notmerely handled by state offices but also discussed in public .
On 29 March 1957 , the first meeting of the " Study Commission forthe possible acquisition of own nuclear arms " was held .
This wasan organ of the Head of General Staff , Louis de Montmollin , whodeclared the matter as secret and expressly prohibited anycontact with third persons not authorised by himself .
The aim wasto give the Federal Council of Ministers an orientation towards " the possibility of the acquisition of nuclear arms inSwitzerland " .
In March 1957 , apart from Montmollin himself , theinitiates were the Lower Chief of Staff , Front Divisional ColonelJacques de Boissier ; Colonel in the General Staff , PeterBurckhardt ; Professor Doctor Rudolf Bindschedler , Head of LegalServices of the Swiss Federal Political Department ; the Delegatefor Issues of Nuclear Energy , Doctor Otto Zipfel ; his deputy , Jakob Burckhardt ; the Director of the Reaktor AG company , DoctorRudolf Sontheim , as well as General Staff Colonels Henri Hess and Georg Heberlein .
The Swiss Officers Association , on its behalf , approved nuclear arms as a significant reinforcement of nationaldefence in spring of the same year 1957 , whereas only a yearlater , the initiative committee for the Swiss Movement againstNuclear Armament began collecting signatures for an Article20 bis of the Federal Constitution , which would have prohibited " the manufacture , import , transit , storage and utilization ofnuclear arms of all types " .
First of all , this challenged the Federal Council of Ministers .
On 11 July 1958 , the staff releaseda declaration of principle in this matter , which states : " In agreement with our centuries - old tradition of defensivefortification , the Federal Council of Ministers is therefore ofthe opinion that the army must be given the most effectiveweapons for the preservation of our independence and for theprotection of our neutrality .
This includes nuclear weapons .
TheFederal Council of Ministers has , consequently , instructed the Federal Military Department to continue investigating the issuesarising from the introduction of nuclear weapons into our Army , and to submit to the Federal Council of Ministers at a suitabletime a report on and application for such . "
The fact that thisdeclaration was criticised , among others , by the Soviet newsagency TASS , could only have a stimulating effect since this wasthe officious statement by the most likely opponent ( for theoverall context , compare Dominique Metzler 's licentiate thesis " The option of nuclear armament for the Swiss Army ( 1945 - 1969 ) " , Aarburg : Dominique Metzler , 1995 ) .
Although the officers whoparticipated in the Federal Defense Commission ( LVK ) which servedas advisor to the Chairman to the EMD ( Federal MilitaryDepartment ) , considered a Swiss atom bomb more as an operativeand tactical measure , there were nonetheless voices such as thatof the commander of the Airforce and Anti-aircraft Corps , EtiennePrimault , who , according to the minutes , declared on 29 November1957 , " If one had an aircraft such as the mirage , for example , which is capable of flying to Moscow with atom bombs on board , then a deployment of these in enemy territory could very well beimagined . "
This opinion , however , was only acceptable as amilitary - technological evaluation of the matter , because , politically , the Federal Council of Ministers had no intentionsat all of making Switzerland into the fourth nuclear power behindthe USA , the USSR and Great Britain .
On the contrary , on 7 October 1958 , Bindschedler declared in an aide - memoire to the Swedish ambassador , " The Swiss Army would be equipped withnuclear weapons only under the condition that the monopoly onnuclear power could no longer be upheld by the three worldpowers .
The problem thus only arises once this monopoly no longerexists . "
The Federal Council of Ministers did , however , want to be onguard against this case , which was not so unlikely , after all .
The Council thus instructed the Federal Military Department ( EMD ) on 23 December 1958 to investigate the effects , the acquisition , the purchase and the manufacture of nuclear arms and then tosubmit the report and application .
Such investigations abroadwere to be conducted " in keeping with all aspects of the policyof neutrality and in close co-operation with the FederalPolitical Department . "
Research into uranium deposits , mentionedin the same resolution , was considered to be of civil andmilitary importance .
The Federal Council of Ministers approvedthe accompanying report from the Finance and Customs Departments , according to which the required credits had to appear separatelyin the budget .
The initiative on the prohibition of nuclear arms was submittedon 29 April 1959 .
The Social Democratic Party of Switzerland , now also forced to move , submitted its own initiative on 24 July1959 which provided for a compulsory Referendum on the " decisionon equipping the Swiss Army with nuclear arms of whichever type " .
The Federal Council of Ministers announced the state of itsevaluation of the situation with its message on the Regulationson Troops on 30 June 1960 , stating , " Although the possibility ofacquiring nuclear arms from abroad or manufacturing them insidethe country , is presently lacking , this should not cause us toaltogether sacrifice the concept of this most effectivereinforcement of our military defense of the country .
Thedevelopment should be pursued attentively , so that optionsarising at a later stage can then be considered , should thesituation arise . "
This was the evaluation by the colleagues .
After all , on 14 March1960 , Colonel Corps commander Jakob Annasohn , Chief of GeneralStaff , had actually applied to the Federal Military Department ( EMD ) to obtain offers for the purchase of nuclear arms on acommercial basis from the USA , Great Britain and the SovietUnion , but on the other hand applied to offer France and Swedenco - operation in the area of " essais " [ trials ] .
The FederalCouncil of Ministers refused such ideas altogether .
It did notonly reject such negotiations at the time , it also decreed in allformality that " the conducting of such clarifications could onlybe authorised on the basis of a later decision of the FederalCouncil of Ministers . "
However , the Swiss attitude gave reason for concern among thenuclear powers ( which included France since 13 February 1960 ) , despite the reservation of the authorities .
An American sense ofdisquiet , albeit only a hint in the available files , could bediscerned as from 1961 .
In the same year ( on 25 April ) , the Federal Council of Ministers applied to Parliament to purchasethat aircraft of which Divisional Colonel Etienne Primault hadspoken with much praise in 1957 .
100 Mirage III S were to bepurchased for a total 871 million ( Swiss ) Francs .
In its report on the initiative for the prohibition of nucleararms dated 7 July 1961 , the Federal Council of Ministers onceagain expressed its opinion on the issue of a possible nucleararmament , " In our report , we have , on purpose , not mentioned theacquisition of nuclear arms , be it by means of purchase , by owndevelopment or by manufacture under licence .
The question remainsopen until an option for acquisition arises , and if this is undersuch conditions that neither affect our sovereignty , nor ourneutrality in any manner whatsoever .
This is not the case atpresent .
Decisions with respect to the acquisition , which at anyrate would be a matter resorting under the Federal Councils ' authority , have therefore neither been taken , nor are theyimminent . "
The sovereign power [ people 's referendum ] rejected the initiativeon 1 April 1962 with 537.138 to 286.895 votes.
18 cantons ( districts represented in the Upper Chamber of Parliament ) declined , 4 consented .
In its supplementary report on the initiative to hold areferendum on nuclear arms , the Federal Council of Ministersadapted the points of emphasis to the other wording in theoriginal document , and subsequently stated , on 15 November 1962 :
" Whether our Army can one day be armed with nuclear weapons , isfirst of all a question of military politics and militarytechnology .
It would not be responsible from a point of view ofnational defense , to subject the decision on this matter to thepassionate atmosphere of a public referendum , quite apart fromthe fact that situations are conceivable where the equipment ofour army with nuclear weapons would have to be controlled byrigorous secrecy regulations .
If these were observed , there wouldbe a risk that the population could come to a wrong decision dueto partial ignorance of the full state of affairs ; however , ifone were to transgress these , then we would risk non-delivery ofthe weapons to us or - at best - that their effectiveness wouldbe reduced since their details might also be known to an enemy .
On the other hand , a comprehensive and specialist examination ofthis fundamental decision , too , will be guaranteed by the factualatmosphere in the consultations of the commissions of seniorofficials , their experience and specialised knowledge , as wellas by the possibility of providing them with all the necessaryinformation .
Only the conventional mode of procuring arms , corresponding to the order of competencies to date , is able toguarantee the optimal status of our uncompromising preparednessfor defense . "
To truly appreciate this use of language , one must remember that President Kennedy only lifted the Quarantine on Cuba five dayslater , on 20 November .
The majority of Swiss felt threatened asa whole , and in actual fact , since 1963 , the valid plan ofoperation of the Warsaw convention as set out by General JanSejna ( living in the West since 1968 ) foresaw that Switzerlandwould be the target of a strategic attack immediately after theoutbreak of a possible war ( We will bury you , London : Sidgwick & Jackson , 1982 ; EMB ( Federal Military Library No. ) Ve 2024 ) .
Naturally , such plans were not known to us here in 1963 ; however , there was certainly a sense of their existence .
The planners went to work with the appropriate sense ofearnestness in 1963 and 1964 .
The Lower Chief of Staff forPlanning , Chief Divisional Colonel Eugen Studer , now urged forclarifications with countries abroad , but once again ProfessorBindschedler put a damper on his efforts .
In his letter dated 4July 1963 , Bindschedler sided with the conclusions of a study onforeign policy and international law which , with a somewhatsybilline tenor reminding of La Charit‚ - sur - Loire , had ended onthe note ,
[ french text ]
" The possibilities are not encouraging ; one could hardly avoid foreseeing normal contacts of the General Staff which could secretly be extended to the issues of the study . "
This attitude was , no doubt , in full agreement with the publicopinion of the time , considering that the initiative for areferendum on nuclear arms was rejected with 451.238 against274.061 votes and by 17 « estates against 4 « .
The accession to the Moscow agreement of 5 August 1963 , on theinterdict on nuclear arms experiments in the air , in space andunder water , did not contradict the clarifications for the eventof a possible Swiss nuclear armament .
Hence , on 18 December 1963 , the correspondent for the National Council Commission , WilliBretscher , said , " We are in a position ... even after signing theagreement , to further pursue the problem of our own nucleararmament , and we shall make our decisions depending on theevaluation of further developments in this field . "
This further development which the well - informed chief editor ofthe Neue Z�richer Zeitung and statesman , was keeping in mind , could be the own ( domestic ) manufacture , a joint venture e.g. with Sweden , or , as the Lower Chief of General Staff : Planninghad stated in a communication to the Chief of General Staff on 21 October 1963 , also " in the purchase of nuclear arms abroad ona purely commercial basis , particularly in France " .
On 28 November 1963 , the Lower Chief of General Staff : Planning , calculated costs of 720 million ( Swiss ) francs over 35 years , initially including 20 million francs for pure research .
Shouldthe decision be for Plutonium instead of super - enriched Uranium , then the estimate would be 2.100 million francs over 27 years .
The precise action was drawn up on 21 March 1964 by Doctor PaulSchmid in an eleven - page paper entitled Suggestions relevant tothe execution of such preliminary work for a possible nucleararmament , as is of predominantly military importance .
The sub - group Planning had in the meantime developed a conceptof the first - level military demand : " 50 aircraft bombs @ 60 - 100KT ( Mirage ) " was the designated quantity on 4 May 1964 .
Studerhimself had , on 8 April , signed a five - page document on the " feasibility of nuclear weapon tests in Switzerland " , in whichcavern detonations in a region " where an area with a radius of2 - 3 km can be sealed off completely " were envisaged .
Furthermore , there is proof that Studer still knew , on 30 October 1963 , aboutthe Uranium reserve of the Federal State which was by no meansa secret despite the classified stamps on the documents , sinceNational Council member , Alfred Schaller , had , on 8 September1958 in the Schweizer Illustrierte Zeitung , quite openly spokenof " 10 tons of natural Uranium " , purchased from Belgium , refinedin England " , and had furthermore written that " tons " of thismaterial were lying in the " duty of care " of the Wimmis powderfactory .
Eugen Studer 's studies were further developments of the Possibilities of an own manufacture of nuclear weapons , that 58 - page thick , unsigned report which had laid the theoreticalfoundations for a nuclear armament of Switzerland on 15 November1963 , and about which the USA had apparently come to hear ( muchto its consternation ) while it was in preparation .
Perhaps the Swiss development would have continued on the track outlined in1958 .
However , after the message about the additional credit forthe Mirage , dated 24 April 1964 , other rules for the game becameevident .
On that day , the Federal Council of Ministers decidedto request a further credit of 576 million francs for theacquisition of the Mirages , which triggered a widespread lack ofcomprehension and caused the first parliamentary investigationcommission in the history of the modern federal state .
Accuratelyon the same 24th of April , the Chief of General Staff applied tothe Head of the Federal Military Department to make available 20 million francs for tracing Uranium sources inside the countrywithin three years , to bring the issue of centrifuges closer toa conclusion and to clarify the issues of nuclear weapontechnology and possibilities for experiments .
Despite the Mirage - affair , the experts were nonetheless convincedto be acting in the interests of the sovereign state .
Theatmosphere of 1964 also led to the courageous opinion of anexpert who stated that " the clarification process toward theacquisition of nuclear weapons should not be kept secret from thegeneral public " , a point of view that was supported by Annasohn , Head of General Staff , on 14 May at the Chairman of the Department , " Dr Schmid has declared that it contradicts hischaracter to constantly have to lie , instead of honestly sayingwhat the clarification process is all about .
He is of theopinion , rightfully in my eyes , that the preliminaryclarifications , after all , do not in the least constitute adecision towards the acquisition of nuclear weapons .
Thisdecision will remain entirely and totally excluded . "
How a parliamentary decision , necessary at least for the budgetcredit , could be effected under the circumstances of the Mirage - affair , became more and more unclear as the delay continued .
On1 September , the commissions of inquiry of the National Assemblyand the Upper Chamber published their report in which thefollowing wording can be found , " Parliament was indeed misled .
In the interest of the State , its duty is to ensure that such aprocess will not be repeated .
The credibility of messages fromthe Minister 's Council must be guaranteed by the Executive . "
Thenumber of aircraft to be purchased was reduced to 57 , and themotion included a demand for a Chief of Armament , a panel ofexperts on defense issues , a clear delineation betweendevelopment and the acquisition of armament material as well asinstructions to secure dates and costs , and the submission oftasks to technical and commercial control .
The Federal Council of Ministers could not have been aware ofthis conclusion by the study - group of the commissions KurtFurgler and Gion Darms on 5 June 1964 , but its reaction to theapplications by the EMD was sceptical .
Although the colleaguestook note of the report MAP ( Possibilities for own nuclear armsproduction ) and instructed the EVED ( Federal Traffic and EnergyScience Department ) and the EMD ( Federal Military Department ) toassimilate the documents necessary for decision - making overapproximately three years , but the EMD was obliged to reduce thecosts to the activity of one expert in the Department of GeneralStaff , and once again it was stated about contacts abroad , " Before the introduction of the necessary steps , it [ the EMD ] must obtain the permission of the Federal Council of Ministers . "
Schmid and Annasohn 's suggestions to conduct the necessaryclarifications quite openly , had remained without consequences .
On the other hand it was impossible to uphold secrecy , as thewell - informed interpellation of National Council member , HelmutHubacher , on 9 December 1964 indicates : " Does an instance existwithin the Federal Military Department that concerns itself withthe question of nuclear armament , should the need arise , or withthe mere manufacture of nuclear arms or their testing within ourown country ?
If so , of which persons does this specialist bodyconsist ? "
Etienne Primault and Jakob Annasohn had already left .
What was the situation of Minister of State , Paul Chaudet ?
Wouldhe stay and soon , in the election year of 1967 , become themortgage for his party , or would he leave and thereby allow theEMD as well as his party to appear weak for the moment ?
3. SUMMARY
Scientifically speaking , in 1945 , no other small state was betterprepared for the nuclear age than Switzerland .
The connectionswhich Paul Scherrer had formed during war times with the Americans , who were now leading in the field , warranted thisalready .
The corresponding self - assurance may have led the Federal Council of Ministers to decide , first in secrecy and in1958 quite openly , to equip the army with the most effectiveweapons , i.e. nuclear arms .
In this context , active serviceexperience in the successful self - conservation - thanks to acombination of willingness to compromise and a clearly manifestedwill for self - defense - played as much of a role as the fear ofthe hegemonical claims of the communist superpower , illustratedbeyond doubt in the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 .
However , the process was slowed down considerably due touncertainty whether the feared German nuclear armament would takeplace , also due to a long tradition of democratic legitimationof political decisions , as well as to the permanent battle forrestricted resources .
Finally , the people and the chambers ofgovernment gave a stimulating signal by rejecting an initiativetowards the prohibition of nuclear arms on 1 April 1962 .
A phaseof intensive work began , the most important result of which wasthe report on the possibilities of own nuclear production , in1963 .
Due to their large extent , these efforts could not be keptentirely secret and are likely to have increased American effortstowards a non-proliferation treaty .
Such efforts were mostprobably not directed specifically at Switzerland but ratherreferred to the model that it might parade to others .
Thedeciding turn to the Swiss efforts came with the Mirage - affair : on 24 April 1964 , the Federal Council of Ministers applied foran additional credit of 567 million francs from Parliament , toward the acquisition of fighter aircraft Mirage - III S. Thisdesire led to a parliamentary investigation , to a reduction innumbers ordered , to the abdication of the Chief of General Staffand of the Commander of the Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Troopsas well as causing a rupture in Parliament 's trust in the FederalCouncil of Ministers , and of the Federal Council of Ministers inthe Military Department .
These were no times to be granted the20 million francs over three years for which Paul Chaudet hadapplied , particularly not if an overall cost estimate of 720 million francs was implied beyond this and since undesirableexperiences had just been made , and were still being made , withsuch amounts for military projects .
On 5 June 1964 , the FederalCouncil of Ministers thus only granted the employment of aspecialist in the office of the General Staff Department .
Thereby , a contradiction had arisen between the federal aim ofequipping the army with nuclear arms , declared in 1958 and neverrecalled , and the feasible minimum option in view of rigorousconstraints .
The Federal Council in 1965 , however , was in nohurry to clear up the matter as requested by Paul Chaudet .
In adeclaration in the Von Wattenwyl - House on 26 October 1965 , thecolleagues finally agreed that the civil aspects of the nuclearissue were the clear priority .
On 28 January 1966 , the FederalCouncil of Ministers decided in all formality to realise andimplement the measures and work applied for by the Department ofMilitary and the Military Delegation of the Federal Council of Ministers ( but worded by the delegate for issues of nuclearenergy ) ; however , the initiative was to be handed to the EVED ( Federal Traffic and Energy Science Department ) .
The concept ofthe country 's military defense dated 6.6.66 specified in the sameyear that only a further extension of nuclear arms would forceSwitzerland to decide whether to purchase them or not , and thatthe running clarifications were based on this fact .
Nello Celio who became head of the Military Department in 1967 , was sceptical of the nuclear arms issues .
He clashed withconcepts that the sub - group planning of the Group for GeneralStaff Services had developed , which stated that a working groupshould be founded , begin operating and grow over 5 years from 15to 52 full - time members .
Since Celio was also of the opinion thatit would be wrong to sign the proposed treaty on banning nucleararms without Quid pro quo , he did not give the red light to startappointing a secret Coordination Council based on the decisionof the Federal Council on 28 January 1966 , but allowed only twoto three colleagues to dedicate themselves to this theme on afull - time basis .
This implied maintaining the freedom of action , but not construction of the bomb .
The planning tasks were taken further within the group forGeneral Staff Services .
The Operations Section calculated anannual financial budget of 100 to 175 million francs in 1968 , forthe development and acquisition on the basis of Uranium which wascheaper .
This aimed solely at procuring , until 15 years later ,400 nuclear warheads for the existing fighter aircraft , for themissile launchers and for a guided missile system that was stillto be acquired .
Apart from other phenomenons implied by the year1968 , this was sufficient background for Celio 's rejection of theplanned secret Coordination Committee in May 1968 .
However , the Chief of General Staff subsequently achieved a re-evaluation andonce again got the green light ; Celio on the other hand movedover to the Finance Department on 1 July 1968 , on precisely theday when the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear arms wassigned in London , Moscow and Washington .
From then on , the Finance Department sent clear signs against aSwiss nuclear armament .
Hence , in 1969 , the Federal FinancialAdministration refused to include 1'500'000 francs for thepurpose of developing Uranium centrifuges , into the 1970 budget .
On a political level , the Federal Council of Ministers closed thegap in policy that had already narrowed substantially since the Mirage - affair , by its decision to sign the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear arms on 27 November 1969 .
Even though , in terms of International law , the Swiss renunciation only becameeffective with the ratification on 9 March 1977 , the onlyconceivable option now was to provide Switzerland with thenecessary specialist knowledge to be considered a thresholdcountry , which at the same time safeguarded the freedom ofactivity for the event of the treaty being broken .
To assure thison a practical level , was the task of the Working Committee forNuclear Issues ( AAA ) with a Scientific Advisory Council , createdon 30 April 1969 by the EMD ( Federal Military Department ) inconsultation with the EPD ( Federal Political Department ) , EDI ( Federal Department for the Interior ) and EVED ( Federal Trafficand Energy Science Department ) .
The AAA met altogether 27 timesduring its period of existence ( 30.4.1969 - 31.12.1988 ) , whichis less than twice a year on average , and this alone proves thatthe issues could not have been more than preparatory measures tokeep open the option of a purchase decision for the FederalCouncil of Ministers , should an entirely different internationalsituation arise ; such as a nuclear armament of Germany inconjunction with a failure of the non-proliferation treaty .
The budgeted finance for these tasks was in accordance with thisstate of affairs .
For the time from 1970 until 1972 , the overalltotal came to SFr.
67'949.30 , including the salaries of twophysical scientists who were for a certain time part of the Scientific Advisory Council .
Chief of General Staff , Johann JakobVischer , declared the cessation of operations of DIORIT inW�renlingen as harmless in military terms , even though this mayhave taken a chip out of the original construction - thedevelopment of specialists particularly suited for armstechnology through work on the heavy water reactor .
For furtherwork , Vischer wanted to place the emphasis on enrichmenttechnology , basing his decision also on the judgement of hismilitary specialists .
The will to become a nuclear thresholdpower , however , " did not seem clearly distinguishable to him , atleast not on government level " .
Due to the ratification decision by the Upper Chamber , who wasthe first instance to handle the business and had originallyrejected the task of preparing an additional report , the year1976 brought about a certain sobering effect among the membersof the AAA and of the Scientific Advisory Board .
It was decidedto disband the latter since there was no longer a need for it , but the AAA continued to work further , thanks to a slightlyadapted Decree of 1977 .
The theoretical basis for the work of the AAA in the period from1977 to 1988 was constituted by a document entitled SwissPolitics in the Question of Nuclear Armament , edited by LowerChief of Staff : Front , Josef Feldmann .
This document concludesthat Switzerland has a vested interest in taking all measurespermitted in the framework of the NPT ( Non Proliferation Treaty ) which are suited to secure its status as a nuclear thresholdpower , and maintain it on a long - term basis . "
However , thestudies required for this now stood in incessant competition forscarce finance , against other projects which were easier to carryinto the AAA since the disbanding of the Scientific AdvisoryCouncil , and which had nothing to do with the original task butneeded an AAA legitimation , such as measures for protectionagainst the nuclear electro - magnetic impulse ( NEMP ) .
Around thistime , the Chief of Armament and his group for armament services - whose posts existed thanks to the Mirage affair and who embodiedthe best qualifications in their field to assess the difficultiesof an eventual acquisition - were steering the discussions in theAAA away from questions on the triggering mechanism and otherconcrete arms - technological issues to other matters , with verveand finally with success .
Naturally , this in no way prevented thecompletion of such AAA - tasks as the edition of a technical studyon the rise of Switzerland to a threshold power , which the AAAhad to update periodically .
This was a task issued by the Chiefof General Staff , now Hans Senn , on 28 September 1979 .
Further , Senn 's instruction reads : " In the event that the political ortechnological development leads to an entirely new evaluation ofthe situation , the AAA shall in good time apply for the measuresto be taken . "
On 12 August 1981 however , the political development seemed togive the Federal Council of Ministers permission to abandon thesecrecy around the Uranium reserves in the State , to place themunder international control within the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty , to transfer the right of control to theEVED ( Federal Traffic and Energy Science Department ) which hadto be a member of the AAA , but nothing more than that .
At least , this is what the colleagues believed to have decided , since the Schweizer Illustrierte Zeitung had , in fact , already published the presence and place of storage of this supply in 1958 , whichseems to have been forgotten by everybody in the meantime .
Inthe AAA , on several occasions , discussions had been held aroundthe riddle of how to purchase natural Uranium and store it , justto be sure ; but no - one had pointed out that five and a half tonsof it were actually already lying in Wimmis .
The decision of the Federal Council of Ministers in 1981 showedclearly that on this level - after all , the AAA still had to beheard due to the remaining insecurity - there was little doubtas to the permanence of the Non-Proliferation Treaty , and that Swiss nuclear armament was now a historical issue .
Indeed , in the AAA , the meaningfulness of nuclear armament becameincreasingly contested during the first half of the 'eighties .
Neither the continuation of the ( ?? )
WK - work nor new tasks suchas evaluating the possibilities of a so - called do - it - yourselfbomb ( Bastlerbombe ) , a makeshift nuclear bomb , could cover thisfact .
The fact remains that mere studies can have substantialimportance , though , as the request of the German military attach ‚in 1985 proves :
He was perfectly well - informed about the studiescompleted , knew authors and titles and wished to acquire some ofthese now .
It is not entirely clear from the files whether he didreceive them ; however , the technical secretary of the AAA was notsurprised about this enquiry and furthermore , he applied forpermission to partially grant this request and to do so in a typeof barter , with a corresponding counter - offer .
As usual in theintelligence service of all times and countries , there seems toexist a kind of bazaar even in classified science : at least thisseems the obvious conclusion .
Two further thoughts immediatelyarise : other countries , too , are occupied with the possibilityof a breakdown of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and are preparingfor this event at least as a theoretical concept .
Hence , one canderive that , due to the long duration of the work and thenumerous and unavoidable personal and institutional changes , other things had also been forgotten , apart from the publicationof the Uranium reserves in the " Schweizer Illustrierte " , i.e. inthis case the clear federal prohibition on foreign contacts inthis field without express prior permission from the meeting ofcolleagues .
Finally , one is impressed by the level of disciplinemaintained , because with only a little imagination , one cancalculate the publicist and political consequences should thematter have become known at the time , even though the exchangeof studies surely did not constitute a breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Within the AAA , the spirit of Geneva initiated by Ronald Reaganand Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 accentuated the question whetherthere was meaning to its endeavour , all the more .
On the last dayof this significant year in global history , Divisional CommanderG‚rard de Loes , chairman of the AAA , directed a letter to the Minister of State , Jean - Pascal Delamuraz , and asked him to appealto the Federal Council of Ministers to officially establish that Switzerland still wished to be a nuclear threshold country .
In1986 De Loes , visibly disappointed by the reserve of the Departmental Head towards this matter , openly contemplated thedissolution of the AAA , since he allegedly did not have themandate .
In reality , he probably lacked the confidence and faiththat the existing mandate was meaningful , which moved him tosecure the backing by the Federal Council of Ministers .
In aGRD ( Group for Armament Services ) - study that was nonethelesscommissioned , the " brisance de la question " ( explosive nature ofthe issue ) was emphasised and the appropriateness of the matterwas questioned .
The members of the AAA were by no means the only ones to askthese questions .
In two questions asked within the span of oneweek in 1987 , National Council member , Paul Rechsteiner , wantedto know , among other things , whether the Group for Nuclear Issuesheaded by the EMD ( Federal Military Department ) still existedwithin the administration and if so , for what reason .
The FederalCouncil of Ministers answered that the AAA did still exist , butthat no decision had been taken whether its term of office wouldbe extended again beyond 1988 .
At this time , the Head of GeneralStaff , Corps Commander Eugen L�thy , had already signalled thathe supported the dissolution applied for by the AAA , as the onlymeaningful task still left in view of the status as a thresholdstate .
Finally , it remained for the AAA to apply for its owndissolution , which was decided unanimously with one abstention .
Accordingly , on 1 November 1988 , Minister of State , ArnoldKoller , drew the final stoke under the issue of a Swiss nucleararmament .

September 6 , 2009 – I was just watching Jodie and Marc walking through the hemp field and I thought it would be a good time to share my hemp ethanol research with y’all !
In this day of oil wars , peak oil ( and the accompanying soaring prices ) , climate change and oil spills such as the Exxon - Valdez , it ’s more important than ever to promote sustainable alternatives such as hemp ethanol .
Hemp turns out to be the most cost - efficient and valuable of all the fuel crops !
And as it turns out , the whole reason for hemp prohibition – and alcohol prohibition – may have been a fuel monopoly !
( i) Insert from Part One : The Economics of Hemp Fuels —
THE EXPERTS :
I decided to investigate these arguments against biofuels and hemp fuels by bouncing them off people doing research in this area .
I spoke with Adrian Francis Clarke of Fibre ( Europe ) Laboratory LTD , Don Wirtshafter of the Ohio Hempery , Tim Castleman of fuelandfiber.com , and Shaun Crew of Hemp Oil Canada .
It is important to understand that hemp provides two types of fuel ; hemp biodiesel – made from the oil of the hemp seed , and hemp ethanol / methanol – made from the fermented stalk .
To clarify further , ethanol is made from such things as grains , sugars , starches , waste paper & forest products , and methanol is made from woody matter .
Through processes such as gasification , acid hydrolysis and enzymes , hemp can be used to make both ethanol and methanol .
I asked questions about the current prices of hemp biodeisel and hemp ethanol / methanol , and what these prices would be post cannabis relegalization .
To be economically viable , these fuels would have to be cheaper than gasoline , currently priced at up to 120 cents per liter ( Can . ) ( 7 ) or up to 3 dollars per gallon ( US ) ( 8 ) Of course , petroleum prices could get much more expensive in the near future , a topic which will be covered in the third part of this article under “ peak oil ” …
Hemp methanol , on the other hand , does make the fuel lineup .
According to Tim , hemp ethanol could be produced for 1.37 per gallon plus the cost of the feedstock , with technological improvements and tax credits reducing the price another dollar or so per gallon !
( 14 ) And the cost of the feedstock would become much more available as more hemp was grown for more products , providing more and more free ( or nearly - free ) feedstock as a “ waste product ” .
Could you imagine paying under 50 cents per gallon ( US ) or 15 cents per liter ( CAN ) for your hemp ethanol ?!! ”

Many of Japan 's newly destitute are reliant on soup kitchens
Not many incoming prime ministers would envy the task facing Yukio Hatoyama , the man who 's likely to inherit responsibility for Japan 's deep economic crisis after yesterday 's historic election .
After more than half a century of virtually uninterrupted rule by the Liberal Democratic Party , now it is the turn of the Democratic Party of Japan to try to find a cure for the country 's chronic economic malaise .
Unemployment is at a record level of 5.7 % .
Consumer prices fell by 2.2 % last month , raising fears of a new deflationary spiral , similar to the one which paralysed Japan for much of the 1990s .
Exports , the lifeblood of the Japanese economy , have collapsed - exports to the US were down by 39.5 % year - on - year in July ; to China down by 26.5 % , to the European Union down by 45 % .
So how will the new government get the country out of the mess ?
The Democratic Party says it will cancel unnecessary and costly infrastructure projects , slim down the country 's bloated bureaucracy and invest in areas like environmental and medical technology , which party leaders say they have identified as the growth areas of the future .
Japan , once the home of the world 's most remarkable economic miracle , has embarked on a new , but highly uncertain , chapter in its history
Profile : Yukio Hatoyama Press upbeat on Japan 's elections
But when I met Masao Watanabe , chairman of Japan Pure Chemicals , a small but highly specialised company that develops the chemicals used to coat materials in integrated circuits , he told me he wants the new government to adopt a cautious approach .
Too much change too fast is not what the country needs , he says .
Like many Japanese entrepreneurs , he is nervous of what change can mean .
Most of Japan 's economic activity is in the hands of men like Mr Watanabe , who run thousands of small and medium - size companies , many of them supplying the needs of the major multi-nationals like Hitachi , Toyota and Sony .
At the electronics giant Panasonic , they are investing heavily in environmental technology , using their know - how to develop what they call an eco-house , which eventually will be able to produce and consume all the energy it needs without contributing to the emission of carbon gases .
This , they say , is the future .
Soup kitchens So Japan is changing .
But the change is already leaving thousands of victims in its wake .
Men who once had jobs for life - the " salarymen " whose companies provided for their every need - are now out of work , or on short - term contracts .
I met a 48 - year - old former junior manager who lost his job after 18 years with the same company .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He would no give me his name , and he would not be photographed .
He has not dared tell his parents or his neighbours that he has no job .
Only his wife and son know .
Labourers who built the steel - and - glass high - rise buildings that dominate the Tokyo skyline are now destitute - thousands of them are living on the streets .
At one soup kitchen alone , I saw more than 300 men waiting patiently , sitting cross-legged on the ground , for a local charity to provide their one hot meal of the day : rice and meat , served in plastic bowls .
So the challenge now for the Democratic Party is both to revive the economy and find a way to provide basic welfare benefits for the homeless and unemployed .
Japan 's national debt is already approaching 200 % of GDP , the highest ratio in the world ; borrowing more will not be easy .
The Democratic Party has never served in government before and has yet to spell out how exactly it intends to find the cash to do all the things it has promised to do .
Japan , once the home of the world 's most remarkable economic miracle , has embarked on a new , but highly uncertain , chapter in its history .
Robin Lustig has been reporting from Tokyo on the Japanese Election for BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme .

DETROIT --
The Detroit Lions and Oakland Raiders failed to sell all their tickets for Sunday 's games by an NFL - imposed deadline and will be blacked out on local television .
The Lions fell well short of a sellout for their game against the Washington Redskins , while the Raiders failed to sell out their game against the Denver Broncos by the league deadline of 72 hours before kickoff .
The San Diego Chargers were able to lift the local television blackout for Sunday 's game against the Miami Dolphins , selling enough tickets by Thursday 's deadline .
The Arizona Cardinals were also able to sell out their game against the Indianapolis Colts .
Lions spokesman Bill Keenist said Thursday the game will be blacked out in the Detroit , Lansing , Saginaw - Flint and Toledo , Ohio , markets .
More than 10,000 - plus tickets were available on Wednesday .
Last week , the Lions were able to sell 1,700 available tickets in time for the home game against Minnesota .
The Lions have lost 19 games in a row , matching the second - longest skid in NFL history .
Coach Jim Schwartz says the team must take responsibility for the empty seats .
" It is on us because it 's our job to win , " he said .
" It 's our job to get fans excited and to give them a reason to come to the game .
And when we do that , we wo n't have to worry about blackouts or sellouts or anything else . "
The Raiders got a one - day extension to sell out their opener against San Diego but were unable to avoid the blackout against the Broncos .
The Raiders have had two games blacked out each season since taking over ticket sales from Alameda County before the 2006 season .
This marks the first division game blacked out during that time .

KANSAS CITY , Mo. -- Kansas City Chiefs running back Larry Johnson issued his second apology in 12 months Tuesday and was told to stay away from the team while the NFL and the Chiefs complete their investigation into his use of a gay slur .
Johnson is not expected to play for Kansas City in its next game , Nov. 8 at Jacksonville , a league source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter .
As Johnson was releasing his apology , a national gay rights advocacy organization called on the league and the team to take disciplinary action against the two - time Pro Bowler .
The latest chapter in Johnson 's stormy career began Sunday night when he questioned coach Todd Haley 's football credentials on his Twitter account .
He used the slur during an exchange with one of his Twitter followers .
A day later , he used it again as he brushed off reporters and told them he would not comment , according to the Kansas City Star , which recorded the comment .
Haley refused to address the matter Tuesday , saying it was still being investigated .
" I 'm just not going to comment any further because there is some stuff going on , " Haley said .
Larry Johnson 's father told the Star that he was hurt by his son's use of gay slurs .
" That 's just not who we are and not what we believe , " Larry Johnson Sr. told the newspaper .
" It 's not how he was raised .
" It 's tough for me as a father . "
Johnson Sr. told the newspaper that it would be wrong to label his son as homophobic .
" He does not hate gays .
That 's not Larry , and that 's not our family , " Johnson Sr. told the Star .
" He 's my son .
You ca n't disown him .
We just talk to him , listen to him , and help him move forward . "
Johnson , who turns 30 next month , signed a five - year contract extension in 2007 that included $ 19 million guaranteed and could be worth up to $ 45 million .
The team could be checking to see whether Johnson violated contract provisions that would allow the Chiefs to cut him with reduced financial obligation .
Last spring , an arbitrator ruled that the Chiefs could release the running back and not owe him $ 3.5 million in guaranteed money because he had violated contract conditions by pleading guilty to disturbing the peace in another incident .
The issue became moot when the team elected not to cut him and until he began tweeting on Sunday night , the often - volatile Johnson had been on good behavior .
The Chiefs said they have told Johnson he would not be allowed to practice with the team or participate in team activities until the matter was resolved , though he has not been suspended .
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league would have no comment pending the investigation .
Johnson , who needs only 75 yards rushing to become the Chiefs ' all - time leader , apologized to Haley , the team , fans and the league " for the words I used . "
" I regret my actions .
The words were used by me in frustration , and they were not appropriate , " he said through a spokesman .
" I did not intend to offend anyone , but that is no excuse for what I said . "
The apology sounded similar to one he made almost exactly a year ago after one woman accused him of throwing a drink on her and another said he had pushed her .
The incidents happened separately in Kansas City nightclubs and led to his being sentenced to two years ' probation after pleading guilty to two counts of disturbing the peace .
" I 'm going to work to that point to get my life back on track and know that I and I alone put myself in these critical situations and environments to where things do n't come out favorably to me , " he said on Oct. 22 , 2008 .
At the time , Johnson was benched for three games by then - coach Herm Edwards and suspended for a game by commissioner Roger Goodell .
On Tuesday , Johnson apologized to " all the kids who view athletes as role models .
I was not a good role model yesterday and hopefully I can become a better role model .
We all make mistakes , and the challenge is to learn from them .
" I will do my best to learn from this one as I move toward becoming a better person , teammate , and member of the Kansas City Chiefs team and community . "
Johnson 's agent said all his client could do now was wait .
" It 's up to the NFL to investigate it and see what they want to do , and we will respond accordingly , " Peter Schaffer told The Associated Press .
" We 've apologized .
Larry 's trying to move forward .
It is what it is right now . "
Jarrett Barrios , president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , called on the NFL and the Chiefs to take disciplinary action and seize a chance to educate " on the dangers of homophobia in sports . "
Such slurs are used to " ridicule and harass young gay and transgender athletes on local sports fields across America , " Barrios said .
Barrios said he welcomed the apology .
" Larry Johnson 's apology sends an important message that there is no excuse for using anti-gay epithets , " Barrios said .
Drafted in the first round out of Penn State in 2003 , Johnson was one of the best running backs in the NFL in 2005 and ' 06 , rushing for more than 1,700 yards in each season .
This year , like the Chiefs , he has struggled , averaging only 2.7 yards per carry .
Kansas City ( 1 - 6 ) has a bye week .

HARARE , Zimbabwe — Mention Zimbabwe and the listener will think of chaos and decay .
But in October , with jacaranda trees displaying their striking purple blossoms , the nation ’s capital , Harare , could easily be described as charming .
White British settlers imported the trees from South America at the end of the 19th century .
Whole avenues are awash with masses of mauve blooms .
Their appearance heralds the arrival of summer , which in Zimbabwe arrives on the dot at this time of year .
And as the heat increases so does the prospect of rain .
There is nothing more dramatic than a highveld thunderstorm as lightning bolts zigzag down to earth .
Within a few weeks the arid countryside is transformed into a sea of green .
The coming of the rains marks the end of the jacaranda ’s brief reign .
It is soon replaced by flame trees whose flowering branches provide a scarlet - red canopy across the city .
Postcards from the 1960s show a prosperous and well - laid - out town with flowerbeds and tidy streets .
Statues of colonial founders stare down from their pedestals , a breed confident in the perpetuity of their rule .
Times have changed .
Harare has not escaped the impact of population growth evident everywhere in Africa .
Zimbabwe has burgeoned from 5 million to 12 million in a generation .
Every nook and cranny is now occupied as rural folk drift to towns to seek , if not their fortunes , then jobs and subsistence .
Vestiges of the old city can be seen here and there .
But the remains are sad to behold .
Bicycle tracks are overwhelmed by rogue shrubs , some street lights have n’t worked for years and sidewalks contain pot holes that would comfortably consume an unsuspecting pedestrian .
Indeed , some have .
But viewed from the perspective of the hill that overlooks the city , it is a pretty and well - ordered town laid out in a grid pattern .
The statues have , of course , been relocated .
But students of “ contemporary ” ( 1950s ) architecture may be pleased to know that the main artery through the city center contains some of the finest examples of ' 50s street lamps surviving in Africa including their “ Chinese hats . ”
And some of them actually work .
Here the great mining , banking and insurance companies had their headquarters in the boom years of the Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland — today Zimbabwe , Zambia and Malawi .
All three countries experienced post - colonial economic collapse but none so dramatic as Zimbabwe .
A few banks remain but mostly the businesses have migrated to office parks on the periphery of the city .
And with their departure the city has succumbed to crime and grime .
Piles of rubbish occupy street corners .
And street kids beg at traffic lights .
President Robert Mugabe is universally blamed for the blight of a once - beautiful city .
Irresistible demographics have played a role but change has not been well managed .
An energetic , business - minded mayor has the daunting task of putting the city back together again .
He ’s unlikely to succeed .
But some pot holes have been filled .
“ One thing he [ Mugabe ] ca n’t take from us is the weather , ” one old timer chuckles .
It is true that Harare has one of the finest climates in the world .
At 5,000 feet it is never too hot or humid and the winter months of May , June , July and August are filled with cloudless blue skies as the rain keeps a discreet distance .
Zimbabwe has a well - developed tourism infrastructure and an impressive range of wildlife .
But the resorts are empty with hotels reporting 30 percent occupancy .
The customer is king .
There is no problem with comfort or security at the country ’s main resorts .
From its mountains in the east and national parks in the west , to the stunning Victoria Falls and tranquil Lake Kariba , Zimbabwe offers a range of sights for the visitor .
But the tourists wo n’t be coming back just yet .
Like the rest of us they are waiting for the main obstacle to change being removed from the road ahead .
Foreigners and Zimbabweans alike hope that it wo n’t be too long now .
Bill Frist , former Senate Republican leader , majority leader , and kitten murderer , shows us what " leadership " looks like -- from the sidelines of the debate .
Were he still in the Senate , " I would end up voting for it , " he said .
" As leader , I would take heat for it .
...
That 's what leadership is all about . "
This is not to say that Frist is entirely happy with everything that is in the bill .
For one thing , he does n't think it does nearly enough to bring costs under control .
In his view , it does not fundamentally change the incentives that providers now have to provide more care , rather than better care .
" There is really nothing to bend the cost curve , " he says [...]
Frist also faults some in his own party for injecting alarmism into the debate .
" Clearly , the death panels and public plan arguments have been overblown , " he says .
Frist noted that Republicans themselves voted for a Medicare prescription drug bill that would have established a version of a public plan -- with the government negotiating directly with drug companies -- if private - sector competition had failed to materialize .
There 's no way in hell Frist supports this while in the Senate .
None .
But I should n't be so negative -- as a former top leader in the GOP and a physician , his characterization of the public plan is remarkably refreshing .
Here we have a conservative Republican admitting that the hysteria over the public plan is " overblown " -- something even some Democrats are finding impossible to do .
And this speaks to a recurring theme of ours in the past few months -- " bipartisanship " does n't necessarily mean getting Republican votes for the legislation , it 's building support among all political factions around America .
In polling , the public option consistently gets support from about a quarter of Republicans , and now we can add the former Senate majority leader , physician , and conservative stalwart Frist to that tally .
Congressional Republicans are looking to score political points , not fix problems .
At least in Frist 's case , that 's no longer a concern .
FAJARDO , Puerto Rico —
If there are any fish on Jupiter ’s moon Europa , they can breathe easy .
Researchers hunting for signs of life beyond Earth have long been drawn to Europa because several features of the moon ’s icy surface — including its bright color , networks of long fractures and crater - free terrain — suggest that the moon contains a vast ocean buried under the ice .
Now one researcher has calculated that the proposed ocean may receive about 100 times more oxygen than previous models indicated — enough to support respiration by 3 million tons of fish or their Europan equivalent .
Oxygen , generated by charged particles striking water molecules on the moon ’s surface , would take 1 to 2 billion years to begin seeping into the ocean , calculated Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona in Tucson .
That delay would have been critical for supporting life because it would have allowed time for primitive organisms to develop the ability to use oxygen .
If oxygen instead had been immediately released into the ocean , it would have destroyed fledgling life through the well - known process oxidation , commented Jonathan Lunine , also of the University of Arizona , who was not part of the study .
Greenberg reported the findings October 9 at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society ’s Division for Planetary Sciences .
Theorists had previously calculated that the charged particles striking Europa would produce oxygen within the top few centimeters of the moon ’s crust .
Small impacts from space debris would then kick up material that would bury this oxygenated layer to a depth of a few meters .
The new part of the story , said Greenberg , came when he considered Europa ’s youthful , nearly crater - free appearance .
The paucity of craters indicates that the crust is continually resurfaced .
Today ’s crust is only 50 million years old , even though the moon formed soon after the solar system ’s birth 4.56 billion years ago .
Over a period of about 50 million years , a layer of ice 300 meters thick slowly rises from below , eventually covering the moon ’s surface and erasing old craters , Greenberg suggested .
As a result of this facelift , Europa ’s oxygenated layer grows increasingly thick , until after about 1 to 2 billion years the entire ice layer is oxygen - rich , Greenberg said .
At that point , ice melting at the bottom of the frozen layer would begin delivering oxygen into the buried proposed ocean at a faster rate than previously estimated , resulting in about 100 times more oxygen in the ocean .

Frederic Mitterrand said all those he paid for sex were close to his own age A French politician has refused to resign over comments that he enjoyed paying for " boys " in Thailand .
Frederic Mitterrand , 62 , the culture minister , denied that passages of his book , The Bad Life , described sexual encounters with underage boys .
Interviewed on French TV , he condemned sex tourism and paedophilia , saying he had only paid for sex with men his age .
Mr Mitterrand , nephew of late President Francois Mitterrand , faced criticism from left and right in recent weeks .
ANALYSIS Hugh Schofield , BBC News , Paris Frederic Mitterrand got his key messages over loud and clear : one , he was ineradicably opposed to sex tourism ; two , he had never himself paid for sex with underage boys .
He also turned the tables on his attackers - accusing them of conflating homosexuality with paedophilia .
From now on , anyone who reopens the attack on Mr Mitterrand risks the stigma of intolerance .
Questions are bound to remain about how truthful he was being .
But culture ministers in France always have a certain licence .
Most French people will take him at his word .
His book was little - noticed when it was first published in 2005 .
However it returned to the headlines after Mr Mitterrand made an impassioned defence of film director Roman Polanski , who was recently arrested in Switzerland on child sex charges .
Mr Mitterrand said the behaviour of the United States , in seeking his extradition , was callous and " horrifying " .
His comments in support of Polanski led the right - wing National Front to lead the criticism of Mr Mitterrand over events in his past .
France 's Socialist opposition has also been sharply critical of Mr Mitterrand .
' Not a crime ' Mr Mitterrand appeared on a French TV news programme on Thursday evening visibly angry and far from apologetic .
" I absolutely condemn sexual tourism [ and ]
I condemn paedophilia in which I have never in any way participated , " Mr Mitterrand said .

People " should not confuse paedophilia and homosexuality " , the culture minister insisted , describing his actions in Thailand as an error - " without a doubt " - but not a crime .
" Each time I was with people who were my age , or who were five years younger - there was n't the slightest ambiguity - and who were consenting , " he said .
Mr Mitterrand said he retained the confidence of current President Nicolas Sarkozy and that he had not offered to resign over the controversy .
He had committed what he thought was an " offence against ... human dignity " , but strongly denied any accusations of illegal sexual activities .
' Kind of a diva ' French political analyst Michel Gurfinkiel said Mr Mitterrand 's description of sexual encounters in the book was clearly referring to young adults , rather than minors .

" He very clearly talks about young adults and not minors , " Mr Gurfinkiel told the BBC's The World Today programme .
He added that should the " media storm " surrounding the story continue into the weekend Mr Mitterrand may well have to resign , but that his position may well be safe should coverage fade away .
" [ Mitterrand ] is seen as a kind of a diva , and a lot of people love to hate him for that , " said Mr Gurfinkiel .
When Mr Mitterrand 's book , described by his publishers as a novel based on autobiography , was written , it received literary praise and did not generate controversy .
When he was appointed to the French government in June 2009 Mr Sarkozy described his new minister as " talented and courageous " .

The most harrowing job in the world
After a teenage girl is lured to her death by an internet predator , this is a unique insight into the police who dedicate their lives to bringing child abusers to justice .
Their stories are deeply disturbing , but should be heard .
Detective Inspector Tony Smith looks as if he is trying not to cry .
We are sitting in the boardroom of the Child Protection Unit for West London , housed in a drab , faceless building on Earls Court Road .
The room is devoid of colour apart from the dozen or so synthetic blue chairs and the pile of lurid photographs that lies on the big table between us .
The photographs are of Amber .
The first shows that she is a beautiful , dark - skinned child , not quite four years old .
Pain :
Many horrific child abuse cases go unheard ( picture posed by model )
Her closed eyes are long - lashed under a high forehead .
Were it not for the plastic tube up her nose , held in place with a strip of sticking plaster , she would look serene and cherubic .
The second photograph is of the back of Amber 's head .
There are two big , bloody , scabby and suppurating patches where the rest of her black , curly hair once was .
Tony explains that Amber 's father swung her around the room by her pigtails .
Then he ripped her pigtails out with such force that he scalped her .
I have never known what a ' scalping ' looks like until now .
Tony says Amber 's hair will never grow back .
There are about a dozen more photographs of Amber .
Two are of her
hands , reduced to pink , skinless messes by severe scalding or burning .
One photograph shows the ugly deep cut on her knee that someone has tried to hide with a big plaster .
Others detail the swelling and bruising all over her body from constant kicking by an adult .
Most of Amber 's injuries were inflicted by her father , though it is not clear who was responsible for burning her hands .
Tony thinks her mother may have been involved .
The photographs were taken during a police examination , which was carried out under general anaesthetic because Amber was in so much pain .
' Without a shadow of a doubt they'd have killed her if we had n't got her out .
Her little body simply could n't have gone on taking that level of abuse , ' says Tony , closing Amber 's file .
' Amber 's was the worst case I have ever come across .
I 've never seen anything as bad .
' I'm welling up now , ' he suddenly adds , and this time I am in no doubt that he is close to crying .
Computer - savvy paedophiles can be hard to trace
Originally from Lincolnshire , Tony has a kind face framed by feathery , white hair that makes him look older than his 40 years .
He is clearly a sensitive man .
Yet here he is , a high - ranking officer , currently acting as Detective Inspector in West London 's Child Abuse Investigation Team ( CAIT ) , dealing with case after case of cruelty , neglect , violence and sexual abuse .
Such child protection officers have recently received criticism over the death of ' Baby Peter ' , which happened despite 60 visits by social workers and other agencies .
Earlier this month came the warning from a Government watchdog , Ofsted , that three children a week are dying in this country because of failings in the child protection system .
Now we have Ashleigh Hall , the teenager killed by a 32 - year - old registered sex offender she met on Facebook .
Tricked into believing he was a boy of 16 , Ashleigh met the man only to face a terrifying ordeal before her death .
She was bound and gagged before being thrown into the back of a Ford Mondeo .
Later her body was dumped in a ditch .
Child protection officers have recently received criticism over the death of ' Baby Peter ' , which happened despite 60 visits by social workers and other agencies
As a registered attacker of young women , Ashleigh 's Facebook predator was required to inform police of any change of address .
But when he moved home , he did not do so .
He appeared simply to fall off the radar .
Such is the ingenuity and cunning of computer - savvy paedophiles in the modern world that the police find it increasingly difficult to keep track of them .
The police , of course , face enormous challenges , the scale of which made me question what kind of person becomes a child protection officer , coping not just with the business of saving children but with having to confront the men and women who neglect , harm , torture and rape them .
I first came into contact with CAIT in April 2008 when I was investigating the crimes of a paedophile named Roger Took for a series of articles , one of which appeared in the Daily Mail .
A writer and leading member of Britain 's art establishment who lived in Chelsea , Took was sentenced in February 2008 to a minimum of four - and - a - half years for 17 crimes relating to child abuse .
They included molesting two of his step - granddaughters , aged nine and 11 , and the possession of 260 photographs , including 102 ' Level Fives ' , which means they contain images of children being tortured or penetrated , including by animals .
Many images on Took 's laptop showed children in obvious pain , shackled to chains or bars .
The computer revealed that Took had taken part in 742 chat logs of a sexual nature relating to children , adding up to over 1,500 pages .
A shocking aspect of his case was the way many of his distinguished colleagues appeared to excuse his perverted behaviour , even bringing pressure on his wife , Pat , to hush up the whole episode as though child abuse did not happen in the upper echelons of society .
Yet , we all know - and none better than the child protection officers - that cruelty and sexual deviance is as likely to occur in a mansion or vicarage as on a council estate .
The first time I saw the Took chat logs was in the Family Room at the Earl 's Court CAIT office .
Intended to reassure children , it is equipped with cuddly toys and furnished with sofas in cheery hues .
Ashleigh Hall :
The teenager killed by a 32 - year - old registered sex offender she met on Facebook
Detective Sergeant Kevin Hudson and Detective Constable Steve Dobson made me tea and brought up the five boxes containing Took 's files .
The officers had worked together to convict Took , which meant reading the chat logs from beginning to end .
' I spent two weeks , ten hours a day trawling through that stuff , ' Kevin , a married father of three told me .
He added that this aspect of the job was wearing him down and he needed a change .
Another officer who had looked through the Took files went further .
He confided : ' It was vile .
My personal life was really affected .
I mean , kissing was n't normal at home during that time , let alone anything else .
It really did haunt me .'
Reading the Took chat logs , I was aware I was crying only when Kevin and Steve offered me a box of tissues and more tea .
They asked if I was alright .
I felt I ought to be .
After all , I had spent years in Africa as a film - maker , recording all kinds of abuse to women and children .
Yet this British case left me in profound shock .
It was not until this year that I was granted unprecedented full access to child protection officers on the Earl 's Court team and was allowed to talk to them about the impact of their work on their own lives .
Steve , who worked with Kevin on the Took case , is a younger man of 29 .
He joined the police after art college and is a sensitive soul .
His girlfriend is a primary school teacher and they live in a leafy London suburb .
He does not discuss details of his work with her and only rarely these days with his friends .
He recalls being on a stag weekend in April 2008 , two months after Took was sentenced .
' There was a whole load of us from up North and we were somewhere awful in Spain for a week , ' he begins .
The public is often unaware of the horrors inflicted
' My Northern mates rarely talk to me about being a police officer , but one day I was walking on the beach with one of them and he was asking what I did .
' He was giving me all the usual , stock responses like , " Oh , I 'd want to kill the bastard ! " and " I do n't know how you do it . "
' I started justifying my job .
I was trying to express how devastating the effect of Took 's crimes was on those little girls and his family .
‘ I got so upset and emotional that I started to cry .
I 'd never experienced that before .
I 've been doing this for three years , but now I 'm tired .
‘ I 've had enough .
The problem is there is n't anywhere to go after here .
These kids genuinely need our help .
Anything I do after this will seem trivial in comparison . '
All the child protection officers talk of deriving satisfaction from rescuing the innocents , and the notion of punishment for those who harm children is very important to them .
Tony says the police need closure as much as the victims .
Amber 's parents were eventually sentenced to 22 years between them for cruelty , neglect and the injuries they inflicted on their daughter .
' If they had n't been found guilty . . .'
His voice trails off as he contemplates the unpalatable thought .
Amber 's father was arrested and taken to Paddington Green Police Station .
' The jailer , a sturdy chap who'd seen it all before , was taken in by him at first , ' adds Tony .
' Amber 's dad was speaking really softly and asking the jailer to be careful with his wife as she was pregnant .
' This made the jailer think he was a good bloke .
He was taking him a cup of tea and that kind of thing .
When the jailer found out what this man had done , he nearly went berserk . '
I guess that 's the normal reaction to this kind of crime .
It 's incredibly hard not to be angry when you see such a small , defenceless child in such pain .
Not long after , I meet Detective Constable Gabriel Chrystal .
He wears a lilac shirt with silver cufflinks and is as polished as a smart shop manager in London 's Bond Street .
He ushers me into the CAIT boardroom , talking straight away about the cases he has worked on .
One involved a young , wealthy couple from the Home Counties who booked into a London hotel with their nine - month - old daughter .
A few hours later the baby was in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital suffering from a massive drugs overdose .
The parents resolutely denied they had been taking Class A drugs and feeding them to their baby , claiming the girl had choked on a hair - tie or a crisp .
Because the doctors did not have the correct information to diagnose what was wrong with the baby , she nearly died .
Another case involved a woman who had disciplined her 14 - year - old son by beating him with electric cable , biting him and dragging him along the carpet so violently that his legs were raw .
Then there was the play centre worker for Westminster Council who had groomed a girl in his care from the age of eight and had sex with her twice when she was 14 .
Gabriel speaks articulately and is clearly motivated by catching and punishing the perpetrators of these crimes .
He goes back to the case of the Home Counties couple .
At the hospital , Gabriel was given the task of taking hand swabs from the baby to see if there were signs of drugs .
They came back clear , though her bottle clearly bore telling chemical traces .
Gabriel was suspicious of the parents from the beginning .
' When I took those swabs and saw that baby lying there , it really affected me .
I got huge satisfaction that the baby survived and her parents went to prison . '
One evening I leave the CAIT office with another child protection officer and we talk about the case of Baby Peter before saying our goodbyes .
' The people who did that to that little boy are pure evil , ' he spits with anger .
' His spine had been broken like a French loaf , right in half , like that - snap !'
With his hands he makes a sudden sharp movement which I remember vividly even now .
Despite feeling enraged , the officers spend their time , energy and resources removing the children from harm 's way and sending the criminals to prison .
They do so against the odds .
Worryingly , there is a growing belief among thinking people , who should know better , that the media reporting of paedophilia and child abuse is sensationalist , particularly in the wake of Baby Peter .
Alternatively , many tend to think that child protection officers , social workers and so on are blinkered zealots , prone to wrenching children away from their parents and shoving them into care at the merest hint of inappropriate behaviour .
Of course , there have been innocent adults who have been wrongly accused of ' abuse ' .
Yet my faith that we live in a generally safe society for children has been eroded by the weeks I have spent with CAIT .
It is not that I now suspect every other adult of being a paedophile .
Nor do I support some of the recent Government measures to ' vet and clear ' almost anyone who comes into contact with children .
I have no definitive answers as to how to make society a safer place for our children , but I have come to realise that the public remains uninformed of the full extent of crimes against them .
Some details are deemed by editors too shocking to report on ( and there are often court restrictions on what can be publicised to protect the identity of the child victims ) , which means that many members of the public are simply unaware of the horrors inflicted on the innocent that the police are dealing with .
' He was only looking at photographs , ' was one of the phrases I heard several times in Took 's defence .
When I asked one man what sort of photographs , he told me naively that they probably involved scantily dressed teenagers .
Child abuse is not new , but the internet has given paedophiles access to each other globally as well as to photographs , films and child pornography .
Through the net , a paedophile now has a self - validating community of like - minded people affirming to each other the ' normalcy ' of their perverted activities .
It was in just such a community chatroom that Roger Took was able to expound his fantasies that extended way beyond mere sexual abuse to torture and murder .
The police believe him to be very dangerous , and their job as guardians of children is to make sure that such a man is incarcerated .
Yet after all of Kevin and Steve 's commitment to , and work on , the investigation , Took could be eligible to leave prison next April .
He will have served just four years .
No wonder these child protection officers feel jaded .

Britain 's five largest banks are to accept the curbs on bonuses agreed by G20 leaders at the recent Pittsburgh summit , Alistair Darling has announced .
The five banks that have signed up to the new rules are Barclays , HSBC , Lloyds , RBS and Standard Chartered .
While the curbs do not limit bonuses , the changes will include the banks having to disclose all such payments .
The chancellor said UK banks were leading the way , and he expected them to set the global standard for others .
" It is vital that our financial services industry remains at the forefront of the industry globally and takes a responsible and long - term approach to remuneration , " he said .
Risk management
Banks have been under pressure to limit large bonuses since the credit crisis .
ANALYSIS BBC Business Editor Robert Peston
The bankers have agreed to end the scandal of bonuses being paid for short - term profits that turned out to be an illusion .
This is significant , but let 's not get carried away .
The Financial Services Authority demanded this of them some months ago , and it is actually what the banks are already doing .
So this was a pretty easy commitment for them to make , and it certainly does n't mean it is going to be a bleak Christmas for bankers .
It has been a good year for many of them and they will still get these bonuses - some of them will be very big - but they wo n't be able to get their hands on the cash for at least two or three years .
Excessive bonuses were considered to be a significant cause of the big losses in the banking sector , because they encouraged investment bankers to take excessive risks .
The five banks said in a joint statement that " it is essential that banking reward is consistent with effective risk management and that there is parity both nationally and internationally on these issues " .
They will now comply with the new rules on remuneration that city regulator the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) first announced in August and will be put into force on 1 January , in line with the G20 agreement .
The five banks that have agreed to limit their staff bonuses include three that have not needed access to emergency government funds - Barclays , HSBC and Standard Chartered .
Key elements of the FSA 's new rules include : • Minimum bonus agreements should be limited to just one year • Bonuses should be clawed back in the result of a person 's poor performance • Senior executives should have between 40 % and 60 % of their bonus payments deferred over three years , with at least 50 % paid in shares .
The same rule applies for other bank employees who make the most risky investment decisions •
Firms will be required to publish an annual report on their bonus payments •
Large banks should have an independent committee to determine bonus payments •
Banks must ensure that their total remuneration payments to staff do not affect the underlying financial health of the business .

Ici et là , la blogosphère francophone fait état de l’actualisation par la FTC de son guide relatif notamment aux billets et tweets sponsorisés .
Ce guide permet aux professionnels américains de s’assurer du respect de la réglementation .
Aux termes de cette réglementation , recommandation , le blogueur encourera , à compter du 1er décembre une amende maximale de 11 000 $ d’amende par billet , s’il n’indique pas ses relations avec son annonceur :
« bloggers who make an endorsement must disclose the material connections they share with the seller of the product or service »
Si aux États - Unis cette réglementation est nouvelle , elle en existe une équivalente en Europe .
Pour mémoire la réglementation française prévoit déjà l’obligation d’indiquer qu’un billet est sponsorisé .
Peu importe le montant du contrat , la liberté de l’auteur dans la rédaction de ses écrits , ce qui compte , c’est la relation financière entre l’annonceur ou son représentant et le blogueur .
C’est ce qui ressort du point 11 de l’article L.121- 1 c. conso .
Cet article dispose qu’est « réputées trompeuses au sens de l’article L. 121- 1 les pratiques commerciales qui ont pour objet [… ]
D’utiliser un contenu rédactionnel dans les médias pour faire la promotion d’un produit ou d’un service alors que le professionnel a financé celle - ci lui-même , sans l’indiquer clairement dans le contenu ou à l’aide d’images ou de sons clairement identifiables par le consommateur ;« .
Le risque encourt le blogueur négligeant ?
La peine prévue est précisée à l’article L. 121-6 c. conso .
Cet article renvoie à l’article L.213 - 1 du même code .
Ce dernier article prévoie une peine maximale de deux années de prison et de 37 500 € d’amende .
L’article 121- 6 dispose également que « L’amende peut être portée à 50 % des dépenses de la publicité ou de la pratique constituant le délit . »
11 000 $ ou 37 500 € : finalement quelle réglementation est la plus sévère ?
More energy than we could ever possibly need , but how can we tap into it ?
( Image : Chris Anderson / Aurora / Plainpicture ) …
See gallery : How to catch the Sahara ’s sun for Europe
EVERY DAY , the sun pours more energy onto the surface of our planet than we use from all sources in an entire year .
It is an inexhaustible powerhouse that has remained largely untapped for human energy needs .
That may soon change in a big way .
If a consortium of German companies has its way , construction of the biggest solar project ever devised could soon begin in the Sahara desert .
When completed , it would harvest energy from the sun shining over Africa and transform it into clean , green electricity for delivery to European homes and businesses .
Prospects for the project , called Desertec , have blossomed over the past year , and this month 20 major German corporations are expected to announce the formation of a consortium that will provide the €400 billion needed to build a raft of solar thermal power plants in north Africa .
They include energy utilities giants E.ON and RWE , the engineering firm Siemens , the finance house Deutsche Bank and the insurance company Munich Re .
The current plan , outlined by the German Aerospace Centre ( DLR ) in a report to the federal government , envisages that the project will meet 15 per cent of Europe ’s electricity needs by 2050 , with a peak output of 100 gigawatts – roughly equivalent to 100 coal - fired power stations .
Preliminary designs in the German report show electricity reaching Europe via 20 high - voltage direct - current power lines , which will keep transmission losses below 10 per cent ( New Scientist , 14 March , p …
The EUR found its breaking point .
OPEC dictated its breaking point and the USD bearÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s were just broke .
All the asset classes turned on a dime yesterday once the USD found the sweet spot .
The dollars strength was driven by the US yield curve .
With stronger global growth rates being announced by China ( + 8.9 % ) and South Korea ( +2.9 % ) , it was only a matter of time that Yield curves would begin to reflect this .
We have the Fed meeting next week and capital markets continue to expect a sign of an exit strategy from policy makers .
The stronger than anticipated US earning season is now being priced in by the bond market and providing support for Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœa stronger dollar policyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢!
Being the contrarian , what if yields are rising in anticipation of the ending of several Fed programs ?
One needs higher yields to attract Capital !
Are all company earnings priced in ?
Are they based on incentive programs or inventory clear out ?
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s somewhat surprising to see the Fed policy makers talking the USD up and not Geithner .
With the holiday season and liquidity issues to begin , do not be surprised to see the dollar maintain an upward momentum until year - end !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
With no US data yesterday , thank god for rumors , which were eventually vindicated , managed to breathe life into a dull threatening session .
All the asset classes completed a u-turn by dayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s end with equities ending in the red , with the USD rebounding aggressively from its 14 - month lows and FI yields easing a tad from their new highs despite a record amount of US debt to be issued this week .
The latter of course will be priced accordingly , weaker , but , it will be interesting to see what the foreign appetite will be like .
Higher FI yields should provide further support for the USD ahead of next weeks Fed meeting .
Some risk appetite has returned to the market after Chinese officials indicated that industrial production will increase +16 % this Q and also reported a +190 % hike in overseas investment for the 3rd Q !
This emphasizes their nationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s role in Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdriving a global economic recoveryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not a bad way to weaken the Yuan either !
The USD $ is currently lower against the EUR +0.16 % , GBP +0.21 % , CHF +0.07 % and JPY +0.18 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD - 0.36 % and AUD +0.34 % .
BOC Governor is insistent that a strong loonie will damper longer term growth .
He continued his bearish rhetoric on the currency yesterday , stating it was too strong and managed to push the CAD to a new 2 - week low .
The commodity based currency was dealt a blow from softer crude prices as OPEC suggested that they would increase output production if higher oil prices threatened global economic growth .
With US equities under pressure , managed to lift the USD from its 14 - month lows believing that the recent decline was somewhat technically overdone and has dissuaded the buying of higher - yielding commodity currencies .
With a large percentage of the market being long CAD on the back of stronger global fundamentals , expect the technical traders to dictate short term direction as weak longÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s get squeezed out .
Dealers continue to see better levels to own their domestic currency .
After breaching the 1.0600 level yesterday opens up the top side to 1.0750 .
For the first time in 3 - trading session , the AUD has managed to advance on the back of Chinese officials indicating that their industrial output will increase as much as +16 % this Q. Australia and its commodity tied currency has the distinct advantage of having China as its largest trading partner , unlike its cousin , Canada , who has the US .
Other data showed that Australian business confidence numbers surged last Q ( 16 vs. - 4 ) .
With Asian bourses advancing , has boosted the demand for higher yielding assets like the AUD .
The RBA keeps providing the ammo to lift the currency towards parity .
They are expected to remain hawkish as Cbank officials make a number of speeches and economic forecasts over the coming weeks .
Governor Stevens said it was Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœpossibly imprudentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ to keep borrowing costs at a 50 - year low in the minutes of its Oct. meeting .
The currency remains better bid on pullbacks ( 0.9173 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 78.55 down - 13 c ) .
It was the tri-factor of trading reasons why crude prices softened yesterday .
Firstly , OPEC is starting to talk crude down .
Members will increase output production to protect the global economic recovery if oil prices continue to rise .
They have indicated that both Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœproducers and consumers were comfortable with oil prices at between $ 75 and $ 80 per barrel and that higher priceÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s could put a brake on the global economy Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Ideally , they want to Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœmaintain balanceÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and will act accordingly in Dec. depending on where crude is trading .
This will surely put a short term dampener on speculative trading .
Secondly , the dollar has rebounded from its 14 - month lows , thus diminishing the appeal of commodities to investors .
Finally , equities managed to see red .
Oil prices had been pushed to New Year highs last week on the back of the weekly EIA report showing a bigger than forecasted decline in supplies of gas .
Gas inventories fell - 2.2 m barrels to +207 m vs. an expected drop of only - 850 k .
On the flip side crude stocks rose + 1.3 m barrels to +339.1 m vs. the forecasted climb of + 1.5 m barrels .
Technically , prices have been aggressively mobile on pure Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœspeculationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ in the face of positive overall supply fundamentals .
Keep an eye on the USD for directional play until we get inventory numbers for this week .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ fell the most in over a week yesterday as the USD rebounded from its 14 - month lows vs. the EUR which eroded the appeal of the precious metal as an alternative investment .
However , expect the commodity to remain well supported on much deeper pullbacks as long term inflation worries continue to be a concern ( $ 1,040 ) .
The Nikkei closed at 10,212 down - 150 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,649 up + 8 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 5,209 up +17 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year bonds backed up 4 bp yesterday ( 3.56 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not rocket science when you have product to absorb !
Dealers continue to pressurize prices with a record $ 116 b worth of US debt to be taken down this week .
The US government is scheduled to sell $ 44 b 2Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s today , $ 41 b 5 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s tomorrow and $ 31b of 7Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s on Thursday .
With Treasury planning to lengthen the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœaverage due dateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ of its outstanding debt to 72 - months from 49 - months will obviously put pressure on the long end of the yield curve over the coming year .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s no wonder that some analysts foresee 4 % 10 - yr notes before the year - end and 4.5 % by middle of next year .

Pad workers have begun to evaluate what is being described as substantial heat damage to Pad 39B , following the launch of Ares I - X .
Meanwhile , the damage to Ares I - X’s First Stage was the result of splashing down at high speed and at an angle , due to only “ one and a half ” of its three main parachutes providing deceleration to the booster .
Ares I - X Parachute Failure :
Both the pad damage and the parachute anomaly should not detract from what was a successful test launch on Wednesday .
All primary objectives were met , bar the parachute recovery system “ Priority 4 ” task , with managers noting their pleasure that the anomaly will provide important lessons learned for the Ares Program .
“ The booster is in Port now and is being taken out of the water .
It will be put on the rail dollies and dunnage and shimming added for support , ” noted a memo acquired by L2 – which was written by Constellation management on Friday .
Recent – over the past one year period – Ares I - X Articles on NASASpaceflight.com can be found on this link :
http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/tag/ares-i-x/
“ The team should get a first look at the riser lines Friday afternoon but it will be several days before the chutes are detangled and available for analysis .
Likewise , the booster must complete safing before more detailed analysis of the hardware can begin . ”
All that is known at this time is one of the three main parachutes failed after deployment and interfered with a second parachute – resulting in only one main chute being able to provide its full deceleration capability prior to splashdown .
“ What we know currently is that almost immediately after main parachute deploy and prior to any reefing , one of the mains gives way on its riser lines and streams out , ” added the memo .
“ A cloud obscured part of the visuals during deploy but it appears that the streaming chute entangles with another of the mains , keeping it from full canopy .
The result was only about 1 and 1/2 parachute capability for decelerating the booster . ”
UPDATE : A follow up article will follow next week , following the acquiring of the full chase plane video ( uploaded to L2 on Saturday ) from ascent , staging , parachute deploy and splashdown .
NASA has since released the video to Youtube on Monday .
Such incidents with the booster parachutes are not uncommon , with a loss of one main chute suffered by STS - 128 ’s Right Hand booster , resulting in that booster hitting the ocean at a high velocity .
However , it avoided any major damage .
“ One of three RH main parachutes failed to fully inflate .
Data Acquisition System ( DAS ) indicated failure occurred 3.9 seconds after frustum separation .
Postflight inspection revealed damage on gore number 5 extending from above vent band to skirt band , ” noted the STS - 128 SRB IFA ( In Flight Anomaly ) presentation into the incident .
Unfortunately , with only one main chute operating nominally , Ares I - X’s First Stage not only hit the ocean at high speed , but also at an angle , causing it to buckle on impact – as seen in recovery photographs that circulated a number of sites on Thursday , including a high resolution set of images on L2 .
“ Photos of Ares I - X First Stage damage were taken by the USA recovery team .
The ‘ dent ’ photos are actually of buckling of the booster versus denting , ” added the memo .
“ The buckling is a result of the hard impact of the booster with the water .
The hard impact is the result of a main parachute failure .
We do not yet know why the chute failed .
That will take some time and in depth analysis .
“ The booster both hit the water hard and at an angle .
Buckling is to be expected in this situation .
The photo of the fractured actuator bracket is also to be expected – the actuator bracket is designed to break loose on hard impact , thereby protecting the actuator from damage .
The forward skirt extension that housed the chutes sank immediately upon water impact – as designed . ”
Although the objective of Ares flights will be to recover and reuse the five segment boosters that will provide first stage power to the launch vehicle , the now - damaged four segment – and fifth segment simulator – booster from Ares I - X was never planned to be reused .
“ As a reminder , the motor segments and aft skirt used for Ares I - X are retired shuttle assets and there was no intent to use them again .
We will learn a great deal from this test flight anomaly – that is why we test ! ”
Interestingly , ATK – who build the boosters – were already aware of the threat of damage to the First Stage from increased splashdown loads on the larger Ares I five segment booster , and had been evaluating alternate stiffener configurations for the aft segment .
The mitigation also involved a proposed ETM - 4 and ETM - 5 as block upgrades to the five segment designs .
ETM - 4 would substitute an HTPB propellant formulation and a new strip wound insulation package .
ETM - 5 would be filament wound segments with metallic joints and dome segments .
In fact , the very notion of being able to recover the Ares I First Stage has been close to deletion since at least 2008 – part of the goal to save the mass involved for the recovery systems , as Ares I struggled to make up the performance shortfalls that has plagued the vehicle over most of its recent years of development .
Pad 39B Damage :
Engineers had already noted that Ares I - X would launch at a slight angle – only by a few degrees – in order to clear / avoid the Fixed Service Structure ( FSS ) at the pad , prior to the Thrust Vector Control ( TVC ) correcting the vehicle through the opening seconds of ascent .
The downside of such a flight profile results in the exhaust of the First Stage impinging on the FSS for a few seconds .
This concern was already well - known with the Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) pad workers , with the main item of interest relating to a potential impact with the ET / IT platform area , which nearly led to its removal during shuttle to Constellation modifications to 39B .
In the end , Ares I - X departed the pad as planned , with the TVC ably controlling the vehicle away from the pad and into its correct flight profile .
Normally , a shuttle launch results in some burnt paint , blast effects on the MLP , an occasional cracked or broken gauge .
However , 39B has suffered a large amount of damage from the heat and blast of the First Stage ’s exhaust .
The first engineers to take a close look at the pad were those involved with the SCAPE ( Self - Contained Atmospheric Protection Ensemble ) operations , following damage to several hypergolic lines at the pad .
However , due to the impact of Ares I - X ’s thrust on the FSS , the pad ’s two elevators were both damaged , meaning SCAPE engineers had to climb three flights of stairs – in their SCAPE suits – in order to fix the hypergolic leaks .
One elevator has now been repaired , but the other will take “ weeks ” to fix due to the extent of what is being described as substantial damage .
While the 95 ′ level on the FSS suffers damage from almost every shuttle launch – since the Mobile Launch Platform 0 ′ level acts as a blast deflector – Ares I - X managed to impact the entire FSS on 39B .
All of the communication lines were destroyed during launch – along with all the outdoor megaphone / speakers melted beyond recognition – resulting in temporary communication lines being set up throughout the pad .
Heat damage has also been noted from the hinge columns through to the Rotating Service Structure ( RSS ) , and a set of photographs acquired by L2 show extensive heat damage to nearly all areas of the vehicle - facing RSS .
Of course , Pad 39B wo n’t be used again for many years , with the next scheduled launch set to be the Ares I - Y test flight – although that vehicle is under severe and imminent threat of being cancelled , even if the Ares program survives the post - Augustine Commission decisions that will be evaluated by President Obama over the next few months ..
The lesson ’s learned from the damage to 39B will likely go some way into the forward plan for the largescale modifications to Pad 39B ahead of hosting Ares I launches , in order to keep maintenance and costs down between missions .
The final 39B configuration will include a massive rollercoaster EES system that will dominate the skyline as a fixed structure out at the pad complex .

Elephant habitats are shrinking in India
Hundreds of villagers have been forced to take shelter in camps in the Indian state of Orissa after repeated attacks by a herd of elephants .
Seven people have been killed and several others injured in attacks by a herd of 12 - 13 elephants over the past few weeks in Kandhamal district .
Over 2,500 people living in 45 villages have been affected by the attacks , district chief Krishen Kumar said .
Wild animals have often entered villages and killed people in India .
Conservationists say this is because the natural habitats of the elephants are shrinking .
They blame this on human encroachment , which means animals have to travel further for food .
It is , however , unclear why this herd of elephants migrated from the Lakheri sanctuary in a neighbouring district .
Mr Kumar told the BBC that 500 homes in some seven villages had been completely destroyed in the attacks , and about 500 residents had taken shelter in two camps .
" People have lost their thatched homes .
We will open more camps if the attacks continue , " Mr Kumar said .
He said the herd had travelled some 300 km into Kandhamal , and even entered a town in the district .
Wildlife officials were camping at the site of the attacks and trying to find out why the elephants had come out of their sanctuary .
Mr Kumar said the elephants had entered Kandhamal nearly a month ago .
But matters came to a head last week when three villagers were killed and more than 100 homes were destroyed in a single attack .
Last year , a rampaging elephant killed at least seven people and injured 24 others in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand .

In many ways Salida , Colo. , typifies the 21st - century Rocky Mountain town .
Originally founded along a railroad line in the late 1800s , it ’s now geared primarily toward tourism .
Among the red brick buildings of the historic center where ranchers , miners , and railroad workers once held sway , tourists now move between coffee shops , galleries , and outfitters .
During warmer months , kayakers “ surf ” a man-made wave in the fast - flowing Arkansas River , which marks the edge of the downtown area .
For the better part of this year , Salida – population 5,400 – has also been the setting for a 21st century kind of battle – over water .
Here and there in windows and entryways are signs reading “ Stop Nestlé ” or “ Nest - Leave . ”
They refer to a proposed project by Nestlé Waters North America , which hopes to pump water from a spring a half - hour north of here and sell it under its Arrowhead label .
Citing myriad concerns , a group of residents has objected vigorously .
They worry about impacts to the watershed and to nearby wetlands .
They say that climate change , predicted to further dry Colorado and the Southwest , warrants a precautionary approach to all things water - related .
And , pointing to fights other communities have had with the company , they say they simply do n’t want Nestlé as a neighbor .
Nestlé counters that these concerns are overblown .
The company says :
The amount of water it plans to withdraw is negligible ; the project will bring many benefits – economic and otherwise – to the community ; and the company , the largest water bottler in North America , is an upstanding corporate citizen .
In mid-August , after months of public hearings and expert testimony , the county finally gave approval to the project – but attached 44 conditions .
“ We still feel that the decision to grant them the permit is not a wise decision , ” says John Graham , president of the Chaffee Citizens for Sustainability ( CCFS ) , which has led the opposition against the project .
The group is weighing what to do next .
Nestlé is satisfied with the outcome , says Bruce Lauerman , a natural resources manager for the company .
“ We can , and will , comply with all the conditions . ”
So what ’s the big deal ?
The springs in question are to the middle and east of the Upper Arkansas Valley .
Boulders lie strewn about , carried to their current positions more than 10,000 years ago when ice dams blocking the Arkansas River breached , inundating the valley .
Water from the spring now collects in clear pools .
Trout flit beneath the silvery surface .
Rafters occasionally float past on the turbid river , which marks the southern boundary of the property on which the springs are located .
Water seems to abound .
Nestlé plans to pump 200 acre - feet per year , or enough water to flood 200 acres with one foot of water .
That ’s 1 to 2 percent of the aquifer recharge coming from a 50,000 - acre watershed to the east , says Mr. Lauerman .
“ This is a safe , sustainable way to withdraw water .
End of story . ”
But many say the greater story – about a growing world population of more than 6.5 billion faced with a limited supply of fresh water – is , in fact , just beginning .
Experts not directly involved in the Chaffee County situation point to it as evidence of rising sensitivity to water issues everywhere .
They cite a growing number of disagreements between communities and bottled - water firms around the US – in Maine , California , Florida , and Michigan , among other places – as evidence .
“ There is a growing interest in water as a whole [ and ] growing scarcity in the Western United States , ” says Peter Gleick , president of the Pacific Institute in Oakland , Calif. , a nonprofit that does research and policy analysis in the areas of environment and sustainable development .
“ And when people pay more attention , it sort of makes it harder to do the things [ bottled water companies ] used to do without any opposition . ”
These companies have now become the focus of campaigns against bottled water in general .
Organizations like Corporate Accountability International and the Environmental Working Group rail against bottled water for a number of reasons , the environmental impact of plastics among them .
( Lauerman points to Nestlé ’s new ecoshape bottles , which , he says , use 30 percent less plastic than most . )
The groups also argue that consumption of bottled water – paying for something that ’s already cheaply available – leads to neglect of municipal water infrastructure , to everyone ’s detriment .
The US Conference of Mayors has urged cities to stop buying water and has called for an investigation into how much the industry costs taxpayers .
( By one estimate , 40 percent of bottled water comes from municipal sources , not springs . )
All of this opposition has had some impact .
San Francisco and Seattle , among other cities , have prohibited city offices from buying bottled water .
Maine is now considering a penny - a - gallon bottled water tax .
High - end restaurants in Los Angeles and New York have stopped serving bottled water , a once - easy moneymaker , to avoid “ ungreen ” reputations .
And in August , Bundanoon , Australia – population 2,500 – became the first town in the world to prohibit the sale of bottled water .
A proposed bottled - water operation prompted the all - out ban .
Deserved or not , Nestlé , whose brands focus primarily on spring water and not the easier - to - procure filtered water from other sources , has become a favorite target of the anti-bottled - water movement .
There ’s a website called Stop Nestle Waters.org , and a documentary called “ For the Love of Water , ” or FLOW , casts the company in an unfavorable light .
Nestlé has responded to FLOW with its own video .
Lauerman attributes anti-Nestlé sentiment and court battles to its being the largest producer of foodstuffs in the world and the largest bottled - water company in North America .
Big companies make big targets , he says .
As for the resistance in Chaffee County , he calls it “ emotional ” and not based on fact .
Others have a different take .
“ Citizens are better off rejecting the zoning right at the beginning rather than getting into long , expensive litigation , ” says Jim Olson , an environmental attorney in Traverse City , Mich. , who has fought Nestlé for more than nine years .
“ The lesson learned is : Do n’t let it start , ” he says .
Indeed , worried by the prospect of facing a deep - pocketed corporation in court , one of the conditions that Chaffee County mandated was that Nestlé establish a reimbursement fund to pay for any future litigation .
And there ’s another detail in the agreement that strikes many as notable .
In drought - prone Colorado , law dictates that anyone applying for a water permit must present an “ augmentation plan . ”
Nestlé , for example , will replace water it pumps with water leased from Aurora , a city 100 miles to the northeast .
The city will redeposit an amount of water equal to what Nestlé withdraws into the upper Arkansas River .
Chaffee County mandated that replacement water must come from other counties , or the water - permitting process reopens .
The county has guaranteed itself a net - zero water loss .
These laws can seem Byzantine , even anachronistic , to the outsider .
Only earlier this year , for example , did Colorado legalize rainwater harvesting .
Before that , it was technically illegal to catch water falling off one ’s own roof .
But the assumption underlying these laws – that water is in limited supply – is the correct one , says Robert Glennon , author of “ Unquenchable : America ’s Water Crisis and What to Do About It . ”
Other states often allow “ a limitless number of straws in the glass , ” he says .
But in Colorado , if you ca n’t replace it , you ca n’t take it .
“ That ’s exactly what I think we should do , ” he says .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Congress ’ chief author of financial regulatory reform moved on Tuesday to kill the most controversial part of an Obama administration proposal for a new government watchdog for financial consumers .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , speaks to reporters during the Reuters Global Financial Regulation Summit in Washington , April 28 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
Banks would not be required to offer so - called “ plain vanilla ” versions of financial products , such as mortgages , under draft legislative language drawn up by Democratic Representative Barney Frank and obtained by Reuters .
The draft language comes in the face of opposition among businesses and existing regulators to President Barack Obama ’s proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency ( CFPA ) , part of his sweeping program to tighten bank and market regulation .
In opting to delete the “ plain vanilla ” provision from his version of the proposal , Frank , who chairs the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee , has effectively acknowledged that it was an over - reach by the administration .
The Frank bill must undergo committee review .
But it will likely be the vehicle Democrats use for moving the CFPA plan to the full House for a vote , and possibly to the Senate .
In addition to dropping “ plain vanilla , ” the bill explicitly exempts many businesses from CFPA oversight , including securities , commodities , investment and general insurance products ; accountants and tax preparers ; real estate brokers and agents ; lawyers ; auto dealers ; communications providers ; and providers of retirement and pension plans .
Frank ’s draft emerged after he met on Tuesday with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd and U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , who is expected to fight for the CFPA in testimony before Frank ’s committee on Wednesday .
“ Our proposal will not create new bureaucracy for banks , ” Geithner said in prepared remarks to be delivered to the panel that were posted on the committee ’s website on Tuesday .
The CFPA is designed to be a central agency to handle consumer protection duties now vested in several agencies , including the Federal Reserve .
It “ will consolidate fragmented consumer authorities into one agency ... which will write rules , oversee compliance , and address violations by non -bank providers , as well as banking institutions , ” Geithner said .
FED CRITICIZED
Many existing agencies , including the Fed , have been roundly criticized in Congress for doing a poor job of protecting financial consumers in the run-up to and during the financial crisis that last year engulfed world economies .
Obama will attend a summit meeting this week of the Group of 20 major nations where leaders are expected to grapple with difficult financial regulatory reform issues .
Besides consumer protection , another issue is how to deal with troubled large banks and companies like those given massive taxpayer bailouts over the past year , such as American International Group and Citigroup .
In his prepared testimony , Geithner said that the United States would not identify in advance financial firms it views as systemically important , like those that were bailed out .
The administration plans to subject financial firms judged to be so important that their failure would threaten the entire system to a new and tougher regulatory regime .
This would impose higher capital requirements on them to offset the perceived benefits of being deemed too - big - to - fail .
“ Crucially under our proposals , there will be no fixed list of Tier 1 FHCs ( financial holding companies ) , and identification of a firm as a Tier 1 FHC will not convey a government subsidy , ” Geithner said .
DODD WARNS ON DEADLINE
Earlier on Tuesday , Senator Dodd said he wants his banking committee to act on financial regulatory reforms before the end of 2009 , but warned that that deadline , self - imposed by the Obama administration , could slip .
“ We want to clearly get something done before the end of the year in our committee , and possibly beyond that , but obviously healthcare ( reform ) will determine to some extent how much we can get done , ” he told reporters .
Speaking after his meeting in the Capitol with Frank and Geithner , Dodd said : “ Nothing has been written yet .
There ’s been no agreement specifically on any legislative language . ”
Dodd is deeply involved in the congressional debate over healthcare , in addition to leading the banking committee .
Frank said the half - hour meeting was “ not a wake ” and that the participants made “ substantial progress . ”
Chances are still “ very , very good ” that Congress will have a financial reform bill by the end of the year , Frank said .
He and Dodd spoke just minutes before Democratic Senator Jack Reed , a banking committee member , introduced a bill to regulate over - the - counter derivatives , a free - wheeling market widely blamed for amplifying the financial crisis .
Like earlier proposals , Reed ’s legislation would force “ standardized ” OTC derivatives to go through clearinghouses , while placing other new limits on the market .
Supervolcanoes and cosmic impacts get all the terrible glory for causing mass extinctions , but a new theory suggests lowly algae may be the killer behind the world 's great species annihilations .
Today , just about anywhere there is water , there can be toxic algae .
The microscopic plants usually exist in small concentrations , but a sudden warming in the water or an injection of dust or sediment from land can trigger a bloom that kills thousands of fish , poisons shellfish , or even humans .
James Castle and John Rodgers of Clemson University think the same thing happened during the five largest mass extinctions in Earth 's history .
Each time a large die off occurred , they found a spike in the number of fossil algae mats called stromatolites strewn around the planet .
Castle will be presenting the research on October 19 at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Portland , Oregon .
" If you go through theories of mass extinctions , there are always some unanswered questions , " Castle said .
" For example , an impact – how does that cause species to go extinct ?
Is it climate change , dust in the atmosphere ?
It 's probably not going to kill off all these species on its own . "
But as the nutrient - rich fallout from the disaster lands in the water , it becomes food for algae .
They explode in population , releasing chemicals that can act as anything from skin irritants to potent neurotoxins .
Plants on land can pick up the compounds in their roots , and pass them on to herbivorous animals .
If the theory is right , it answers a lot of questions about how species died off in the ancient world .
It also raises concerns for how today 's algae may damage the ecosystem in a warmer world .
" Algae growth is favored by warmer temperatures , " Castle said .
" You get accelerated metabolism and reproduction of these organisms , and the effect appears to be enhanced for species of toxin - producing cyanobacteria . "
He added that toxic algae in the United States appear to be migrating slowly northward through the country 's ponds and lakes , and along the coast as temperatures creep upward .
Their expanding range portends a host of problems for fish and wildlife , but also for humans , as algae increasingly invade reservoirs and other sources of drinking water .
JODHPUR , India — Hindu priest Bhupendra Vaishnava steps gingerly into the Kunj Bhihari
temple 's Vishnu grotto .
Two inches of water instantly submerge his bare feet .
In between two marble slabs in the basement shrine 's center , a thin spurt of water jets an inch into the air .
The temple is flooding .
Here in the desert city of Jodhpur , a popular tourist destination nestled in the hinterlands of the great Thar desert , Vaishnava shares his plight with home and business owners fighting groundwater rising by up to 4.5 feet a year .
As large parts of India suffer the worst drought in 20 years due to the delayed monsoon , this indigo blue city is slowly flooding because of the Indira Gandhi canal .
The behemoth irrigation scheme , which began in 1958 , diverts water from the northern " breadbasket " state of Punjab down to Haryana and Rajasthan .
It reached Jodhpur in 1997 .
Before then , the city was almost as tinder dry as the surrounding farmlands .
According to legend , the dryness stretches back to 1459 .
When the maharajah ordered the foundation stones of the Mehrangarh Fort to be laid , a hermit was forced from his shelter .
To retaliate , he issued the curse : " May your kingdom suffer drought for ever ! ”
The canal has turned that legend on its head .
Geologically , Jodhpur lies in a bowl - shaped indentation to which the excess water drains .
The state government has set aside 120 million rupees ( $ 2.6 million ) to help the city , with tentative plans to plant eucalyptus and other non-native , water - demanding trees to literally drink away the problem .
As Jodhpur floods , Rajasthan as a state faces depleted ground water in the face of this year 's drought .
Recent NASA satellite imagery suggests a foot a year is being lost .
Some 450 million Indian farmers depend on the monsoon which accounts for 80 percent of the country 's water .
This year , only two thirds of the average fell , and far too late to save much of the crops .
About an hour outside Jodhpur , villagers testified they expected only 5 to 10 percent of their usual millet , mung and mothbean production .
Staple food will have to be bought .
But these farmers ' water needs could be Jodhpur 's savior .
Nearby villages are due to be connected to the canal .
Along shrub - lined countryside roads lie large white pipes , like giant maggots in the sand , waiting to be linked up and buried .
Once installed , they could ease the pressure of the city 's rising levels , siphoning off too much of a good thing .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Authorities are seeking the public 's assistance in identifying a teenage girl who mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago , claiming to have no memory of her family , her home -- or even her own name .
The teen has recalled an excerpt from the fantasy novel " Fool 's Fate " by Robin Hobb .
" I just want to know who I am , " the girl says in a statement released by the New York City Administration for Children 's Services .
The teen , who is being referred to as Jane Doe , continues , " I want to know who I am and what happened to me . "
The Caucasian young woman , described by New York ACS as " very soft - spoken , " is 5 feet , 6 inches tall , light - skinned , with short , straight , cropped blond hair and blue eyes .
Doctors are estimating her age to be between 14 and 17 .
ACS Commissioner John B. Mattingly appealed to the public in a statement , " asking anyone who may know this young woman to help us locate her family as quickly as possible , so we can safely reunite her with those who love her . "
The girl was found in midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m.
October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter , although the organization tells CNN that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility .
According to its
Web site , with nearly 7,000 youths seeking shelter per year , " Covenant House New York is the nation 's largest adolescent care agency serving homeless , runaway and at - risk youth . "
A security guard for the shelter noticed the girl walking around on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her .
Finding her unresponsive , he called the New York City Police Department .
Police officers interviewed the young woman , but it became clear that she could n't provide authorities with any information about herself .
The NYPD said she was wearing military green camouflage pants , a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered .
Children 's Services said the girl recently wrote down the name " Amber " and has responded to it on one occasion , but she has no idea whether it is her true name .
On another occasion she is said to have recalled certain words , which turned out to be an excerpt from the fantasy novel " Fool 's Fate " by Robin Hobb .
The girl is also apparently writing a fantasy story of her own that features a heroine named Rian , " who 's been raised by the commander of the guard post on the edge of a fantasy kingdom , " says the young woman .
The girl has a 2 - to 4 - inch scar on her lower left back and had a black , handwritten birthday message on her arm , addressed to a name of Japanese origin , when she was found , police said Friday .
Judging from poor dental hygiene , said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman , she appears to have been living on the streets for some time .
" This case has been going on since October 9 , " Zimmerman said .
" Today is the 23rd , and we 're vey concerned .
It 's been a very long time now .
That 's a long time frame to not identify somebody .
Especially someone who we believe is a juvenile .
Usually juveniles we get a lot of inquiries about . "
While the girl is confused and her story remains vague , Mattingly said , " she is safe with us , and we are doing all we can to help her , but she needs to find her family . "
She is apparently reviewing materials for a high school GED exam , saying that she is able to do the math but has no recollection of studying the history and science portions .
However , according to the Children 's Services statement , the young woman " can easily retain the information . "
New York City Administration for Children 's Services and police are asking anyone with information about the young woman or her family to contact the NYPD Missing Persons Squad at 212-694-7781 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS .

Because I despise politics in general , and the two major parties in this country in particular , I go through life constantly bemused by all the weight that people put on partisan political loyalties and on adherence to the normative demarcations the parties promote .
Henry Adams observed that politics , as a practice , whatever its professions , has always been the systematic organization of hatreds .
This marshalling of hatreds is not the whole of politics , to be sure , but it is an essential element .
Thus , Democrats encourage people to hate big corporations , and Republicans encourage people to hate welfare recipients .
Neither Liberty nor Sa ... Robert Higgs Best Price : $ 3.99 Buy New $ 10.00 ( as of 05:35 EST - Details )
Of course , it ’s all a fraud , designed to distract people from the overriding reality of political life , which is that the state and its principal supporters are constantly screwing the rest of us , regardless of which party happens to control the presidency and the Congress .
Amid all the partisan sound and fury , hardly anybody notices that political reality boils down to two parties  : ( 1 ) those who , in one way or another , use state power to bully and live at the expense of others ; and ( 2 ) those unfortunate others .
Even when politics seems to involve life - and - death issues , the partisan divisions often only obscure the overriding political realities .
So , Democrats say that anti-abortion Republicans , who claim to have such tremendous concern for saving the lives of the unborn , have no interest whatever in saving the lives of those already born , such as the poor children living in the ghetto .
And Republicans say that Democrats , who claim to have such tremendous concern for the poor , systematically contribute to the perpetuation of poverty by the countless taxes and regulations they load onto business owners who would otherwise be in better position to hire and train the poor and thereby to hasten their escape from poverty .
If the unborn children happen to be living in the wombs of women on whom U.S. bombs and rockets rain down in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan , however , all Republican concerns for the unborn evaporate completely , as do the Democrats ’ concerns for the poor children living in the selfsame bombarded villages .
Both parties ’ positions would seem to rest on very flexible and selective morality , if indeed either party may be said to have any moral basis at all , notwithstanding their chronic public displays of moral wailing and gnashing of teeth .

Marijuana growers , many believed to be affiliated with Mexican drug cartels , are aggressively expanding their illegal farming operations in the U.S. , clearing land to plant pot in dozens of national forests from coast to coast .
Illicit cannabis farms on public land first sprang up in California more than a decade ago and remain a serious problem in that state .
But in the past two years , the U.S. Forest Service has documented a rapid expansion of the practice .
Authorities have discovered pot farms in 61 national forests across 16 states this year , up from 49 forests in 10 states last year .
New territories include public land in Colorado , Wisconsin , Michigan , Alabama and Virginia .
" They 're moving across the country , " said David Ferrell , director of law enforcement for the U.S. Department of Agriculture , which includes the Forest Service .
With the expansion comes an increased risk to campers and hikers -- a particular concern this Labor Day weekend , as families converge on public land just as many cannabis crops are ready for harvest .
ALMOST 300 pilgrims who came to Australia to pray with Pope Benedict XVI are on the run after illegally overstaying their visas .
The Daily Telegraph can reveal that , of the 110,000 people who came to Sydney for World Youth Day last year , 550 did not go home .
Federal immigration authorities have caught and expelled about half of those but 280 pilgrims are still on the run .
The majority of overstayers are from South Pacific countries including Tonga , Fiji and Samoa .
The bulk of the remainder came from India , Vietnam and Pakistan .
Federal Department of Immigration and Citizenship spokesman Sandi Logan said the overstayers represented less than 0.3 per cent of the number of people who came to Australia for the world 's largest youth event .
" But it is still an issue , " Mr Logan said .
Mr Logan said following World Youth Day the Government granted 86 protection visas to pilgrims who could not safely return home , while a further 90 people were waiting to hear if the Federal Government will grant them an extension to their visas .
There were dozens of overstayers after Australia hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2006 and the Olympics in 2000 , including Olympic and Paralympic team members .
" Whenever we have these major events we go to great lengths in the lead - up to the event to make sure we manage the risk that there may be overstayers , " Mr Logan said .
In the lead up to World Youth Day , the Department of Immigration required pilgrims - particularly from high - risk nations - to supply supporting documentation from their parishes to confirm they were legitimate church - goers .
As a result the department received " a lot of complaints " from supposed pilgrims who were denied visas .
" We know some people are going to flout the law , " Mr Logan said .
Of visitors to Australia for the Olympics , the Commonwealth Games and World Youth Day , less than 1 per cent overstayed their visas .
The Department of Immigration and Citizenship deals with 26 million people each year .

Author Francis Fukuyama spoke with Global Viewpoint editor Nathan Gardels on Tuesday , Oct. 20 .
Nathan Gardels :
In 1989 , you wrote an essay , later developed into a book , that stated your famous " end of history " thesis .
You said then :
" What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War , or the passing of a particular period of post - war history , but the end of history as such : that is , the end point of mankind 's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government . "
What mostly holds up in your thesis 20 years on ?
What does n't ?
What changed ?
Francis Fukuyama :
The basic point – that liberal democracy is the final form of government – is still basically right .
Obviously there are alternatives out there , like the Islamic Republic of Iran or Chinese authoritarianism .
But I do n't think that all that many people are persuaded these are higher forms of civilization than what exists in Europe , the United States , Japan , or other developed democracies ; societies that provide their citizens with a higher level of prosperity and personal freedom .
The issue is not whether liberal democracy is a perfect system , or whether capitalism does n't have problems .
After all , we 've been thrown into this huge global recession because of the failure of unregulated markets .
The real question is whether any other system of governance has emerged in the last 20 years that challenges this .
The answer remains no .
Now , that essay was written in the winter of 1988 or ' 89 just before the fall of the Berlin Wall .
I wrote it then because I thought that the pessimism about civilization that we had developed as a result of the terrible 20th century , with its genocides , gulags , and world wars , was actually not the whole picture at all .
In fact , there were a lot of positive trends going on in the world , including the spread of democracy where there had been dictatorship .
Sam Huntington called this " the third wave . "
It began in southern Europe in the 1970s with Spain and Portugal turning to democracy .
Then – and later – you had an ending of virtually all the dictatorships in Latin America , except for Cuba .
And then there was the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the opening of Eastern Europe .
Beyond that , democracy displaced authoritarian regimes in South Korea and Taiwan .
We went from 80 democracies in the early 1970s to 130 , or 140 , 20 years later .
Of course , this has n't all held up since then .
We see today a kind of democratic recession .
There have been reversals in important countries like Russia , where we see the return of a nasty authoritarian system without rule of law , or in Venezuela and some other Latin American countries with populist regimes .
Clearly , that big surge toward democracy went as far as it could .
Now there is a backlash against it in some places .
But that does n't mean the larger trend is not still toward democracy .
Gardels :
The main contending argument against the " end of history " was offered by Sam Huntington .
Far from ideological convergence , he argued , we were facing a " clash of civilizations " in which culture and religion would be the main points of conflict after the cold war .
For many , 9/11 and its aftermath confirmed his thesis of a clash between Islam and the West .
To what extent was his argument valid ?
Fukuyama :
The differences between Huntington and I have been somewhat overstated .
I wrote a book called " Trust " in which I argue that culture is one of the key factors that determines economic success and the possibilities of prosperity .
So I do n't deny the critical role of culture .
But , overall , the question is whether cultural characteristics are so rooted that there is no chance of universal values or a convergence of values .
That is where I disagree .
Huntington 's argument was that democracy , individualism , and human rights are not universal , but reflections of culture rooted in Western Christendom .
While that is true historically , these values have grown beyond their origins .
They 've been adopted by societies that come out of very different cultural traditions .
Look at Japan , Taiwan , South Korea , and Indonesia .
Societies rooted in different cultural origins come to accept these values not because the US does it , but because it works for them .
It provides a mechanism for government accountability .
It provides societies with a way to get rid of bad leaders when things go wrong .
That is a huge advantage of democratic societies that someplace like China does n't have .
China , at the moment , is blessed with competent leaders .
But before that they had Mao .
There is nothing to prevent another Mao in the future without some form of democratic accountability .
Problems of corruption or poor governance are much easier to solve if you have a democracy .
For enduring prosperity and success , institutionalized , legal mechanisms of change and accountability are essential .
Gardels :
In an earlier book , " Political Order in Changing Societies , " Huntington argued that Westernization and modernization were not identical .
He thought modernization – an effective state , urbanization , breakdown of primary kinship groups , inclusive levels of education , market economies , and a growing middle class – were quite possible without a society becoming Western in terms of a liberal secular culture or democratic norms .
We see this today from Singapore to China , from Turkey to Malaysia and even Iran .
Any observant visitor to China these days can see that beneath the logos of Hyatt and Citigroup the soul of old Confucius is stirring , with its authoritarian bent .
In Turkey , we see an Islamist - rooted party running a secular state , battling to allow women to wear head scarves in public universities .
In other words , is n't " non-Western modernization " as likely a path ahead as Westernization through globalization ?
Fukuyama :
For me , there are three key components of political modernization .
First , the modernization of the state as a stable , effective , impersonal institution that can enforce rules across complex societies .
This was Huntington 's focus .
But there are two other components of modernization in my view .
Second , the rule of law so that the state itself is constrained in its actions by a preexisting body of law that is sovereign .
In other words , a ruler or ruling party cannot just do whatever he or it decides .
Third is some form of accountability of the powers that be .
Huntington would have said that rule of law and accountability are Western values .
I think they are values toward which non-Western societies are converging because of their own experience .
You can't have true modernization without them .
They are in fact necessary complements to each other .
If you have just political modernization defined as a competent state , you may only have a more effective form of tyranny .
What you can certainly have is effective state building and a certain amount of prosperity under authoritarian conditions for a time .
That is what the Chinese are doing right now .
But I am convinced that their prosperity cannot in the end endure , nor can Chinese citizens ever be secure in their personal progress , without the rule of law and accountability .
They can't go to the next stage without all three components that comprise modernization .
Corruption and questionable legitimacy will ultimately weigh them down , if not open unrest .
Gardels : Modernization has usually also meant the growing secularization of society and the primacy of science and reason .
Yet , in a place like Turkey today , as I mentioned , we see modernization and growing religiosity side by side .
That certainly departs from the Western - oriented trajectory charted by Ataturk .
Fukuyama : I agree .
The old version of the idea of modernization was Euro- centric , reflecting Europe 's own development .
That did contain attributes which sought to define modernization in a quite narrow way .
Most importantly , as you point out , religion and modernization certainly can coexist .
Secularism is not a condition of modernity .
You do n't have to travel to Turkey to see that .
It is true in the United States , which is a very religious society but in which advanced science and technological innovation thrive .
The old assumption that religion would disappear and be replaced solely by secular , scientific rationalism is not going to happen .
At the same time , I do n't believe the existence , or even prevalence of cultural attributes , including religion , are so overwhelming anywhere that you will not see a universal convergence toward rule of law and accountability .
Gardels : Still , must accountability entail the same democratic , electoral norms of Europe or the United States ?
Fukuyama :
You can have nonelectoral accountability through moral education , which forges a sense of moral obligation by the ruler .
Traditional Confucianism , after all , taught the emperor that he had a duty to his subjects as well as himself .
It is not an accident that the most successful authoritarian modernization experiments have all been in East Asian societies touched by Confucianism .
In the end , though , that is not enough .
You cannot solve the problem of the " bad emperor " through moral suasion .
And China has had some pretty bad emperors over the centuries .
Without procedural accountability , you can never establish real accountability .
Gardels : Some top Chinese intellectuals today argue that when China arises again as the superior civilization in a post - American world , the " tired " global debate over autocracy versus democracy will yield to a more pragmatic debate over good governance versus bad governance .
I doubt you would agree .
Fukuyama :
You are right , I do n't believe that .
You simply can't get good governance without democratic accountability .
It is a risky illusion to believe otherwise .

As US forces completed a withdrawal from Iraqi cities Tuesday six years after the US - led invasion , the top US commander General Ray Odierno refused to spell out how many would be left behind .
" June 30 , 2009 marks a significant milestone for Iraq as the Iraqi security forces assume responsibility for security within the cities across the country , " Odierno told US journalists in a video - briefing from Iraq .
" In accordance with the security agreement between the United States and Iraq , US combat forces completed the withdrawal .
A small number will remain in cities to train , advise , coordinate with Iraqi security forces , as well as enable them to move forward . "
But when pressed by journalists to say exactly how many US troops would be left , Odierno refused to give a number .
" To let me give a number would be inaccurate and I just do n't want to do it , " he said , adding the remaining US troops would be acting as trainers and advisors to Iraqi security forces .
" The reason I wo n't do it is because it will be different every single day and it will be based on how much training and how much advising and how much coordination is required .
That will change each and every day . "
But the general did say those troops left in Iraq would be " a significantly smaller number than what we had in the cities now . "
Iraq was celebrating a national holiday to mark the June 30 pullback , a milestone in the recovery of a country battered by war , insurgency and sectarian bloodshed that has left tens of thousands of people dead since 2003 .
President Jalal Talabani thanked US forces for their role in overthrowing now executed dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003 , and in the years of bloodshed that followed .
" They bore the burden and dangers against the most cruel regime and against the mutual enemy -- the terror , " Talabani said on state television .
According to Pentagon figures as of June 22 there were 131,000 US troops still in Iraq .
Only a small number of those US forces in training and advisory roles will remain in urban areas , with the bulk of American troops in Iraq quartered elsewhere .
The Status of Forces Agreement , which set the pullback deadline , says US commanders must seek permission from Iraqi authorities to conduct operations , but American troops retain a unilateral right to " legitimate self - defense . "
Chinese media have confirmed what we in the West suspected all along : that concealed in the northern Swedish woods is a city of 25,000 women , many of whom have turned to Sapphic love to satiate their natural Scandinavian sexual desires .
According to news agancy Xinhua , the all - female enclave is called “ Chako Paul City ” , and was founded in 1820 by a " wealthy widow " .
The city is guarded by two blonde sentries who prevent men from entering .
Those chaps who do unwisely attempt to force the issue risk being “ beaten half to death ” by Nordic gender police .
Women , though , are welcome to visit Chako Paul City , which boasts a burgeoning tourist industry with hotels and restaurants catering for international guests .
Locals , however , are discouraged from leaving their female paradise , and those who do " are only allowed to re-enter Chako Paul City if they agree to bathe and undertake several other measures designed to ensure that their out - of - town trysts do n’t negatively affect the mental state of other women in the town " .
Of course , Chako Paul City 's economy does n't rely solely on tourism .
Most of the population is involved in forestry , and workers boast a “ thick waist belt full of woodworking equipment ” .
All of this came as a bit of a surprise to Per Wilhelmsson of the tourist office in Umeå in northern Sweden , who said he was " fairly certain " no such city existed .
Claes Bertilson , a spokesperson for Sweden ’s Association of Local Authorities and Regions , similarly described himself as " doubtful " that such a place could have escaped the authorities ' attention .
He told The Local : “ I ’ve never heard anything about it .
At 25,000 residents , the town would be one of the largest in northern Sweden , and I find it hard to believe that you could keep something like that a secret for more than 150 years . ” ®

The events of 9/11 , by contrast , demonstrated how bad ideas  amplified by a willingness of just a few people to commit suicide  can bring down skyscrapers and tie a great country in knots .

I toured Paris Square the other day with Ulrike Graalfs , a program director at the American Academy in Berlin , where I am a visitor , and she mentioned in passing that she was in America on 9/11 , as a student at the University of Pennsylvania , and she was a 9 - year - old schoolgirl standing on the Berlin Wall on 11/9 .
I was struck by her recollections .
On 9/11 , she said , she was overwhelmed by the sense of “ anger and hurt ” that so many of the Penn students around her felt  feelings so intense it made it impossible for them to see , what she , a foreign student could see , “ how much the rest of the world was standing with America that day . ”
By contrast , on 11/9 , “ there were people singing and dancing and someone lifted me up on the wall , ” she said .
“ I still get emotional thinking about it .
I saw my father jump down on the other side .
I was terrified .
It was very high .
I thought it was going to be the end of my father .
He started debating with an East German soldier .
But the soldier did n’t do anything .
He just stood there , stiff . ”
People power won , and Germany has been united and stable ever since .
The problem we have in dealing with the Arab - Muslim world today is the general absence or weakness of people power there .
There is a low - grade civil war going on inside the Arab - Muslim world today , only in too many cases it is “ the South versus the South ”  bad ideas versus bad ideas , amplified by violence , rather than bad ideas versus good ideas amplified by people power .
In places like Egypt , Syria , Saudi Arabia , Afghanistan or Pakistan you have violent religious extremist movements fighting with state security services .
And while the regimes in these countries are committed to crushing their extremists , they rarely take on their extremist ideas by offering progressive alternatives .
That ’s largely because the puritanical Islamic ideology of the Saudi state or segments of the Pakistani military is not all that different from the ideology of the extremists .
And when these extremists aim elsewhere  like at India or at Shiites or at Israelis  these regimes are indifferent .
That is why there is no true war of ideas inside these countries  just a war .
These states are not promoting an inclusive , progressive and tolerant interpretation of Islam that could be the foundation of people power .
And when their people do take to the streets , it is usually against another people rather than to unify their own ranks around good ideas .
There have been far more marches to denounce Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad than to denounce Muslim suicide bombers who have killed innocent civilians , many of them Muslims .
Here 's a little preview of the B.S. we can expect FreedomWorks ' Dick Armey to be spouting on Meet the Press this weekend .
He faced off against Health Care for America Now 's Richard Kirsch on The PBS Newshour Thursday night .
Armey uses people buying into his disinformation campaign as proof that there must be something wrong with the health care bills making their way through Congress .
I agree there are problems , but for the opposite reason Dick Armey does , and somehow pursuit of the truth does n't look like it's at the top of his organization 's agenda .
Protecting the insurance and health care industries ' profits are .
I watch this process .
The thing that breaks your heart about that is , especially with older folks , to be subjected to extra procedures that are not medically necessary is a very difficult burden for them to carry when they 're already oftentimes quite fragile and the procedures themselves can be quite a stressful experience for them .
DICK ARMEY : Well , lawyers suing doctors and that which causes doctors to order up extra procedures on behalf of patients that are not needed medically , but they need them in case they end up in a courtroom .
DICK ARMEY , FreedomWorks : Yes , I do .
And we go back to things I 've argued for , tort reform is -- estimates now as much as $ 100 billion of just sheer abject waste , which , by the way , is a hardship ...
And , Dick Armey , I 'm going to come straight to you on the basics .
You believe that there should be some form of reform of health care , health insurance , but a more limited form than what the president favors .
Thank you both for being here .
We thank you for being part of this discussion .
And Richard Kirsch is the national campaign manager of Health Care for America Now , a liberal group which has urged its supporters to turn out at the meetings .
Former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey is chair of FreedomWorks , a conservative group that has rallied protestors at health care town hall meetings .
JUDY WOODRUFF :
As the fight over reforming health care spreads from here in Washington , D.C. , across the rest of the nation , we hear now from advocates on both sides of the issue .
JUDY WOODRUFF : Would that be enough , Richard Kirsch ?
RICHARD KIRSCH , Health Care for America Now :
That 's not the problem Americans face , Judy .
Basically , what Americans face is a problem of they do n't have a guarantee of good health care they can afford .
Three out of five of the personal bankruptcies in this country are because of medical costs , and most of those people have insurance , but the insurance is n't there when they need it , because if they get seriously ill , it stops paying .
Did you know that premiums in the last decade have gone up four times as fast as wages ?
People can't afford to get health coverage .
And so we have this tremendous sense of insecurity , and what people need is a guarantee of good , affordable coverage at work or , if they do n't -- if they 're not at work , to have that coverage there , too .
And what we 're talking about is basically saying to America :
You have good coverage that you can afford .
JUDY WOODRUFF : And you 're saying provide that how ?
RICHARD KIRSCH : Provide that very simply .
What the reforms that we 're looking at do two things .
First of all , they say , if you 're at work , your employer is going to continue to provide coverage at work , or -- and the coverage is going to be good , because there are going to have to be a specified set of good benefits , and if you do n't have coverage at work , you 're going to go into a new health insurance marketplace where you 're going to have a guaranteed choice of coverage that 's affordable based on what you earn .
It 's very simple .
JUDY WOODRUFF : Why is n't that a system that would work ?
DICK ARMEY : Well , the biggest problem that they have with this -- this sounds great .
I mean , I have to tell you , you 're warming my heart .
RICHARD KIRSCH :
It is great .
DICK ARMEY : But the fact of the matter is there is a large and growing number of Americans who are actually reading the bills that have come through the House and they just do n't believe that .
They see this as a hostile government takeover of all health care , where they will be forced into a government - run program , and their health care lives will be managed by the government , just as today 's the case in Medicare .
If you 're over 65 years old in America today , you have no choice but to be in Medicare .
Even if you want out of Medicare , you have to forfeit your Social Security to get out of it .
Even if you 're a Christian Scientist , you have to give up your Social Security .
That 's pretty heavy - handed , and people fear that .
JUDY WOODRUFF : What about this charge ?
RICHARD KIRSCH :
Well , I mean , I think what Dick Armey just said is absolutely to the point .
He does n't think Medicare should exist .
Basically , Medicare is the system that provides a guarantee of good coverage for seniors in this country .
It is , in fact , what is meant -- your old age means you do n't have to worry about not getting the health care you need .
That 's the same thing we need to do for everybody in this country , but we need to do it in a system that provides choices between regulated private insurance or public insurance .
And the point is , we need that guarantee for people to have affordable health coverage .
DICK ARMEY : Let me just be clear about something .
I have no problem with Medicare .
I was talking to my minister just last night about it .
If you want to voluntarily be a part of it , bless your heart , I 'm proud for you .
I want you to have it .
But I do have a problem is forcing people in it and be given very , very punitive government sanctions against anybody who would say , " I do n't want to be in that program . "
JUDY WOODRUFF : Well , let 's address ...
DICK ARMEY :
You should have a right to say no to the government and say , " I do n't want to be a ward of the state . "
JUDY WOODRUFF : What about this very point ?
He 's saying that , under the plan or the plans that are moving through Congress , people would be forced into government health care , either Medicare or some other ...
RICHARD KIRSCH : First of all , that 's totally untrue .
Under the plans that are being introduced and passed by so far three committees in the House and one in the Senate , people at work would keep their coverage at work , but the coverage would change in the following ways .
Your employer 's coverage would have to meet certain minimum standards , so the benefits would have to be good , and the employer would have to pay for a decent amount of your coverage .
So that 's private insurance at work .
And if you then do n't get private insurance at work , what you would do is go into a new health care marketplace where you would choose from multiple private insurance plans , not government plans , private insurance plans , and one new public insurance plan .
That 's not a government takeover of anything .
It is government regulation so we 're sure that health insurance works for you .
JUDY WOODRUFF : What 's wrong with that ...
DICK ARMEY : There 's nothing wrong with his story as he tells it .
But the fact of the matter is , even the Congressional Budget Office says 100,000 -- or 100 million Americans will lose their -- their ...
RICHARD KIRSCH :
That 's not what they say .
DICK ARMEY : ... their employer - provided insurance .
The Congressional Budget Office ...
RICHARD KIRSCH :
That 's not what they say .
DICK ARMEY : This is not quarreling with me .
RICHARD KIRSCH : The Congressional Budget Office actually did an analysis of the House bill .
And what it said is , under their bill , the number of people who will be -- not lose their private insurance .
The number of people , mostly uninsured people now who will go into the public plan will be 9 million .
That 's the number in the analysis of the House bill .
DICK ARMEY : Well ...
RICHARD KIRSCH :
That 's the facts .
That 's what it says .
DICK ARMEY : Well , so we have a difference of information here .
But I have to tell you , if you take a look at the unrest that you see brewing in America today , it 's precisely because the American citizenry at large does not believe what the government and agents of the government are telling them .
The BBC 's flagship political programme Question Time has delivered its fair share of on - air rows during its 30 - year history , as politicians of differing hues have faced occasionally angry audiences and engaged in an hour of heated debate .
But next week 's edition is already threatening to provide more than the usual verbal jousting after the Corporation 's decision to give a prized seat on the panel to the leader of the British National Party ( BNP ) .
The programme 's producers are to push ahead with next week 's show , which will feature the far - right party 's leader , Nick Griffin , despite plans by anti-fascist campaigners to hold a protest outside BBC headquarters on the day of filming and the decision by some cabinet ministers to refuse an invitation to take part .
The Corporation is also risking a strike by some of its workers and questions remain over who will pay for the extra security needed to police the event .
In an attempt to minimise disruption , the BBC has refused to reveal the exact location of the show .
It is currently simply listed as coming from London .
However , it is widely expected that it will be filmed on 22 October at BBC Television Centre , in White City , west London , as other venues have been too nervous to stage it .

A spokesman for Unite Against Fascism , which is organising a day - long protest , said that plans were in place in case the BBC decided to change the venue at the last minute .
" We want to be clear that the BBC should not be handing the BNP this invitation to political respectability , " a spokesman said .
The BBC says it is duty bound to offer a seat on the panel to the BNP , as the party won two seats during the European Parliament elections in June .
Bonnie Greer , the black playwright and author , has accepted an invitation to appear on the programme alongside Mr Griffin .
Labour was forced to review its long - held refusal to share a platform with members of the party , and the Justice Secretary Jack Straw has now agreed to represent the Government .
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , will be appearing for his party .
The inclusion of Greer means that only one place remains unfilled on the panel .
The Tories have said that they will leave it until next week to make a final decision on who they will nominate to appear .
Mr Straw 's allies said last night that it had not been an easy decision for him to make .
" He takes the view that the best way to defeat the BNP is by taking them head on , " one said .
He is said to have sympathy with cabinet colleagues such as the Welsh Secretary , Peter Hain , and the Home Secretary , Alan Johnson , who have refused to take part in protest .
Mr Huhne told The Independent that while he still had a policy of refusing to share a platform with the BNP at its own events , he felt the invitation from the BBC made it a different matter .
" It would be very difficult for the BBC to stop the BNP taking part in a programme like this , " he said .
" You cannot have the programme makers deciding which parties the voters get to see .
It would not make any sense for us to leave an empty chair at the event and not represent the party which holds the views that are the most diametrically opposed to those offered by the BNP . "
A row has also begun over who will foot the bill for policing the event , with the BBC and the local council both hoping to avoid funding the security operation .
Hammersmith and Fulham Council , which has the BBC 's headquarters within its boundaries , said it wanted the edition of Question Time moved to another location because of the threat of protests .
" Our concern is with the disruption to our residents who are trying to get in and out of Shepherd 's Bush in their thousands at that time of day , " a spokeswoman said .
Some BBC workers are said to be poised to launch industrial action if they are made to work on the edition .
The broadcasting union , Bectu , has warned the Corporation not to go ahead with the programme .
The crisis over the BNP 's debut on the show comes after the BBC was criticised for the way it handled an interview with two members of the far - right party on a Radio 1 programme .
More than 100 complaints were received after it emerged that the pair , who were introduced simply as " Mark and Joey " , were Mark Collett , the BNP 's publicity director , and Joseph Barber , who runs the BNP 's record label Great White Records .
During the interview , they claimed that Ashley Cole , the Chelsea and England footballer , was not " ethnically British " .

An extraordinary gathering
When krill come together , they form some of the largest gatherings of life on the planet .
Now scientists have discovered just how these small marine crustaceans do it .
Huge ' superswarms ' containing trillions of krill are formed by juveniles not adults , and these swarms are even denser than experts supposed .
That suggests that all krill in the Southern Ocean are more vulnerable to overfishing than previously thought , the scientists warn .
Krill are small shrimp - like crustaceans that gather in huge numbers .
Previous research has found that some gatherings of Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) can stretch for tens of kilometres .
It was astonishing how much biomass could be concentrated into such a small area
British Antarctic Survey scientist Dr Geraint Tarling
But while huge swarms are known to exist , scientists did not really understand why some swarms are bigger than others , and what drives krill to gather in this way .
So researchers working for the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) decided to investigate the phenomenon .
Led by Dr Geraint Tarling , a BAS researcher based in Cambridge , UK , the research team studied the composition and structure of 4525 separate krill swarms in the Scotia Sea , a vast expanse of water in the Southern Ocean .
The team used echo - sounding equipment , which works much like underwater radar , to find the krill across an area of water equivalent to the eastern half of the Atlantic Ocean .
What they found surprised them .
Krill tend to gather into two distinct types of swarm .
Some krill gather into smaller swarms , no longer than 50 m long and up to 4 m deep .
These swarms are not very tightly packed , with just ten individual krill per cubic metre , on average .
A lone shrimp
However , other much bigger swarms also occur .
Dubbed " superswarms " , these are an order of magnitude larger in area , often stretching over one kilometre in length , and averaging almost 30 m deep .
What is more , these superswarms are much more densely packed , containing up to ten times greater density of animals .
" I was coming at it thinking there might be small swarms tightly packed , and then large swarms that were a bit more diffuse , " says Dr Tarling .
" But what we actually found was the opposite .
There were small swarms that were quite diffuse and large swarms that were tightly packed . "
That means that the majority of krill living in the Antarctic Ocean at any one time will exist within a few , huge superswarms .
" We talking trillions of krill in one aggregation , " explains Dr Tarling .
" Ten or 12 swarms could explain 60 or 70 % of the biomass in an area the size of the eastern Atlantic . "
" It was astonishing how much biomass could be concentrated into such a small area . "
Youthful gathering
The scientists then searched for reasons why such superswarms form .
Certain factors made superswarms more likely .
" The factors we identified included whether there was more likely to be a lot of food around or not , and when there was n't that much food around , they tended to form larger swarms , " says Dr Tarling .
A superswarm of krill located by echosounder ( swarm shown in red )
The small , diffuse swarms are usually formed by mature , adult krill , the researchers discovered .
However , the huge superswarms are formed by juvenile krill .
" Where the animals were less mature , they were more likely to form the larger swarms , " says Dr Tarling .
" Why they do that I do n't know . "
Nightime mystery
One possible explanation could be that swarming together offers individual krill protection against marine predators such as whales or seals .
" All types of swarms are probably to a greater or lesser extent an antipredator response .
There is safety in numbers , the predator confusion affect , " Dr Tarling says .
But swarming comes at a cost , as each individual shrimp has to compete with millions of others for food .
Adult krill are quite negatively buoyant , and have to keep swimming to stay afloat .
That takes a lot of energy , which must be supplied by food , so adult krill likely want to avoid competing with millions of others for their next meal .
A handful
But juvenile krill are more buoyant , and need to eat less .
So they can afford to gather into huge superswarms for protection .
Another reason could be that researchers have previously shown it is more energetically efficient to be in swarm than be isolated .
" For a juvenile that wants to grow very quickly , saving energy could be a bonus for them , " says Dr Tarling .
One mystery to emerge from the research , which is published in the journal Deep Sea Research I , is that superswarms are more likely to gather at night .
" That is more puzzling for us to explain , " says Dr Tarling .
" Up until this point , most polar biologists believed that the swarms dispersed [ at night ] , because that 's the time they feed . "
" When daylight comes they get back into the swarm again for the antipredator benefit .
But we found the opposite to that . "
Vulnerable to overfishing
The discovery that most krill in the Southern Ocean can be found gathered into just a few superswarms has significant implications for how the animals are fished , Dr Tarling warns .
Fishing fleets can efficiently locate and scoop up whole swarms of krill .
But by fishing out just a few huge superswarms , they may be removing the majority of krill living in the entire ocean .
" Focusing on large swarms can have a much larger effect on the environment than you would predict . "

Like BellKor 's Pragmatic Chaos , the winner of the Netflix Prize , second - place The Ensemble was an amalgam of teams which had been competing individually for the million - dollar prize .
But it was n't until leaders joined forces with also - rans that real progress was made in the contest 's goal to improve the Netflix movie recommendation algorithm by 10 percent .
Besides the sheer thrill of seeing the winner place first by mere minutes after years of work , the Netflix Prize competition has proffered hard proof of a basic crowdsourcing concept :
Better solutions come from unorganized people who are allowed to organize organically .
But something else happened that was n't entirely expected :
Teams that had it basically wrong — but for a few good ideas — made the difference when combined with teams which had it basically right , but could n't close the deal on their own .
The secret sauce for both BellKor 's Pragmatic Chaos and The Ensemble was collaboration between diverse ideas , and not in some touchy - feely , unquantifiable , " when people work together things are better " sort of way .
The top two teams beat the challenge by combining teams and their algorithms into more complex algorithms incorporating everybody 's work .
The more people joined , the more the resulting team 's score would increase .
" It 's been quite a drama , " said Netflix chief product officer Neil Hunt at Monday 's awards ceremony .
" At first , a whole lot of teams got in — and they got 6 - percent improvement , 7 - percent improvement , 8 - percent improvement , and then it started slowing down , and we got into year two .
There was this long period where they were barely making progress , and we were thinking , ' maybe this will never be won . '
" Then there was a great insight among some of the teams — that if they combined their approaches , they actually got better .
It was fairly unintuitive to many people [ because you generally take the smartest two people and say ' come up with a solution ' ] ... when you get this combining of these algorithms in certain ways , it started out this ' second frenzy . '
In combination , the teams could get better and better and better . "
Ironically , the most outlying approaches — the ones farthest away from the mainstream way to solve a given problem — proved most helpful towards the end of the contest , as the teams neared the summit .
For instance , BellKor 's Pragmatic Chaos ( methodology here ) credits some of its success to slicing the data by what they called " frequency . "
As it turns out , people who rate a whole slew of movies at one time tend to be rating movies they saw a long time ago .
The data showed that people employ different criteria to rate movies they saw a long time ago , as opposed to ones they saw recently — and that in addition , some movies age better than others , skewing either up or down over time .
( Finally , someone has explained why Snakes On A Plane seemed more fun at the time than it does now . )
By tracking the number of movies rated on a given day as an indicator of how long it had been since a given viewer had seen a movie , and by tracking how memory affected particular movie ratings , Pragmatic Theory ( later part of the winning team ) was able to gain a slight edge , even though this particular algorithm is n't particularly good at predicting which movies people will like when run on its own .
Another example : According to Joe Sill of The Ensemble , Big Chaos ( the Austrians who also became part of the winning team ) discovered that viewers in general tend to rate movies differently on Fridays versus Mondays , and certain users are in good moods on Sundays , and so on .
The team essentially devised a three - dimensional model that incorporated time into the relationship between people and movies .
Taken on its own , the fact that a viewer rated a given movie on a Monday is a horrible indicator of what other movies they 'll want to rent – a crucial part of Netflix ' business ( it says its recommendations are better indicators of what people will rent than their " most popular " lists ) .
But combined with hundreds of other algorithms from other minds , each weighted with precision , and combined and recombined , that otherwise inconsequential fact takes on huge importance .
" One of the big lessons was developing diverse models that captured distinct effects , " said Sill , " even if they 're very small effects . "

Raj Rajaratnam , the hedge - fund billionaire charged as part of a vast insider - trading case , surfaced in an earlier , separate probe into U.S. fund raising by a Sri Lankan terrorist group , people familiar with the probe said .
As part of that investigation , federal agents said they uncovered documents showing Mr. Rajaratnam , founder of the Galleon Group , was among several wealthy Sri Lankans in the U.S. whose donations to a Maryland - based charity made their way to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , these people said .

Tony Blair has many fine qualities .
He can be a brilliant advocate ; and he has a gift – although he found its limit – for finding agreement among apparently incompatible interests .
His supporters also put forward other qualifications for the post of President of the European Council : he has experience of working with European institutions ; as Prime Minister he sought to engage Britain more constructively in the European Union – again within limits ; and , whatever the critics might say , he is well known and respected among world leaders .
However , The Independent on Sunday cannot support his undeclared candidacy for the job that is now almost certain to be created .
This is not simply a matter of his decision to join the American invasion of Iraq .
That was an error of judgement , and an important one .
It must count against him in consideration for any leadership position .
But the Iraq war also undermines Mr Blair 's claim to be a unifying force .
The issue itself was divisive , pitting the governments of the European Union against each other .
When the choice between Britain 's relationship with America and its relationship with the rest of Europe became unfudgeable , Mr Blair chose America , which speaks volumes about his instincts .
Mr Blair rode roughshod over popular opinion across Europe , and misled people at home .
He used information selectively to help persuade Cabinet and Parliament of the case for military action .
As we say , he was a forceful advocate , sometimes stretching the facts to the utmost in order to make his case .
His lawyerly persuasiveness may be useful in presenting Europe 's case to the rest of the world , but it is not necessarily the ability that makes for the best chairman of summits of European leaders .

As we report today , this is the view of none other than Sir Stephen Wall .
Sir Stephen was Britain 's ambassador to the EU for Mr Blair 's first three years as Prime Minister .
He was then Mr Blair 's adviser on Europe until 2004 .
In that time , he helped to draft the European Constitution that later became the Lisbon Treaty , which created the post of European president .
He claims that it was a British idea , but that Mr Blair might one day fill the post " was not in our thoughts at the time " .
The job was seen then as one with " very constrained " powers , he says , of " co-ordinating the business of the European Council " – the meetings of the leaders of the member states that take place four times a year .
Sir Stephen says that having a high - profile figure as president " is not necessarily a good idea " , which , from someone in his position , is damning indeed .
Above all , however , the argument against Mr Blair 's appointment is that it would be undemocratic .
This newspaper supports the Lisbon Treaty , but sees a terrible missed opportunity in the way it began – as an attempt to impose a constitution on the EU from above .
The EU can only be strengthened if its peoples are given their voice .
A referendum on the Treaty would have been essential had it proposed significant changes in the EU – as it was , the demand for a referendum was only a cause behind which Europhobes could rally .
But Mr Blair is not the choice of the peoples of Europe , and it would weaken the EU if his appointment were to emerge from the secret horse - trading that is now going on behind the scenes .
Mr Blair is not even the choice of the people of Britain .
Anyone who thinks it would be good to have a Briton in the job to fight for a " British " pragmatism in Europe should think again : he would provide a focus for Conservative anti-Europe feeling .
Nor should European leaders choose someone simply on the basis that the Americans have heard of him .
They should choose someone who would be interested in making the European Union work better in the interests of its peoples , which means that it should work more democratically .
There is , therefore , a strong case that the first President of the European Council should come from one of the smaller member states .
" As a unifying signal it should be thought about , " says Sir Stephen Wall .
More than that , it should be acted on , and Mr Blair should be stopped .

The nation 's home foreclosure epidemic may be taking its toll on Americans ' health as well as their wallets .
Nearly half of people studied while undergoing foreclosure reported depressive symptoms , and 37 percent met screening criteria for major depression , according to new University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine research published online this week in the American Journal of Public Health .
Many also reported an inability to afford prescription drugs , and skipping meals .
The authors say their findings should serve as a call for policy makers to tie health interventions into their response to the nation 's ongoing housing crisis .
" The foreclosure crisis is also a health crisis , " says lead author Craig E. Pollack , MD , MHS , who conducted the research while working as an internist and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholar at Penn .
" We need to do more to ensure that if people lose their homes , they do n't also lose their health . "
In addition to the high number of participants reporting depression symptoms , the study of 250 Philadelphia homeowners undergoing foreclosure also shed light on other health care problems that may be spurred by difficulties keeping up with housing costs .
The study participants were recruited with the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Delaware Valley , a non-profit , U.S. Housing and Urban Development - approved mortgage counselor .
The authors found that compared to a sample of residents in the general public , those in foreclosure were more likely to be uninsured ( 22 percent compared to 8 percent ) , though similar health problems were seen among both the insured and uninsured .
Nearly 60 percent reported that they had skipped or delayed meals because they could n't afford food , and people undergoing foreclosure were also more likely to have forgone filling a prescription because of the expense during the preceding year ( 48 percent vs. 15 percent ) .
The study also revealed that for 9 percent of respondents , a medical condition in their family was the primary reason for the home foreclosure , and more than a quarter of those surveyed said they had significant unpaid medical bills .
Because the financial hardships of foreclosure may lead homeowners to cut back on health care spending that they consider " discretionary " – preventive care visits , healthy foods or drugs for chronic conditions like hypertension – Pollack theorizes that the prolonged period of time that most homeowners spend in foreclosure could have a serious effect on health outcomes .
In addition , the stress of undergoing foreclosure may exacerbate health - undermining behaviors .
Among the participants who smoke , for instance , 65 percent said they had been smoking more since they received notice of foreclosure .
The " exceptionally high " rate of depressive symptoms found in the study is especially concerning , Pollack says , compared to previous research showing that only about 12.8 percent of people living in poverty meet criteria for major depressive disorder .
" When people purchase homes , they are buying a piece of the American Dream , " says co-author Julia Lynch , PhD , the Janice and Julian Bers Assistant Professor in the Social Sciences in Penn 's department of political science .
" Losing a home can be especially devastating because it means the loss of this dream .
When this happens , there is reason to worry not only about the health of the home owner but also that of family members and the broader community they live in . "
The authors say that the data collected in Philadelphia may be only the tip of the iceberg when compared to other cities that have experienced a sharp spike in housing foreclosures .
Although foreclosure filings nearly doubled between 2007 and 2008 in Philadelphia , other large cities have higher unemployment and foreclosure rates .
To combat the health problems revealed in the study , Pollack and Lynch suggest that health care workers and mortgage counseling agencies coordinate their efforts to help people at risk of foreclosure access both medical and housing help .
Doctors , they suggest , should ask their patients about their housing situation and steer them towards mortgage relief resources .
Mortgage counselors , meanwhile , can provide information about how to access safety net health care , enroll in public insurance programs like SCHIP or Medicaid , or apply for nutritional assistance programs for pregnant and nursing mothers and their children .
The implications for policy , too , are vast .
" This study raises the stakes of the housing crisis , " Pollack says .
" The policy push to get people into mortgage counseling should be combined with health outreach in order to fully help people during this tremendously difficult period in their lives . "

Amnesty 's Water Report : Will the Facts Trickle Out ?
Yesterday Amnesty International issued a report condemning Israel 's water policies and charging the Jewish state with discriminatory practice vis-a - vis allocation to its Palestinian neighbors ( " Troubled Waters : Palestinians Denied Fair Access to Water " ) .
The report is based solely on Palestinian sources .
NGO - Monitor , Israel 's Foreign MInistry , and the Water Authority have responded , blasting Amnesty for the report 's flaws .
CAMERA is reviewing the report and will provide updates as they are available .
In the meantime , we were struck by this promotional video for the report , which juxtaposes photographs of sprinklers and swimming pools in Israeli communities with images of barren Palestinian water reservoirs and children carrying water vessels .
Yet , there is no shortage of swimming pools in the Palestinian West Bank .
As Ha'aretz 's Avi Issacharoff wrote on Aug. 8 , 2007 :
Nowadays , every city in the West Bank has a pool or a recreational complex : Bethlehem has one similar to Al - Khaluf [ a clover - leaf - shaped pool in Dura , near Hebron ] , while Ramallah has more than 10 .
One of Jenin 's swimming champs committed a suicide bombing at Jerusalem 's Sbarro restaurant in August 2001 .
Nablus has a pool reserved for women , and an Olympic pool .
Another pool and recreation complex sits between Nablus and Tubas .
Al Khaluf draws more than 2,500 people on an average weekend day , [ lifeguard Ahmed ] Rajoub says .

Firing of Michele Pierre - Louis breaks a period of relative stability on the impoverished Caribbean island
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Haiti's senate has triggered political uproar by firing the prime minister , a darling of western diplomats and donors .
A chaotic nine - hour session ended just after midnight with a vote to oust Michele Pierre - Louis , breaking a period of relative stability on the impoverished Caribbean island .
Eighteen of the chamber 's 29 senators voted against the prime minister , citing the slow pace of economic recovery in the wake of four devastating tropical storms and hurricanes last year .
The move was a rebuff to Bill Clinton , the former US president and UN special envoy for Haiti , who told a recent investor conference in the capital Port - au - Prince that political risk was lower than it had ever been in his lifetime .
Hillary Clinton , his wife and the US secretary of state , phoned Haiti 's president , René Préval , last week to discuss the coming senate vote and the " damaging " impact of the perception of instability , according to a US embassy spokesperson .
Pierre - Louis , a former teacher who took office just over a year ago , won the confidence of foreign donors with a business - like approach but lacked a strong political base .
Préval , who appointed her , stayed on the sidelines as his own party spearheaded the ouster .
" I fear the decision will send the wrong signal to Haitian investors , the diaspora and foreign investors , " said Prospery Raymond , Christian Aid 's country representative .
" The security situation improved markedly during her tenure and acute malnutrition was declining . "
The prime minister 's senate opponents complained of dire unemployment and poverty , with most Haitians living on less than $ 2 daily , and queried the spending of $ 197 m ( £ 119 m ) storm - recovery funds .
However , few specific allegations were made in a televised session dominated by procedural wrangling and walk - outs .
Her supporters shouted " illegal " and " unconstitutional " from the floor before marching out , leaving opponents to vote 18 - 0 to fire her .
Pierre - Louis refused to attend , saying in a letter the result was a foregone conclusion .
" I leave the senators of the republic to face their responsibility in front of the nation , " she said .
Since July , 63 percent of all new cash going into foreign central banks have been euros and yen not U.S. dollars .
The greenbacks share of new cash , 37 percent , is far lower than its 66 percent share of 10 years ago .
According to the International Monetary Fund , dollars currently make up about 62 percent of reserves at central banks .
This is the lowest on record !
Additionally , the story has broken that the Persian Gulf states have met with leaders from China , Russia , Japan , and France to set - up payments for oil in currencies other than the dollar .
Naturally , the story has been denied by several of the participants .
But , from what I have experienced so far about Qatar living here for just the past 2 months , the Qatari government is very astute at acting in the nation 's best interest .
They are not going to make bad investments ( accepting debased dollars for oil ) in the long run and interrupt their own economic growth just because the U.S wants them to .
A source of mine on the ground here in Doha has also indicated that the Gulf Cooperation Council ( Kuwait , Bahrain , Qatar , U.A.E. , Oman , and Saudi Arabia ) which plans to institute a common currency in 2010 , is currently debating whether that currency should float or be pegged to another currency .
Apparently , the leading favorite for pegging is the euro .
If this were to happen , overnight the euro would also become the currency of choice for purchasers of oil .
None of these indicators are good news for the dollar and its future as the world 's reserve currency .
It 's no secret how we got to this place .
The U.S. has been on a spending binge ever since Richard Nixon took us off the last vestige of the Gold Standard in 1971 .
Throughout , the term of George W. Bush the welfare / warfare state accelerated federal spending , and interest rates were kept very low by the Fed .
Once the bills came due and the financial crisis hit , the politicians , especially the current president , and the money oligarchs at the Fed knew only to spend more money and lower rates even further to combat the emergency .
See , they either never considered that these actions of theirs got us into the mess in the first place or they realized that since we were in a messy fix they needed to help their benefactors on Wall Street and the best way to do that was to pursue the same policies , but label it “ stimulus ” or “ quantitative easing ” to fool the masses .
Only time will tell whether their chicanery has worked .
One thing is for sure , Fed chairman Ben Bernanke is between an overheated printing press and a hard place .
If he raises rates and siphons trillions out of the economy he will burst the current Fed induced stock market bubble .
Housing values will sink even lower to reach supply / demand equilibrium .
Unemployment will accelerate even more given the higher cost of money for businesses .
If he maintains the status quo , which seems likely given his cowardice in the face of political consequences , the dollar will be finished as the world 's reserve currency .
He claims he has the tools and the know - how to siphon trillions of dollars out of the economy to prevent inflation once the recovery picks up .
But , given the amount of money and credit the Fed has injected since the crisis began , and Washington 's thirst for huge deficits , Bernanke would need to be more than a mere mortal to accomplish that .
Many may ask , well , what would be so bad about the dollar losing world reserve currency status ?
For one thing , demand for dollars will evaporate .
Foreigners will not need them to buy oil and other commodities .
Consequently , the Fed will no longer be able to simply print new money to cover the future debts of Congress ' because no one will be interested in buying the Treasury bonds that support the monetization .
Since demand for the dollar will be gone its value will drop precipitously and this will actually force our government to raise taxes and / or print money just to buy the necessities of a nuclear power and industrialized society – namely uranium and oil .
In light of the amount of debt we already have and the future unfunded liabilities of Medicare and social security , the standard of living in the U.S. will be equivalent to Mexico's .
One huge benefit would be the death of the welfare / warfare state because merely put , “ you ca n't get blood out of a stone . ”
But the loss of wealth will not be worth it .
In some ways the chairman of the Federal Reserve is the most powerful person in the world .
He supplies the money the whole world uses to buy commodities .
That distinction will soon come to an end .
When it does Ben Bernanke will go down as the worst Fed chairman in history since the dollar collapsed because of his policies and on his watch .
Congressmen Ron Paul R - Texas and Alan Grayson D - Florida are about to request that the Senate delay Bernanke 's confirmation hearing for another term as Fed chairman until he releases more information pertaining to the many bailouts of the Fed in the current crisis .
Instead President Obama should withdraw Bernanke 's nomination altogether .
It is possibly too late to stop the inevitable collapse of the dollar .
Maybe Obama can find a competent hand to pick up the pieces when it happens ?

How long would it be before you were back in the hospital ?
Studies show that homeless people have high rates of readmittance to hospitals .
Healing in safety
That ’s why the Medical Respite Center was such a great idea .
It offers homeless people a place where they can recuperate from surgery or broken bones , to gain strength while undergoing cancer treatment .
Nurses and counselors help them keep track of their medications and get to doctor appointments .
The 15 - bed respite center , one of only a handful in the country , is in a wing of the Boccardo Reception Center in San Jose , a one - stop homeless services center run by EHC LifeBuilders .
A collaborative including EHC , Santa Clara County and nine private hospitals supports it .
For Fonseca , the center has been a lifesaver .
“ If it were n’t for this place , and this is honestly from my heart , I would be dead or under a bridge somewhere , ” she said .
The small , energetic 76 - year - old invited me to her tidy room .
She showed me the afghan she ’s knitting for her bed .
She plans to knit 15 of them , one for each bed in the center .
“ I ’m hoping when I get out of here to have a place of my own , ” she said .
That ’s one of the center ’s goals , to get folks off the street for good .
About 50 people have stayed at the center since it opened this past October , and all have moved into permanent housing , said Cheryl Ho , medical director for the Valley Homeless Healthcare Program .
Making a connection
While patients are recovering , case managers look for subsidized housing , sign people up for Medi-Cal , Social Security and other benefits , and help them feel connected .
“ It ’s the kind of support you never have when you ’re living on the street , ” said Audrey Kuang , a physician who runs the Boccardo Center clinic .
Before the center opened , Kuang kept homeless people in VMC longer than she would have if they had homes to go to , at a cost of $ 2,000 a day .
So far this year , the center has saved 261 days of hospital care , worth more than $ 500,000 .
A day at the center costs under $ 100 .
But it ’s harder to put a price on the lives saved , and that ’s what Fonseca and Ramon Paz feel the center has done for them .
Paz , 65 , is recovering after someone hit him in the head with a rock at a homeless encampment .
Now , he says , he ’s finished with the street .
“ I guess it took something like that to knock it into my head that I have no business being out there , ” he told me .
“ The people here have done everything for me .
They have given me back my life . ”

While many Americans are upset by ObamaCare ’s $ 1 trillion price tag , Congress is contemplating other changes with little analysis or debate .
These changes would create a massively unfair form of income redistribution and create incentives for many not to buy health insurance at all .
Like the homeowner who waits until his house is on fire to buy insurance , younger , poorer , healthier workers will rationally choose to avoid paying high premiums now to subsidize insurance for someone else .
After all , they can always get a policy if they get sick .

Over the past day , Everyone has been reporting about the arrest last month of Elliot Madison for twittering about police movements to protesters during the G - 20 Summit in Pittsburgh , PA .
The reason this is being reported on now is because on last Thursday , the FBI also raided Mr. Madison 's home in Queens , NY , followed on Friday by Mr. Madison 's filing of a motion in the Eastern District of New York federal court in Brooklyn for the return of his seized property .
In reviewing all the stories , we saw lots of quotes from Mr. Madison 's legal filings and from the Pennsylvania state criminal complaint against him , but no links to the legal papers themselves .
As a resource to journalists and interested readers , we are posting Mr. Madison 's motion and his lawyer 's supporting declaration ; attached to the declaration are copies of the search warrant , an inventory of the seized items , and the original criminal complaint .
Princeton University economist , author and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman won the Nobel Prize in economics last year for his work on international trade — so the guy knows what he ’s talking about when it comes to this subject .
And he ’s worried .
First , he offered a few comments about the U.S. economy at the World Business Forum conference in New York :
1 – Based on GDP , “ the recession is over , we ’re back to a world of growth ”
2 – But , “ the jobs picture is continuing to deteriorate .
The recession may be over , but the bad times are nowhere near over . ”
3 – “ This could be bad .
Financial crises tend to produce prolonged hits to growth … and this is the mother of all synchronized financial crises so we almost certainly have a long , long slog before we ’re fully recovered . ”
Then , he turned to the topic of world trade .
And the picture he painted was not a pretty one .
“ When it comes to international trade , actually it ’s not the Great Depression , it ’s worse , ” he said , presenting charts showing the decline in global trade activity falling much more steeply in the current downturn than during the Depression .
“ The scale of the collapse of world trade has been so large that it has produced a degree of international linkage that surpasses what even the pessimists imagined , ” he said .
“ World trade acted as a transmission mechanism , ” spreading economic distress “ even to those countries that had relatively healthy financial systems , ” such as Germany .
“ We really are one world economy in a way that has never been true before , ” he said .
Despite the collapse in trade , Krugman downplayed concerns about protectionism .
The Obama administration ’s move last month to impose tariffs on certain imports of Chinese tires raised much concern that nations are leaning towards protectionism — a move some economists say worsened and prolonged the Great Depression .
But Krugman is n’t convinced .
First , he said , protectionism was an effect –– not a cause — of the Great Depression — a frequent misconception among economists , he said .
And despite “ incidents ” it has n’t really been a factor in the current downturn .
He added that as for the tire tariffs , they “ are n’t really a big deal , ” because they are “ part of the rules ” under world trade agreements and are temporary — rather than permanent — in nature .
The High Line park opened to the public earlier this year
New York 's newest park - built on the tracks of a rusting and half - forgotten railway line - snakes between the skyscrapers of Manhattan , as Jonathan Marcus discovered when he visited this ribbon of greenery set in a concrete jungle .
They call it the High Line , an old elevated railway that threads its way through abandoned warehouses and bright new glass and concrete buildings on Manhattan 's Lower West Side .
Abandoned in 1980 - the last train carried three freight cars of frozen turkeys - it simply slumbered for more than 20 years .
Nature took over .
Grasses and even trees grew up between the sleepers .
It remained largely forgotten , until now .
Today , the High Line is one of New York 's most unlikely new attractions .
I followed the whole course of the line from ground level .
The only real clues to its existence are the cast - iron , Art Deco bridges crossing each side street as the tracks run parallel to 10th Avenue .
At one cross -street , you can still see the fading logo of the New York Central Railroad , which first elevated its street - level tracks to reduce road accidents in the 1930s .
' Special ' line Robert Hammond lived in the area and had come to love the line 's rusting steel structure
During its hey - day , trains delivered goods to a variety of wholesale food warehouses , running into - and in some cases through - the buildings that they served .
This was the only rail - freight route into Manhattan that kept its feet dry .
All the other railroads had to ship their freight cars over on tug - hauled barges or car - floats .
But the New York Central was special .
Its line ran northwards from a terminal south of Greenwich Village , passing almost unnoticed through some 30 city blocks before entering the West Side Rail Yard and disappearing underground .
Its destination was Albany in up - state New York and beyond .
Saviours
On the corner of Gansevoort and Washington Street - in the heart of the old Meatpacking District - I met up with Robert Hammond , one of the joint saviours of the High Line .
Originally from Texas , he lived in the area and had come to love the rusting steel structure .
He told me that when he heard that there were plans to demolish it he went to a local council meeting convinced that there must be somebody working to save the line .
There was n't .
It is a masterclass in urban renewal , a kind of ' strip - prairie ' through the heart of the urban jungle
At that meeting he met travel writer Joshua David .
They discussed starting something and the Friends of the High Line was born .
Ten years later , the first section of the line is now open as Manhattan 's newest park .
From the street we went up a new staircase and emerged onto the viaduct into a magical land .
A new pathway has been laid using concrete slabs .
This meanders through beds of grasses and other plants , all carefully planned to retain a wild and overgrown look .
Here and there the old railway lines are still visible , with each piece of rail having been returned to its original place .
At the start everything had had to be cleared away , Robert Hammond told me , but the structure itself was in surprisingly good condition despite years of neglect .
The most expensive thing , he said , was stripping away all of the old lead - based paint .
We headed off northwards under the newly built Standard Hotel which straddles the line .
It is brutally modern : " Eastern Bloc meets Miami , " as Robert described it .
Its pale green curtains or blinds make it look a bit like a hospital .
It seems that some , shall we say , more exhibitionist couples have failed to close those blinds , providing an unexpected show for walkers on the High Line below .
Robert Hammond said that such stories were overblown but this was fast becoming a new urban myth , a token in many ways of the line 's extraordinary success .
' Masterclass '
On this typical sunny Saturday , he expected to have some 25,000 visitors , walkers , joggers , sunbathers , grandparents with their grandchildren - anyone who wants to see the city from a fascinating new vantage point .
You are above ground but not so high that you cannot make eye contact with people in the streets below .
When completed , the park will be one and a half miles long
On one side , you pass Pier 54 on the Hudson River .
That is where the Titanic would have docked , Robert told me .
To the right , there is a fine view of the Empire State Building and , if you turn around and look back down the course of the line , you can just make out the Statue of Liberty away in the distance .
The first section of the High Line now ends at a wire fence at 20th Street .
The next 10 blocks should be open in a year or two and a battle is still under way to preserve the line 's northern extremity , the old rail yard , which is an enticing prospect for developers .
All in all , it is a masterclass in urban renewal , a kind of " strip - prairie " through the heart of the urban jungle .
And it is a testament to what Robert Hammond and a dedicated band of campaigners were able to achieve to preserve and re-use a forgotten part of Manhattan 's heritage .

Great grandma can soon put aside that powered wheelchair she uses to terrorize the residents at her rest home .
Japan ’s robotics venture Cyberdyne ’s robot - suit " HAL " ( Hybrid Assistive Limb ) is now available for rent and is being tested on the streets of Tokyo :
HAL , an exoskeleton , is a mind - controlled wearable machine that gives humans enhanced mobility .
The HAL exoskeleton –- described in a popular article for the first edition of h+ ( " I am Ironman ! " ) – helps the wearer to carry out a variety of everyday tasks , including standing up from a chair , walking , climbing up and down stairs , and lifting heavy objects .
The suit can operate for almost five hours before it needs recharging .
Cyberdyne ’s HAL is n’t quite ready for great grandma just yet .
But until it is , Toyota researchers in Japan have built a brain / machine interface ( BMI ) that has been demonstrated to control a wheelchair using a person ’s thoughts .
The wheelchair enables a person to make it turn left or right or to move forward simply by thinking the commands –- and it has a 125 millisecond response time .
The HAL exoskeleton , on the other hand , has robotic limbs that strap to your arms and legs — providing much fuller mobility than a wheelchair .
The suit ’s backpack contains a battery and computer controller .
When a HAL - assisted person attempts to move , nerve signals are sent from the brain to the muscles , and very weak traces of these signals can be detected on the surface of the skin .
The HAL exoskeleton identifies these signals using a sensor , and a signal is sent to the suit ’s power unit telling the suit to move in synch with the wearer ’s own limbs .
HAL comes in three sizes — small , medium and large and weighs in at 23kg ( 50.7 lbs ) .
A single leg version rents for 150,000 yen ( $ 1,570 ) a month , while a two - leg unit goes for 220,000 yen ( $ 2,300 ) a month .
Cyberdyne has yet to announce when HAL will go on sale to the public or what the price tag will be .
Great grandma wo n’t be the only one who will benefit from a thought - controlled exoskeleton .
Seiji Uchida , paralyzed from the neck down for over two decades , was able to get within 500 yards of the summit of the 13,741 - foot Breithorn Mountain in Switzerland with the help of a HAL exoskeleton worn by his friend Takeshi Matsumoto .
Mr. Matsumoto was able to carry the quadriplegic Mr. Uchida because Matsumoto was wearing the exoskeleton .
Imagine a next - phase exoskeleton that Mr. Uchida can control himself without the assistance of Mr. Matsumoto .
HAL shows tremendous potential to help mobilize the disabled to perform day - to - day tasks .
If anyone is physically challenged , it ’s the soldier carrying a huge load on the battlefield .
Exoskeletons give soldiers the ability to move faster while carrying more weight .
For nearly a decade , a project launched by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been looking at ways to help with the heavy lifting .
The Exoskeletons for Human Performance Augmentation , a program with the goal “ to develop devices and machines that will increase the speed , strength and endurance of soldiers in combat environments , ” is a way to create super soldiers that can lift hundreds of pounds as easily as lifting 10 pounds and can run twice their normal speed .
Under contract from the Army , a team at Raytheon Sarcos , led by Stephen Jacobsen , built an exoskeleton called XOS .
Looking something like Ripley wearing the industrial exo-suit power loader in the classic SF film Aliens , software engineer Rex Jameson used his XOS to run , jump , and even speed box a punching bag .
Jameson also was able to do a lengthy series of reps on a weight machine using 200 lb weights .
“ He stopped because he got bored , ” Jacobsen says , “ not because he was tired . ”
Here ’s a video of the Sarcos exoskeleton :
Cyberdyne ’s exoskeleton is considerably more sleek and stylish .
Tokyo rentals were initiated in August , 2009 .
Like Segways , the popular 2 - wheeled , self - balancing electric vehicles now being using by police to patrol the streets of major cities , it ’s easy to imagine Washington , D.C. , Minneapolis , Denver , San Francisco , Chicago , or even Albuquerque providing exoskeleton rentals .
The next phase in bicycle rentals is high - tech bike - sharing systems — an investment in public bicycles worldwide .
Walk up to a kiosk , swipe a credit or membership card and ride away .
Return it there or at another station , like renting a luggage cart at the airport .
Cyberdyne ’s exoskeletons appear to be easier to use than bicycles , particularly for weary travelers .
Why not rent an exoskeleton rather than a bicycle ?
With fashionable cyborg exoskeletons now available for rent on the streets of Tokyo , can major U.S. cities be far behind ?
The PATRIOT Act was sold to the country as the line in the sand protecting us from the murderous hordes of Islamist terrorists .
Passed in a hurry following 9/11 , they told us that these powers were needed for terrorism only , and not for general law - enforcement .
Civil libertarians did n’t believe this assertion , of course , and as usual when it comes to government power , we were right ( link to PDF report ) .
In a traditional search warrant , the person / people / place being search are notified when the search is conducted .
One aspect of the PATRIOT
Act is the delayed notification warrant , aka the “ Sneak and Peek ” .
For this , the search is conducted but the person being investigated is not told that the search was executed for some delayed time afterwards .
For a terrorism surveillance case , this allows investigators to attempt to detect plots in the planning stage .
In the government ’s FY2008 ( Oct’07 to Sep’08 ) , 763 new warrants were obtained .
Of these new warrants , a mere 3 were for terrorism .
What were the rest ?
Table 2 presents the types of offenses specified in delayed - notice search warrant and extension requests reported in 2008 .
Drug offenses were specified in 65 percent of applications reported , followed by fraud ( 5 percent ) , weapons , and tax offenses ( 4 percent each ) .
Someday , the warnings issued by libertarians — rather than being ignored — will actually be heeded .
On that day I will die of shock .

And now the Republicans claim they are going to introduce a resolution " disapproving " of my behavior .
What is this , junior high school ?
Do they think my feelings are hurt ?
Just what do these people think health care means ?
It 's not some abstract " issue " , we 're talking about life and death !
And the Republicans , who ran the government in full or in part from 2001 - 2009 , chose to let those 44,000 people die , every single year when they were in power .
And George W. Bush , whom the Republicans somehow pretend was not President for the last eight years , just let them die .
He even vetoed health care for poor children .
So apologize ?
I do n't think so .
Now , my office is getting slammed with calls .
Some people are saying " I will do anything in my power to get you out of office . "
But many of you are calling and saying " Thank you for speaking the truth , and do n't you dare apologize . "
The Republicans are serious about getting rid of me , because they are scared .
They have already set up a site to attack me .
And the reason is simple ; they do n't want my tough attitude to rub off on other Democrats .
And the Democrats are n't sure what to think about this new , I do n't know what you call it , truthtelling ?
But you can help make it clear that when I spoke the truth , I was speaking for you .
And you can show them that I was speaking for you .
Today is the end of the fundraising quarter , which means everyone is going to be watching fundraising totals .
Help me speak truth .
You 've already set up a bunch of fundraising pages and I can't thank you enough for getting my back .
If you have n't already , I hope you 'll go to one of these pages and help out today .
I 'm at $ 20,956 $ 28,449 $ 41,141 $ 50,799 $ 61,012 $ 50,799 $ 70,420 $ 91,775 $ 96,974 $ 100,205 so far .

Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla. ) , left , listens during a hearing on Capitol Hill .
Rivals shy away from Grayson
As a polarizing freshman from a competitive House seat , one with a habit of making provocative comments , Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) would appear to rank among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents .
Yet Republican after Republican keeps backing away from challenging him , enough to raise the question :
Are prospective candidates scared of Grayson ?
Advertisement
The notion is n’t as outlandish as it seems .
First , the best - known candidate in the Orlando region , Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty , decided not to pursue a campaign .
Then one of the most respected Florida conservatives , former state Sen .
Daniel Webster , shocked the party when he announced he was n’t running — even though he ’d already begun to scout locations for his campaign kickoff and had talked to House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) about supporting his potential candidacy .
Several state legislators also took a pass , despite the inviting political landscape and the national party ’s hunger to oust Grayson .
Then there were the two well - funded Orlando businessmen , Tim Seneff and Jerry Pierce , who also floated their names as possible challengers before deciding to step aside .
That has left 28 - year - old developer Armando Gutierrez Jr. , who just moved to Orlando , as Grayson ’s current leading opponent .
Even though he ’s won endorsements from Florida Republican Reps .
Tom Rooney and Gus Bilirakis , leading Republican officials privately believe he would have a difficult time defeating Grayson because he lacks ties to the Orlando area .
Analysts on both sides say that potential challengers have had to think long and hard about whether they want to engage in what is sure to be a smash - mouth , no -holds - barred campaign .
The pugnacious Grayson is not only independently wealthy — he is one of the wealthiest members of the House , with an estimated $ 31 million net worth — but now also possesses a national fundraising base in the wake of a headline - grabbing episode last month in which he claimed on the House floor that the GOP health care plan consisted of wanting sick seniors to die quickly .
“ These people realize that Grayson plays hardball .
There are two reasons that are giving these Republican candidates pause :
It will be a bruiser of a campaign , and he has a huge amount of money to spend , ” said John Dowless , a leading Republican consultant in the Orlando area .
“ It is the phone conversation among the political insiders around here : ‘ Where are the candidates ? ’
We ’re all completely flummoxed as to why so many people are n’t running .
There ’s hardly anybody left . ”
Grayson ’s team is quick to warn prospective GOP opponents that the controversial first - term incumbent plans to run a punishing campaign .
“ The people who decided not to run obviously do not have the stomach for the difficult race , ” Grayson ’s senior campaign adviser , Julie Tagen , told POLITICO .
“ As for the people who have already entered the race , they are a veritable ‘ Who ’s that ? ’ of Central Florida .
Whoever wins the nomination will end up gutted like a fish by Election Day . ”
Grayson himself has openly gloated about his lack of Republican opposition , releasing a Top 10 list to his supporters last week explaining why no one wants to run against him .
In it , he joked that candidates are passing on the race because their wives will cheat on them back home , and launched a thinly veiled barb at Crotty , whom he accused of “ shaking down vendors in Orange County . ”
Several Florida Republican operatives acknowledged that some prospective candidates were reluctant to sign on for what they expected to be a scorched - earth campaign that , even in the event of victory , would come at the cost of having their reputations dragged through the mud .
“ The toughest thing Republicans have going for them is , the guys looking at running have very successful political or business careers .
And the stomach for engaging in the kind of bare - knuckles campaign just to end up being a minor player in Congress is just not there for these guys , ” said Florida GOP strategist Brett Doster .
Orange County Republican Party Chairman Lew Oliver said he was still optimistic that the party would coalesce behind one strong candidate , and he has been speaking with a new wave of candidates interested in taking on Grayson .
“ We ’re so excited that I ’m going to have a lottery to see who ’s going to be our candidate , ” Oliver said .
“ The fact is , a lot of people want to take on Alan Grayson , but they do n’t want to float their names yet .
But we have a big batting cage of folks sitting and waiting . ”
That current bench , according to GOP recruiters , consists of three candidates : state Rep. Eric Eisnaugle , a 32 - year - old first - term legislator ; attorney Will McBride , who unsuccessfully challenged Katherine Harris in the 2006 Republican Senate primary ; and businessman Bruce O’Donoghue .
Of those three , O’Donoghue , who runs a traffic management business , has emerged as the most likely contender .
The 55 - year - old has spent his entire life in the Orlando area , inherited his father ’s business and is close to regional GOP power brokers , including former Sen. Mel Martinez and former Lt. Gov. Toni Jennings .
Republicans are also enthusiastic about his campaign because of his ability to self - finance .
O’Donoghue said he has n’t made a final decision but is very close to entering the race in the next couple of weeks .
“ I ’m not scared of Alan Grayson , ” O’Donoghue told POLITICO .
“ He can fire all the shots he thinks are necessary , but the bottom line is he ’s out of touch with the people of this district . ”
“ Politics can get dirty — as long as they leave my wife and kids out of the picture .
I get along with just about everybody in this community , and I do not understand Alan Grayson .
He does n’t represent this community , and it ’s time to get someone in there that does . ”
Eisnaugle told POLITICO that the prospect of a Grayson onslaught would n’t dissuade him from running , but he did have serious reservations about spending most of the week in Washington away from his family .
“ I ’m looking at it closely , but I do n’t want to drag it out .
It was n’t on my radar screen until a week ago , ” said Eisnaugle .
“ The truth is , running for Congress is a life change .
You have to move to D.C.
If you have kids , it can be quite difficult .
If your priority is your family , it does n’t make sense . ”
As Republicans mull over their options , Grayson has been busy stockpiling campaign cash .
According to his campaign , 10,000 people donated $ 300,000 since he gave his widely publicized House speech — most of it in addition to the $ 477,000 he banked at the end of September .
He recently set up a website called CongressmanWithGuts.com proclaiming Nov. 2 as a “ money bomb ” day for progressives to donate money to his campaign .
“ Grayson has positioned himself to be public enemy No. 1 for all congressional races , but we ’re having a difficult time finding a good candidate , ” said Doster .
“ By mid-February , if you do n’t have anyone there with a serious plan for funding a top - tier race , it ’s going to be a tough race for Republicans to win . ”

A name from a very different era sits alongside modern pop stars like Beyonce , Pink and Lily Allen in Britain 's top 20 chart this week .
At the age of 92 , wartime singer Dame Vera Lynn is riding high in the British music charts for the first time in more than half a century .
Dame Vera was known as the sweetheart of the armed forces during World War II and was credited with keeping up the spirits of millions of soldiers .
Now she has become the oldest living artist to enter the top 20 album chart .
On the eve of the 70th anniversary of the beginning of World War II , Dame Vera has released a new CD - We 'll Meet Again : The Very Best Of Vera Lynn .
Dame Vera 's morale - boosting songs sustained Britons through those dark years .
With her nightly radio program , Sincerely Yours , she bridged the gap between the soldiers on the frontline and their loved ones waiting at home .
And while she was a huge hit during those years , her success seven decades later has come as bit of a surprise to the wartime entertainer .
" It 's wonderful , but it is rather strange , " she said .
" Never did I think when I was recording those songs that 70 years on they would even still be known , let alone being brought out into the public again .
So it 's very wonderful really . "
Dame Vera thinks the latest album resonates with many people who still remember the war .
" I 'm sure so many people have many stories to tell - how they heard news and where they were and what they felt , " she said .
Even today with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , she believes the younger generation can relate to her songs .
" The boys are away again and all the songs are appropriate , " she said .
" The words are universal .
I mean they suit anytime , anywhere and for any purpose .
There 's the simple lyrics , mostly about loved ones .
" We 'll Meet Again and White Cliffs are the ones that speak of home really , and I suppose they were the two outstanding songs . "
Description : Kinga wanders around naked looking mighty with her seemingly perfect body !
Where has she been all my life ..

2009 -10 - 19 - JazzScheme embraces its Scheme destiny !
The last of the Jazz - specific constructs , namely using ' function ' instead of ' lambda ' , was removed from the language .
The decision was made after realizing it was time that Jazz fully embraced its Scheme destiny !
We plan on continuing to evolve the Jazz language , platform and IDE to make them ever more Scheme - and Lisp - friendly .
2009 -06 -27 - Auphelia
Technologies to use JazzScheme for their new ERP software After an exhaustive evaluation period , Auphelia Technologies has decided to develop the backend of their new Enterprise Resource Planning product entirely in JazzScheme .
Decision is still pending between Qt and JazzScheme for the desktop client but there is a definite preference at this point for using JazzScheme across the whole project .
One key element of the decision to use JazzScheme was the high complexity of the project .
The project is not to create just another ERP software , but rather a complete dynamic ERP - creation platform .
On the technical side , the project will include development of the JazzScheme platform by three people over a period of about six months .
Planned work includes : Documentation
Static builds of executables and libraries
Module system / Hygienic macros
Performance / Memory / Stability
UI / Interface designer
IDE / Remote debugger and profiler Note that Gambit 's author , Marc Feeley , has confirmed his participation part - time in the project !
Various job openings for highly - skilled people where also announced .
For details , see : http://lispjobs.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/auphelia-technologies-erp/

Changes since the MSLUG presentation Project Management Project management has received a major overhaul .
The result is hopefully a very flexible and intuitive to learn project management system that offers various project templates for easy learning .
Only downside is that most of the tutorials on the website that where created for the MSLUG presentation are now somewhat out of date .
Please take a look at them even then as they should help you get started .
We will be working on and off to bring them up to date in the next few weeks .

Debugger Using new Gambit hooks , the debugger is now able to locate source code even if it is moved around .
This is extremely useful for binary releases where the source code will end up in a different location than the one where it was when the compiled .o1 was generated .

Build System
A serious memory problem in the build system has been solved .
Before , building Jazz could end up taking up to 2G of memory !
Now , after a quick peek of 700 M when linking the kernel , the whole build process seldoms takes more than 200 M of memory .

Kernel * Every * call to unsafe ## Gambit primitives is now wrapped in a safe % % macro that , depending on the safety chosen in the build configuration will be expanded to either a safe call for ' debug ' safety or an unsafe call for ' release ' safety .
In theory , no code run in ' debug ' should ever crash .
Note that for performance reasons , the default safety is ' release ' and thus by default jazz and jedi are built in ' release ' .
Should you encounter a serious crash in Jedi , as the build system supports multiple configurations , you can easily build a separate ' debug ' version to try and solve the problem .

User Profile Every user setting is saved in a ' profile ' .
If some of these settings are manually edited and corrupted , the IDE would fail to launch .
Now , every profile setting will load safely and a generic one will be used should a problem ever occur so that in theory , no amount of corruption should ever stop the IDE from launching correctly .

Todo before the public release Debugger
The remote debugger is totally functional at the moment but is still missing many features
Common Lisp debugger through SWANK Documentation A lot of work remains to be done documentation wise .
We plan to quickly bring the documentation to at least a point where every stable method has basic documentation so that it is easy for a programmer to know if a method is ' OK ' to be used or not .

Guillaume Cartier Guillaume Cartier Announcement Date : Thursday , November 27 , 2008
Time : 7:00 pm - 9:00 pm
Location : Room 3195 , André - Aisenstadt Building , Université de Montréal
Street : 2920 chemin de la Tour
City / Town : Montreal , QC
As some of you know , Guillaume Cartier has been working for the past 12 years on his JazzScheme system .
It is a powerful and complete development environment for Scheme applications .
You can read about it here : http://www.jazzscheme.org
A couple of years ago , he decided to port the whole Jazz kernel to Gambit - C Scheme and to eventually release Jazz under an Open Source License .
With the near completion of X11 support , the time to do a full public release is coming very close .
In order to help spot and iron out the remaining issues for a full public release , Guillaume will be doing a " Closed Beta " release to the participants of the MSLUG .
The release will take place at the MSLUG meeting on November 27th .
You are encouraged to bring your own laptop , as Guillaume will walk us through the installation of Jazz and the creation of a simple application .
Note that Jazz should run on Windows * and* on systems featuring an X11 server .
Thanks to Marc Feeley , WiFi Internet access will be available at the meeting , which should help with the whole process .
Once everybody is up and going with the system , we 'll merrily go down the mountain to the pub and celebrate the release .
Everybody is welcome .
Please spread the news around and invite friends and colleagues .

2008 -11-06 - X11 Port and Debugger Update X11
I am very happy to report that X11 has progressed by leaps and bounds in the last weeks .
A big structural change to the windowing system where Jazz now manages everything inside the toplevel windows fixed nearly all the X11 problems .
This change has also unified profoundly the windowing architecture of all platforms so that all platforms should now evolve much more uniformly towards stability and completeness .

Personally , I have worked exclusively on X11 for the last 2 weeks and it felt almost as good as working under the Windows version .
The only things I missed where drag & drop ( we are looking into it ) and faster scrolling ( we are looking into using XCopyArea to implement fast scrolling on X11 ) .
There are other shortcomings like dialogs not being modal at the moment so that you can crash the system by being a smart ... and breaking the modality but those are no show - stoppers to use the system as - is imo .

The key feature that still needs work is X11 .
Unfortunately , the student who did the port now has less available time to spend on the project as his master 's degree is taking a lot of his resources .
We are still both working on X11 but it may take a while to complete .

We are still both working on X11 but it may take a while to complete .
Note that the port was advanced enough that the whole IDE was 90 % functional .
I would guess the work remaining to be around 2 - 3 weeks for someone both knowledgeable in X11 and in Jazz .
Personally I do not have the time required to delve into X11 but if anyone with good X11 knowledge wants to team up , it could be a fun project and accelerate the completion of the X11 port .
Just let me know .

2008 -02-04 - New build system fully implemented in Gambit Here 's a summary of the most important developments since the last update ( apart from a very nice Christmas vacation with my son :-) :
Build system A new build system was developed to automate Jazz building and deployment .
It follows the usual configure / make methodology and is fully implemented in Gambit making it highly portable .

The build will now create a ' jazz ' executable file that encapsulates the Jazz kernel .
Use this executable to load Jazz code , launch Jazz applications , ...
Under Unix , we are now using pkg-config to simplify building library depencies .
Package system A new package system was developed to manage resources uniformly accross the development and deployment stages of a project .

With it , Jazz applications can be deployed as compiled binaries , source files or as a mix of both .
Jazz will use a sha - 1 digest of the source file to automatically determine if a file should be loaded interpreted or compiled .
Generic methods Jazz now implements generic dispatch on an arbitrary number of parameters .

All jazz units have now been ported to the new kernel at least enough to load correctly .
Here 's a summary of the most important developments since the last update ( apart from a very nice Christmas vacation with my son :-) :
2007 - 11-11 - New Gambit based kernel now faster than the old C++ kernel !
A lot has happened since the last news update a month 1/2 ago .
Let me try and summarize the most important developments : Performance
As I was saying in the last message , performance was very critical as this stage as it was so far behind the old Jazz as to make the new one unusable .
The benchmark I have been using is editing Window .
jazz a big file with lots of syntax coloring necessitating a lot of sexpr navigation .
As every Lisp related tool must be able to navigate sexpr in text , those operations are so critical that in the old Jazz they where handcoded directly in C .
So keep in mind that in the benchmark results , it is handcoded C code vs Jazz code generating Gambit code .

New Jazz : 28.5s Old Jazz : 0.3sNew Jazz : 28.5s so 95 x slower .
so 95 x slower .
We are now at 0.17s so 167x faster than the first version and 60 % faster than the old handcoded C code .
Note that there is still a lot of room to make this much faster but now that performance is acceptable we are going to put performance aside for a while in favor of other priorities .

Note that Jazz as a whole does n't use the new type system a lot .
I 'd say that around 30 files out of Jazz 's 3000 + files use the new type system .
Annotating only those 30 something critical units resulted in huge performance improvements .
Also note that the type annotations are purely optional and removing any of them will not change any code semantics .

Mainly missing from the old Jazz IDE is debugging support .
We are still relying on the Gambit console .
Note that this is really not painful at all as the Jazz generated Scheme code is so close to the original code that reading a Gambit stack of Jazz code is almost identical as what a pure Jazz debugger stack would look like .

Everything that Jazz was redefining from Scheme was rethought / renamed so that now I am very happy to report that Jazz is now a full R5RS Scheme ( to be more precise : as R5RS as the underlying Scheme you are using is ) system where any R5RS Scheme code can be run as is inside a Jazz unit or module .

If pure Scheme is used inside a Jazz unit or module , the resulting code will have no overhead and will be the exact same code .
The Jazz module system will just validate at compile time that every symbol referenced exists in the underlying Scheme system and report any unresolved symbols .

Cross -Platform / X11
The Jedi IDE while not functional , is now booting completely under X11 !
What was astonishing was that nothing was working , and a couple changes later , Jeremie had a version where * everything * was rendering perfectly !
The port of the graphical code to Cairo really payed off there .
I am very happy about this new development , especially as Jeremie was able to pull this off part time while studying for his master 's degree .
Gratz !

The port of 100 + C++ classes to Gambit was very demanding at first but now the development has really become a joy .
Even though the start was difficult , developing the new kernel on Gambit 's extremely robust , fast and flexible architecture has now surpassed all my expentations in development speed and quality of code that could be developed with it .
Cheers to Gambit !

Next steps are : Complete the port
Optimize the new kernel to make it as fast as Gambit can be ( that 's fast ! )
Port the library and IDE to Mac and X11 ( this should be fairly fast at this point ) I expect a first beta , beginning of 2008 .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
If anyone sits at the intersection of Silicon Valley and Detroit , it is Shai Agassi , a software engineer turned supplier to the car industry .
Agassi left a top post at enterprise software company SAP ( SAP ) and in 2007 founded Better Place , which is building a network of charging and battery - switch stations for electric cars .
He spoke with Fortune 's Stephanie N. Mehta about the powerful combination of cars and technology .
What can car makers learn from their technology counterparts ?
The automotive industry has not been disrupted in 100 years .
If Henry Ford walked into a Ford ( F , Fortune 500 ) plant today , he 'd recognize the product and the manufacturing process .
Disruption is coming to the auto industry .
How will it change its business model ?
Technology companies know how to deal with disruption :
In tech , if your business is n't being disrupted , you disrupt it yourself .
Are there lessons from Detroit for the tech industry ?
I have a lot of respect for the auto manufacturers .
They make a product people live inside -- and can die inside -- so they are held to very high standards .
When software goes down for a minute , what 's the worst that happens ?
You lose a minute [ of productivity ] .
How is Better Place using information technology to help build better cars ?
Most of the operating systems in cars end up being the lowest - cost platform .
We wanted the best technology :
We wanted Intel 's Atom chips , Microsoft Windows Embedded , full Wi-Fi , and GPRS capabilities .
But why build such a sophisticated system for vehicles ?
It 's not as if I 'm going to do vector algebra in my car .
You can't have thousands of cars without good computers on the electric grid .
The software helps us figure out when to recharge your car :
It will learn that you drive your car to work every day and leave it in the parking lot until 6 p.m. , except on Tuesdays , when you leave at 4 p.m .
The computers can talk to our network and figure out the best time to recharge every car in the system .
Having a great operating system seems as if it would allow you to do other things too .
We think we can build applications for the cars that people will pay for , or that will differentiate our system .
Sort of like iTunes for the car .
CarTunes , perhaps ?

If the prosecutors appeal Friday ’s order , it could take months for judges to determine whether he should face trial on charges of diverting public money , which carry a maximum 10 - year jail sentence and a $ 210,000 fine .
One of Mr. Chirac ’s most prominent aides during his presidency , former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin , is in court defending himself against separate charges of planning a smear campaign in 2003 and 2004 to thwart the ambitions of Nicolas Sarkozy , a political rival who is now the president .

The charges against Mr. Chirac and nine other people relate to his years as mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995 .
He is accused of awarding contracts for fictitious positions as city advisers in return for political favors .
Public suspicion about his past followed him through his years as president .
Mr. Chirac was elected president in 1995 and remained in office until 2007 .
His position as president gave him constitutional immunity from prosecution , which fell away when he left office .
Preliminary embezzlement charges were filed soon afterward , but he denied them vigorously in a letter to the newspaper Le Monde in November 2007 .
“ Never were the resources of the city of Paris used for ambitions other than to benefit Parisians , ” the letter said .
“ Never was there personal enrichment .
Never was there a ‘ system . ’ ” Several aides to Mr. Chirac faced trial on corruption charges while the president was still in office , including former Prime Minister Alain Juppé , convicted in 2004 of party finance irregularities .
More recently , a Paris court last Tuesday ordered a three - year prison term for a former interior minister , Charles Pasqua , and a $ 562,000 fine for Jean - Christophe Mitterrand , son of former President François Mitterrand , for their involvement in illegal arms trafficking to Angola in the 1990s .
The Pope has been highly critical of the US Church 's handling of abuse cases A Catholic diocese based in the state of Delaware has filed for US bankruptcy protection on the eve of a civil trial involving high - profile sex abuse .
The move automatically delays the case , the seventh of its kind in the US since a scandal in Boston seven years ago .
The bishop of the diocese said the move offered the best chance for victims of sexual abuse to be treated fairly .
But an attorney for the victims said the action was a desperate attempt to hide the truth from the public .
The case , due to be heard on Monday , would have been the first to go to trial under a state law creating a two - year window allowing claims to be brought even if the statute of limitations had expired .
' Cover - up '
About 230,000 Catholics live in the Wilmington diocese , which covers Delaware and eastern Maryland .
" This is a painful decision , one that I had hoped and prayed I would never have to make , " Bishop W Francis Malooly said in a statement on the diocese 's website .
He said that talks with the eight victims bringing Monday 's case had broken down , and there were fears that too large a settlement would leave the diocese without sufficient resources to compensate another 133 people with outstanding claims .
" Filing for Chapter 11 [ bankruptcy protection ] offers the best opportunity , given finite resources , to provide the fairest possible treatment of all victims of sexual abuse by priests of our diocese , " he said .
But Thomas Neuberger , a lawyer representing 88 of the victims , said the purpose of the bankruptcy filing was to conceal " thousands of pages of scandalous documents " and vowed to contest the move .
" This filing is the latest , sad chapter in the diocese 's decades - long ' cover - up ' of these despicable crimes , to maintain the secrecy surrounding its responsibility and complicity in the sexual abuse of hundreds of Catholic children , " he said in a statement , the Associated Press news agency reported .
Wilmington is the seventh diocese to seek bankruptcy protection since an abuse scandal in Boston archdiocese in 2002 .
It has so far paid out $ 6.2 m ( £ 3.79 m ) to settle sexual abuse cases and has settled with other victims who did not go to court .
The largest pay - out to date was by the Los Angeles archdiocese , which settled 508 cases with $ 660 m in July 2007 .

Mississippi usually always tops the lists of poorest states in the USA .
In 2017 , New Hampshire had the lowest poverty rate and American Samoa had the highest poverty rate ( the highest poverty rate among the states was in Mississippi ) .
In 2012 , Mississippi was named the poorest state in the US , with a per capita income of $ 20,670 .
This makes a lot of people ask the question : why is Mississippi so poor ?
All of the problems of the Mississippi can be traced to the Delta .
If you excluded the Delta , Mississippi might be statistically insignificant as far as southern states in America can go .
The Delta was about the headquarter of American slavery .
The Delta has an extensive history , and most of the former slaves stayed back after gaining their freedom , and their descendants still live there till date .
The Mississippi Delta is situated at the center of the so called Black Belt .
Majority of the black people living there can trace their roots back to slave plantations that are probably close to where they live now .
Agriculture does n’t exactly make huge money and the rural areas where agriculture dominates generally are poorer .
Of course , Farmers can make good money , but the employees whom they hire actually work their farms do n’t .
The fact is these farmers tend to hire undocumented immigrants because they charge cheap fee for their labor .
A good example is the Delta .
Since farming has now become mechanized and automated , job opportunities have reduced for this farm workers .
Racism is another topic to talk about .
There is still racism in Mississippi , which can make getting ahead so difficult for poor blacks .
Despite all these , the Delta area has access to a lot of federal funding which they receive every year and has boost real income a little bit over the last 20 years .
Education is another factor to consider .
Education in Mississippi is very bad .
The students in the Delta who are able to get into college , they leave for another state and this contribute to the bad “ brain drain ” problem .
There are limited good jobs for people with education in the Delta .
When educated people are leaving a state , there would be a very big developmental void .
Educated and exposed people are needed to invest money , start business , or become licensed professionals .
Educated people rive local economy .
Corporations prefer areas that have huge talent pools – places such as Houston and Silicon Valley .
So there ’s no reason to move to Mississippi when it is located between economic friendly places like Texas and Atlanta .
Why Mississippi Is The Hungriest State In The Nation
Mississippi is seriously experiencing food insecurity .
For the past eight years , the state has been the hungriest state in the USA .
The state currently has 600,000 citizens and 20 % of the population in the state are considered to have food problem , including 1 in 4 children .
Estimates suggest that Mississippi would need $ 300,000,000 more every year to be able to meet the needs of the state .
The overall food insecurity is 22 % with 34 out of 82 counties more than 22 % food insecurity rate .
Mississippi also has the highest food insecurity rate at the country level .
Issaquena County tops the list with 40 % , while Jefferson County comes second at 36 % .
In the Hinds County , there are more people experiencing food insecurity than in the entire state of North Dakota .
Due to the lack of resources to be able to get food , Mississippi rural areas have a higher rate of food insecurity than in the urban areas .
Rural counties that are in the South with a population of 20,000 or more have a food insecurity rate of 18 % , while the urban counties in the Northeast have food insecurity rate of 10 % .
Counties with the highest food insecurity rate will also have high indicators of unemployment and poverty .
Even though they are already the hungriest state in the country , Mississippi is also considered the poorest of all states .
50 out of 82 counties in Mississippi are considered to be living in extreme poverty , which means they have a poverty rate of 20 % or more which they have maintained for over 30 years .
Having a consistent high poverty rate means that consumers cannot buy healthy food and are not likely to have a vehicle that can transport them to where they can buy the food .
For a lot of Mississippians , the easiest way to buy food on daily basis is to buy unhealthy junk foods at the local stores because grocery stores are not made available in the state .
Mississippians often eat cheap foods that have minimal nutritional value .
Issaquena County is an example of a place that has no grocery store .
SNAP is providing some help to people who are experiencing food scarcity , but it cannot provide much financial assistance .
It is usually very hard for citizen to be able to have access to SNAP benefits .
The eligibility requirements necessary to access SNAP in the state are very strict – more than in other states .
While a lot of other state require only interview , Mississippians must undergo an in - person interview .
So as to be able to receive benefits of SNAP , residents of Issaquena County will have to travel to neighboring counties to get food because they lack stores that accept the benefits .
Only 5 % of SNAP transactions by people living in Issaquena County occurred with the county .
There are just 4 grocery stores in Holmes County = , even though it is 765 square miles .
This means 1 in 4 residents travel up to 10 + miles to use SNAP benefits .
According to the United States Department of Agriculture in 2015 , only have of the population that have food stamps have access to transportation .
Due to the lack of transportation and money to buy a vehicle , counties in the state such as Issaquena experience serious economic loss because citizens have to redeem their snaps benefits outside their county .
The cutoff salary limits also makes attaining the benefits SNAP has to offer very difficult .
30 % of the citizens suffering from lack of food do not earn enough to qualify for SNAP benefits .
Accessing the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants , and Children ( WIC ) is also too difficult because Mississippi has state - run distribution centers instead of just giving themelectronic benefits transfer cards that can allow them to buy what they want at the grocery stores .
90 % of Mississippi ’s counties have only a distribution center , which is a great challenge for citizens who cannot afford transportation .
This then creates what is known as food desert , which is a term used a particular area has a poverty rate that is more than 20 % and more than 33 % of its residents living over a mile from the closest grocery store around .
Even though Mississippi has vast rural and agricultural areas , the residents are n’t receiving what the state has to offer them in terms of fresh foods .
As a matter of fact , 0 % of the food that Mississippians eat is imported , with most of the state ’s agricultural areas producing mainly cotton and soybeans .
The scarcity of healthy food causes high rates of deadly disease .
Health care in houses with lack of access to food is higher than in houses that have no food insecurity .
Mound Bayou , for instance is populated with only 1,500 people , but 44 % of the county ’s adult population is suffering from diabetes .
Healthcare.org reports that of all states in the country , Mississippi is the least healthy .
Mississippians who are among the marginalized racial and ethnic groups suffer most from food insecurity .
Like majority of the southern states , Mississippi still bears the scars that were cuased by slavery .
A National Book Award - winning author from Mississippi , Jesymn Ward summarized the problems that African Americans in the state go through in a piece she wrote for The Atlantic :
“ Racist sentiment is built into the fact that the state government squeezes the funds for public schools , which might technically be desegregated but remain very segregated because the whites who have the money send their children to private schools .
Built into the fact that Mississippi has the highest rate of child poverty in the nation and some of the lowest test scores .
Built into the fact that Medicaid provides health insurance for more than 50 % of children in the state and many senior citizens as well and yet our public officials repeatedly vote to deprive the program of resources , to shrink coverage . ”
The places in Mississippi that do not have access to food are likely to be have Hispanics , African Americans , and other ethnic groups has citizens .
61 % of the 670,000 recipients of SNAP in the state are African Americans .
31 of the 63 counties that lack food in Mississippi have over 40 % African Americans , and 22 % counties having 50 % African American population .
Counties such as Issaquena , Holmes , and Jefferson have population , in which one - third of the population are experiencing lack of food .
These populations are between 74 and 86 % African - American .
Being the state with the highest rate of poverty in the country , lack of access to certain benefits , lack of grocery stores , high health care costs , institutional racism that has negative effects on the marginalized racial groups , and the lack of nutritional food , we cannot but see why Mississippi has more food insecurity and higher rate of poverty than other states in the nation .

Dead Forests to Fuel Vehicles
September 15th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
Here ’s a resource we ’ll have plenty of as ever wider swathes of our forests get decimated by pests like the Pine Bark Beetle .
Dead trees .
In an adaptation eerily reminiscent of Thomas Edison ’s dictum
We live like squatters , not as if we owned the property ” a university has invented a technology to harvest one of the horrific effects of climate change .
The University of Georgia Research Foundation has developed an innovative way to turn dead trees into a liquid fuel and has licensed it to Tolero Energy in California .
We could be driving on our dead forests as soon as 2010 .
The technology represents a leap forward for the biofuels industry .
Not only does the resulting biofuel need no additional refinement before blending with diesel fuel , but it is a naturally very low - sulphur biofuel .
And it would prevent additional CO2 from being released if the forest was left to decay .
But the biggest leap is in thinking of using a non -food source ( at least for us humans ) of biomass that we will have an ever increasing abundance of , as our climate gets worse and worse .
And it does n’t take scarce water resources to grow .
Quite the contrary .
Droughts and rising temperatures are all it needs .
Dead trees are one of the major sources of waste biomass , says Tolero CEO Chris Churchill .
“ Infestations of the mountain pine beetle have devastated forests in the western United States and Canada , killing over 40 million acres of pine trees .
As the trees decompose and decay , they release millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere , and the devastation has created a significant and dangerous fire hazard in the western forests .
“ Harvesting dead trees and forest residue and converting them to renewable fuel and soil amendment products will help reduce the CO2 released into the atmosphere and reduce the fire danger .
The recent fire in the Los Angeles foothills , which was fueled by years of highly flammable dead biomass build - up , is a prime example of a situation where this technology can be put to use .
Tolero has the capability to establish pyrolysis facilities to process the dead underbrush and convert it to a renewable fuel that is easy to transport , ” Churchill said .
Lead inventor of the technology is Tom Adams , a retired member of the University of Georgia Faculty of Engineering .
Co-inventors are John Goodrum , Manuel Garcia - Perez , Dan Geller and Joshua Pendergrass – all presently or previously associated with the Faculty of Engineering there .
“ Fuel produced through this efficient technology , which uses dead biomass as the starting material , holds the promise of being highly economical , carbon - negative and environmentally acceptable , ” said Adams , now an engineering consultant .
Tolero will use this low - cost , on - site process to turn waste biomass into sustainable and renewable forms of energy and industrial products .
The biomass is heated at carefully controlled high temperatures in the absence of oxygen , a process known as fast pyrolysis .
The vapors produced during pyrolysis rapidly condense into a bio-oil that can be added to biodiesel or petroleum diesel .
Other pyrolysis by - products are gas and bio-char , which can be used as a soil amendment .
“ We are glad that our new business partner , Tolero , will be using biomass waste as starting material for the production of biodiesel , ” said Gennaro Gama , senior technology manager charged with the management of University of Georgia ’s bioenergy technologies .
“ Not only is this approach socially responsible , since it does not employ food crops as the source of biofuels , it also is ecologically sound , as it will open areas to reforestation and at the same time lead to the production of cost - efficient , sulfur - free fuels , ” he said .
“ This commercialization approach perfectly reflects the social and ecological concerns of UGA ’s bioenergy researchers and the research partnership formed with Tolero , ” Gama concluded .
If we had not invented the combustion engine , we would not have had the climate change that provides us this fuel byproduct of climate change for more combustion engines .
Kudos to the inventors at the University of Georgia and the biofuel company Tolero .
We have been dealt lemons .
They are making lemonade .

KNOCKOUT : David Tua lands the final blows of the fight on Shane Cameron .
The Tuamanator is back - big time !
David Tua re-ignited his international boxing career and left some serious doubts hanging over Shane Cameron 's competitive future with a stunning win in the heavyweight contest in Hamilton on Saturday night .
Tua knocked Cameron down three times - twice in the first round and finally just seven seconds into the second round for a stunning knockout victory .
On an emotional night when Howard Morrison jnr sang the national anthem in honour of his recently deceased father , Maori entertainment legend Sir Howard , and the victims of the Samoan tsunami that included an aunt of Tua were also recognised , Tua let loose with no lack of fury .
Cameron had no answers at all to the power of Tua who produced another of his trademark early decisions .
His left hook was dynamite but his combination work was just as impressive .
The win was Tua 's 50th in professional fights against three losses and a draw .
Coming after a two - year lay - off and his second comeback during a turbulent period out of the ring where he has fought for his fortunes in the courts , Tua must now be considered a real chance to pick up his well - earned reputation in the United States as a serious contender amongst a thin layer of top - tier heavyweights .
He has snared Cameron 's WBO Oriental and Asian - Pacific belts but it will be more interesting and undoubtedly more valuable to see what the win does for his international rankings .
Even at the age of 37 Tua might still have enough time to earn another crack at a world title .
He certainly appears to still have the goods to do the business .
Taunted by Cameron as a fat old man who was past his best , Tua 's response was predictably brutal .
Both boxers earned $ 500,000 for a fight where the pay cheques were the only even things between them .
The result will leave Cameron with plenty to ponder .
At 31 he is young in professional terms for this division .
But having earned his stripes on a diet of nobodies he is now left contemplating his second defeat in 25 fights .
But more importantly this fight always loomed as a major test for him in terms of stepping up to another class of opponent .
There will be no calls for a rematch .
But the sticky situation Tua is in with a low - budget Maori TV deal covering his next three fights in New Zealand , means his future here might be limited .
It 's on to bigger and brighter things for the South Auckland Samoan .
" I 'd like to thank Shane for giving me the opportunity to do what I like doing tonight , " said Tua .
" It was very important in every way .
I have lost a lot of weight and some people said I had lost my speed and power as well .
" It 's not a comeback it 's a continuation .
It 's always great to come back and fight in New Zealand .
It means the world to me . "
Tua joked he was going to go to Burger King and then go to sleep .
Undercard :
Light Middleweight : Steve Chur Heremaia ( NZ ) vs Frank Lo Porto ( AUS ) - Six round decision to Heremaia .
Cruiserweight : Max Alexander The Great v Aloryi Moyoyo Mensah ( Ghana ) - Six round decision to Mensah .
Heavyweight : Daniel The Doberman Ammann ( Aus ) v Lawerence Tauasa ( NZ ) - Six round decision to Ammann .
Light Heavyweight : Shane Chapman v Soulan Pownceby - Technical draw after 3rd round accidental head but .
Heavyweight : John Hopoate v Colin Kid Coal Miner Wilson - Fourth round KO to Wilson .
HSBC earned more than £ 650 m in fees from work for Textron , US manufacturer of cluster weapons
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday 6 November 2009
We reported that HSBC earned a total of £ 657.3 m in profits for bank services provided to Textron , a US industrial firm that makes cluster bombs .
In fact , the figure was in dollars and was not a profit : HSBC underwrote $ 657.3 m in Textron share and bond offerings .
The bank is not disclosing the profits made from these services or from the lending of $ 150 m to Textron .
The deadly trade in cluster bombs is funded by the world 's biggest banks who have loaned or arranged finance worth $ 20 bn ( £ 12.5 bn ) to firms producing the controversial weapons , despite growing international efforts to ban them .
HSBC , led by ordained Anglican priest Stephen Green , has profited more than any other institution from companies that manufacture cluster bombs .
The British bank , based at Canary Wharf , has earned a total of £ 657.3 m in fees arranging bonds and share offerings for Textron , which makes cluster munitions described by the US company as " leaving a clean battlefield " .
Campaigners maintain the deadly weapons can explode years after combat , killing or maiming innocent people .
HSBC will face protests outside its London headquarters today .
Goldman Sachs , Bank of America , JP Morgan and UK - based Barclays Bank are also named among the worst banks in a detailed 126 - page report by Dutch and Belgian campaign groups IKV Pax Christi and Netwerk Vlaanderen .
Goldman Sachs , the US bank which made £ 3.19 bn proft in just three months , earned $ 588.82 m for bank services and lent $ 250 m to Alliant Techsystems and Textron .
Of the banks named , only Barclays was prepared to comment .
It said : " Barclays group provides financial services to the defence sector within a specific policy framework .
It is our policy not to finance trade in nuclear , chemical , biological or other weapons of mass destruction .
" Our policy also explicitly prohibits financing trade in landmines , cluster bombs or any equipment designed to be used as an instrument of torture . "
A spokeswoman added that Barclays had supplied money to Textron , which makes cluster bombs , but that the US firm was a broad - based weapons manufacturer .
Last December 90 countries , including the UK , committed themselves to banning cluster bombs by next year .
But the US was not one of them .
So far 23 countries have ratified the convention .
The UK has yet to do so , but the Foreign Office confirmed that it would form part of the government 's legislative programme before the next election .
A Foreign Office spokesman said the tightest export control order had been placed on cluster bombs , which extended to banks supplying money to manufacturers .
The government was aware the control order was not working and " is working on it " .
Esther Vandenbroucke , of Netwerk Vlaanderen and one of the report 's authors , said : " The responsibility to ban cluster munitions is a shared responsibility .
It requires courage , and it requires an effort .
We are just months away from an international treaty entering into force and it is time for signatory states to the Convention on Cluster Munitions for non-signatory states and for financial institutions to act now . "
Last December , the New Zealand government 's pension fund sold shares in Lockheed Martin because of its link to the manufacture of cluster bombs .
Similar actions have been taken by the Irish and Dutch governments .
Millions of people will be endangered by up to tens of millions of cluster bomblets that have not yet exploded , causing lasting economic and social harm to communities in more than 20 countries for decades to come , campaigners have warned .
The vast majority of cluster bomb casualties occur while victims are carrying on their daily lives .
On Monday , a Lebanese 20 - year - old man had his leg amputated after a cluster bomb exploded in southern Lebanon Houla village .
A security source said he was collecting wood in his border village when the explosion occurred .
The Israeli army made extensisve use of cluster bombs during the war in south Lebanon three years ago .
Cluster bombs were most recently used by both the Georgians and the Russians in the dispute over South Ossetia .
They were also used in the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions .

Ark Tribe is a building worker .
He and other unionists held a lunchtime meeting over safety issues .
They drafted their concerns on hand towels and took industrial action .
The safety concerns were eventually addressed .
Enter Kevin Rudd ’s Australian Building and Construction Commission .
This Spanish Inquisition wanted to know what the unionists had discussed at the lunchtime meeting .
They demanded Ark attend a hearing to tell them what the workers discussed .
He refused .
It is an offence to refuse to attend ABCC hearings or to refuse to answer their questions .
The penalty is six months jail .
What is the ABCC ?
John
Howard set up this draconian body to smash the building unions , almost the last vestige of any militancy in unions in Australia .
The building industry is a brutal one .
Unions have won better wages and conditions , and better safety , only through a long history of industrial action against the bastard bosses .
Labor ’s Workchoices Lite has kept the ABCC .
From 1 February 2010 Labor ’s ABCC will be called the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate .
Changing a body ’s name does n’t change its functions .
Julia Gillard paints this anti-union body as an attack on ‘ thuggery ’ in the building industry .
Here is what our ‘ left - wing ’ the deputy Labor Prime Minister said :
The Rudd government is determined to encourage lawful behaviour and a change in the culture of the building and construction industry .
This is exactly the argument John Howard used .
The Cole Royal Commission recommended setting up the ABCC to quash this supposed ‘ lawlessness ’ .
It recommended prosecutions begin .
And how many successful Cole prosecution have there been of unionists ?
None .
How could that be ?
Because it ’s all rubbish .
If there was all this lawlessness and thuggery the police would be all over it .
They are n’t and there is n’t .
The ABCC ’s real task is to stop strikes .
Gillard spelled this out when she said :
The Rudd government ’s new Fair Work
Act ensures that industrial disputes are governed by clear , tough rules .
Under Fair Work , industrial action will only be protected during bargaining and if it has been authorised by a mandatory secret ballot .
Under Rudd Labor , strikes are illegal unless they occur in certain limited circumstances of the type Gillard has outlined .
The building unions ’ long history of industrial action to defend lives and jobs , and win better wages , would threaten the whole edifice of strike suppression both the Liberals and Labor support .
So the ABCC has draconian powers , not to stop non-existent thuggery , but to stop strikes .
This means building workers now often do n’t take action over safety .
In the year before the ABCC was set up there were no deaths on sites in Victoria .
Last year there were ten .
The ABCC is part of a wider ongoing Government attack on workers and their right to strike .
Unions have meekly paid millions upon millions in fines for striking ( often wildcats over safety . )
So we have fines and jail for workers undertaking a basic human right , the right to strike .
In 1969 a group of 27 left wing unions went on strike across the country to have Clarrie O’Shea , jailed by John Kerr over fines , released from jail .
He was , and the penal powers became a dead letter .
The bosses were too afraid to use them .
We might be heading for another showdown .
As Dave Noonan , head of the building workers ’ union , the CFMEU , said :
If someone is jailed under these laws , there will be mass industrial action .
The peak trade union body , the ACTU , has given verbal support .
But to defeat these laws may require more than building workers shutting down the industry .
Even now it is not clear that the leadership of the CFMEU is really prepared to even go that far on this , but the pressure from their rank and file may hopefully be forcing them to threaten industrial action .
The demonstrations on 30 October when Ark appeared before the magistrates court were a good first step in the fight for the right to strike .
( The hearing was postponed to 18 December , the beginning I believe of the building industry 6 week shut down over Christmas . )
The demonstrations are only the first step .
The issue is too important to leave in the hands of the trade union leadership .
It has to be the rank and file running this to take the struggle forward and prevent only a tokenistic response to the possible jailing of Ark .
If the ABCC and their Labor masters can get away with jailing Ark and beating the CFMEU we face a prolonged period of reaction in Australia and the complete dominance of capital over labour in not only the building industry but every industry in Australia .
Is the rank and file prepared to push the struggle for the right to strike all the way , and bring in members of other unions on and off building sites across Australia ?
If so , we could see a re-run of 1969 , with Rudd ’s anti-union laws destroyed .
If not then Ark and many others who will surely follow should get ready for 6 months in jail for talking about industrial action .
When these difficult situations arise , you need to have the confidence that the attorney with whom you are working has the capability and commitment necessary to truly help you .
In the course of our lives , there are unforeseen circumstances and situations that we know we need to prepare for — ones that call for experienced legal guidance and advocacy .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I already commented on this Mukasey piece – but I wanted to follow up and make clear why this piece from a well - respected “ conservative ” demonstrates how far the conservative movement , the right wing , and the Republican Party have fallen .
First , it ’s important to note Mukasey ’s position under Bush – as the chief proponent and custodian of our justice system .
Second , one should remember that he was long considered a moderate in the party .
Yet Mukasey literally blames September 11 on American values , on the American justice system :
[ W ]e put our vaunted civilian justice system on display in these [ previous terrorism ] cases …
In return , we got the 9/11 attacks and the murder of nearly 3,000 innocents ….
Or , as the subhead put it :
We tried the first World Trade Center bombers in civilian courts .
In return we got 9/11 and the murder of nearly 3,000 innocents .
This is not a conservative approach to the issue .
It is a radical one .
The accumulated wisdom of our forerunners is thrown out the window in the favor of a shiny , new and “ improved ” justice system .
And even worse the barratuve being built is clearly unhinged from reality .
Its only purpose seems to be the same as Cheney ’s – to preemptively politicize the aftermath of the next attack .
Reading his argument analytically , it ’s hard to see how he reaches the conclusion he does regarding the American justice system .
The list of deficiencies are all manageable – perhaps with some tweaks – within our legal system .
Perhaps they suggest we should try a system of national security courts .
But Mukasey concludes instead that they necessitate throwing out our values and the institutions which represent the accumulated wisdom of our democracy .
This leap comes from the narrative .
The rationale Mukasey offers is deeper than any of the actual facts he cites – and is emotional rather than logical .
For him , September 11 happened because our justice system does n’t work against terrorism .
It is an argument parallel to Cheney ’s – that September 11 happened because we were weak – and as a result of this mindset , Cheney set out demonstrating our strength by bullying other nations , withdrawing from treaties , avoiding multilateral institutions , invading Iraq , avoiding the Middle East peace processes , refusing to talk to our adversaries , labeling them evil .
But in each case , despite the emotional “ logic , ” the narrative itself is unhinged from reality .
The fact that a “ moderate ” in the Republican Party has been so radicalized demonstrates how far from common sense the right wing movement has fallen .

People who use public WiFi to make iPhone calls or conduct video conferences take heed :
It just got a lot easier to monitor your conversations in real time .
At a talk scheduled for Saturday at the Toorcon hacker conference in San Diego , two security researchers plan to show the latest advances in the open - source UCSniff tool for penetrating voice - over - internet - protocol systems .
With a few clicks of a mouse , they will eavesdrop on a call between two audience members using popular iPhone applications that route the calls over the conference network .
For more than a year , UCSniff has provided everything a hacker needs to plug a laptop into a network and within seconds begin intercepting VoIP transmissions .
But until now , the program has allowed eavesdroppers to reassemble the conversations only after they were concluded , a limitation that was far from the elite bugging capabilities shown in Mission Impossible and other spy thrillers .
" As the private call is in progress , we can see and hear what is happening , " said Jason Ostrom , a developer of UCSniff and director of Viper Labs , the research arm of security firm Sipera Systems .
" There 's real - time violation of confidentiality . "
In addition to monitoring voice conversations as they happen , UCSniff can also bug video conferences in real time .
Ostrom said he and fellow Viper Labs researcher Arjun Sambamoorthy plan to show those capabilities at Toorcon as well .
With the proliferation of iPhones and other smartphones , plenty of businesses and individuals have sought to save money on roaming charges by routing calls over the internet instead of over carrier networks .
Adam Boone , a vice president at Sipera , said one large , unnamed client logs more than 1 million minutes per month in such VoIP calls .
The problem , he added , is that many of the iPhone apps for VoIP calls do n't provide encryption capabilities , making the conversations ripe for eavesdropping .
( Sipera plans to unveil a new product to protect such users next week ) .
No doubt , traffic traveling over unsecured networks has always been vulnerable to snoops .
UCSniff just streamlines their work by bundling a hodgepodge of tools that previously were only available piecemeal .
It turns any laptop into a man - in - the - middle node .
A VLAN hopper then traverses the virtual local area network until it accesses the part that carries VoIP calls .
UCSniff automatically injects spoofed address resolution protocol packets into the network , allowing all voice and video traffic to be routed to the laptop .
Ostrom said the tool is designed to help penetration testers quickly assess the security of clients ' networks and to help security providers to stay abreast of the latest attacks .
" If we can do this , there are many , many people out there who can do this .
It 's not rocket science , " he said .
" The end game here is to help them improve their products , to know what types of attacks can happen so they can build security features into their products . " ®
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D ) are now calling on their state 's judicial review board to oust a judge who refused earlier this month to perform an interracial marriage .
Keith Bardwell , a justice of the peace in local Tangipahoa Parish , has captured headlines -- and national attention -- after refusing to marry local residents Beth Humhprey and Terence McKay out of " concern ... for the children , " he explained in a recent interview .
" I 'm not a racist , " Bardwell stressed last week .
" I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house . "
The judge 's defense , however , has hardly swayed some of his state 's top lawmakers , who are enraged by his decision .
On Friday , both Jindal and Landrieu separately called for an investigation into the judge 's conduct -- and asked for his prompt removal from the bench .
The governor in his statement charged the judge 's action was discriminatory and said it constituted a " violation of constitutional rights and federal and state law . "
“ Disciplinary action should be taken immediately — including the revoking of his license , ” Jindal added .
Landrieu concurred with the governor .
“ Not only does his decision directly contradict Supreme Court rulings , it is an example of the ugly bigotry that divided our country for too long , ” she explained .
The Louisiana Judiciary Committee , however , has not indicated whether it will in any way sanction Bardwell for his conduct .
Investigations are confidential until the panel recommends action to the state 's Supreme Court , its spokesperson told the Shreveport Times .
Meanwhile , the Obama administration too has signaled its dissatisfaction with the incident .
Although press spokesman Bill Burton would not say on Friday whether the president agrees with the heightened calls for Bardwell 's ouster , he did note : “ I ’ve found that actually the children of biracial couples can do pretty good . ”
Programs that allow homeowners to trade in their old refrigerators and scoop up a rebate — a sort of “ cash for clunkers ” system for the fridge — are spreading quickly across the country .
Last week , New Jersey began a statewide program that offers residents a $ 30 rebate by recycling eligible refrigerators or freezers .
Old refrigerators and freezers in Vermont also fetch $ 30 , under a program begun last month .
Pickup is free in both states .
National Grid began a similar program in June , in Rhode Island and Massachusetts .
These programs target old refrigerators and freezers — the type often found in garages and basements — because they use substantially more electricity than those built after the introduction of federal efficiency standards .
Sam Sirkin , the program development manager of Jaco Environmental , a refrigerator and freezer recycler , said that his company now works with 45 utilities in 21 states , up from about 15 utilities in 10 states three years ago .
The recent flurry of new programs in New England stems in part from the recent introducton of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative , a Northeastern program that caps greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to combat climate change , as well as from energy efficiency initiatives in individual states , according to Mr. Sirkin .
Utilities commonly estimate that homeowners can save up to $ 150 a year on their electricity bill by dumping their old refrigerator or freezer .
Old refrigerators , made prior to 1990 , also use three times as much electricity as new ones , the utilities say .
In addition , refrigerators made before the mid-1990s may also emit ozone - depleting chlorofluorocarbons .
“ Avoiding the release of the C.F.C. ’s in fridges captures five tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per fridge , and just removing the old refrigerator or freezer from the grid saves another two to five tons of carbon dioxide due to energy savings , ” said Mr. Sirkin .
As part of the Vermont program , Jaco Environmental will reuse about 95 percent of the appliances ’ contents , including foam insulation ( which is burned , and its heat used to generate electricity ) , according to Mr. Sirkin .
Steel and plastic may end up in new products like cars or refrigerators , and the tempered glass shelving may wind up in asphalt or helping to aerate some potting soils .
“ This program saves energy , saves money both for the utility and the consumer , and also saves the environment , ” said Carol Tucker , a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power .
Her utility offers a low income refrigerator exchange program in addition to a standard refrigerator turn - in and recycle program .

CHICAGO – “ This is an embarrassing day for the city of Chicago , ” declared Guadalupe Perez a striking Congress Hotel worker at an Oct. 26 action honoring the strike .
“ This is now the longest hotel strike in US history .
For over 6 years the Congress has brought this city down .
But we ’ll be here for as long as it takes to get justice . ”
The Congress Hotel strike officially surpassed the Frontier Hotel strike in Las Vegas that lasted 6 years , 4 months and 10 days and ended Feb. 1 , 1998 .
Workers went on strike after the Congress unilaterally broke with the master agreement between the union and city hotels and imposed a lower wage scale .
“ The torch has been passed from one group of heroic workers in our union to another group of heroes , ” declared John Wilhelm , Unite Here international president , the union representing the Congress strikers .
Veteran union members of the Frontier strike brought solidarity greetings and praised the strikers for their courage .
Joe Daugherty , now president of Unite Here Local 24 in Detroit , told the Congress strikers , “ while it ’s a long time it ’s a short time in the fight for justice . ”
“ You never know when you will make history , ” said Gloria Hernandez of Unite Here Local 165 in Las Vegas .
“ They know they ca n’t defeat us when we ’re together .
This is the only way they ’ll respect us .
You ’re fighting for the future of Chicago and the next generation . ”
As strikers , hotel workers and their supporters marked the occasion , others prepared to take a strike vote in response to demands for concessions by big hotel corporations .
Under light rain , hotel workers and their supporters took the “ tour of crummy employers ” down Michigan Avenue past the Hilton , Blackstone and ended at the Congress Hotel .
Union contracts covering over 6000 workers at 30 downtown hotels expired on August 31 .
Three major hotel corporations employ most : Hyatt , Hilton and Starwood .
Workers at five hotels are taking strike votes .
Hitting hard at the greed of hotel owners , Unite Here Local 1 President Henry Tamarin said , “ We ’re not going to settle for standing still , we wo n’t move back either .
We ’re only moving forward . ”
“ Malos , mucho malos , ( bad ones , very bad ones ) ” cried the crowd in reference to the greedy hotels .
The Hilton Hotel is one of the big chains driving wage - and - benefit concessions .
They are using the economic crisis to cut jobs and demand concessions in health care benefits and impose speed up .
But when economic times were better they were just as stingy .
“ The Hilton is not making this any easier , ” said Eddie Simms , a worker at the Hilton Hotel .
“ Each day I feel like fighting somebody .
I know what I have to do and each of us has to fight and not give up . ”
Like the Boston Hyatt Hotel , the Hilton wants to subcontract out parts of their operation to lower paid workers .
But shop steward Sherry Stevenson said workers are fighting any subcontracting along with the proposal for a five - year contract with no raise for the first 2 years .
The workers led by Unite Here have fought hard to raise wages and benefits in the hospitality industry in Chicago .
Average housekeeper wages have risen from $ 8.83 an hour in 2002 to $ 14.60 today .
What galls the workers is the hotels are making profits even in the economic downturn .
In the last three months , hotel company stocks have soared 20 - 30 % .
On Oct. 22 , Starwood ( which operates some of the hotels taking the strike vote ) announced profits of $ 180 million for the first three quarters of 2009 .
Evidently , these profits are not big enough for greedy hotel owners , say the workers .
The protesters moved on to the Blackstone Hotel , a landmark that had been closed but was refurbished and re-opened with $ 47 million of taxpayer money .
The hotel showed its gratitude by resisting a union organizing drive and after the union won by refusing to settle on a contract .
The Blackstone fired Renee Walker for her strong union support .
“ They ‘ laid off ’12 workers from the Room Service Department , ” Walker told the People ’s World .
“ We were the strongest union supporters .
They said it was because the economy was bad .
Then they had a job fair to hire our replacements and none of us were considered .
We were essentially fired . ”
Walker and her co-workers have filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission ( EEOC ) against the Blackstone to regain their jobs .
“ We ’re going to continue to fight , ” said Walker .
Imelda Martinez embodies the connection between the Congress strike and the fight at the other hotels .
Martinez has been on strike at the Congress Hotel and now works at the Sheraton Hotel as a housekeeper , where a strike vote is being taken .
“ Right now , two hotels are trying to cut my benefits and my rights .
Today more than ever we have to fight .
We ’ll continue fighting in the path of Cesar Chavez and for wage and benefit justice .
I am not afraid . ”

As the White House “ debates ” its Afghan options , are we hearing a balanced media presentation on the issues ?
Or are many media outlets doing what they did before and during the invasion of Iraq , the details of which I documented in my books Embedded , When News Lies , and my film WMD .
Have they learned anything ?
The answer has to be no way .
On Friday night , there was Charlie Rose advising us that he would soon interview his “ friend ” Michael Moore , as friendly and supportive an interview as I have every seen .
It was amusing to see Charlie concurring in an attack on Capitalism given that he is a frequent host at every major corporate meeting and “ friend ” to every CEO .
Only it was preceded by a half hour of let ’s escalate in Afghanistan spiels by two “ experts ” –one an Australian counter - insurgency advisor and former aide to General Petraeus , the other a Boston - based academic / expert / war booster — who could n’t agree with each other more than more troops were the only solution .
On Sunday morning , Meet the Press did its usual Hawkish thing — just a few days after David Gregory , all 6 ’ 7 inches of him schmoozed on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart .
He offered up four guests , two ex Generals and two Senators , one a Democrat and the other a Republican , saying pretty much the same thing .
We are in Afghanistan to stay , A British General was even quoted to the effect that they will there for about another 40 years , confirming Dick Cheney ’s LONG WAR theory .
No real critic there .
And then the New York Times , I will let Jeremy Scahill tell you about their latest crime against fairness :
“ The ‘ paper of record ’ complains that Robert Greenwald ’s film is unbalanced with no ‘ sympathy ’ for pro-war views .
Horrors !
“ Perhaps more than any other major corporate news outlet , The New York Times played a central role in promoting the Bush administration ’s fraudulent case for the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
The “ reporting ” of Judith Miller and Michael Gordon basically served as a front - page fiction laundering factory for Dick Cheney ’s fantasy of a “ mushroom cloud ” threat from Saddam Hussein looming on the immediate horizon , topped off with a celebratory slice of yellowcake .
More recently , the paper ’s propagandists , William Broad and David Sanger , have aimed their sights on reporting dubious claims about Iran ’s nuclear program .
Readers of the Times , therefore , should take with a huge grain of weaponized salt the paper ’s “ review ” of Robert Greenwald ’s new documentary , Rethink Afghanistan .
With no sense of the painful irony of writing such jibberish in the Times , reviewer Andy Webster declares that the film could “ use balance , something in short supply here : ”
At an almost breathless pace that leaves little room for reflection , Mr. Greenwald presents a flurry of sights , voices and figures , many of them compelling but all reflecting his point of view .
A historical summary is fleeting .
What appears , again and again , are terrifying images of children : dead , hideously maimed or , in one instance , almost put up for sale by a frantic civilian in a refugee camp .
Military engagements , it seems , are messy and claim innocent lives .
If it takes Greenwald ’s “ point of view ” to see the human costs of the U.S. war in Afghanistan in the form of deformed , maimed and dead civilians , then his film should be required viewing for anyone purporting to support the war .
Anyone who has actually seen the film knows that a string of former top intelligence officials , perhaps most significant among them the former head of the CIA ’s Counter - terrorism Center , Robert Grenier , are heard meticulously deconstructing the dominant justifications for the continued U.S. military presence in Afghanistan .
What does Grenier know ?
Oh , he was just the CIA station chief in Islamabad , Pakistan , where he was one of the Agency ’s top officials planning the U.S. invasion .

HIS MASTER ’S VOICE : BECK OPENS FIRE ON MEDIA REFORM , BOB MCCHESNEY AND FREE PRESS
Mark Crispin Miller writes :
Here ’s a little masterpiece of red-baiting , as Glenn Beck goes after Bob McChesney and Free Press ( a “ Marxist group ” ) , as well as Mark Lloyd and FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski–all of them , says Beck , conspiring with Obama to snuff the First
Amendment and install a communist dictatorship :
WATCH THE JOE MCCARTHY REVIVAL ANDBECK’S BROADSIDE
It would take a lot of time , and space , to deal with all the lies , half - truths and distortions in this diatribe .
And why bother ?
No -one with half a brain buys anything that Glenn Beck says , while his rapt audience buys everything he says no matter what .
In any case , this shot at Bob McChesney and Free Press is actually good news –because it makes clear that the owners of the media cartel are scared to death of media reform ; and they have every reason to be scared , because the vast majority of Americans would back a tough reformist program in a heartbeat .
Beck can slime McChesney all he wants .
The fact is that whenever Bob , or Mark Lloyd , or John Nichols , or I myself , or any other activist for democratic media reform goes out and talks to living , breathing citizens about this subject , what always brings the house down is the notion that we need to cut Big Media down to size , through radical trust - busting above all .
Such is the response in the Kiwanis Clubs and churches just as it is on “ humanistic ” college campuses .
Nobody likes Time - Warner , Disney , News Corp. or GE as such , just as nobody really likes the crap that those huge players keep churning out–as the declining sales throughout the culture industries make very clear .
If Clear Channel could no longer own 900 radio stations , would there be furious protesters in the streets ?
Would people rally to defend the cable companies ’ monopolies ?
Would there be any grass - roots opposition to free , nationwide wireless Internet access ?
Let ’s remember that , when Michael Powell , Bush / Cheney ’s FCC chair , tried to make it even easier for one company to gobble up the lion ’s share of TV / radio stations , cable systems , newspapers , etc. , the national grass - roots “ NO ! ” was mammoth and
ideologically diverse , including both the NRA and NOW , and Brent Bozell along with Norman Lear .
So it ’s good news that Glenn Beck is trying to cast the effort to democratize our media system as a blow against the First Amendment –because it tells us that his overlords are terrified that their long death - grip on our free speech can be broken , once the people learn the truth about real media reform .

Carter Claims There Is " Racist " Tone Against Obama
In an interview with NBC's Brian Williams , former President Jimmy Carter said he has been extremely bothered by the heightened climate of racial and other hate speech since the election of President Barack Obama .

Businesses are taking more control of workers ' 401 ( k ) s , retreating from the 30 - year experiment with employees running their own accounts .

The White House has landed another big Republican voice in support of sweeping health care legislation : Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California .
With the health care legislation headed for debate on the floors of both chambers of Congress , the Obama administration has stepped up efforts to win support from Republicans away from Capitol Hill , where G.O.P. lawmakers are overwhelmingly opposed to the legislation .
In his statement , Mr. Schwarzenegger did not endorse any specific version of the legislation .
But he noted his own efforts at improving the health care system in California and urged bipartisan cooperation at the national level .
Here ’s his statement :
As governor , I have made significant efforts to advance health reform in California .
As the Obama administration was launching the current debate on health care reform , I hosted a bipartisan forum in our state because I believe in the vital importance of this issue , and that it should be addressed through bipartisan cooperation .
“ Our principal goals , slowing the growth in costs , enhancing the quality of care delivered , improving the lives of individuals , and helping to ensure a strong economic recovery , are the same goals that the president is trying to achieve .
I appreciate his partnership with the states and encourage our colleagues on both sides of the political aisle at the national level to move forward and accomplish these vital goals for the American people .
In lining up Republicans to support legislative action on health care this year , the White House is using a strategy similar to one it employed during debate over the economic stimulus plan earlier this year .
Moving to bypass Republican opponents in Congress , the administration reached out to governors , many of whom stepped up in support .
On Monday , Tommy Thompson , the former health and human services secretary in the Bush administration , one - time Republican presidential candidate and former governor of Wisconsin , issued a statement expressing similar support for health care legislation this year .
So did a former Republican — and now an Independent — Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City .
The " stick " has flown .
The 100 m - tall , super - slim Ares 1 - X rocket has completed its demonstration mission .
Time will now tell whether this event was a giant leap on the road to a new astronaut launch system or just a spectacular side - show .
Nasa wants to use the fully developed Ares 1 to propel its next - generation crewship into orbit , and expects the rocket to be flying in 2015 .
A White House advisory panel has suggested otherwise [ PDF 7 Mb ] .
It doubts Ares can be made to fly before 2017 , and has pointed to potentially easier and cheaper options for getting humans into low - Earth orbit .
Wednesday 's launch may not have advanced Ares ' cause , but it will not have harmed it either .
The flight went ahead after a series of frustrating " no go " calls from weather officers .
Conditions had seemed benign enough except for some persistent high cloud .
The concern was that if the vehicle had climbed through this cloud , a build - up of static might have interfered with radio signals sent to and from the rocket .
If the flight had gone wrong for some reason and the vehicle had begun to veer out of control , this " triboelectric effect " could have interfered with a command to destroy the rocket .
The risks associated with a maiden flight are always higher than with a proven vehicle and so nothing could be left to chance .
The 1 - X had an explosive charge running the full length of the booster and officials at the spaceport would not have hesitated in using it if required to do so .
As we now know , the weather finally obliged towards the end of the launch window and the Ares 1 - X was given a " go " for 1530 GMT .
The 1 - X uses the same booster technology ( with modifications ) that helps lift the space shuttle off the launch pad .
The higher thrust - to - weight ratio of the slender 1 - X meant of course that its departure from terra firma had a little more zip about it .
Everything appeared to go pretty much to plan : a two - minute powered flight to more than 130,000 ft ( 45 km ) , with the vehicle moving at almost five times the speed of sound .
Separation of the booster from the upper part of the rocket occurred right on cue .
The booster was flipped by thrusters to slow it , and it fell towards the ocean , deploying a new parachute system during the descent .
The team sent to recover the booster from the water also tried out a method of retrieval not previously used to salvage the shuttle 's discarded motors .
One point of note was the way the upper part of the 1 - X - a physical simulation of what the top of an Ares 1 should look like - appeared to start its tumble motion earlier than expected .
All of the immediate goals do seem to have been achieved .
But it will take months for engineers to assess the data returned by the more - than - 700 sensors on the 1 - X .
The demonstrator was intended to help verify design assumptions so that when the Ares 1 proper is built , everyone can be confident it will fly as expected .
Which brings us back to the " big question " : will the Ares 1 actually be developed ?
This is one only President Barack Obama can answer .
He also has to find a budget to support whatever solution he proposes to get US astronauts into space once the shuttle is retired .
His expert panel has told him that $ 3bn a year extra is needed by Nasa to do anything " meaningful " in the realm of human spaceflight .
The weeks ahead in Washington are sure to be fascinating .
The lobbying will be intense , and Congress is sure to want to have a say .
I know science reporters like myself are usually given the " space beat " in the mainstream media , but I 'm very aware that the decision which has to be taken is not a scientific one .
It 's a political one ; and given the size of the US space sector , it has major economic considerations .
Many thousands of jobs will hang on President Obama 's Ares deliberations .
Watch this space .
Supporters say the vending machine ban would " change history "
The removal of cigarettes from public display is a step closer after MPs said vending machines should be banned and shops should keep stocks out of sight .
MPs supported a backbench amendment to outlaw cigarette vending machines in England , Wales and Northern Ireland .
Scotland has its own separate bill .
The vending machine amendment to the government 's Health Bill was passed by the Commons without going to a vote .
Health campaigners welcomed the step , calling it a " brave move " .
The bill passed its third reading and will now go before the House of Lords .
This is the nanny state gone mad
Conservative MP Philip Davies
The vending machine ban was proposed by the former Labour minister Ian McCartney , who said it would " change history " .
Mr McCartney said vending machines gave young children access to cigarettes and condemned them as an " outrageous loophole in our country 's safeguards " against tobacco .
He said tobacco was still " the only product in Britain that can be sold legally , which routinely kills and injures its customers " .
The Conservatives had questioned the wisdom of banning shops from putting cigarettes on public display during a recession , when many smaller retailers were suffering from a lack of business .
Newsagents say the proposal could cost them £ 250 m in lost sales .
' Free choice '
Tory backbencher Philip Davies said : " This is the nanny state gone mad .
On every conceivable level this particular ban is wrong .
" It goes against the principle of individual responsibility , free choice and people making their own decisions . "
Mr Davies said it was " completely false " to suggest people would be more likely to buy cigarettes because they were displayed in shops .
He argued : " As someone who was a retailer for 12 years , can I tell you that tobacco is not an impulse purchase in the same way that cream cakes are . "
But health minister Gillian Merron said the ban would help to stop new generations taking up smoking .
She said : " The tobacco industry constantly recruits young people to replace those who give up smoking or die each year .
Consigning vending machines to the scrapheap will cut off an easy supply of cigarettes to children
Peter Hollins , British Heart Foundation
" We are of course aware of how the current economic climate is affecting small business which is why we will not commence the effect of this legislation until 2011 for larger stores and 2013 for smaller shops . "
Ms Merron said she was opposed to an outright ban on vending machines but the Health Secretary , Andy Burnham , said he would not oppose Mr McCartney 's measure in the Lords .
He said : " The remaining amendments that have been voted through go over to the other place ( the Lords ) in a well - drafted and legally workable form .
" I will watch with interest how his proposals are received in another place but the government will not seek to overturn them , " he added .
' Step forward '
The chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health ( Ash ) , Deborah Arnott , said the vending machine ban had " made a strong Bill even stronger " .
It was the most " significant step forward " in public health since the ban on smoking in public places , she added .
The British Heart Foundation said the move was a " victory " for those who had campaigned on the issue .
" Consigning vending machines to the scrapheap will cut off an easy supply of cigarettes to children , " said its chief executive Peter Hollins .
" This policy must be carried out across the UK as soon as possible . "
The Scottish Parliament is considering a similar ban on vending machines and public displays of tobacco .

( CNN ) -- Officials warned Wednesday that the bridge linking the California cities of San Francisco and Oakland will likely remain closed Thursday morning , promising more delays for Bay Area commuters .
That work is intended to dampen vibration on the structure .
Vibration may have played a role in causing pieces of the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge to fall Tuesday night from the span onto the roadway , resulting in its closure .
The 73 - year - old bridge spans the San Francisco Bay and carries an average 280,000 vehicles daily , according to the state 's Transportation Department .
" Right now , we do not have a time when the bridge will potentially open , " said Bart Ney , a spokesman for California Department of Transportation .
" The work has to be completed first . "
Once the new steel is in place and the rods have been made tense , at least three hours of testing will be carried out before the bridge will reopen to vehicular traffic , Ney said , refusing to speculate on when that might occur .
" The first thing that I would say to motorists is that you need to be at this point planning other routes over the next day or so , " he said .
The Federal Highway Administration and the Seismic Peer Review Board are scrutinizing the repair plans , he said .
Wednesday 's commute was a horror show for many .
" My wife actually drives over to the peninsula ; she says it 's taken her two hours to get to work so far and she 's not there yet , " commuter Seth Carp told CNN affiliate KTVU as he prepared to board a Bay Area Rapid Transit train .
" I tried to take the Golden Gate Bridge , " said a woman who identified herself only as Yemi .
" It was a big mistake . "
She gave up and wound up taking BART .
" It was back - to - back bumper , there were rows of cars everywhere , " said Christina Chou , who lives in Foster City near the San Mateo Bridge , which served as an alternate route for many .
" It was just horrible . "
Ridership increased on ferries , too , with some people finding a silver lining to the snafu .
" I have been looking for an opportunity to go across the bay in the ferry , " said Jack Pierce of Oakland .
" I 'm sorry the cable parted , but I am glad to get the opportunity . "
Ney said wind gusts of up to 50 mph slowed repair efforts on Tuesday , but the winds had diminished by Wednesday evening .
Winds increased vibration by the rods that were fatigued and ultimately failed , he said .
" It was a contributing factor , but not necessarily the only factor , and we are analyzing what the factors are right now , " he said .
Travelers flocked to BART , which ran longer trains and extra trains .
The rail line was on track to exceed its peak ridership of 405,000 in a single day , said BART spokesman Linton Johnson .
Were you there ?
Send photos and video
" We have called in extra personnel to help us make sure we operate with every available train car we have in order to provide as much capacity as possible , " said BART 's assistant general manager of operations , Paul Oversier .
Amtrak was running a shuttle between the San Francisco and Martinez stations for Coast Starlight and California Zephyr passengers .
The pieces that fell -- a cross beam and tie rods -- came from the same section that was repaired in September over Labor Day weekend , when crews worked almost around the clock to fix a crack in the span .
A 50 - foot section of the bridge collapsed in 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake , killing one person and prompting efforts to make it quake - tolerant .
The whole Bay Bridge is slated to be replaced in 2013 , said Patrick Siegman , a transportation planner at Nelson Nygaard Consulting Associates , a national transportation planning firm based in San Francisco .
The bridge is " really showing its age , " he said .
" It 's kind of a race against time to finish the new bridge before the next quake hits . "
Have n’t had much time to update the blog lately .
All week I ’ve been quietly grinding away at two basic issues : PAL VBI support for the em28xx chip , and identifying / addressing the HVR - 1600 performance problem .
I often get questions from users along the lines of “ how do you make boards work ? ” .
Reverse engineering is a bit of a black art , but I figured I would offer some insight as to how the process works .
If you do n’t actually care how tuners are designed and how we figure out how to make them work , stop reading now .
If this stuff interests you , read on , and feel free to put something in the comments if you want to see more posts of this nature .
I ’m still gauging whether there is enough interest in this topic for me to go through the work associated with writing about it .
So let ’s take a step back for a moment : what am I trying to accomplish ?
In this case , there have been reports for quite a while that the Linux tuning performance of the HVR - 1600 is worse than under Windows .
In fact , people have pointed out that the SNR being reported is about 3 dB lower under Linux .
This results in visual artifacts being displayed , as well as not being able to hold a signal lock on weaker signals .
In this case , my suspicion is that either the mxl5005s silicon tuner or the cx24227 demodulator is not being configured properly .
So the logical approach would be to see how it ’s programmed under Windows , and compare that to how it ’s programmed under Linux .
But then I hear you screaming , “ But wait !
You do n’t have the source code to the Windows driver , so how do you know how the tuner and demod are configured ? ”
Well , that depends .
If it were a USB device , I would use a tool such as SniffUSB 2.0 to capture the USB traffic , and then decode the i2 c traffic to see how the register is programmed .
In this case , it ’s a PCI card , so I can not just look at the bus .
Now what ?
“ When in doubt , use brute force . ”
This next step needs you to think like a hardware developer .
Hardware designs do n’t work overnight .
They are n’t magical , and like software they can have problems and need to be debugged .
As a result , hardware engineers often add what are known as “ test points ” to a printed circuit board design .
This makes it easier for him / her to poke around with an oscilloscope or attach debugging hardware .
On debug boards , test points have pins attached .
On production hardware , the test points are often still there but they simply do n’t populate the board with the pins , since they are not needed and add cost to the bill of materials .
So , were the Hauppauge engineers who designed the HVR - 1600 thinking about how they were going to be able to debug the design ?
Apparently so :
[ lightbox title= ” Em28xx PAL VBI ” href= ” ../../blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/hvr1600tp-300×225.jpg ” ] [ / lightbox ]
Oh look , two through - holes on the board marked “ TP10 ” and “ TP11 ” , right next to the EEPROM ?
Could those pins expose the HVR - 1600 ’s i2 c bus ?
Yup .
But do n’t I need thousands of dollars worth of special hardware in order to read the i2 c bus ?
Well , logic analyzers used to be really expensive , but now you can get a very capable logic analyzer for less than $ 200 .
In fact , I bought my Saleae Logic from SparkFun Electronics for $ 149.95 .
Break out your soldering iron , hook up a couple of pins , and start capturing i2 c traffic .
This approach lets you record the traffic using the same method regardless of whether you are under Windows or Linux .
The logic analyzer even has the ability to decode the i2 c traffic and export the data in CSV format to a text file :
Time [ s ] , Event
" 1.5155000 " , Start
" 1.5155200 " , Setup write to 0x19 .
+ACK
" 1.5156900 " , Wrote 0xF2 to 0x19 .
+ACK
" 1.5158650 " , Wrote 0x00 to 0x19 .
+ACK
" 1.5160350 " , Wrote 0x00 to 0x19 .
+ACK
" 1.5162200 " , Stop
" 1.5162250 " , Start
" 1.5162450 " , Setup write to 0x19 .
+ACK
" 1.5164200 " , Wrote 0xFA to 0x19 .
+ACK
" 1.5165900 " , Wrote 0x00 to 0x19 .
+ACK
" 1.5167650 " , Wrote 0x00 to 0x19 .
+ACK
" 1.5169450 " , Stop
...
The raw data is n’t particularly easy on the eyes , but with a bit of Perl - Fu , you can turn it into something much more manageable :
0xF2 0x00 0x00
0xFA 0x00 0x00
...
A look at the existing s5h1409 driver shows that the first byte is the register address , followed by a 16 - bit value .
Since we are interested in the state the registers were left in when I stopped the capture , we need to weed out all the older register writes .
Perl comes to the rescue again .
Just spin over the file , and load the values in to a hash with the first byte as the key :
while ( my $ line = < FILE > ) { chomp $ line ; my @vals = split / / , $ line ; $ final {$ vals [ 0 ] } = \@vals ; }
Take the resulting captures for both Windows and Linux , pass it through sort and diff , and what do we get ?
root@ubuntumb:~/1600traces # diff nbcwin1.txt.final nbclin1.txt.final
26,27c26
< 22 0x2F
< 25 0x36
---
> 22 0x3 F
We went from a 1780 line analyzer capture , down to a file with 94 mxl5005s registers writes , down to a five line file showing the two mxl5005s registers that are programmed differently .
Total code required : 64 lines of Perl .
The diff for the s5h1409 register was a little longer ( eight registers ) , but it ’s still much easier to use some regex magic to avoid having to hand inspect and compare over two hundred register writes .
As a test , we can now just hack a few register writes into the driver right after the tuning command and see if it works … .
Yup .
I ’m now getting an extra 3 dB compared to before I tweaked the driver .
Now I just have to work backward and understand why the Linux driver programmed the chip with different values .
Total time spent from plugging in my soldering iron to verifying the 3dB improvement under Linux : most of Sunday afternoon .
I hope some of you have found this little tutorial informative / educational .
If so , feel free to leave a comment saying so , as this will tell me whether anybody actually cares about this stuff and whether I should write about it in the future .

Pre users can now use their device as a modem and even as a 3G router with newly available unofficial software .
A developer has created a application called My Tether which enables users to utilize the Pre 's 3G connection much like a WiFi hotspot .
This lets users share connections and link up laptops on the road over USB , Bluetooth or WiFi .
There are currently two versions of the application .
A free version 1.5 requires some technical know - how and Linux hacking in order to install and configures , while a more user friendly version 2.0 comes with its own automated installer .
The later option is available with a $ 10 donation .

FOR those who fret that their hard - earned money might be wasted on a dud computer game , help could soon be at hand .
A new breed of game aims to suit everyone by adapting to an individual ’s playing style .
Computer games have had an element of adaptability for decades , says Julian Togelius at the IT University of Copenhagen , Denmark .
“ If you play well the game gets harder and if you are lousy it might get easier , ” he says .
Togelius and colleague Georgios Yannakakis want to take this adaptability one step further by creating games that “ learn ” to identify whether an …

I ’ve been playing a lot with CouchDB lately and if you ’re on OS X there ’s really no easier way to do so than by using CouchDBX , a self - contained application that includes CouchDB , Erlang , and all of the dependencies you need to run Couch .
However , recently I wanted to try the power and functionality of couchdb - lucene for full - text indexing of a CouchDB application on which I was working .
It was n’t immediately obvious to me how to make that happen , so I thought I ’d share how I got it working for those who might want to do the same .
For the record , I am using the following versions of things :
Mac OS X 10.6 ( Snow Leopard )
CouchDBX 0.9.1 R13B pl2
CouchDB Lucene v0.4
Unpacking CouchDB Lucene
You will need to place CouchDB Lucene in a convenient location , but first you ’ll need to unpack the gZip file .
Note that , at least for me , the default Mac unarchiver did not provide a suitable . jar file .
Instead , extract it using the following command :
unpack200 couchdb- lucene-0.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar.gz couchdb-lucene-0.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar 1 unpack200 couchdb - lucene - 0.4 - jar - with - dependencies . jar .
gz couchdb - lucene - 0.4 - jar - with - dependencies .
jar
It does n’t particularly matter where you put it ( I put mine in /usr / local / etc ) so long as you remember the location .
Editing the CouchDBX .ini File
Next you will need to edit the CouchDBX local .ini file to add the external for full - text indexing .
To access the file , right - click CouchDBX and select “ Show Package Contents ” then navigate to Contents / Resources/couchdbx -core / couchdb/etc/couchdb/local.ini and open it up in your favorite text editor .
You will need to add the following lines to this file , taking note to change the directory to match where you stored your Lucene . jar file .
[ couchdb ] os_process_timeout=60000 ; increase the timeout from 5 seconds .
[ external ] fti=/usr/bin/java - server - Xmx1g - jar / path/to/couchdb-lucene-0.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar - search [ update_notification ] indexer=/usr/bin/java - server - Xmx1g - jar / path/to/couchdb-lucene-0.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar - index [ httpd_db_handlers ] _fti = {couch_httpd_external , handle_external_req , <<" fti " >>} 1 [ couchdb ] os_process_timeout = 60000 ; increase the timeout from 5 seconds . [ external ] fti = / usr / bin / java - server - Xmx1g - jar / path / to / couchdb - lucene - 0.4 - jar - with - dependencies . jar - search [ update_notification ] indexer = / usr / bin / java - server - Xmx1g - jar / path / to / couchdb - lucene - 0.4 - jar - with - dependencies . jar - index [ httpd_db_handlers ] _fti = { couch_httpd_external , handle_external_req , & lt ; & lt ; " fti " & gt ; & gt ; }
All right , that ’s all the setup you need to be running CouchDB Lucene !
Now you can start up CouchDBX and set up your first search indexes .
Creating a Full - Text Index View
To create a full - text index view , you simply need to add a “ fulltext ” field to one of your design documents .
The URL structure for accessing CouchDB Lucene searches is as follows :
http://localhost:5984/database_name/_fti/design_doc_name/index_name?q=your+query+here 1 http : //localhost:5984/database_name/_fti/design_doc_name/index_name?q=your+query+here
Where database_name is any database you have on your system , design_doc_name is any design document in your database , and index_name is a fulltext index you defined .
For instance , if I had a CouchRest generated design doc for a bunch of music , I might have a design document that looks something like this :
{ " _id " :" _design / Song " , " _rev " : " af12a4b12af1b24afbf244f1 " , " fulltext " : { " my_search " : { " index " : " function ( doc ) { if ( ! doc [ ' couchrest - type ' ] == ' Song ' ) return null ; var ret = new Document ( ) ; ret.add(doc.title ) ; ret.add( doc.artist ) ; return ret ; } " } } } 1 { " _id " : " _design /Song " , " _rev " : " af12a4b12af1b24afbf244f1 " , " fulltext " : { " my_search " : { " index " : " function ( doc ) { if ( ! doc [ ' couchrest - type ' ] == ' Song ' ) return null ; var ret = new Document ( ) ; ret.add(doc.title ) ; ret.add( doc.artist ) ; return ret ; } " } } }
I would then be able to access the search results with this URL :
http://localhost:5984/myapp/_fti/Song/my_search?q=Ben+Folds 1 http : //localhost:5984/myapp/_fti/Song/my_search?q=Ben+Folds
Awesome !
We now have full - text indexing up and running on CouchDBX !
Bonus : CouchRest Lucene
I use CouchRest extensively in my Ruby CouchDB projects , and I wanted to be able to integrate the new Lucene searches easily .
I found this post that added a bit of functionality , but I wanted to be able to integrate with ExtendedDocument ( and the snippet was also slightly outdated ) , so I ’ve updated it .
Just add this sometime after you include CouchRest :
class CouchRest :: Database def search ( design , index , query , options={} ) CouchRest.get CouchRest.paramify_url( " #{@root}/_fti/#{design}/#{index} " , options. merge( :q => query ) ) end end class CouchRest : : ExtendedDocument def self .search ( index , query , options={} ) options [ :include_docs ] = true ret = self.database.search(self.to_s , index , query , options ) ret [ ' rows '].collect!{|r| self.new ( r[ ' doc ' ] ) } ret end end 1 class CouchRest :: Database def search ( design , index , query , options = { } ) CouchRest .
get CouchRest .
paramify_url ( " #{@root}/_fti/#{design}/#{index} " , options .
merge ( : q =& gt ; query ) ) end end class CouchRest :: ExtendedDocument def self .
search ( index , query , options = { } ) options [ : include_docs ] = true ret = self .
database .
search ( self .
to_s , index , query , options ) ret [ ' rows ' ] . collect !
{ | r | self .
new ( r [ ' doc ' ] ) } ret end end
What this snippet does is allows you to perform searches on a database directly or by calling a search method on an extended document .
Let ’s look at a couple examples to see how it would work :
@db = CouchRest.database ! ( " http://localhost:5984/myapp " ) @ db.search (' Song ' , 'my_search ' , ' Ben Folds ' , :include_docs => true ) #
The following is equivalent to the above , but will automatically # include the docs and cast the result rows into ExtendedDocuments Song.search ( ' my_search ' , ' Ben Folds ' ) 1 @ db = CouchRest .
database ! ( " http://localhost:5984/myapp " ) @ db . search ( ' Song ' , ' my_search ' , ' Ben Folds ' , : include_docs =& gt ; true ) #
The following is equivalent to the above , but will automatically # include the docs and cast the result rows into ExtendedDocuments Song.search ( ' my_search ' , ' Ben Folds ' )
Now that we have this set up , we ’re ready to go forth and build full - text search into our Couch DB apps .
I hope this is helpful to some who have become somewhat familiar with CouchDB but are looking to push it a little further and try out some of the more advanced usages of CouchDB in their applications .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Ever watch a colleague take credit for your idea , been accused of being emotional , taken jokes too personally or been interrupted frequently in a meeting ?
Two Korean women pose in the exhibition hall of Korea on the day of the opening of the Frankfurt book fair , October 18 , 2005 .
The world 's largest book fair with it 's focal theme on Korean literature will be open to public from October 19 to 23 .

Most women will nod yes to such scenarios , say the authors of “ Code Switching : How to Talk So Men Will Listen , ” a new book on communication , or the lack thereof , between men and women .
Men and women communicate differently , say authors Claire Damken Brown and Audrey Nelson , in ingrained styles learned from birth and deeply embedded in the workplace structure .
They propose “ code switching , ” which they describe as using knowledge of more than one culture and language to communicate .
“ It ’s a travel guide , in a way , to another country with another culture , ” Nelson said in an interview with Reuters about the book , published by Alpha Books .
The differences in men’s and women ’s styles create a persistent “ credibility gap , ” where women are credited with less authority and power than men , they write .
“ The biggest complaint I have gotten for 30 years from all levels , all professions of women , is , ‘ How can I get men to take me seriously ? ’ ” Nelson said .
“ This book is to build a bridge in that credibility gap . ”
Men have lost about three - quarters of the jobs during the recession , but having more women in the workplace does not necessarily bring change , the authors say .
“ There are more of us ... but do not assume because the person is a woman that she is on board , ” Nelson said .
“ There are a number of women out there that are still happy to accommodate men , that do not want to rock the boat , that have no assertive skills and do n’t want them . ”
GENDER DIFFERENCES
EVERYWHERE
Signs of the gender difference are everywhere , they write .
Women apologize more than men , play the role of “ office mom ” to whom everyone confides and offer more subjective opinions .
Men tell more jokes , but women laugh at them more .
Men want solutions to problems while women look for understanding of problems , and men like to play devil ’s advocate while women want to help everyone to agree , they say .
Even in e-mails , men banter and write short to - the - point messages , while women share personal information and express appreciation and support in longer messages , they say .
Brown hailed from the corporate world , where she worked at companies like AT&T and Lucent Technologies , while Nelson is a veteran communication consultant .
Their book proposes tools to help women bridge that communication gap , such as steps to respond to interruptions , with suggested phrases and body language .
“ Part of our goal in this book is to make women more self - conscious , ” said Nelson .
“ Step up to the plate .
Do something about it . ”
It was not intended to be a “ whining , bitching session , ” said Nelson .
Nor is it “ male bashing , ” Brown added .
“ It ’s really trying to say , ‘ Here ’s another way we can communicate and get a point across , ’ ” Brown said .
To help spread their word , and sell their book , the authors are offering on their website ( www.codeswitching.biz) to address book clubs by telephone .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
More than 3,000 U.S. troops scheduled to deploy to Iraq wo n't go after all , as the military tries to draw down troop levels in the war - torn country , a Pentagon spokesman said Saturday .
U.S. troops speak to an Iraqi child in Baghdad on Monday .
The 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team , 10th Mountain Division will not replace a North Carolina National Guard unit already in Iraq , Lt. Col. Eric Butterbaugh told CNN .
The 3,500 - troop combat team , based in Fort Drum , New York , was to leave in January , he said .
" [ The cancellation ] reflects a thorough assessment of the security environment in Iraq and continued improvement in the ability of the Iraqi security forces to safeguard Iraqi citizens and institutions , " Butterbaugh said .
The National Guard unit is still on schedule to return home , which will speed up the drawdown of forces , he said .
The troop withdrawal in Iraq coincides with a debate in the Obama administration on whether to send as many as 40,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan .
As of Friday , 250 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since the start of the year , according to a CNN tally based on Pentagon numbers .
The United States plans to withdraw all its combat troops from Iraq by August , leaving 50,000 in advisory roles .
Those advisers are to leave by the end of 2011 .
Concerns that a delay in the upcoming Iraqi elections could put a dent in scheduled withdrawals was rejected Friday by U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Chris Hill .
" As for our schedule of troop withdrawal , we 've been pretty clear about when the troops would be withdrawn , " he told CNN .
" So our plan is to draw down the troops as we 've said we 're going [ to ] do . "
The polls are scheduled to open January 16 , but both the United States and the United Nations are worried because Iraq still has no election law .
If a new law is n't adopted , the government may have to change the election date or rely on the law used in the 2005 elections , some officials say .
A vote on the new law is expected Monday .
Pentagon officials also must weigh the impact of continuing violence in the country .
Hill said the violence is a concern , as are insurgent efforts to undermine attempts at reconciliation in the divided country .
" Reconciliation is a tough business .
I mean I 've been in some of these meetings with people , you know , they do n't like each other , you have to get them to work together , get them to understand their futures are together , and then you get a bombing , which makes it even tougher , " Hill said .
" Again , I think the Iraqi people have really signaled that they are really sick and tired of this stuff . "
Meanwhile , violence continued in Iraq on Saturday .
Four soldiers were killed and 10 people , including civilians and security forces , were wounded when a bomb targeting an Iraqi army checkpoint exploded in Falluja , an Anbar province town , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said .
Elsewhere in Anbar , a suicide truck bomb hit a police checkpoint on a bridge west of Ramadi , wounding a police officer .
The blast badly damaged the bridge , which carries a highway linking Iraq with Jordan and Syria , the official said .
Traffic had to be rerouted to an another road .
Anbar province , a massive region populated mostly by Sunni Arabs , had been a major front in the Iraqi war .
The al Qaeda in Iraq militant group once held great sway in Anbar , but its influence lessened with the advent of U.S. - backed groups called Awakening Councils .
CNN 's Scott Spoerry and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report .

It looks like this could be a new record : A Tesla Roadster has squeezed its battery for 313 miles .
The red Roadster competing in Global Green Challenge traveled through the Australian outback from Alice Springs to Coober Pedy and rolled into town with three miles left on the battery .
Owner Simon Hackett and co-driver Emilis Prelgauskas covered 501 kilometers – 313 miles – on one charge .
And that , Tesla Motors says , appears to be a new record for a production EV .
Yes , Down Under is a long way to go with a Tesla , but then , the Roadster is a pretty sweet ride .
Hackett 's feat was done on a single " fill up , " too .
There were no clever battery - swap stations , and no Teslas were harmed during the run through the middle of the Australian continent .
The car 's charging port was sealed at the start of the run , as the pic at right shows .
Hackett and Prelgauskas were competing in the 10th annual Global Green Challenge , one of the most high - profile rallies for alternative fuel cars .
The two provided updates about the red 2008 Roadster 's progress in real time on Hackett 's blog after leaving Alice Springs , in Australia 's Northern Territory , and proceeding south .
For the record , the Roadster 's 53 kilowatt - hour lithium - ion battery has a claimed range of 236 miles .
The record claimed by Hackett and Prelgauskas shattered the previous all - time high of 241 miles , also held by a Tesla Roadster that set the benchmark in April during the Rallye Monte Carlo d'Energies Alternatives .
That particular Tesla had an estimated 38 miles left in the battery by the time it crossed the Monte 's finish line .
In an e-mail sent to Tesla , which shared it with us in a release , Hackett said :
Emilis and I have decades of experience flying gliders competitively and we applied the same energy conservation techniques to our driving , with significant results !
The car had about three miles of range left when the drive was completed .
We traveled 501 km on a single charge .
Let that sink in for a minute .
The security seal was applied to the charge port door when we started the journey .
As this is being done as part of the Global Green Challenge , we have a full set of official verifiers here who will attest to the results and to achieving the outcome .
We were followed along the journey by our support crew and a documentary film crew – so we have it on film .
It 's late here and we have another 541 km to drive ( with an intermediate charge stop ) tomorrow – and another two days of the event left after that .
When we 're done , we will have driven over 3000 km in the Roadster over the course of only six days , from Darwin to Adelaide .
The two guys did n't provide any specifics on their driving style , but we 're betting they did n't do a lot of smoky burnouts or test the car 's 3.9 - second zero - to - 60 time .
If we get more info , we 'll be sure to pass it on .

Graphs are ubiquitous .
Social or P2P networks , thesauri , route - planning systems , recommendation systems , collaborative filtering , even the World Wide Web itself is ultimately a graph !

Conclusion
Recently Lorenzo Alberton gave a talk on Trees In The Database where he showed the most - used approaches to storing trees in a relational database .
Now he has moved on to an even more interesting topic with his article Graphs in the database : SQL meets social networks .
Right from the beginning of his excellent article Alberton puts this technical challenge in a proper context :
After a brief explanation of what a graph data structure is , the article goes on to show how graphs can be represented in a table - based database .
The rest of the article shows in detail how an adjacency list model can be used to represent a graph in a relational database .
Different examples are used to illustrate what can be done in this way .
This post is going to show how the same things can be done when using a native graph database , namely Neo4j .
To begin with , it ’s good to have a grip on how your data actually looks , and when it comes to graphs I prefer a graphical representation , so here goes :
As you can see , it ’s a fairly small social network , so it should be easy to comprehend what ’s going on in the examples .
Anyhow , please read the original article for the full context of the examples ; this article will mainly deal with how to solve the same problems in a true graph database .
For the sample code , Java will be used .
If you ’re no fan of Java , go check out the current language drivers for Neo4j
This part is very different when dealing with a graph database : there ’s no need to think much about the representation at all when using a graph database .
Nodes and relationships ( also called edges ) are native to a graph database and this includes making sure that the graph is consistent ( for example ensuring that every relationship has a start node and an end node ) .
As a developer you can focus more on what to model and less on how to represent it .
Our first task is to find the nodes that are directly connected to a node in the case of directed relationships .
We assume thevariable as input and then the code is as easy as follows : What we are doing here is to fetch all the outgoing relationships and then get the node at the other end of the relationship .
In Neo4j , all relationships between nodes are typed , and as seen from both the image above and the code , arelationship type was used in this case .
The relationship types are explained on thepage of the Neo4j API reference
The following image showsand all the nodes that are directly connected to it .
When following all outgoing relationships , the result will be a single node , namley Next , it ’s time to do the same thing again but using undirected relationships .
Both Neo4j and the model in Alberton ’s article store the relationships as directed but then you can retrieve them in a different way to ignore their direction .
Here ’s how to do this using Neo4 j : Did you spot the difference ?
Where the previous code hadwe know have .
For those of you who are curious now : yes , there ’sas well .
When viewed with a perspective that ignores directions , the whole graph looks like this :
When running the new code with , all the directly connected nodes will be retrieved irregardless of direction :
First , obviously the SQL solution is declarative , while the Neo4j solution is procedural .
As we ’ll see later on there is a declarative API to traverse the node space ( graph ) in Neo4j as well .
Second , changing from directed to undirected relationships almost did n’t change the code necessary at all with the graph database approach , while the relational one requires some changes .
Transitive closure , in the sense Alberton uses it , is irrelevant in a graph database context as you have access to the full graph from the beginning .
The need for defining a transitive closure over the graph in relational databases is caused by its lack of native support for graph data structures .
What is still of course relevant in the graph database setting is how to find all nodes that are reachable from one node , using directed relationships .
So let ’s see how to do that .
As previously we assume thevariable as input to this piece of code :
So what ’s happening in this code ?
We start out by setting up a traverser .
The traverser will use a breadth first algorithm , so that we can intercept the depth / distance to each of the returned node correctly .
The traverser will not stop until the end of the graph and will return all nodes but the start node .
It will follow relationships of thetype in the outgoing direction .
Finally the loop fetches the result from the traverser .
If we for some reason want to do this for all nodes in the graph , we simply feed the code above with all existing nodes .
This time we assume having all nodes in our network in thevariable .
It ’s easy to get them as theAPI provides amethod .
What we need to do is just a regular loop :
How then to do the same thing but using undirected relationships ?
I am rest assured that readers will have no problems solving this so I leave it as a homework exercise !
This time it ’s less obvious what the SQL actually does ; you need a bit of SQL fu to parse that code !
The corresponding Neo4j code this time uses a declarative approach , which depicts the wanted result .
Now it ’s definitely time to get closer to what a graph database could do for you in an application .
In this case , we want to know the possible paths from one person in a social network to an other .
With those paths at hand we can do things similar to the “ How you ’re connected to N.N. ” feature of LinkedIn
For a deeper analysis , it could be of interest to know all possible paths between two nodes within a limited distance ( and not only go for the shortest path ) , so we will see how that would work .
This task could be performed with the low - level API of Neo4j , but in this case we will use the graph - algo package instead .
Of course a graph database should come with basic graph algorithms included as well !
This time we will assume that we ( quite obviously ) know theandnodes and how long the paths are that we ’re looking for ( ) .
Let ’s get to the code :
Do you want to sort the paths by distance ( a.k.a. lenght of the paths ) ?
Then add this code :
When looking for paths fromtousing undirected relationships , all nodes butwill be part of at least one path :
If we for some reason use directed relationships , the result will be found among the nodes that are colored yellow in this graph :
In this case , you could argue that it ’s not a fair comparison , since a relational database can’t ship with built - in functions for such specific things as finding paths in a graph .
There ’s some validity to that .
But that ’s also my point : Graphs are , as Alberton and Google say , ubiquitous these days and no longer a niche technology .
In an increasingly connected world , a graph database many times brings a lot more functionality and performance to the table – pun intended !
– than a relational system designed for the payroll systems of the 70s .
Our last example will require some more complexity to solve .
But on the other hand I regard it as the most fun and rewarding piece .
The challenge this time is to traverse into friends of friends ( or even deeper ) and find people with something in common .
Based on this we can distill someone the user might know , or could be interested in knowing .
The persons in our social network all have different values for two features , and .
The idea of the solution presented here is to keep track of the features that are common in each branch of the traversal and to stop when there is nothing in common any more or the maximum distance has been reached .
To do this we use recursion ( which was never a problem in graph databases , unlike in relational database systems ) .
Before we start to recurse , we have to set some things up :
Theparameter contains the names of the features we want to check .
As all features of course matches at the starting point , we can send them in as thelist .
To make sure we do n’t suggest people who are alreadywe keep track of those in a That ’s all we need to prepare , so off we go to the recursion !
It ’s initially fed with the root node and path to start from , together with the list of the matching features and finally the current distance .
Here ’s how things continue from there :
Now there ’s a few things we need to think about to get this code right .
It ’s not hard if you keep the network structure in your mind .
To begin with there are some nodes we have to avoid .
As soon as we have passed by ( ) the , we do n’t want to meet them again .
We also want to avoid nodes which are already contained in the path we are investigating , thus avoiding cycles in the graph .
When we know we are looking at the right nodes , it ’s time to compare their features .
We only look at the features that are matching everyone in the path behind us , so thelist will get shorter than thelist if one or more features do n’t match any more .
If there are nowe ’re finished with this branch .
Otherwise we construct a .
Then we have to make sure not to addto theand to stop recursing when thehas been reached .
Finally , this is how to use the class :
The graphical view of this problem looks like this , when searching for “ might - know ” nodes of If you would like to do something more advanced it would be a small step to add in you own feature matching operations instead of the simplemethod used in this example .
If you compare the code , you ’ll note that the graph database code is more intuitive .
This is because it works with abstractions ( nodes , relationships , etc. ) that fit the domain better .
But I think the most important difference in this case appears when it ’s time to evolve the code .
How do you change the traversal depth in the SQL solution ?
How to change the traversal depth dynamically depending on facts found in the attributes / features ?
It should be noted that the examples above are all very trivial .
When dealing with real - world problems differences that may seem small from the tiny code examples could prove to have a strong impact .
Also , I did n’t mention performance so far , but in many cases this could be the main reason to move graph data to a native graph database .
What is actually the root cause of the differences between relational databases and graph databases outlined in this article ?
It lies in a fundamental difference in design of the underlying data models .
The relational model is based on the assumption that database records are what primarily matters while relationships between records come second place .
Graph databases instead assume that the relationships are as important as the records .
This difference has numerous consequences for ease of use as well as for performance .
A table - based system makes a good fit for static and simple data structures , while a graph - based fits complex and dynamic data better .

Advertisement President Barack Obama has welcomed the news that the US economy returned to growth between July and September .
Official figures showed the economy grew by 3.5 % during the quarter , its first expansion in more than a year .
The growth was helped by a substantial government spending plan , including a scrappage scheme to boost car sales .
But Mr Obama said while " welcome news " , the US was still a " long way " from recovering from the " deepest downturn since the Great Depression " .
The return to growth of the world 's largest economy also sent shares on Wall Street sharply higher .
The main Dow Jones index closed up 200 points , or 2.1 % , at 9,962.58 .
Mr Obama said the figures were " an affirmation that this recession is abating and [ showed ] the steps we 've taken have made a difference , but I also know that we 've got a long way to go to fully restore our economy . "
He said there were other benchmarks for measuring economic progress , such as " whether we are creating jobs , whether families are able to pay their bills and whether businesses are hiring and doing well . "
Compared with the previous three months , the US economy grew by 0.9 % .
In the same period , and on the same measure , the UK economy unexpectedly stayed in recession after it shrank by 0.4 % .
Japan , Germany and France have recently climbed out of recession .
ANALYSIS By Michelle Fleury , New York business reporter
The US , the world 's economic powerhouse , joins Japan , Germany and France as the leading economies that have emerged from recession .
While economists may be celebrating , it is too soon for the rest of us .
The recent weakness of the dollar wo n't help Americans buy goods from the rest of the world and with the unemployment rate in the US currently at 9.8 % , life is still very hard .
Government schemes such as the " cash for clunkers " programme helped consumers and manufacturers but given the weakness of the last retail sales data , shoppers are still limiting their spending .
All the same , this GDP reading is a milestone regardless of how fragile the recovery is .
Pain continues for some Mardell :
Where only hope is left Head to head :
What next for US economy ?
Global good news BBC chief economics correspondent Hugh Pym said the 3.5 % annualised growth rate - which takes the change over a three - month period and works out what it would be if it continued over a year - was better than had been expected by most commentators .
" The sheer scale of the stimulus in the US has made a big difference , it was much bigger in percentage terms than that in the UK , " he said .
It is the first time the US economy has expanded since the second quarter of 2008 , when it grew at an annual pace of 2.4 % .
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner stressed times were still hard for millions .
" Unemployment remains unacceptably high for every person out of work , for every family facing foreclosure , for every small business facing a credit crunch , the recession remains alive and acute , " he said .
Official confirmation of whether the US is in or out of recession will come from the National Bureau of Economic Research , the agency which considers a number of factors in coming to its decision .
Numerous boosts
The figures from the Commerce Department showed that a number of factors helped to lift the economy during the third quarter .
HAVE YOUR SAY
There can be no genuine recovery , where there are no jobs .
We continue to lose jobs , and none are being created Rick McDaniel , Lewisville , TX USA Spending on durable manufactured products soared at an annualised rate of 22.3 % , the highest quarterly amount since 2001 , led primarily by the impact of the cash for clunkers scheme lifting car sales .
The housing market also improved , with spending on housing products up 23.4 % , its largest quarterly jump in 23 years .
Analysts said this big leap was sparked by the government 's $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time house buyers .
Meanwhile , total government spending was up 7.9 % , as the wider stimulus spending continued to take effect .
In addition , exports were also up strongly , increasing 21.4 % , the biggest rise since 1996 .
' Distorted by stimulus ' " It 's good to have the economy growing again , " said Brian Bethune , economist at IHS Global Insight .
" But we do n't think that rate of growth is sustainable because it is distorted by all the government stimulus .
" The challenge here is to get organic growth - growth that is n't helped by fiscal steroids . "
Analysts cautious about the slow nature of the US economic recovery point to the fact that the unemployment rate currently stands at 9.8 % , and that the labour market traditionally lags behind any wider economic recovery .
They also highlight the fact that the big car firms have already reported a sharp fall in September sales following the conclusion of the popular $ 3bn cash for clunkers scheme at the end of August .
" You can say that the recession is over , but it sure wo n't feel like that , " said Dean Baker , co-director of the Centre for Economic Policy Research .
" There is a lot of downward momentum that is n't going to go . "

BBC Moscow correspondent
FROM THE PM PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from PM Britain 's young minister for energy and climate change , Ed Miliband , had come to Russia to talk about global warming .
Little did he know he would end up meeting a long - lost member of his family .
It came in the middle of a phone - in programme on the popular Moscow radio station " Ekho Moskvy " .
As the fresh - faced Mr Miliband prepared to answer questions on CO2 emissions and melting permafrost , the voice of an elderly woman came on the line .
" I am Sofia Davidovna Miliband , I am your relative ; I am the only one left . "
As the British minister looked on bemused , the host of the show cut her off - clearly worried she was a hoaxer .
But it was no hoax .
Iran expert The British ambassador and dozens of invited guests ( and the BBC ) were left stranded at an embassy reception as Mr Miliband raced off to meet his long - lost kin .
It turns out that Sofia Davidovna Miliband is an 86 - year - old academic .
She was once a leading expert on Iran at the Moscow School of Oriental Studies .
I 've always slightly wondered about her ever since I was a kid , it was amazing for me to come face to face with her
Ed Miliband
After much translation and a call to his mother in the UK , the British minister - whose brother David , is the UK 's foreign secretary - worked out that his great - great grandfather was the brother of Sofia 's grandfather .
Both of them had been born in the Jewish quarter of Warsaw in Poland .
Ed Miliband 's grandfather fled Poland in the 1920s and ended up in Belgium .
He fled again ahead of Hitler 's invading army and made it to Britain on forged papers with his son , Ed and David Miliband 's father .
Unknown to them another part of the Miliband clan had come east to Moscow .
Sofia Davidovna reportedly told him she was delighted .
She has no children and thought she was the last of the Milibands .
Little did she know that in faraway England there are not one , but two of them in the British cabinet .
Mr Miliband told BBC Radio 4's PM programme his relative was " an amazing woman " .
" I did sort of vaguely know when I was a boy about her existence .
The way I know about it , if you look on a library computer her name pops up .
" I 've always slightly wondered about her ever since I was a kid , it was amazing for me to come face to face with her . "
On meeting her , he said : " I think she was much less interested in what David or I do than in making the family connection and realising she was n't the last Miliband around and that there was a branch of the family in Britain . "

These are sunny , long - shadowed days in New York City ; September is the deceptively glorious season of loss .
The city is reborn but perhaps not quite rejuvenated :
Our slightly weary - looking mayor is running for a third term , looking not so much like a raffish billionaire as late - issue Mayor Wagner .
Our trademarked paragons of wealth and celebrity — Trumps , Hiltons , Diddys — seem either recession - worn or just a little silly .
The valiant New York Times , gallant as a Rudyard Kipling regiment , is fighting for its life , waiting for the bugle calls of reinforcements or mini-payments .
Wars grind on , the recession spits few gold coins , the one - woman ambition generator named Hillary R. Clinton is exporting her Lucy Van Pelt–like certitude to other nations , her replacement senator a genial mockery of the system .
The Yankees are winning , that ’s true , with a brutally efficient iteration of the team , but the long summer and the economy have draped gray through the town and even our lovely new mascot president seems careworn and drained .
But up on Broadway and 53rd Street at the Ed Sullivan Theater , a late - middle - aged man is leaping to work each late afternoon .
These days , when David Letterman goes to work on his program and the lights go on , he bounds across the stage with the long goofy strides of a Dr. Seuss gazelle .
The audience roars , and for one hour a day , the comedian is filled with hemoglobin and the sun shines upon him .
“ Well , hi , folks ! ” he says .
“ Hello ! ”
And then he snorts a little chuckle of hee - hee - hee in private , self - lacerating conversation with himself .
Four little words and a snort : marinated in history and sensibility , auguring the dread and pleasure that make up the little ongoing narrative of his life , the hour for which he ’s paid $ 32 million a year .
In a decade that has seen Tom Brokaw retire and Peter Jennings die , that has seen Carson fade from modern memory , David Letterman might be the last grown - up on network television .
The bad boy of Ball State , Huck Finn grown and weathered , David Letterman has become the national Daddy .
He is the ideal dad for the age — not a particularly pristine dad , or full of Cronkitean certitude , but confused and serious and full of conflict , anger , and ambiguity .
Letterman is not a fuzzy person ; working live he gives off the kind of dangerous electricity of stripped , dangling power lines .
But he is a fundamentally serious comedian holding onto the gig of his life — Late Show With David Letterman — the hour in his day that seems to give him purpose .
It has never been better .
He has done the old Dave stuff and plenty of it — stupid tricks , top - ten lists , sending dogs off diving boards into a pool on West 53rd Street , hitting fungoes with Mark Teixeira , whacking tennis balls with Andy Roddick , goading guffawing audience members , wheedling a bob - haired , head - bobbing Anna Wintour , doing a nutty tango on marriage with the impressively bonkers Anne Heche , calling out Biff Henderson , accidentally spraying a pregnant lady on the sidewalk by remote - controlled hose , showing blown - up diagrams of the tick - borne disease he contracted in a tree house , indulging Renée Zellweger — but it has been something more .
These ought to be bright , sunny days of sweet victory for Letterman .
He has run Late Show on CBS for sixteen years now , making a great deal of money for the network as its franchise player , and suddenly , he has been trouncing Conan O’Brien ’s Tonight Show on a regular basis .
But on September 14 , the game changes once more .
For anyone who cares , it ’s the landscape on which two comedy adversaries do some twilight battle as the ancient world of network television fades .
In a weird piece of television trigonometry , David Letterman will be taking on not only young Conan O’Brien but also , somewhat tangentially , his old Super Rival , Jay Leno , who — after fifteen years of generally chinning out Letterman at 11:35 p.m. — will be starting his new five - night - a- week strip show on NBC .
The Jay Leno Show is a kind of inverted Tonight Show , with celebrity guests — beginning opening night with Jerry Seinfeld — front - ended by Leno ’s monologue , with signature features like “ Jaywalking ” and “ Headlines ” news clips at the back end of the show .
He will have a nightly monologue and also install a racetrack near the studio so that Tom Cruise can race around and break speed records .
It will be American entertainment .
The Jay Leno
Show is a huge risk for NBC and an epochal statement in the history of network television .
Leno will be the first TV talk - show host to have a prime - time hour since Jack Paar did it Friday night at 10 p.m. in the early sixties .
It is also a move that many have said augurs the end of prime - time network television as the main stage of American culture .
Even if Leno succeeds triumphantly , he will have a difficult time averaging the almost 5 million viewers a night he had at The Tonight Show — compare that with the 40 million that ER once got at 10 p.m. on NBC — and an implicit statement by NBC Universal president and CEO Jeff Zucker that broadcast television is G.E. ’s glorious old frigate and cable its main business : Zucker suggested that a 1.8 Nielsen among young - adult viewers would be a “ home run . ”
That ’s a tenth of what a ten o’clock show used to get on network television when TV was TV .

Somehow , without anyone looking , David Letterman has superseded the usual TV categories of comic , or talk - show host , or broadcaster .
He paces the stage at night worrying about the Afghan - election recount and generally free - associating about the flies and vultures flapping around in his head .
His nightly broadcast from Broadway has become a weird and great American entity unto itself , a blurred throwback , an amalgam of the tradition he came from : Johnny Carson , Edward Murrow , Jack Paar .
And the most middle - American of talk - show hosts has become the most New York–centric .
He is also an increasingly interesting human being who has absorbed , not evaded , events and recorded , not denied , human experience .
Craggy , bewildered , irascible Dave , with his gray crew cut , designer suits , and white socks — a nightly mind - blowing image in HDTV — has become a persona , a distinctive agglomeration of character traits , even more than his idol Johnny Carson , much more like Carson ’s own idol , Jack Benny .
His monologues are indifferent as one - liners and jokes , but the character who delivers them is one memorable American .
He can reel off dozens of Obama jokes and McCain jokes and Paris Hilton jokes , but it is when Letterman begins to invert and mutter , when his personal neuroses and raw wounds are inflamed by the assaults of everyday life — and whose are n’t ? — that is when he becomes something more than a good comedian and something like the scarred protagonist of his own comic novel — a bewildered , gutty mid-lifer at the crash intersection of American culture .
Who ca n’t identify with that ?
Of course , he wo n’t cop to it .
But for sixteen years , he ’s been battling his archrival , Jay Leno .
The Letterman versus Leno battle , while not as direct as the Late Show versus Tonight Show 11:30 skirmish — is still the most fascinating conflict on television , part Muhammad Ali versus Joe Frazier , two former kid comics , Carson acolytes turned old pros who know each other ’s strengths and weaknesses , engaging each other once more , from an hour ’s distance .
It is the itch Letterman ca n’t quite scratch .
He has not let the NBC ten o’clock move alone in his monologues .
“ Spitzer is not only coming back , ” he said last Tuesday night , “ but they ’re gonna give him the 10 p.m. slot . ”
Letterman has anticipated the battle with riff after riff denigrating the ten o’clock slot but with a scintilla of obvious envy .
As Dave has become a stripped - raw Jack Benny , Leno has become late Bob Hope , playing the State Fair audiences .
“ Cat jokes work , ” The Wall Street Journal reported on him , as he tested new material in Boston this summer .
“ Edible underwear does n’t . ”
His incessant shtick and weightless political attacks have made him a risk - free franchise .
Of course President Obama visited his couch in Burbank .
“ I do n’t like the edgy comics out there , ” Deb Stoddard of Natick , Massachusetts , told the Journal .
But she loves Jay Leno .
Twenty - eight years ago , I was working on a profile of David Letterman , a young , scruffy comedian who at that point had retreated west to Los Angeles after the noble collapse of his critically appreciated , under - watched 10 a.m. talk show .
Letterman was considered the next big thing — NBC had decided to pay him a million dollars a year to wait for his next project .
He and his writers were advocates of what they called “ found comedy . ”
But suddenly he was lost .
He and I had just gone to the Improv in Hollywood and watched a lot of stand - up acts work .
When we came out , he looked down the street and saw a comedian with a spiky wave of black hair and a high whine of a voice surrounded by other comics .
“ That , ” said David Letterman , “ is the funniest stand - up guy working . ”
It was Jay Leno doing an ad hoc routine on the street corner : Pat Cooper , the great malevolent Vegas comedian , had been on Tom Snyder ’s late - night show the night before and attacked Cher , Tom Jones , and Tony Bennett frontally enough to make sure he would not work west of Allentown , Pennsylvania , for a long time .
Leno pantomimed Pat Cooper taking out a razor and slitting his wrists and his own throat as he gave the interview .
It was deeply , viciously funny , and Letterman was floored by it .
But neither he nor Leno could have known at that moment that it was a predictive moment and a cautionary one .
In the years following , Leno took The Tonight Show and , after a bumpy start , sailed above and ahead of Letterman ’s Late Show on CBS to become the processed food of American comedy .
In 1982 , Letterman got the 12:30 a.m. slot at NBC and changed American comedy .
Leno , meanwhile , became not the King of Late Night as Carson had been but a kind of Viceroy , a holding pattern that became a habit and then a long - term habit , benign and risk - free .
He seemed genuinely nice — he once compared himself to Old Fezziwig in A Christmas Carol — building a success but rarely flooring it with the show .
He was , he liked to say , a “ big - tent guy . ”
When NBC and Carson Productions gave Letterman his show , they believed they were establishing another NBC star ; they did n’t understand that they were laying the groundwork for a pervasive culture of irony .
Letterman ’s program created a sensibility that permeated TV , movies , literature , music , art , and magazines :
The ceaseless joke of cultural debunking became the surgical tool that guided a generation of college students to strip the showbiz skin of the past 50 years .
Letterman played disgusted consumer and truth teller ; “ Oh , that ’s good , ” he would say .
Or occasionally just , “ It ’s crap , ladies and gentlemen ! ”
Long before he took Zsa Zsa Gabor to fast - food restaurants , he hauled out an actor named Calvert DeForest to play Larry “ Bud ” Melman as a kind of affectless piece of human tofu in the Letterman soup , reading his lines atonally and playing Santa Claus to slightly horrified children .
In 1985 , he made an enemy of Bryant Gumbel by turning a bullhorn on an outside taping of the Today show .
Letterman established himself decisively on April 8 , 1986 , when he turned up in the lobby of the G.E. Building with a fruit basket to meet NBC ’s new owner and was thrown out by security .
He became the voice and the face of affectionate disaffection , so that when , six years later , Carson retired , NBC anointed not the scruffy jester but the smoother ward politician , Jay Leno — a man who could be counted on to work the affiliates .
As you know , Jay Leno got the gig and delivered .
But the choice hurt Letterman deeply :
When in 2000 he had quintuple - bypass surgery and returned to work after five and a half weeks , one of his first jokes was , “ Bypass surgery , it ’s when doctors surgically create new blood flow to your heart …
A bypass is what happened to me when I did n’t get The Tonight Show . ”
David Letterman has become the national daddy — not a particularly pristine dad , or full of Cronkitean certitude , but confused and serious and full of anger and ambiguity .
Nevertheless , a lot of his pain was self - inflicted .
He moved three blocks west and three blocks north from Rockefeller Center to the old Ed Sullivan Theater , which CBS renovated for him in 1993 and where he had a short period of intense success and then a long period of mild self - destruction .
At first , he could do no wrong on CBS .
Every joke hit , and he was trouncing The Tonight Show .
But then some mysterious mechanism kicked in , as though he could not endure his success .
From a beautifully tuned machine , the springs popped and it seemed to bottom out on a strange night in which he began literally beating the stuffing out of a David Letterman mannequin onstage .
Then something amazing happened to David Letterman , some weird combination of history and biography that moved him from a distinctive oddity of American comedy to something that came strangely close to greatness .
It may have happened in three spasms of event .
One thing was his heart surgery elicited a depth of emotion from him that few suspected he had .
The night he came back , he looked cadaverously — almost dangerously — thin but throbbingly exuberant .
The irony had departed , as had his emotional detachment .
Letterman still was n’t sentimental , but he seemed suddenly grateful for both his life and his gig .
Another was his return to the air on September 17 , 2001 ; he was the first entertainer back on , and his extemporaneous , husky - voiced monologue was a landmark in broadcasting .
“ As I understand it … we ’re told that they were zealots , ” he said that night , “ fueled by religious fervor .
And if you live to be 1,000 years old , will that make any sense to you ?
Will that make any goddamn sense ? ”
It also fused him to New York City .
The third may have been this year .
It was the year in which he had a protracted political participation , bringing the Republican nominee for president , John McCain , to his couch in contrition for having lied to him , the year in which he drew the mad ire of Sarah Palin of Alaska for a sloppy burlesque joke about her daughter for which he has performed a kind of anti-contrition after Governor Palin ’s attempts to somehow stitch Letterman to the Eastern Media Establishment and to knit it into a combination of conservatism and feminism .
He apologized immediately , but his long recoil has been a giddy froth of nightly retribution .
And he does not appear sated .
“ At one of these town - hall meetings , ” Letterman said August 27 , pacing back and forth , “ McCain had to have a crazy woman removed by security …
And I ’m thinking , well geez , he should have done that a year ago . ”
It did n’t reek of self - righteousness ; he seemed to be protecting his program like a frontier landowner with a rifle .
He was n’t wrong — the right wing was getting ready to light bonfires and demonize him .
There actually was a Fire Dave rally .
Maybe it was n’t a good idea to say that Sarah Palin ’s daughter had been knocked up by Alex Rodriguez during the seventh - inning stretch .
The first night of the controversy , he said , “ You know , this very well could be my last show .
I do n’t know why we all find that amusing . ”
Then later : “ Would I do anything to advocate or contribute to underage sexual abuse or misconduct ?
Absolutely not .
Not in a thousand years !
Look at me .
Do I look like I ’m trying to make trouble ? ”
He looked genuinely , deeply upset .
A couple of days passed .
CBS affiliates roiled and yahoos wrote to Les Moonves .
Letterman made a second apology more gauged to the affiliates .
When Sarah Palin grudgingly accepted the apology , she did it through Fox News .
But he snapped back .
He seemed to compensate with a new onslaught of Palin jokes , then back to Dick Cheney for a comfort stop .
Mostly he had just entered some stage of his career as a kind of crabby eccentric , complaining about his new wife ’s friends , setting up tales of sleeping in the tree house with his 5 - year - old son , Harry , and picking up a virus that brought him into work for four nights with a 103 - degree fever .
He put himself in a video triptych with Regis Philbin and Larry King as the three oldest men in TV .
He imagined being elder - abused by subway bullies and imagined the distaste with which his open - heart - surgery scars would be viewed on the beach .
He had become something out of James Thurber or Twain , a satisfyingly complete humorist , telling satisfying character tales that did n’t seem to have an endpoint .
His pursuit of dinner with Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey on Martha ’s Vineyard spanned many nights , epic in its statement of Dave ’s injury .
“ Oprah — a national treasure , ” he said , looking us straight in the camera .
“ Me—a … guy with a television show . ”
A look of confusion and hurt narcissism filled every crevice of his 62 - year - old face .
“ I ’ll tell you what I ’m going to do , I ’m going to borrow a busboy ’s uniform and find out where Obama and Oprah are eating dinner and then … ” He pantomimed carrying the tray over to the table where they were eating , sure that he would then be invited to sit down with them .
Later in the week , he insisted that the Secret Service had banned him from the entire island and that he had to explain it to his son Harry , who had his heart set on a shell - seeking vacation .
Jack Paar used to do something like this on The Tonight Show in the fifties , the program that personalized and revolutionized late - night television .
Paar would shock and delight his audience with his persona — stuttering and assuring them by putting his hand on his chest , “ This is true , I swear , I mean I could not make this up .
I kid you not ” — then telling a story about his daughter shopping for a training bra or what he thought of Fidel Castro , or he would self - flagellate his own neurotic inability to negotiate modern life .
Johnny Carson — mentholated and surgical — followed Paar in 1962 , and it was he , of course , whom Letterman idolized .
Finally , Letterman had merged Steve Allen ’s absurdity , Jack Paar ’s neurotic confessionalism , and Carson ’s topicality .
The Conan part of the battle is easier .
Dave has become the tenured Ol’ Professor of American comedy , and Conan O’Brien , brilliant and delightful as he is , seems to be playing the graduate student .
On August 31 , as Letterman was sending dogs off a diving board and running through a bramble bush of madness with Howie Mandel , Conan was struggling manfully with the deliriously funny but audience - inscrutable Norm MacDonald , who had silenced his audience by performing a cruel mockery of Jay Leno ’s “ Headlines ” routine , the deadness of which was the joke itself .
O’Brien , on his magnificent new set in a beautiful new suit , was almost breaking a sweat and visibly exhaled when the segment was done .
Over on CBS , Dave was giggling and whinnying away .
It ’s a late - inning victory , but apparently Letterman is incapable on some level of believing it or accepting it .
And the numbers are not unambiguous :
Dave is winning significantly , but he seems to be the King of Geezer Nation ; Letterman is beating Conan by close to a million viewers in the Nielsens despite O’Brien ’s legitimate demographic claims .
Conan has time on his side .
Letterman will almost certainly hang it up at the end of this contract .
He ’ll be 65 in 2012 , and Carson hung it up at 66 in 1992 .
When he does , he will have been on late night for 30 years , the same length of time as Johnny Carson .
When Carson died , David Letterman gave the classiest tribute to the man to whom he said he owed his career , an elegant Viking funeral .
He came out onstage and did his monologue brilliantly , squeezing it for each laugh he could , returning to the desk and eulogizing his mentor .
He then told the audience — separating the laughs from the attendant sentimentality — that each joke he had told had been written and submitted to the show by Carson himself in the previous months .
He may have been losing to Leno in the ratings , but he K.O. ’d him on lineage .
In 1895 , Mark Twain , another dapper crabapple discoursing on politics and society , prepared a worldwide lecture tour that he began in New York City — actually using inmates at Randalls Island House of Refuge as his warm - up audience .
A little like Letterman complaining about Oprah and Obama , in a modern nod to the coming new century , he planned to put up photos of all the celebrities who had decided not to show at his first lecture : General Sherman , General Lee , Gladstone , and Disraeli .
“ Every one of these illustrious men was sorry , and sent regrets ; even lamentations . ”
Then the speech went : “ As soon as a man recognizes that he has drifted into age , he gets reminiscent .
He wants to talk and talk ; and not about the present or the future , but about his old times .
For there is where the pathos of his life lies — and the charm of it . ”
David Letterman has hit the part of life where he wants to talk and talk .
But he seems to be still speaking of the present and the future .
He is 62 and has chosen not to drift but to floor it , a boy of autumn , Huck Finn in September , the last American codger , the crabby voice of American reason , heedless , uncompromising , and driven .
Long may he chortle .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup finds a new low of 44 % of Americans saying the laws covering firearm sales should be made more strict .
That is down 5 points in the last year and 34 points from the high of 78 % recorded the first time the question was asked , in 1990 .
Today , Americans are as likely to say the laws governing gun sales should be kept as they are now ( 43 % ) as to say they should be made more strict .
Until this year , Gallup had always found a significantly higher percentage advocating stricter laws .
At the same time , 12 % of Americans believe the laws should be less strict , which is low in an absolute sense but ties the highest Gallup has measured for this response .
These results are based on Gallup 's annual Crime Poll , conducted Oct.1 - 4 this year .
" Compared with views in 2000 , each major demographic or attitudinal subgroup has shown a shift toward a more pro-gun stance on the question about whether gun laws should be more strict or less strict . "
The poll also shows a new low in the percentage of Americans favoring a ban on handgun possession except by the police and other authorized persons , a question that dates back to 1959 .
Only 28 % now favor such a ban .
The high point in support for a handgun - possession ban was 60 % in the initial measurement in 1959 .
Since then , less than a majority has been in favor , and support has been below 40 % since December 1993 .
The trends on the questions about gun-sale laws and a handgun - possession ban indicate that Americans ' attitudes have moved toward being more pro-gun rights .
But this is not due to a growth in personal gun ownership , which has held steady around 30 % this decade , or to an increase in household gun ownership , which has been steady in the low 40 % range since 2000 .
Nor are more pro-gun attitudes a specific reaction to the election of a Democratic president , Barack Obama , whose support for gun rights is questioned at times .
Though the trends on both the gun-sales and the gun-possession measures have moved in a slightly more pro-gun direction this year compared to last , both trends had been moving in that direction during the latter part of the Bush administration , which strongly supported gun rights .
Rather , Americans as a whole may just be more accepting of gun rights now than in the past .
Compared with views in 2000 , each major demographic or attitudinal subgroup has shown a shift toward a more pro-gun stance on the question about whether gun laws should be more strict or less strict .
( The results are similar on the question of a ban on handgun possession , with nearly every major demographic group less supportive of a ban now than at the start of the decade . )
Even with the change , there are some subgroups among whom a majority continues to favor stricter gun laws , including liberals ( 67 % ) , Democrats ( 66 % ) , Easterners ( 59 % ) , gun non-owners ( 57 % ) , postgraduates ( 55 % ) , women ( 55 % ) , and nonwhites ( 51 % ) .
The groups least in favor of stricter gun laws are gun owners ( 20 % ) , Republicans ( 28 % ) , conservatives ( 30 % ) , and men ( 33 % ) .
Bottom Line
Americans continue to trend toward holding attitudes that are more in favor of gun rights , and Gallup today finds new low points in favor of gun control on two separate measures dating back at least two decades .
While solidly against a ban on handgun possession , Americans are nonetheless about equally likely to say they favor stricter laws on firearm sales as to say these laws should not change .
Still , the current poll marks the first time Gallup has not found a significantly higher proportion of Americans preferring tighter gun-sale regulations .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,013 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 1 - 4 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
“ We are heartened to see so many corporate citizens step up in support of our campaign against Glenn Beck , ” said James Rucker , executive director of ColorOfChange.org .
“ Their action sends a clear a message to Glenn Beck : Broadcasters should n’t abuse the privilege they enjoy by spewing dangerous and racially charged hate language over the air .
No matter their political affiliation , hate language does n’t belong in our national dialogue . ”
“ Walmart [ sic ] today confirmed the retailer pulled ads from the Glenn Beck show on August 3rd , ” said David Tovar , a spokesperson for Wal - Mart , in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
“ While advertising on Fox is part of our communication plan , we had not requested time on Glenn Beck ’s show specifically , ” said Carolyn Castel , Vice President of Corporate Communications for CVS Caremark , in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
“ We have instructed our advertising agency to inform Fox to ensure Glenn Beck ’s program is not part of our advertising plan . ”
“ Our position is simple , ” Castel continued .
“ We support vigorous debate , especially around policy issues that affect millions of Americans , but we expect it to be informed , inclusive and respectful , in keeping with our company ’s core values and commitment to diversity . ”
In an email exchange with ColorOfChange.org , Lisa Svac Hawks , Director of Public Relations for Best Buy , stated that any advertisements for Best Buy that were placed on Glenn Beck ’s show were done so in error .
Svac
Hawks pledged that Best Buy will correct any mistakes made .
“ We did not specifically place our ad on the show , ” said Amanda Borichevsky , a spokesperson for Travelocity in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
“ We buy ads in bulk and then they are placed somewhat randomly .
However , we have now specifically asked that our ads do not appear during this show . ”
“ We reviewed our commercial schedule , and based on your feedback , we ’ve put any programming featuring Glenn Beck on our “ do not air ” list , ” said Aziz Mottiwala , Senior Marketing Manager for Allergan , in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
“ This means that you will no longer see any Restasis ads during programming featuring Glenn Beck .
Thanks again for bringing this to our attention . ”
“ Ally advertises on a broad spectrum of programs to reach our potential customers , ” said a Customer Care Representative for Ally Bank .
“ Our advertising is not an endorsement of editorial content on any program .
We have ceased to advertise on the Glenn Beck program . ”
In a phone conversation with Dwayne Sigler , Senior Vice President of Marketing for Broadview Security Systems , Sigler told ColorOfChange.org that Broadview ’s advertising is bought based on network , not particular programs , but that “ given the considerations , we have requested of Fox News not to include us in the rotation that would have our commercials running on Glenn Beck ’s show . ”
“ … We are no longer airing our commercials on the Glenn Beck Show … ” said Mary Beth Mayer , spokesperson for Re-Bath , in a phone message to ColorOfChange.org .
The heroic Color of Change effort to get advertisers to back away from underwriting the venomous racism of Fox News ' worst inciter , Glenn Beck , is really bearing fruit .
Yesterday Wal - Mart , Best Buy , CVS and 5 other mainstream advertisers asked that their ads no longer by run on his program .
That brings the total to twenty national advertisers who have now dumped Beck .
No wonder he 's weeping on the air all the time !

Not surprisingly , we have found that over the years parents want to take care of their children more than anything else , but their ability is often frustrated by other burdensome debt .
The bankruptcy laws can help you accomplish this goal by placing support ahead of most other debts .
Domestic Support Obligations
Child support and alimony are by and large considered Domestic Support Obligations and are not dischargeable under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 .
Usually this support comes in the form of a weekly cash payment to provide for their necessities .
Other times it may come in other forms , such as debt assumptions , school tuition , life insurance , etc .
We can help you identify what is a Domestic Support Obligation and what is not and the dischargeable possibilities under different types of bankruptcies .

Protection Under Chapter 13
Collection of these support obligations can be funneled through Chapter 13 , both making a record of payment while protecting you from levies or other collection efforts .
Arrears can be paid over a period of up to 60 months and longer by consent .
We can shape a plan that both protects you and accomplishes your goal to care for your children and meet your support obligations .
Protecting Your License
Tennessee law provides that your driver ’s license can be revoked if you fail to pay your child support .
The loss of your license could rob you of your ability to support your child and maintain payments on your car , home or other necessities .
Chapter 13 is a good option to consider to protect your license when faced with these collection tactics .
Property Division
Under Chapter 13 , obligations considered to be property division can sometimes be discharged .
Property settlements and orders of the divorce court requiring you to pay joint debts are sometimes dischargeable when it does not have the effect of providing for the other spouse ’s necessities .
For example , an obligation to pay the car note of the other spouse would normally be considered support and nondischargeable ; however , the obligation to protect your ex-spouse who co-signed your car loan may be dischargeable .
We will help you consider all of the factors to help you make the best decision about which chapter to file .
If the obligation to pay a debt is considered support , you could pay this debt under Chapter 13 and prohibit the creditor from collecting from your spouse or ex-spouse .
Payment of these co-signed debts that are in the nature of support can often be stretched over 60 months .
Help Through Chapter 7
Both obligations for support and property division survive a Chapter 7 discharge .
The help available under Chapter 7 is more limited than what is available under Chapter 13 .
However , discharging other debts could free up enough income to make paying these Domestic Support Obligation affordable .
Therefore , Chapter 7 should never be overlooked .

A federal judge in San Francisco refused Wednesday to dismiss a lawsuit challenging California 's Proposition 8 , the voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage , and ordered a trial on whether the measure denies fundamental rights to gays and lesbians .
Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker has said repeatedly that a trial is needed to resolve disputes that may determine the measure 's constitutionality , so Wednesday 's ruling did not surprise either side .
But the breadth of his decision was a boost for gay rights advocates , who argue that Prop. 8 unconstitutionally discriminates against gays , is rooted in anti-homosexual bias and violates the right to marry the partner of one 's choice .
Walker left all those issues on the table , rejecting arguments by Prop .
8 's sponsors that higher courts had already resolved them .
Among the questions to be answered , he said from the bench , is " whether Prop. 8 was passed with discriminatory intent . "
Voters on trial ?
Lawyers for Protect Marriage , the religious conservative coalition that campaigned for the November constitutional amendment , say the measure had a clear purpose - to restore the traditional male - female definition of marriage .
They say opponents ' claims of a hidden anti-gay agenda are both unfounded and legally irrelevant .
" Voters who passed Prop. 8 are essentially on trial in this case , accused of being irrational and bigoted , " Andrew Pugno , a lawyer for the sponsors , said after the hearing .
Protect Marriage is challenging
Walker 's order that the sponsors must disclose internal campaign strategy documents , which opponents hope will reveal plans to appeal to voter prejudice against gays .
Review of order
A federal appeals court 's decision to review that order would delay the trial , now scheduled to start Jan. 11 .
It will be the nation 's first trial on the validity of a law against same - sex marriage .
Prop. 8 amended the state Constitution to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman , overturning a May 2008 state Supreme Court ruling that allowed gay and lesbian couples to marry .
The state 's high court upheld the measure in May while allowing 18,000 same - sex couples who married before the election to remain legally wed .
The court 's ruling was based on state law and did not address any U.S. constitutional issues .
Plaintiffs in the federal case - two same - sex couples , a gay - rights group and the city of San Francisco - claim Prop.
8 discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation and gender and interferes with the right to marry one 's chosen partner .
Minnesota case
The initiative 's sponsors argued that the U.S. Supreme Court validated bans on same - sex unions in 1972 by rejecting a challenge to a Minnesota law defining marriage as being between a man and a woman .
The court did not spell out its reasoning but issued a brief order that said opponents had not raised any substantial federal questions .
But Walker said prevailing legal doctrine has changed since 1972 .
He cited Supreme Court rulings since then that condemned discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender and overturned state laws against homosexual conduct .
Another central issue is whether Prop. 8 should be judged like laws that discriminate against historically persecuted groups .
Courts generally overturn such laws unless government can show a compelling need for them .
Rational basis
Charles Cooper , lead attorney for Protect Marriage , noted that the Supreme Court has never categorized gays and lesbians as a persecuted group , entitled to the same legal protection as racial and religious minorities .
That means Prop. 8 must be upheld if voters had any rational basis for approving it , he said .
He cited several grounds for such a finding - the traditional definition of marriage , the ability of opposite - sex couples to conceive children naturally , and the voters ' decision to wait and see how same - sex marriages work out in other states before allowing them in California .
Gays ' political power
But Walker said federal courts have n't resolved the standard for judging laws that treat heterosexuals and homosexuals differently .
The answer , he said , could be determined by testimony on such topics as how much political power gays and lesbians hold and to what degree they are discriminated against .
Even if it 's rational for the state to promote marriage among opposite - sex couples , the judge asked Cooper , how would that goal be impeded by allowing same - sex couples to wed ?
" The answer is , I do n't know , " the attorney replied .
But he said it does n't matter , because it 's up to Prop.
8 's opponents to show that the law is irrational .
The price of oil has reached a new high for 2009 , continuing its recent rise on the back of the weak US dollar and strong US company results .
US crude settled up $ 1.08 at $ 79.61 in New York trading .
Meanwhile London Brent crude rose 78 cents to at $ 77.77
Oil prices surged last week , as encouraging US bank results fuelled optimism for the global economy .
Analysts said the short - term direction of oil would depend on the dollar and the next round of corporate results .
And there was much caution that the price rises seen in recent days could easily be reversed .
" The spectacular gains were overwhelmingly driven by financials and market optimism rather than fundamentals , " said JBC Energy in Vienna , adding there was " no reason " why prices should not return to between $ 65 and $ 75 where they had been for several weeks .
They believe the price of oil is more likely to drop back rather than move higher once fundamental factors re-establish themselves as the main driver of the oil price .
These factors include spare capacity , low profit margins for refiners , a " massive stock surplus " of products such as diesel and heating oil , and lacklustre demand among industrialised nations , JBC argued .
The dollar lost more ground against the euro in early trading , falling to $ 1.4940 , just short of a 14 - month low of $ 1.4967 seen last week .
Eating 100g of pure liquorice a week could affect a child 's development Pregnant women who eat large amounts of liquorice could negatively affect their child 's intelligence and behaviour , according to research .
Experts from Edinburgh and Helsinki universities studied eight - year - olds born in Finland , where consumption of liquorice among young women is common .
The children of women who ate a lot of liquorice when pregnant did not perform as well as other youngsters in tests .
Researchers said a component in liquorice may impair the placenta .
They said the component - glycyrrhizin - may allow stress hormones to cross from the mother to the baby .
This suggests the importance of the placenta in preventing stress hormones that may affect cognitive development getting through to the baby
Professor Jonathan Seckl
University of Edinburgh
High levels of such hormones , known as glucocorticoids , are thought to affect foetal brain development and have been linked to behavioural disorders in children in previous studies .
Of the children who took part in the Finnish study , 64 were exposed to high levels of glycyrrhizin in liquorice , 46 to moderate levels and 211 to low levels .
They were tested on a range of cognitive functions including vocabulary , memory and spatial awareness .
Behaviour was assessed using an in - depth questionnaire completed by the mother .
Shorter pregnancies
The results suggested that women who ate more than 500mg of glycyrrhizin per week - found in the equivalent of 100g of pure liquorice - were more likely to have children with lower intelligence levels and more behavioural problems .
The eight - year - olds were more likely to have poor attention spans and show disruptive behaviour such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , the researchers said .
Professor Jonathan Seckl , from Edinburgh University 's centre for cardiovascular science , said : " This shows that eating liquorice during pregnancy may affect a child 's behaviour or IQ and suggests the importance of the placenta in preventing stress hormones that may affect cognitive development getting through to the baby . "
The research comes after a study which suggested that liquorice consumption was also linked to shorter pregnancies .
The results of the study are published in the American Journal of Epidemiology .

The incident took place on the flight from Sharjah to Delhi last Saturday
A mid-air scuffle between pilots and cabin crew of an Air India flight last Saturday did not endanger the 106 passengers on board , the company says .
It says its preliminary enquiry has established " that the cockpit was not left unmanned at any stage of the flight " from Sharjah to Delhi .
One of the pilots and a cabin crew member have been suspended , its says .
The brawl is said to have begun when a female flight attendant claimed the pilots had sexually harassed her .
In a statement issued on Tuesday , Air India said a five - member committee investigating the altercation would determine " the extent of involvement and culpability " of the individuals concerned .
Counter - claim
The incident took place over Pakistan on the Air India IC 884 flight from Sharjah , in the United Arab Emirates , to Delhi .
One pilot and one air hostess reportedly suffered bruises , as punches were thrown .
The cabin crew alleged that pilots sexually had harassed the 24 - year - old flight attendant , who filed a complaint once the plane landed .
Indian police registered the case against the pilots for " outraging the modesty of a woman " , The Times of India reported .
But the newspaper said the pilots had made a counter - claim , saying that the harassment claim was an attempt to divert attention from accusations of misconduct against a male flight attendant .
Air India said shortly afterwards that it had grounded all the staff involved .
The president just announced that as of Monday , the ban on HIV - positive visitors , tourists and immigrants will formally come to an end .
There are 60 days before the new rule comes into effect .
But after that , people with HIV will be treated in exactly the same way as any other person with a serious illness - according to science , not politics , and following the logic of reason , not fear .
The ban has been in existence for 22 years , pioneered by Jesse Helms , resisted by the first Bush , signed into law by Bill Clinton , legislatively repealed by George W. Bush and now administratively ended by Barack Obama .
In an age when bipartisanship is out of fashion , the repeal was led by Gordon Smith and John Kerry , with backing from many Republicans and Democrats .
The work of staffers - Rob Epplin and Alex Nunez , in particular - was invaluable .
The support of Immigration Equality was vital .
The lobbying of HRC was an important late development .
The readers of the Dish also helped raise awareness of this and emailed Congress to move it forward .
It means a huge amount to many people unknown to you and me but struggling in ways you and I cannot truly imagine .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
For me , it is the end of 16 years of profound insecurity .
Like many others , my application for permanent residence and citizenship can go forward .
And I will be able to see my family again in England and know that my HIV will not force me to choose between my husband and the country I have come to call my home .
There is no price to be put on that .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Gender Bending
That ’s my face watching the catfight
I started a new job on Monday , thank you very much .
And while it is in the basement of an episcopalian church and I can hear organs playing funeral tunes while I ’m writing emails , it ’s not a bad gig .
Strange , to be sure .
So strange , in fact , that there is no Men ’s Bathroom .
The organization is so small they ’ve never had a man work there , and so the Men ’s room , which would have been conveniently located in the nearest hallway , serves as the storage closet for old T - shirts and letterhead .
There may have been an Easy button lying around the toilet seat , but I did n’t investigate too much .
Here ’s the kicker : I was never explicity told I could use the Women ’s bathroom , just the “ bathroom down the hall . ”
So I passed the Women ’s bathroom and walked down the hall , past doors leading to church group meeting rooms , and found nary a Men ’s or unisex toilet .
I naturally assumed my boss meantÃ‚ the Women ’s bathroom .
On my first day , I took two shits in there .
On the second , I was clogged , and on the third , I clogged it …
There are different levels of fear we experience in our lives .
I ’m sure this goes up there with being selected in the Vietnam draft and realizing you ’ll be getting shot at in the jungle in a few weeks ’ time .
Being discovered walking out of a Women ’s bathroom after it ’s been clogged by a boss who probably did n’t intend you to be there in the first place is not something you want to have happen in your first week of work .
I think there comes a time in every man ’s life that God bestows upon him the knowledge of professional plumbing skills , somehow transformed by dire need .
I was blessed on this day .
With a turd that had been stewing inside me for 2 hours causing sweat marks on my khakis , I gave no thought to the jostling sounds of the pipes when I entered .
Hell , if I had given a second ’s thought I would have shat myself for the umpteenth time this year .
But I flushed it good .
Out of sight , out of mind , right ?
NO !
Because now I am stuck in a situation where I have no idea if I was given permission to poop in this bathroom , let alone wash my hands in there .
It is the only bathroom on the floor and , I was told , I would have to use the Church bathroom if I wanted some privacy .
As a jew , that does n’t feel quite right .
I can , however , let all you men in on a little secret : it feels good to take a shit in a girls ’ bathroom .
Just the thought of some prissy woman coming in after me and blaming it on another woman makes everything slide out a little bit easier .
Maybe my stinky , streaky poo will cause a catfight , as one coworker blames the other of leaving a godawful stench .
And the other is so offended she thinks of nothing else to do but grab the accuser ’s breasts and suckle at them in frustration …
But I still have to worry about splashing , leaving the toilet seat up , and all the other annoying giveaways like pubic hair stuck on the bowl .
The grass is always greener , right ?
Here are some unintended consequences ...
According to the NAR , the " first - time " homebuyer tax credit will lead to an additional 350 thousand homes sold in 2009 .
As I 've mentioned before , this tax credit is inefficient and poorly targeted , costing taxpayers about $ 43,000 for each additional home sold .
And where are those 350 thousand buyers coming from ?
My guess is most were probably renters ( a few might have been living in their parent 's basements ! ) .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
And what will be the impact on the rental vacancy rate ?
The rental vacancy rate was already at a record 10.6 % in Q2 2009 .
Some quick math suggests the tax credit will push the national vacancy rate above 11 % soon .
And that means even more pressure on rents ( rents are already falling ) .
This is good news for renters , but this will also lead to more apartment defaults , higher default rates for apartment CMBS , and more losses for small and regional banks .
And falling rents are already pushing down owners ' equivalent rent ( OER ) , and my guess is OER will probably turn negative soon .
Since OER is the largest component of CPI ( and almost 40 % of core CPI ) , this will push down CPI for some time .
Extend the tax credit and we might be looking at the core CPI showing deflation .
Welcome to the Fed 's nightmare .
The other day I was looking around at “ tree ” model libraries for Django , and I noticed that there are an awful lot of algorithms people use to manage hierarchies in SQL out there , but the one that is simplest ( at least in my view ) seems to not be ...

After the mortgage business imploded last year , Wall Street investment banks began searching for another big idea to make money .
They think they may have found one .
The bankers plan to buy “ life settlements , ” life insurance policies that ill and elderly people sell for cash — $ 400,000 for a $ 1 million policy , say , depending on the life expectancy of the insured person .
Then they plan to “ securitize ” these policies , in Wall Street jargon , by packaging hundreds or thousands together into bonds .
They will then resell those bonds to investors , like big pension funds , who will receive the payouts when people with the insurance die .
The earlier the policyholder dies , the bigger the return — though if people live longer than expected , investors could get poor returns or even lose money .
Five weeks ago , Los Angeles–based sperm bank California Cryobank launched a celebrity - inspired “ Donor Look - A - Likes ” service , which allowed clients to search for donors according to what celebrities the donors most resemble .
The service , which is a catchy way of answering the question of what donors look like without having to actually reveal their pictures , was an instant hit :
The company ’s website was inundated by inquiries ( 300 percent more than usual ) from women who want their artificially inseminated progeny to look like David Beckham or Jon Hamm .
Now California Cryobank is diversifying again , with a move to New York — they ’ll be taking over Park Avenue Fertility , a small operation that had previously been mostly in the business of testing sperm rather than hawking it .
It will be a few months before California Cryobank hangs its sign over the door , but New York women in the market for some A - list - looking semen can start searching online now .
The company ’s process of attributing a celebrity to a donor could never be termed scientific .
Male and female employees of varying ages make up the assigning committee .
They meet , put each donor ’s picture up on a projector , and then argue about whom he looks like .
Scott Brown , California Cryobank ’s communications manager , says it ’s more complex than it seems .
“ There ’s a lot that goes into it .
It ’s not just sitting in a room deciding who looks like Ben Affleck , ” he says .
“ What sounded really easy got complicated when we realized that people see people in completely different ways .
So we ’re very concerned about misleading clients .
One rule we made was that a donor never gets just one celeb .
And one of our representatives can always get on the phone and explain . ”
So far regular - guy - type actors Paul Walker , Greg Grunberg ( from Heroes and Alias ) , Scott Caan , and Ben Affleck have garnered the most interest ; Brown says guys with dark hair and blue eyes do best .
Sportsmen are popular , too — Brett Favre , basketballer Luke Walton , and Jeremy Shockey in particular .
If C - and D - list studs are more your style , Lance Bass , Adam Carolla , and Joe Rogan types make the celeb search engine , too .
Manhattan ’s sperm banks do n’t seem to be bothered by the company ’s move east — or by its gimmick .
“ The idea of matching [ donors ] to some ideal has always been a goal .
Different companies have different approaches , ” says Stephen Feldschuh , chief operating officer of Idant Laboratories , a bank that sits in the shadow of the Empire State Building .
“ I ’m not saying it ’s a bad thing or a good thing .
If they ’re comfortable with it , that ’s fine .
It ’s not something we ’re considering . ”
Ty Kaliski , director of operations for Cryo International , is similarly unperturbed .
“ It ’s something I never thought of .
If it gives clients another picture , that ’s great .
With us it ’s more important to speak directly to the client about the personality .
And all of our clients focus on the health aspect . ”
Ah , yes , the health of the donor — should n’t that be utmost in the minds of California Cryobank clients , too ?
“ I think in their heads they know the medical history is most important , ” Brown says .
“ But ultimately we ’re all interested in what someone looks like .
It ’s what we do when we ’re dating or meet someone .
I did n’t ask my wife her medical history before I decided to marry her . ”

NEW YORK , Oct. 19 ( UPI ) --
Losing a house to foreclosure has become an increasingly prevalent factor at U.S. homeless shelters , a national study revealed .
The survey conducted for several groups including the National Coalition for the Homeless shows that an average of 10 percent of homeless people helped by various social service agencies in 2008 said they had lost their homes to bank actions , The New York Times reported Monday .

As recently as 2006 , foreclosure was a rare explanation for homelessness , the Times said .
In 2008 , in the Midwest , 15 percent of homeless people attributed foreclosures to the reason for their plight , the study said .
" These families never needed help before .
They have n't a clue about where to go , and they have all sorts of humiliation issues .
They do n't even know what to say , what to ask for , " said Larry Haynes , executive director of Mercy House in Santa Ana , Calif .
Rick Cole , city manager in Ventura , Calif. , said , " we 've seen a rise in people sleeping in their cars , " noting , " some are foreclosed former homeowners , and some could n't afford their rent . "
China Ditches the Dollar
Walking the long , windy road toward the demise of the dollar , we spy another mile marker today : China is officially putting their money where their mouth is .
After clamoring for a reserve alternative all year , the Chinese government agreed to a $ 50 billion currency - diverse deal with the IMF today .
Back in June , the deal seemed imminent .
This morning , it finally came to fruition .
In their deal with the IMF — the first of its kind for any nation , ever — China buys $ 50 billion worth of bonds denominated in Special Drawing Rights , which will represent a basket of global monies .
( That basket will be a split between the dollar , euro , pound and yen … not exactly the gems of the global currency batch . )
Still , it ’s probably a win for China on several fronts :
They get to ditch the dollar ( sort of ) without making a big geopolitical stink .
In fact , since their funds will prop up the IMF ’s rescue coffer , China gets to play the global good guy for once — while also purchasing some political influence over the IMF .
Russia and Brazil have each promised to buy $ 10 billion of these bonds , as well .
Hedge funds run by women fall half as much during financial crisis as those managed by men , research shows
Hedge funds run by women have fallen only half as much during the financial crisis as those managed by men , research shows .
The value of female - managed funds dropped by 9.6 % in the past year , compared with a plunge of 19 % for the rest , according to Chicago - based Hedge Fund Research .
Women investment managers also performed better in general over the past decade , with an average annual return of just over 9 % , while hedge funds overall delivered 5.82 % .
These findings were showcased in a research paper presented at the Women 's Forum for the Economy and Society at Deauville at the weekend .
They are supported by Hedge Fund Research 's " diversity index " , which tracks the performance of other minority groups along with women .
Funds run by women accounted for roughly 50 % of the index , which returned an average of 8.21 % a year since 2003 , compared with 5.98 % for the field as a whole .
Despite women 's apparent prowess , in early 2008 they were running just 3 % of the $ 1.9tn then invested in hedge funds .
Female hedgies such as Leda Braga at London - based BlueCrest Capital Management remain in a tiny minority .
The paper by the US National Council for Research on Women says that women also suffer " capital punishment " , finding it harder to raise the finance to start up fund management firms and experiencing more difficulty in attracting money from investors .
The average size of funds run by women and minorities is $ 73.7 m compared with $ 308.2 m for men .
One female asset manager said : " With a man ... you might dismiss something as a bad day , with a woman it 's seen as a sign of instability .
Somewhere , buried deep in the psychology , is the notion that people do n't trust us with their cash . "
The NCRW argues that a better mix of male and female investment styles would lead to greater stability on markets .
Linda Basch , its president , called for a change in the chilly workplace culture for female investment professionals and said women needed to gain critical mass in the finance industry : " It is uncomfortable to be the only skirt in the room .
This is a time when we need women with their more tempered approach to risk , as well as men . "
Jacki Zehner , a former partner at Goldman Sachs , who initiated the report , added : " Where women are present at decision - making tables , the quality of those decisions improves . "
The NCRW 's work supports the views put forward by investment banker Ros Altmann and Professor Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics at the Treasury select committee on women in the City last week .
They argued that the financial crash was less likely to have happened if there had been more women in senior positions in the financial industry .
Professor Goodhart said the more cautious and long - term outlook of women could prove a more positive trait than the more aggressive , risk - taking stance of men .
The NCRW report highlights a growing body of academic work suggesting that women fund managers typically take less risk and adopt less extreme investment styles than male managers , including research from the University of Cologne in 2005 .
A 2008 study of men on trading floors by Cambridge University posited that male traders may be afflicted with a boom and bust in their hormonal cycle .
During booms , their testosterone soars , leading to an increased willingness to take risks , but in a crash , levels of the stress hormone cortisol levels spike , making them shun risk altogether .
A recent paper from the University of California suggested that men who felt they were being observed or judged by their peers tended to make riskier investment choices at times of crisis in an attempt to assert their dominance over rivals .
Women were found to make consistent decisions in all types of situation .
Different wavelengths of light from a distant gamma-ray burst travel at the same speed , down to quantum scales ( Illustration : NASA / SkyWorks Digital )
A hint that quantum fluctuations in the fabric of the universe slow the speed of light has not been borne out in observations by NASA ’s Fermi telescope .
The measurements contradict a 2005 result that supported the idea that space and time are not smooth .
Einstein ’s theory of special relativity says that all electromagnetic radiation travels through a vacuum at the speed of light .
This speed is predicted to be constant , regardless of the energy of the radiation .
Yet in 2005 , the MAGIC gamma-ray telescope on La Palma in the Canary Islands suggested the speed of light might not be constant after all .
The telescope , which measured the light released by a galaxy around 500 million light years away , found that higher energy photons arrived four minutes behind their lower energy counterparts .
Grainy universe
The discovery hinted that the speed of light may change depending on its energy .
This effect could be a consequence of some theories of quantum gravity , which attempt to unify Einstein ’s theory of gravity with the laws of quantum mechanics .
These models postulate that space and time are not smooth .
Instead space - time is inherently grainy , fluctuating rapidly over distances of about 10 - 35 metres , a length called the Planck scale .

If space - time is grainy , higher - energy photons would move more slowly than their lower - energy counterparts .
That ’s because higher - energy photons have smaller wavelengths , which makes them more sensitive to tiny fluctuations in space - time .
However , the MAGIC lag was apparently too large to be easily explained by graininess on the quantum scale .
If the delay were caused by fluctuations in space - time , they would have to occur on scales more than 10 times larger than the Planck scale .
“ This intriguing evidence has been wandering around in the quantum gravity community for more than a year now , with hope on the progressive side , and stomach aches on the conservative side , ” says physicist Giovanni Amelino - Camelia of Sapienza University of Rome in Italy .
Now new observations suggest quantum gravity cannot be responsible for the time delay observed by MAGIC .
The light from a powerful , 7 - billion year old gamma-ray burst detected by NASA ’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope shows no evidence of a lag between photons of a range of energies .
“ We have fewer stomach aches now , ” says Amelino - Camelia .
“ The Fermi data has pushed the limit where it ’s now proven the MAGIC data can not be interpreted in that way . ”
Light artefact
Fermi ’s measurement is the most stringent direct limit on how much the speed of light might vary with energy , says Jonathan Granot of the University of Hertfordshire in the UK , who led the analysis of the burst .
“ For the first time , we can put the limit [ down to ] the energy scale in which quantum effects would alter the geometry of space time . ”
The MAGIC time delay may be down to an astrophysical process where particles are accelerated to enormous energies within the hearts of galaxies .
Follow - up calculations after MAGIC ’s 2005 result showed that is possible to produce flares that release lower - energy radiation before higher - energy radiation , according to MAGIC collaborator Robert Wagner of the Max Planck Institute of Physics in Munich , Germany .
“ I think what we can say for the time being is quantum gravity effects cannot be the dominant effect , ” he says .
Knockout blow ?
The result does not necessarily strike a blow to quantum gravity .
Only a subset of models predict the effect , and “ while it seems reasonable to expect that the variation of the speed of light with energy is a sign of quantum space - time , there is no well developed theory of quantum space - time that cleanly makes this prediction , ” says Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo , Canada .
What ’s more , it will require even more precise measurements to completely exclude the possibility that light may change its speed depending on its energy .
“ If there is an effect , the experiment is now at the threshold of scales where the effect is expected , and there is the exciting prospect that it could be discovered over the …next few years , ” Smolin says .

Ten thousand unemployed apply for 90 jobs in Louisville , Kentucky
By Hiram Lee
10 October 2009
Reflecting the increasingly desperate economic situation faced by millions , this week 10,000 unemployed workers applied for 90 jobs at a Louisville , Kentucky , General Electric ( GE ) plant .
The enormous response came within the space of just three days .
GE had announced its intentions to add a second shift to its plant manufacturing washing machines in Appliance Park last Friday and began accepting applications on Monday .
An earlier announcement by the GE plant calling for 13 maintenance workers who would receive $ 23 per hour drew 700 applicants .
The GE jobs promised a mere $ 13 per hour , plus benefits including dental coverage and eye care .
The same jobs had previously paid $ 19 per hour until the decision by the IUE - CWA Local 761 to accept concessions in May , which included cutting wages for new workers and future hires .
Unemployment in Kentucky reached 11.1 percent in August .
A total of 3,200 manufacturing jobs were lost in the state in the same month .
Over the year ending in August , some 35,300 manufacturing jobs were lost in Kentucky .
Dr. Justine Detzel , the chief labor market analyst for Kentucky ’s Office of Unemployment and Training , commented after the release of these numbers , “ This marks the 14th time in the last 15 months industrial employment has fallen .
Job losses were concentrated in the durable goods subsector , reflecting layoffs at a number of automobile parts manufacturers , the closing of another automobile parts producer , and the start of a lengthy temporary shutdown of a durable goods plant . ”
The loss of better - paying manufacturing jobs will have a sharp impact on poverty in the state , which already stood at 17.3 percent for 2008 .
According to the latest Census Bureau figures , one in eight families and one in four children live in poverty .
Foreclosures , particularly in Louisville , continue to rise due to a spike in unemployment .
A testament to the destruction of the manufacturing sector , no less than 80 percent of the workers applying for the 90 GE jobs were able to claim factory experience on their applications .
The response of the Kentucky state government to widespread unemployment and a major crisis within the state budget has been entirely reckless and shortsighted .
Social programs , made all the more necessary by the economic crisis , have been slashed .
Upon entering office in 2007 , Governor Steve Beshear , a Democrat , almost immediately began a fight to bring casino gambling to the state , a mercenary industry that would only prey on the poor and working class population .
Short - term attempts to increase tax revenue include hosting the 2010 World Equestrian Games in the state , as well as a major Nascar racing event .
As federal stimulus funds will have run out by 2012 , the governor is preparing the state for further hardships in the future .
Hinting at further cuts to social programs , he spoke before a Downtown Rotary Club in Louisville in September , saying the budget crises yet to be faced will “ make us decide what we consider sacred and what is expendable . ”
The rush by 10,000 unemployed workers to claim the small number of jobs offered by GE is a phenomenon not unique to Kentucky .
All over the country , workers are desperately trying to find jobs or secure assistance under conditions in which available jobs and resources are completely inadequate .
Thousands have flocked to free , temporary clinics set up in Texas and California in search of health care they could not otherwise afford .
In Detroit this week , 50,000 residents sought housing aid , of which there was only enough to assist some 3,400 people in need .
These and similar incidents around the country have made clear the inability of the capitalist system to meet the most basic social needs of masses of people .
At a time when trillions of dollars are available to bail out the banks , workers are told there is no money to provide even the most elementary necessities of life .

PARIS , France —
Whoever ends up presiding over Afghan chaos and corruption , Europe is losing patience fast with U.S. mission muddle and a president who wo n’t make up his mind .
NATO defense ministers meeting last week in Slovakia backed Gen. Stanley McChrystal ’s strategy to strike harder , and fast , against a growing insurgency .
But opinion polls and remarks in official circles from Britain to Poland ( and elsewhere , like , Canada ) make clear that Europeans are fed up with Afghanistan if not the whole military business altogether .
A NATO graph that tracks European defense spending looks like an intermediate ski slope .
In every country but Greece , 2010 budget projections suggest a sharper drop .
Jean - Pierre Maulny of France ’s Institute for International and Strategic Studies ( ISIS ) was blunt in the daily Le Monde , which last week examined the trend .
“ Budgets are not up to what is at stake , and Europe is sinking into a formless neutrality , ” he said .
“ We are seeing — this is new — a real trans - Atlantic decoupling . ”
Europeans spend $ 520 a year per capita on defense , a third less than Americans .
Britain ’s budget , the biggest along with France ’s , could drop 10 percent in five years .
Where Afghanistan is concerned , these cutbacks coincide with a quickly dissipating political will .
Britain , with 9,000 troops and the largest EU contingent , pledged 500 more but only if allies and Afghans fight the Taliban harder .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain speaks of Afghanization the way Americans once talked of Vietnamization when looking desperately for lights at the end of tunnels .
Brown told Parliament he was looking for “ benchmarks and timelines ” to hand over security operations to Afghans .
Since 2001 , British deaths total 221 — 37 since July .
A Daily Telegraph / YouGov poll in August found 62 percent of respondents wanted troops to come home .
In a separate poll , only 27 percent favored a long deployment .
In recent German elections , Chancellor Angela Merkel defeated her Social Democrat opponent , who wants out of the war .
She is committed to training Afghan police .
But the influential weekly , Der Spiegel , estimated that 70 percent of Germans , like the defeated candidate , want out of a costly , painful and embarrassing quagmire .
After unleashing world - class blitzkrieg twice in living memory , Germans have mixed feelings about keeping 4,500 soldiers at war .
Since 2002 , 35 have been killed .
Allies who want more combat support are critical of Germany ’s preference for rear - echelon missions .
So long after World War II , some say , this is a copout .
In September , a German commander called in an air strike near Kunduz based on sketchy single - source information , which killed innocent Afghans .
Last year , a senior German officer called the program to train Afghan police “ a miserable failure , ” Tom Coghlan reported in the Times of London .
Later , an official report in Berlin said German troops sit around too much drinking beer and eating sausages .
“ Plainly put , the soldiers are too fat , exercise too little and take little care of their diet , ” Reinhold Robbe , parliamentary commissioner for armed forces , concluded .
In Italy , feelings flared in September when a Kabul bombing killed six Italians .
Crowds demanded that Silvio Berlusconi bring home their 2,800 troops .
Then in October , Coghlan dropped a bombshell in the Times .
In 2008 , he wrote , Italian intelligence officers secretly paid the Taliban and local warlords to keep peace in Italy ’s sector east of Kabul .
No one told French forces who took over and underestimated the threat .
Seeing protection money abruptly cut off , insurgents ambushed a column .
They killed 10 Frenchmen , tough Foreign Legion paratroopers , mutilating bodies and seizing weapons .
Though denied in Rome , it was based on solid , if necessarily unnamed , sources .
A senior NATO commander said that while there might have been some reason to pay off insurgents , it was “ madness ” not to tell a coalition partner .
A “ high - ranking Western intelligence source ” made the larger point , underscoring the problems of lining up reluctant allies against an ill - defined enemy .
“ NATO in Afghanistan is a fragile enough construct without this lot working behind our backs .
The Italians have a hell of a lot to answer for . ”
France took the news hard .
By then , two - thirds of the country already wanted out .
But President Nicolas Sarkozy of France , hurrying to Kabul , declared : “ My determination is intact . ”
That remains the official line , and little is likely to change over the hunkered down Afghan winter .
Still , Sarkozy has less reason to stand firm as public will wanes .
In 2007 , freshly elected , Sarkozy was eager to show strength to Washington , lining up as a solid ally after Jacques Chirac ’s iffy relations with George W. Bush .
With Barack Obama , Sarkozy is shifting back toward France ’s usual Gaullist role : an independent - minded , nuclear - tipped force capable of taking its own direction .
In London , Gen. David Richard , chief of the General Staff , summed up the allies ’ challenge across the continent in remarks to the Daily Telegraph .
Holding public support is a struggle , he said .
“ We need to do better . ”
BC Liberals Suck
The Truth Will Set Us Free
There have been a number of military achievements throughout world history that have revolutionized warfare .
Listed here , I have attempted to formulate the top ten military achievements that have most significantly impacted warfare throughout world history .
Although there have been numerous military technological and ideological advancements that have revolutionized warfare from military formations and gunpowder to radio communications and canned foods , this study focuses strictly on weapon systems .
While many may disagree with the particulars on this list , most will agree that all the weapon systems noted have played a significant part in revolutionizing warfare .
In fact , many of these weapon systems have continuously been updated over time and most still play a dominate role in modern warfare today .
10 . The Chariot
The two - wheeled horse - drawn chariot was one of the most important achievements in history .
It provided humanity its first concept of personal transport and for more than two thousand years it was used as a key military weapon system of war .
Chariots seem to have originated in Mesopotamia in the third millennium or around about 2000 BC .
The highly mobile two - wheeled war chariot carrying a driver and an archer armed with a short composite bow revolutionized military tactics after 1700 BC .
Chariots were expensive , clumsy and prone to breakdowns .
Yet these military weapon systems were used for centuries .
They were not replaced by horseback riders until the first millennium BC making these weapon systems the early foundation for the cavalry .
9 . The Sarissa
The sarissa , also know as a lance or pike , was a gigantic 13 - 21 foot long double pointed pike used in the Macedonian phalanx infantry formation as early as 3,000 BC .
Its great length was an asset against hoplites and other soldiers bearing smaller weapons , because they had to get past the sarissa to engage the phalangites .
The tight formation of the phalanx created a “ wall of pikes ” , and the pike was sufficiently long that there were fully five rows of pikes in front of the front rank of men— even if an enemy got past the first row , there were still four more to stop him .
The Macedonian phalanx was considered all but invulnerable from the front , except against another such phalanx ; the only way it was ever generally defeated was by breaking its formation or outflanking it .
The invention of the sarissa is credited to Philip , father of the celebrated Macedonian king , Alexander the Great .
However , it was Alexander who successfully employed this new weapons system across Asia , conquering Egypt , Persia and the Pauravas ( northwest India ) , victorious all the way .
The sarissa - wielding phalanxes were vital in every battle to include the pivotal battle of Gaugamela where the Persian king ’s brutal scythe chariots were utterly destroyed by the phalanx .
The sarissa remained a primary weapon system for every Hellenistic army until the rise of Rome .
8. Sailing Ships
The first sailing ships were likely Egyptian and existed around 3000 BC or earlier .
They were used on the Nile River which was ideal for primitive sailing vessels .
The wind on the Nile is usually from the north , so if they wanted to go south they just raised the sail on the double mast .
And if they wanted to go north , they just lowered the sail and drifted with the river .
Through these early sailing ships the navy was born .
Produced from the 8th to the 13th centuries and commonly used in Northern Europe , Viking ships were “ clinker built ” boats called Knorrs .
These sailing ships were sturdy , long , and slender with a large square sail making them swift and capable of long voyages .
By 1200 , these Knorrs were used by militaries throughout northern Europe .
The technology of the sailing warship found relative stability from 1775 to 1862 requiring little expensive research and few new developments .
Sails , ropes , and guns would eventually become the main components of this military weapon system and timber , the most basic and vital component of these wooden sailing warships , was present in abundance to most countries .
7. The Cannon
The cannon , first appearing in the early 14th century in Europe , assumed its classic form at the beginning of the 17th century which persisted almost unchanged until the mid-19th century at which time it was superseded by the breech loading rifled gun .
Until the early 17th century , cannons in a battle were immobile and the two - wheeled gun carriage was slow to be developed .
This military weapon system would eventually add a new service branch to the army .
And the Artillery would soon join the Cavalry and Infantry .
It was a shock weapon , most effectively used in mass , and its placement was critical .
The battery itself was fixed , but fire could be directed to any point within range very quickly .
The battery had to be carefully protected from assault , while its field of fire had to be as open and level as possible .
One good volley across the front of a cavalry or infantry charge would lead to incredible destruction .
This weapon system was most vulnerable to a cavalry attack from the rear , rendering its powerful weapons useless .
However , it was the cannon that made the fortresses and castles obsolete .
In 1494 , the Earl of Warwick reduced Bamborough Castle of the revolting Percies to rubble in a week .
In 1523 , Philip of Hesse brought the most powerful fortress in the world at Landstuhl , to its knees in a day .
This military weapon system remains today in a modified form as the mortar and a few other smooth - bore weapons .
6 . The Machine Gun
The Gatling gun , named after its inventor Dr. Richard J. Gatling , was the first widely used rapid - fire guns .
Due to their multiple barrels , this weapon system could offer more sustained fire than the first generation of air - cooled , recoil - operated machine guns .
The weight , complexity , and resulting cost of this multibarrel design discouraged its initial success .
The first true machine gun was invented in 1881 by Hiram Maxim .
The “ Maxim gun ” used the recoil power of the previously fired bullet to reload rather than being hand - powered , enabling a much higher rate of fire than was possible using earlier designs .
Maxim ’s other great innovation was the use of water cooling ( via a water jacket around the barrel ) to reduce overheating .
Maxim ’s gun was widely adopted and derivative designs were used on all sides during the First World War .
Most famously this weapon system was employed during the battle of the Somme .
The design required fewer crew , was lighter , and more usable than earlier Gatling guns .
It would be another 50 years before Gatling ’s concept was again improved to allow extremely high rates of fire as found today in miniguns and other automatic aircraft cannons .
Today , many machine guns are mounted and even disconnected from humans as part of a robotic armament system such as on a tank coaxial or part of an aircraft ’s armament .
These weapon systems are usually electronically - fired and have advanced sighting enhancements .
5 . The Submarine
The “ Rotterdam Boat , ” designed by a Frenchman named De Son in 1653 , was probably the first underwater vessel specifically built to attack enemy ships .
This 72 - foot - long semi- submerged ram was supposed to sneak up unobserved and punch a hole in an enemy ship .
The designer boasted that it could cross the English Channel and back in a day , and sink a hundred ships along the way .
Since then , the submarine has revolutionized naval warfare .
This military weapon system has demonstrated significant evolution from the days of the Civil War to its baptism by fire in the first World War to the nuclear subs of today which carry intercontinental missiles and can cruise submerged for several months .
Today some 47 nations operate more than 700 submarines and almost 300 of these ships are nuclear - powered .
A host of countries , including the United States , Germany , Italy , Denmark , Norway , Sweden , and Japan , are pursuing new designs .
In short , the submarine appears to be weapon system that is here to stay for the major powers of the world .
4. The Paratroopers
Perhaps no military weapon system has provided more flexibility on the battlefield as the employment of paratroopers .
Certainly , no weapon system has been so spectacular .
Shortly after World War I , General Billy Mitchell proposed that parachuting troops from aircraft into combat could be an effective on the battlefield .
During the demonstration of his concept at Kelly Field at San Antonio , Texas , six soldiers parachuted from a Martin Bomber , safely landed , and in less than three minutes after exiting the aircraft had their weapons assembled and were ready for action .
Although the U.S. military observers dismissed the concept , not all of the observers arrived at the same conclusion .
The German observers eagerly grasped the idea and planners worked quickly to develop an effective military parachute organization .
The Germans effectively developed their airborne forces and , at the start of the Second World War , used parachute troops in their spearhead assaults in Holland and Belgium .
Spurred by the successful employment of airborne troops by the Germans in their invasion of the Low Countries , U.S. military branches began an all - out effort to develop this new form of warfare .
From Operation
Overlord ’s paratroopers who first secured the flanks of Normandy ’s landing beaches to the rangers and airborne forces who spearheaded modern operations by jumping into the night to seize airfields , paratroopers provide an obvious tactical edge in modern military warfare .
Inserted onto the battlefield from the air , the paratrooper can drop into areas inaccessible to regular soldiers .
This weapon system is extensively used by modern armies and can evade enemy fortifications and force an army to thin its defenses to protect areas that normally would be safe by virtue of geography .
3. The Airplane
The history of aerial warfare is a relatively new branch of military history .
Hot air balloons were introduced as observation platforms in the late 18th Century .
They were not widely used until the mid-19th Century .
True aerial warfare or air combat operations , is only about a century old .
But the history of aerial warfare is already brimming with stories of great air battles , innovative technology , and the decisive use of strategic airpower .
With the jet engine developed during the end of the Second World War , the major powers of the world began to employ this new technology in its air force .
The United States entered the Korean War using Second World War style propeller - driven aircraft , but by wars end the air force was almost totally based on jet powered aircraft .
During the Korean War U.S. F - 80 ’s and F - 86 ’s battled against the Soviet MiG - 15 in the first aerial battles between jet fighters .
Military aviation came into its own during the Second World War .
The increased performance , range , and payload of contemporary aircraft meant that air power could move beyond the novelty applications seen in the First World War becoming a central striking force for all the combatant nations .
Over the course aircraft evolution , modern and distinct roles continue to emerge for the application of air power with stealth technologies , optically guided missile systems , and smart bombs .
2. The Aircraft Carrier
The British navy also experimented with the aircraft carrier during the First World War and developed the first true carrier with an unobstructed flight deck , the HMS Argus , built on a converted merchant - ship hull .
The war ended before the Argus could be put into action , but the U.S. and Japanese navies quickly followed this British example .
The first U.S. carrier , a converted collier renamed the USS Langley , joined the fleet in March 1922 .
A Japanese carrier , named the Hosyo , entered service in December 1922 and was the first carrier designed as such from the keel up .
Today the aircraft carrier has become one of the most advanced weapon systems and represents the hallmark of military superiority on the high seas .
The nuclear aircraft carrier is the epitome of U.S. military superpower status .
And among the modern nuclear super carriers , the Nimitz - class is the newest , largest , and fastest in the world .
At nearly 1,100 feet long , the Chrysler building can be laid upon its deck with fifty feet to spare at each end .
1. Atomic Bomb .
To date , no other military weapon system has had such a profound influence on revolutionizing warfare as the atomic bomb .
This bomb was the first and only nuclear bomb to have ever been used in warfare .
It was exploded over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945 respectively .
An even more powerful nuclear weapon was developed in the hydrogen bomb , based on destruction through nuclear fusion and was acquired by the USA in 1952 ; the USSR in 1953 ; the UK in 1957 ; China in 1967 ; and France in 1968 .
In 1977 the U.S. developed an even more potent weapon in the enhanced hydrogen bomb which uses a beryl coating to vastly expand its radioactive power .
Since their inception , nuclear weapon systems have multiplied at an alarming rate , leaving everyone from policymakers to concerned citizens wondering what it will take to slow , stop , or even reverse the spread of these technologies .

Steve Jobs said people do n't read any more .
But Apple is in talks with several media companies rooted in print , negotiating content for a " new device . "
And they 're not just going for e-books and mags .
They 're aiming to redefine print .

Several years ago , a modified version of OS X was presented to Steve Jobs , running on a multitouch tablet .
When the question " what would people do with this ? " could n't be answered , they shelved it .
Long having established music , movie and TV content , Apple is working hard to load up iTunes with print content from several major publishing houses across several media .

Two people related to the NYTimes have separately told me that in June , paper was approached by Apple to talk about putting the paper on a " new device . "
The R&D labs have long worked on versions of the paper meant to be navigated without a keyboard or mouse , showing up on Windows tablets and on multiple formats using Adobe Air .
The NYTimes , of course , also publishes via their iPhone application .
Jobs has , during past keynotes , called the NYTimes the " best newspaper in the world . "
A person close to a VP in textbook publishing mentioned to me in July that McGraw Hill and Oberlin Press are working with Apple to move textbooks to iTunes .
There was no mention of any more detail than that , but it does link back to a private Apple intern idea competition held on campus , in their Town Hall meeting area in 2008 , where the winning presentation selected by executives was one focused on textbook distribution through iTunes .
The logic here is that textbooks are sold new at a few hundred dollars , and resold by local stores without any kickbacks to publishers .
A DRM'd one - time - use book would not only be attractive because publishers would earn more money , but electronic text books would be able to be sold for a fraction of the cost , cutting out book stores and creating a landslide marketshare shift by means of that huge price differential .
( If that device were a tablet , the savings on books could pay for the device , and save students a lot of back pain . )

Apple also recently had several executives from one of the largest magazine groups at their Cupertino 's campus , where they were asked to present their ideas on the future of publishing .
Several mockups of magazines were present in interactive form .
It is presumed that more talks took place after the introduction and investigatory meeting .
Some magazine company is also considering Adobe Air as a competing option for digital magazines , but without a revenue / distribution system that iTunes has , it seems unlikely .
I have n't heard anything about traditional book publishers being approached yet , but given the scope of the rest of the publishing industry 's involvement , it 's not hard to imagine they 're on board as well .
( If you know something , please drop me a line . )
Update : Reader
Tom reminds me of this Andy Ihnatko rumor , from several sources , that Apple is receiving truckloads of books at its HQ .
It 's a thin line to draw , but its something .

Another source corroborates that the January announce date others have reported is correct within the month , with this information heard from a high level .
Some I 've talked to believe the initial content will be mere translations of text to tablet form .
But while the idea of print on the Tablet is enticing , it 's nothing the Kindle or any E - Ink device could n't do .
The eventual goal is to have publishers create hybridized content that draws from audio , video and interactive graphics in books , magazines and newspapers , where paper layouts would be static .
And with release dates for Microsoft 's Courier set to be quite far away and Kindle stuck with relatively static E - Ink , it appears that Apple is moving towards a pole position in distribution of this next - generation print content .
First , it 'll get its feet wet with more basic repurposing of the stuff found on dead trees today .

Appeal Denied for Mom Convicted of Murder Hannah Overton lost appeal ; Husband says , " God is not done with this situation . "
CORPUS CHRISTI , Texas , Oct. 29 , 2009  -- Hannah Overton , 32 , a devout Christian and mother of five kids , is serving a life sentence in a Texas prison for killing her 4 - year - old adopted son , Andrew Burd .
Her husband , pastor and scores of fellow parishioners have argued her innocence for years despite her conviction .
Now , after nearly two years behind bars , her appeal to the 13th District Court of Appeals has been denied .
In its decision , the court concluded that " a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Overton intentionally caused A.B. 's [ Andrew Burd 's ] death by either of the theories alleged by the state , and that Overton was aware that her conduct of failing to provide or seek medical care was reasonably certain to cause A.B. 's death .
Therefore , we conclude that the evidence was legally sufficient to support a finding that Overton either intentionally or knowingly caused A.B. 's death . "
When 4 - year - old Andrew Burd arrived at a hospital in critical condition in the fall of 2006 , doctors did n't have a clue what was wrong with him .
Blood tests soon revealed that he had salt poisoning , or hypernatremia .
Andrew 's levels were off the charts -- almost double the norm and among the highest ever recorded .
Doctors turned to Hannah Overton , then a 29 - year - old pregnant mother of four , who was in the process of adopting Andrew .
She told them Andrew had thrown a fit that afternoon after he'd been fed a full lunch .
Instead of giving him more food , she said she put a few dashes of creole seasoning in a sippy cup of water .
But that did n't calm him , she said , and a few moments later he fell to the floor , vomited and complained of being cold .
Overton said she suspected the flu , but after an hour and a half , Andrew 's condition failed to improve .
That 's when she and her husband , Larry , took Andrew to the hospital .
The Overtons ' story aroused the suspicions of doctors and investigators .
The next day Andrew died and the devout Christian couple , who had no criminal history , became murder suspects .
As the investigation continued , authorities developed a theory that Andrew 's death was an intentional poisoning .
" We were just waiting for someone to look at it and say , ' This is just an accident , ' " Larry Overton told " 20/20 . "
" Instead , we were arrested . "
To investigators , Andrew 's sudden and bizarre death was no accident .
Within days , the authorities had begun weaving a sinister tale of murder .
They painted Hannah Overton as a pregnant mother of four young children who became overwhelmed with the arrival of a foster child .
The arrest warrants painted the Overton home as a house of horrors , where Andrew was monitored by a camera and was punished with spicy seasoning .
Detectives even used the Overtons ' children to build a case against them , saying unusual forms of punishment had been previously used .
" This case boils down to a woman who , basically , tortured a child , " said prosecutor Sandra Eastwood , " becoming so enraged she forced him to have 23 teaspoons of hot pepper and then watching him die in agony . "
A grand jury returned an indictment on capital murder .
In the state of Texas , if a child younger than 6 dies at the hands of another person , it 's considered a capital case .
The charge carries a minimum life sentence .
Charged With Capital Murder : Rush to Judgment ?
The Overtons ' church community saw the accusations against Hannah and Larry as ludicrous and rallied around the couple , raising nearly $ 700,000 for their defense .
" What they came up with and what really happened were completely different things , " said the Rev. Rod Carver .
" It 's so bizarre , " Noreen Carver , Rod Carver 's wife , said , " because [ Hannah Overton 's ] really the last person you would think would be charged with this type of crime . "
The Overtons and their supporters claimed there was a rush to judgment -- that the authorities had never considered alternate theories .
The Overtons said that in the four months Andrew had lived with them , he had exhibited excessive tantrums and obsessive eating .
Hannah Overton said she started noticing that Andrew was hoarding food , stealing off the other children 's plates and throwing tantrums after mealtime was over .
At times , they said , they caught him trying to eat things that were n't even edible .
" Anything that he found , he would try and put in his mouth .
He would also eat the cat food , the dog food , out of the trash can , " Hannah Overton told " 20/20 . "
The Overtons believe this unexplained behavior might have been linked to Andrew 's death .
" Something was wrong with Andrew .
I do n't know exactly how or what happened to him , " Hannah Overton said .
" Something caused his sodium levels to rise , and it was n't me . "
While Hannah and Larry Overton awaited separate trials , Hannah Overton gave birth to a baby girl named Emma .
Child welfare services placed all five Overton children with loved ones , allowing the couple only supervised visits .
Medical Mystery or Murder ?
From day one of Hannah Overton 's trial in August 2007 , the prosecution portrayed her as a mother who had lost control .
Frustrated with a naughty child , prosecutors said , she tried to punish him with seasoning mixed in water and then neglected to get him medical attention , knowing that he was dying .
Detectives questioned why Hannah Overton had n't called 911 , instead driving Andrew to the hospital .
One doctor calculated that it would take at least 23 teaspoons of creole seasoning ( equivalent to 7 teaspoons of salt ) to get Andrew 's sodium level as high as it was when he arrived at the hospital .
Medical staff members from the hospital also took the stand , testifying that they noticed bruising and scratching on the child 's body when he arrived at the hospital .
Prosecutors speculated these marks could be signs of abuse , or a struggle .
" Could it be that you held his nose , held his neck and made him drink this horrible concoction ? " prosecutor Sandra Eastwood asked at trial .
" Absolutely not , " Hannah Overton testified .
The prosecution also countered claims by the Overtons about Andrew 's strange behavior .
Witnesses , including Andrew 's former foster mother Sharon Hamil , took the stand and told jurors the boy seemed perfectly healthy and never exhibited odd or excessive eating .
Hamil said the same in an interview with " 20/20 " after the trial : " He did n't ever seem like he was not being fulfilled with his meals .
He seemed to be full when he would leave the table . "
But Hamil later added , " He was always ready for a snack .
...
He liked to eat and he liked , he loved pizza .
He loved french fries .
He could eat five slices of pizza .
I mean , he could out - eat just about anybody else .
And if there were five slices of pizza there and nobody else was eating them and he wanted them and I already knew he could handle it , why not let him have it ?
You know ? "
The defense presented the jury with a medical mystery .
They speculated Andrew might have had pica , an eating disorder characterized by an obsessive appetite .
Witnesses outside the home had seen Andrew 's bizarre habits too .
Hannah Overton told jurors that she thought the behavior was unusual but had learned in adoption classes that children in foster care often exhibited issues with food .
When the problems escalated , she alerted Andrew 's adoption agency .
During the visit to the home , the caseworker mentioned pica as a possible explanation .
Hannah said it was just a few days later that Andrew got sick and eventually died .
She said she believes he may have gotten into something that morning when she was n't watching that caused his sodium levels to rise .
Hannah insists the creole seasoning mixed with water was n't to punish -- it was to soothe Andrew 's insatiable appetite .
" My thought was that I would calm him down , appease him , give him like a broth , without giving him a tummyache from eating more food , " Hannah told " 20/20 . "
When asked why she did n't get him help sooner , Hannah said , " We did n't know that there was anything major going on .
We did n't realize how sick he was .
…
If we had known that there was something more going on , we would have rushed to the hospital . "
But Hannah Overton was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life in prison in September 2007 .
" I just kind of broke down , " Larry Overton said .
" And I just stared out a window for ... I do n't know ... probably about an hour . "
Jurors and Doctors Speak Out
To find Hannah guilty , jurors had to believe either of two scenarios -- that Hannah force - fed Andrew Burd salt knowing it would kill him or that she neglected to get medical help fast enough knowing that that would kill him .
All 12 jurors agreed with the second scenario , and " 20/20 " spoke to two of them .
" I do n't believe it was her intention to , to kill him , " said juror Dora Santos .
" I just feel that if Andrew would have gotten help sooner he would probably be alive today . "
" I mean , she killed him because she did n't seek medical help , " said juror Norma Bejarano .
But when asked if Hannah Overton intentionally withheld medical attention from Andrew in order to kill the child , Santos replied , " That 's something we 'll never know . "
Two doctors , both experts in the case -- one for the prosecution , the other for the defense -- believe Hannah Overton was wrongly convicted , and they spoke on camera for the first time to " 20/20 . "
Dr. Edgar Cortes , the same pediatrician who treated Andrew at the emergency room and later consulted for the prosecution , said he always believed Andrew 's death was accidental .
Cortes is not being paid by the Overton defense team .
" I was stunned when I heard that [ Hannah ] had been given capital murder .
I was just at a loss for words , " Cortes said .
Cortes disagrees with the prosecution 's portrayal of Andrew as perfectly healthy -- he said he saw speech and developmental problems back in 2005 .
" The only physician that treated Andy while he was alive , and who was aware of the other neurological problems that he had , was me , " Cortes said .
" And I think that testimony might have given the jury an understanding that perhaps he was not a totally normal child . "
But neither the defense nor the jury ever heard Cortes ' opinions , which are the cornerstone of Hannah 's appeal .
Prosecutor Sandra Eastwood said she does n't recall Cortes expressing doubts about Hannah 's intent .
" Sounds very disingenuous , " Cortes told " 20/20 , " " I was very clear from day one and very forceful as to my opinions . "
Overton 's appeal alleged that the state withheld Cortes ' opinion from the defense .
But in the appellate decision the court said , " Because there is conflicting evidence regarding whether the state knew of the alleged exculpatory evidence , we cannot conclude that the information was in fact known to the state or that the state was required to produce the unknown information . "
The court added that even if Cortes had expressed his doubts to the prosecution , the state " has no duty to disclose inadmissible evidence . "
And that " Texas courts have repeatedly excluded expert testimony regarding a defendant 's state of mind or intent at the time of the offense because it is speculative and unreliable . "
Yet , in an earlier section of the decision , the court points to another prosecution expert , Dr. Alexandre Rotta , who testified that he believed Andrew was given the creole seasoning and water mixture after he had a temper tantrum " probably to punish his behavior . "
In a 2008 interview with " 20/20 , " prosecutor Eastwood stood by her case .
" I feel very confident that I did the right thing in presenting the evidence and having her convicted , " she said .
She also remains convinced that Hannah Overton knew or should have known that withholding medical treatment would kill Andrew .
" I think she was angry , enraged , with wanting to punish him and hurt him and then realized , ' Oh my gosh , I 've really hurt him . ' "
Dr. Michael Moritz , a leading expert on salt poisoning at Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh , said , " I do n't think there was any evidence at all that she did this . "
Hannah 's defense team hired Moritz but never put him on the stand , believing his testimony would be repetitive .
Moritz believes he knows what happened to Andrew .
" I think he was in one of his feeding binges .
He was having a tantrum , and he was unsupervised for a brief period of time , and I believe that he ingested a large amount of salt . "
Moritz has written extensively about salt poisoning and its connection to pica .
" When I pulled all the cases of salt poisoning , they all fit the same profile , " he said .
" Children within that age group of 2 to 6 years of age , in foster care from abusive homes but with behavioral problems , who had history of pica , who by all accounts appeared to have voluntary ingested large amounts of sodium . "
For his part , Moritz does n't believe Hannah Overton knew Andrew was dying .
" I think most people would never suspect salt poisoning , since it 's something very few pediatricians or emergency rooms in the country have ever encountered , " he said .
What 's Next for the Overton Family ?
Since Hannah Overton 's trial concluded , Larry Overton has been a single father of five .
Once a month , he packs them into the family van and heads north .
It 's a 300 - mile drive , but no one complains , because for two hours the Overton children visit their mom at a Texas prison , where she hopes her case will be overturned .
This morning , Larry Overton delivered the news to his children and told them " God is not done with this situation yet . "
Still , Hannah Overton does n't regret trying to adopt Andrew .
" I would n't take that away , " she said .
" He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy , what he called his forever family , because we had to go through a lot of pain since then .
It 's not fair to him .
Or to us . "
Next , Hannah 's lawyers will likely appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin , Texas .
One of Hannah 's pastors , Doug Hoffman , told " 20/20 , " " We will continue to challenge the system to see that honest justice is followed through on . "
The influential lobby group Consumer Electronics Assn. is fighting what appears to be a losing battle to dissuade California regulators from passing the nation ’s first ban on energy - hungry big - screen televisions .
On Tuesday , executives and consultants for the Arlington , Va. , trade group asked members of the California Energy Commission to instead let consumers use their wallets to decide whether they want to buy the most energy - saving new models of liquid - crystal display and plasma high - definition TVs .
“ Voluntary efforts are succeeding without regulations , ” said Doug Johnson , the association ’s senior director for technology policy .
Too much government interference could hamstring industry innovation and prove expensive to manufacturers and consumers , he warned .
But those pleas did n’t appear to elicit much support from commissioners at a public hearing on the proposed rules that would set maximum energy - consumption standards for televisions to be phased in over two years beginning in January 2011 .
A vote could come as early as Nov. 4 .

The association ’s views were n’t shared by everyone in the TV business .
Representatives of some TV makers , including top - seller Vizio Inc. of Irvine , said they would have little trouble complying with tighter state standards without substantially increasing prices .
“ We ’re comfortable with our ability to meet the proposed levels and implementation dates , ” said Kenneth R. Lowe , Vizio ’s co-founder and vice president .
Last month , the commission formally unveiled its proposal to require manufacturers to limit television energy consumption in a way that has been done with refrigerators , air conditioners and dozens of other products since the 1970s .
“ We would not propose TV efficiency standards if we thought there was any evidence in the record that they will hurt the economy , ” said Commissioner Julia Levin , who has been in charge of the two - year rule - making procedure .
“ This will actually save consumers money and help the California economy grow and create new clean , sustainable jobs . ”

Tightening efficiency ratings by using new technology and materials should result in “ zero increase in cost to consumers , ” said Harinder Singh , an Energy Commission staffer on the TV regulation project .
California ’s estimated 35 million TVs and related electronic devices account for about 10 % of all household electricity consumption , the Energy Commission staff reported .
But manufacturers quickly are coming up with new technologies that are making even 50 - inch - screen models much more economical to operate .
New features , such as light - emitting diodes that consume tiny amounts of power , special reflective films and sensors that automatically adjust TV brightness to a room ’s viewing conditions , are driving down electricity consumption , experts said .
The payoff could be big for TV owners , said Ken Rider , a commission staff engineer .
Average first - year savings from reduced electricity use would be an estimated $ 30 per set and $ 912 million statewide , he said .

If all TVs met state standards , Rider added , California could avoid the $ 600 - million cost of building a natural - gas - fired power plant .
Switching to more - efficient TVs could have an estimated net benefit to the state of $ 8.1 billion , the commission staff reported .
Consumer Electronics Assn. officials disputed that figure , arguing that it was based on out - of - date numbers that fail to account for recent industry innovations .
“ With voluntary compliance , manufacturers can meet the targets over time , managing the cost impact , yet not in any way impeding innovation , ” said Seth Greenstein , an association consultant .

Recently by Gary North : It ’s 50th High School Reunion Day !
The heart of the modern monetary system is fractional reserve banking .
This system is based on fraud .
At the very heart of the modern economy is fraud — fraud on a gigantic scale .
What is the nature of this fraud ?
Counterfeiting .
Banks are government - licensed institutions that issue bogus IOUs .
Because these IOUs function as money , they are counterfeit money .
This is the heart , mind , and soul of all modern banking .
There is only one textbook in money and banking that states explicitly that all fractional reserve banking rests on fraud : Murray Rothbard ’s The Mystery of Banking .
It is not used in any university .
It never has been .
It was published in 1983 .
It went out of print almost immediately .
It is on - line here .
Rothbard takes the reader through the traditional T - account exercise that is common to all upper - division textbooks in money and banking .
Unlike all the others , his book shows how the process of making deposits and lending the money involves counterfeiting whenever the depositor has the legal right to withdraw his money on demand .
This is not the same as a life insurance contract in which you can borrow against your built - up reserves .
The company treats the policy - holder as it would treat another borrower .
It raises money to make the loan .
The withdraw - on - demand banking process has the same effect as counterfeiting gold and silver coins by adding base metals ( pp. 48—51 ) .
It has the same effect as issuing paper money that has no backing in gold or silver ( pp. 51— 55 ) .
It has the same effect as issuing warehouse receipts for goods stored for which there are no goods stored ( pp. 88—90 ) .
The banking system issues multiple IOUs to depositors and borrowers , yet these IOUs are based on the same initial deposits .
Traditional textbooks describe this process , but they refuse to identify the process as counterfeiting .
They also refuse to mention that this process of monetary inflation is the sole basis of all booms and busts : the business cycle .
This was Ludwig von Mises ’ insight as far back as 1912 in his book , The Theory of Money and Credit .
Rothbard makes it clear why fractional reserve banking is fraudulent .
This is why no professor assigns his book to his classes .
The irresistible temptation now emerges for the goldsmith or other deposit banker to commit fraud and inflation : to engage , in short , in fractional reserve banking , where total cash reserves are lower , by some fraction , than the warehouse receipts outstanding .
It is unlikely that the banker will simply abstract the gold and use it for his own consumption ; there is then no likelihood of ever getting the money should depositors ask to redeem it , and this act would run the risk of being considered embezzlement .
Instead , the banker will either lend out the gold , or far more likely , will issue fake warehouse receipts for gold and lend them out , eventually getting repaid the principal plus interest .
In short , the deposit banker has suddenly become a loan banker ; the difference is that he is not taking his own savings or borrowing in order to lend to consumers or investors .
Instead he is taking someone else ’s money and lending it out at the same time that the depositor thinks his money is still available for him to redeem .
Or rather , and even worse , the banker issues fake warehouse receipts and lends them out as if they were real warehouse receipts represented by cash .
At the same time , the original depositor thinks that his warehouse receipts are represented by money available at any time he wishes to cash them in .
Here we have the system of fractional reserve banking , in which more than one warehouse receipt is backed by the same amount of gold or other cash in the bank ’s vaults .
It should be clear that modern fractional reserve banking is a shell game , a Ponzi scheme , a fraud in which fake warehouse receipts are issued and circulate as equivalent to the cash supposedly represented by the receipts ( pp. 96—97 ) .
Modern economists do not acknowledge that fractional reserve banking is a gigantic system of counterfeiting .
They do not apply the same analysis to fractional reserve banking that they would apply to counterfeiting if they discussed counterfeiting .
They rarely discuss counterfeiting .
This is because they know that bright students can make the analytical connection .
The students will be tempted to conclude what is in fact the case , namely , that fractional reserve banking is a form of counterfeiting .
BORROWED SHORT AND LENT LONG
The banker offers a deal to holders of currency .
( Prior to 1914 in Europe and prior to 1933 in the United States , the public held gold coins . )
Here is the offer .
If you will deposit your money in my bank , I will lend it out at interest .
I will share some of this interest with you by guaranteeing you a fixed rate of return .
So far , so good .
But then comes the kicker .
Furthermore , I will pay you your money on demand during banking hours .
Any time you want your currency back , just come to the bank and take it out — no questions asked ( unless you try to take out $ 10,000 or more ) .
The banker knows what the economics professor knows : almost no one can think through the implications of this promise .
Both the banker and the professor of money and banking strive to keep people in the dark .
They promote the mystery of banking .
What are a few implications ?
Here is one .
When the bank lends money to a borrower at a fixed rate of return , it lends for a specific period of time ( commercial loans ) or else no deadline ( credit card loans ) .
It can not get this money back on demand .
Yet it owes money on demand .
The depositor can demand immediate payment .
Yet the money is gone .
The bank has therefore issued two IOUs to the same deposit .
The depositor can pull out his money at any time .
The borrower , who has the money sitting in his account , can do the same thing .
How is this possible ?
Because the government or the central bank allows the bank to set aside a small percentage of reserves on the deposit .
The bank does not have to keep 100 % of the on - demand money in reserve .
With a 10 % reserve requirement , if a bank gets a $ 100 deposit and sends $ 10 to the central bank as a reserve , it can legally lend $ 90 .
When the borrower spends this $ 90 , the receiving bank sets aside $ 9 and lends $ 81 .
The initial $ 100 deposit leads to $ 900 in new money , if banks lend all of the money they are legally allowed to lend .
If the banker had added the following statement , there would be no fraud .
There would be no counterfeiting .
You will not be able to get your money back on demand until the contract runs out for the borrower .
As he repays interest , you will get your share .
If he refuses to repay , I will pay you your principal based on bank reserves .
But , of course , if the bank goes bankrupt , you will not be repaid .
This offer would make it clear to the depositor that there is no such thing as a free lunch .
He can not get the return of his money until the bank gets it back from the borrower .
The same deposit still serves as money : for the borrower , not for the depositor .
The banker makes the offer of payment on demand because he knows that few depositors will demand their money most of the time .
Those who do demand their money can be paid out of the money deposited by today ’s depositors .
Is this a Ponzi scheme ?
In part , yes .
It is a Ponzi scheme that can go on much longer , because the bank possesses the power to create money .
The bank has borrowed short — “ withdraw the money on demand ” — and has lent long : “ pay the money back on time . ”
This is fraudulent .
CONTRACTS OVER TIME
All contracts have a time component .
A contract is a promise to perform an action in the future .
What about an exchange that is instantaneous ?
In the most radical form , a seller of money holds out a wad of currency .
A seller of a good holds out the good .
Each of them takes hold of both items , using different hands .
On the count of three , each person releases the item he is offering to the other .
Each person hopes the other will turn lose of the item on three .
Yet even here , there is a time component .
Each participant promises to let loose on the count of three .
If there were no agreement — either formal or implied — there would be no exchange .
A contract that promises to do the impossible is fraudulent .
If it is part of a series of identical contracts , only a few of which can be consummated on the same day , then all of the payment - on - demand contracts are fraudulent .
The creditor cannot distinguish his claim from all the others , other than by “ first come , first served . ”
That principle encourages bank runs .
Whenever a prospective depositor goes down to the bank to make a deposit , he should sing to himself the song that every fractional reserve bank has as its anthem regarding its depositors , who are its creditors .
The banker silently sings to every depositor :
Well , that ’ll be the day , when you say goodbye .
Yes , that ’ll be the day , when you make me cry .
You say you ’re gonna leave , you know it ’s a lie .
’Cause that ’ll be the day when I die .
This is the chorus .
But those of us from the late 1950 ’s remember what followed .
Well , you give me all your lovin ’ and your turtle dovin’
All your hugs and kisses and your money too .
Well , you know you love me babyUntil you tell me , maybeThat some day , well , I ’ll be through .
Fractional reserve banking may be a mystery , but Buddy Holly has provided the key to understanding the system .
Bankers woo depositors with promises of everlasting commitment .
The proof of this everlasting commitment is the promise of withdrawal on demand .
Then they take the depositors ’ money to woo borrowers with promises of what would otherwise have been below - market interest rates .
Why below market ?
Because depositors have been lured into parting with their money by means of a promise — a promise that cannot be fulfilled because of the time discrepancy between borrowing short ( depositors ’ accounts ) and lending long ( borrowers ’ accounts ) .
The basis of this monetary philandery is the discrepancy between the rival promises of time .
To understand modern banking , think of a full - time philanderer with one mid-town apartment , four mistresses , and three keys .
We can call this a 25 % reserve requirement .
Three mistresses live in the suburbs .
His favorite lives in mid-town .
One key is for him ; one is for the mid-town girl ; and one is for the other three mistresses .
This key is kept on reserve at the desk downstairs .
He assumes that out - of - towners will not all show up on the same day at the same time .
This plan works until a rumor gets out about the nature of the arrangement .
Then all three out - of - towners show up to make sure they have a key .
INFLATION AND BAD INFORMATION
Counterfeiters increase the money supply .
This is inflationary .
They defraud holders of the non-counterfeit currency .
How ?
By lowering the market price of the currency already in circulation .
The slogan is : “ More money chasing the same amount of goods . ”
But , as Mises showed , there is more to it than this .
The added money , when lent to producers , leads to a transfer of wealth to the producers .
They start bidding for production goods : land ( including raw materials ) , labor , and capital ( land plus labor over time ) .
The can make higher bids .
They supply goods and services to match expected demand .
This creates an economic boom .
But when the counterfeiters stop counterfeiting , expected demand does not appear .
This creates a bust .
Counterfeit money distorts information .
How ?
Because prices convey information .
Prices should convey accurate information .
When decision - makers have accurate information , they can find ways to lower the transaction costs of their decisions .
They can search out better ways to cut expenses .
They can become more efficient .
When prices convey inaccurate information , individuals find that they make more mistakes .
They make decisions in terms of information that is misleading .
This is why prices should be based on decentralized decisions in which individuals making the decisions are responsible for the outcome of their actions .
This is the defense of free - market capitalism .
But , when it comes to banks , the economists refuse to follow the logic of this principle of individual responsibility and performance .
Defenders of central banking and fractional reserve banking are necessarily defenders of inaccurate information .
CENTRAL BANKING
A central bank provides emergency money to commercial banks .
This reduces the threat of bank runs .
Central banks intervene to save large banks .
This is why no large American bank went bust in the Great Depression , while over 6,000 small banks did .
Central banks are the enforcing arm of the fractional reserve banking system .
Central banks determine which banks survive and which do not in a national bank run .
Their job is to protect the largest commercial banks .
This is a form of central planning by a government - licensed monopolistic agency .
When central planners substitute their judgment for individual decision - makers , we see a centralization of power over the market .
The terms of exchange are not being set by individual participants who are responsible for their actions .
The terms of exchange are being set by a distant committee .
They are immune from negative feedback for their own decisions .
This arrangement is guaranteed to reduce the accuracy of information that is conveyed by prices .
Furthermore , when the intervention in question relates to the control of the money supply , we can be certain that the information conveyed by the decision of the committee will be less accurate than the information conveyed by individual decision - makers .
Fractional reserve banking creates blindness .
Central banking extends this blindness .
Any economy that relies on fractional reserve banking is flying partially blind .
This blindness becomes permanent when a central bank protects large commercial banks that are regarded as too big to fail .
CONCLUSION
Fractional reserve banking is inherently fraudulent .
It inflates the money supply .
It creates the boom - bust cycle .
Through central banking , it transfers planning authority to bureaucrats with only an indirect stake in the outcome of their decisions .
It is the basis of the modern economy .
The booms and busts get worse .
The dollar depreciates .
Central planning increases .
Information becomes more distorted .
This will end badly .
Worse , it may start over again .

It 's surprising at how many people make bets on horse races without the slightest understanding of the tote board .
While all of those numbers on the board may seem imposing , the odds and payoffs are actually pretty easy to learn .
And by doing so , you will be able to make and calculate better bets .
Reading the Win Odds
The easiest information on the board is the win odds quoted on each horse .
They do n't tell you what the horse will pay , but the amount of profit you will get and the amount you have to bet to get it .
For example , 6 - 5 means you will get $ 6 in profit for every $ 5 you wager , while 20 - 1 means you get $ 20 in profit for every $ 1 you wager .
In the latter example , a bet of $ 2 means you would get $ 42 back for a winning wager .
Payoffs use the actual odds and are rounded down to the nearest nickel or dime , depending on the rules at that track .
This rounding is called breakage .
Calculating the Win Odds on a Horse
If you want to calculate the exact win odds on a horse , you will need to use a couple of other figures from the tote board :
Total win pool
Amount bet on that horse
The total pool is all the money bet on all the horses to win , but it is not the amount that will actually be paid out to the holders of winning tickets .
Before the track pays off the winners , they deduct the " take , " which is generally between 14 and 20 percent and is different in every state .
This money goes to pay state and local taxes , payment for the horsemen , expenses at the track , and the track 's profit .
To calculate the exact odds on your horse , just subtract the take from the total pool , then subtract the amount bet on your horse to give you the amount of cash to be paid out .
Divide that figure by the amount bet on your horse to get the exact odds .
This figure will always be rounded off to the nearest dime ( usually ) or nickel , as mentioned previously , before the payoffs are calculated .
Here is a simple example of win odds calculation :
Total pool : $ 900
Amount bet on horse No. 1 : $ 300
Take amount : 15 percent
$ 900 minus 15 percent equals $ 765
$ 765 minus $ 300 equals $ 465
$ 465 divided by $ 300 equals $ 1.55
Round this amount off to $ 1.50 for breakage and you get odds of 1.5 - 1 or 3 - 2 , as it would normally be written , which yields a payoff of $ 5 on a wager of $ 2 .
Payoffs for $ 2 Win Bets
Since most tracks have a $ 2 minimum bet , below is a handy chart to look up the payoff for a $ 2 bet at various odds .
Remember , your actual payoff may differ from this chart , as the odds on the tote board are rounded off , so 2 - 1 odds on the tote board may actually be 1.9 - 1 or 2.2-1 .

Icann oversees the structure of the net
The internet is on the brink of the " biggest change " to its working " since it was invented 40 years ago " , the net regulator Icann has said .
The body said it that it was finalising plans to introduce web addresses using non-Latin characters .
The proposal - initially approved in 2008 - would allow domain names written in Asian , Arabic or other scripts .
The body said if the final plans were approved on 30 October , it would accept the first applications by 16 November .
The first Internationalised Domain Names ( IDNs ) could be up and running by " mid 2010 " said the president of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) .
" Of the 1.6 billion internet users today worldwide , more than half use languages that have scripts that are not Latin - based , " said Rod Beckstrom at the opening of Icann 's conference in Seoul , South Korea .
" So this change is very much necessary for not only half the world 's internet users today but more than half , probably , of the future users as the internet continues to spread . "
Relaxed rules Plans for IDNs were approved at a meeting in June 2008 .
However , testing of the system has been going on for much longer , said Peter Dengate Thrush , chairman of the board in charge of reviewing the change .
" You have to appreciate what a fantastically complicated technical feature this is , " he said .
" What we have created is a different translation system . "
The changes will be applied to the net 's Domain Name System .
This acts like a phone book , translating easily understood domain names such as bbc.co.uk into strings of computer readable numbers known as IP addresses .
The tweaks will allow this system to recognise and translate the non-Latin characters .
" We are confident that it works because we have been testing it for a couple of years , " said Mr Dengate Thrush .
" We 're really ready to start rolling it out . "
Some countries , such as China and Thailand , have already introduced workarounds that allow computer users to enter web addresses in their own language .
However , these were not internationally approved and do not necessarily work on all computers .
The meeting in South Korea will also discuss its plans to introduce generic Top Level Domains ( TLDs ) , such as .uk or .com .
Last year , the body voted to relax rules on TLDs meaning companies could turn brands into web addresses , while individuals could use their names .
Icann , set up by the US government , was founded in 1998 to oversee the development of the net .
Last month , after years of criticism , the US government eased its control over the non-profit body .
It signed a new agreement that gave Icann autonomy for the first time .
The agreement came into effect on 1 October and puts it under the scrutiny of the global " internet community " .

Mornin ' Fellow Patriots !
So , I want to talk about the real war this morning .
Not that we do n't do our part in the real war , but something apart from our little battlefield , and something that makes what we do all the more important .
Last night , I was reading an article from The Long War Journal analysing the air strikes in pakistan .
So far in 2009 , there have been 42 strikes , already more than than the 36 from last year .
And , that 's just great ' cause I 'm all for the Hellfire into jihadi campaign .
By all accounts , it 's taking a serious toll on alqada and taliban operatives : 404 killed , with some nice high value targets tossed in for good measure .
In addition , the death toll to civilians remains relatively low at 43 .
President Obama , to his credit , has continued and even intensified the Hellfire into jihadi campaign .
And he ordered up a surge in Afghanistan .
Good moves , both .
As I am sure you have heard , though , he is rethinking his strategy .
Moving from a counterinsurgency to a counter intelligence campaign .
But , one of the things that makes the Hellfire into jihadi campaign so successful , is boots on the ground .
I hope we keep enough boots on the ground .
Here is the bummer thing , though .
He made this decision , to change course , after having have had one conversation with the general he picked to lead the charge .
That 's not leading , that 's being led .
Very disappointing .
So , with that said , how 's about we take out some islamo - facist , terrorist supporting e-jahidi trash !
Hwang Woo-suk was a hero in South Korea until the revelations of fraud A South Korean court has convicted the disgraced cloning scientist Hwang Woo -suk of embezzlement over his stem cell research .
He was given a two - year sentence suspended for three years .
The 56 - year - old scientist 's work had raised hopes of finding cures for diseases such as Alzheimer's .
But his research was declared bogus in 2005 , and he was put on trial the following year for embezzlement and accepting money under false pretences .
Hwang 's research made him a South Korean hero until revelations that it was false shocked the nation .
" He was guilty of fabrication , " the Seoul court said , adding that Hwang illegally diverted a portion of the money he received for non-research related purposes .
Prosecutors had demanded a four - year prison term .
But despite the conviction for embezzlement , Hwang was cleared of separate fraud charges and the judge found that he had " truly repented for his crime " .
His two - year sentence has been suspended for three years .
Awe , then shock As soon as his colleagues at Seoul National University had concluded Hwang 's work had been " intentionally fabricated " , Hwang resigned and apologised .
" I sincerely apologise to the people for creating shock and disappointment , " he said , after his fall from grace in 2005 .
ANALYSIS John Sudworth , BBC News , Seoul
Hwang was hailed as a national hero in South Korea .
He was awarded the title " supreme scientist " and heralded as a harbinger of a hi-tech , bio - tech future .
The real concern here is that there is damage to South Korea 's international scientific reputation as a result of all this .
The claims he made back then held out real hope for sufferers of diseases like Parkinson 's and cancer that these stem cell breakthroughs really would lead to improvements in medical care .
However he maintained that the science behind his work was sound , and that his country 's scientists were still leading the field .
" I emphasise that patient - specific stem cells belong to South Korea and you are going to see this , " he said .
The controversy caused shockwaves in South Korea , where the cloning pioneer was once widely considered a national hero .
However , Hwang and his team claimed to have created the world 's first dog clone in 2005 , an achievement which was independently confirmed .
Since 2002 , he received $ 40 m ( £ 23 m ) in grants from the science and technology ministry alone .
In May 2005 , Hwang published a paper in the journal Science , saying his team had extracted material from cloned human embryos that identically matched the DNA of 11 patients .
It was claimed such a technique could be the key to providing personalised cures for diseases such as cancer , Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's .

Profile : Hwang Woo-suk Q&A : Stem cells
But an investigating university panel said that all 11 sets of data were derived from only two stem cell lines .
The panel said it still did not know whether those two stem cell clusters had actually been cloned .
" Based on these findings , data in the 2005 Science journal cannot be regarded as a simple accidental error but as intentional fabrication made out of two stem cells , " the investigators said .
" This is a serious wrongdoing that has damaged the foundation of science , " it said .
Scandal had earlier erupted when Hwang was forced to step down as chairman of South Korea 's World Stem Cell Hub , after admitting that eggs for research were donated by his own female colleagues , in breach of guidelines .
The South Korean government stripped him of the license to carry out stem cell research in 2006 , citing " ethical problems " .
In his defence , Hwang has denied ordering his researchers to falsify results , saying at least one of them deceived him .
He has also denied he intentionally embezzled research funds , saying that absent - mindedness was to blame for any flawed book keeping .
Hwang still works in animal cloning at a local institute .

When I was a kid I prayed all the time .
I prayed for world peace and universal understanding ; more specifically , I prayed that my grandparents and my parents would live forever , that my dying cat would stop coughing , and that my classmates would forget to torment me .
When I got a little older , I prayed to propitiate the Almighty .
I thought that if I made myself sufficiently craven , I could shame Him into pulling His punches .
I apologized so often and for so many things that I had to devise a special shorthand to get them all in .
I was obsessive , to put it mildly — in fact I was perseverative ( the clinical term for the uncontrollable repetitions of words or gestures ) .
Nowadays they medicate kids who act that way and that ’s not a bad thing .
In time , I learned to still the chatter in my head .
I stopped worrying so much about being punished and stopped asking for special dispensations .
Once in a while I experienced moments of real exaltation — in the beauty of James Joyce ’s prose , the timbre of Pharoah Sanders ’ tenor saxophone , in the shattering wisdom of the Book of Job—intimations of what Christians called the Mysterium tremendum and what the Hasids that I encountered in Yiddish stories called Ein sof ( without end ) .
When I was a sophomore in college I read W.T. Stace ’s Time and Eternity ( 1952 ) and the phrase “ that than which there is no other ” really stayed with me .
By then I had stopped praying altogether because I no longer believed in a God who was a projection of my fears and desires , but provisionally at least in one who was truly other and genuinely incommensurate with me .
I know that many people approach their spirituality in a completely different way and I have no argument with them .
I have a dear friend , a Lutheran minister , who rolls up his sleeves and wrestles with demons from time to time and actually carries on two - way conversations with the living Christ .
I know Jews — believers and non-believers alike — who derive tremendous satisfaction from davening .
I do n’t disdain prayer ; it ’s just not something I do .
Maybe if I had been raised observantly , or if I had praised more and pleaded less when I did pray , if I had loved rather than merely feared God , it would be that way for me too .
The God I choose not to pray to is the source of the infinitely vast and the impossibly intricate — of the Spiral Nebula and the double helix ; of redwood trees in nature and the dendritic trees in my brain .
We stand in relationship to each other , this God and I , but we do n’t have a relationship , any more than one of the cells in my liver could relate meaningfully to me .
It ’s not that I do n’t feel the breath of the eternal when I look at a sunset or into my children ’s eyes .
I do .
But if I prayed , I do n’t think that I would .

New Drug May Lift Curse of Menstrual Cramps
About 15 percent of women have pain so bad they can not go to school or work .
Oct. 13 , 2009  -- Candace Jones suffered monthly menstrual pains throughout adolescence , but she did n't fully understand how bad they were until she went into labor with her first child .
" The cramping was so severe you could compare it to the contractions with the baby , " said the 26 - year - old Springfield , Va. , mother .
Since having two children and turning to a new form of birth control -- the IUD -- the cramps have subsided , she said , but the memories of missing running and swimming practices and staying in bed with a heating pad are still vivid .
Jones , like about 15 percent of all menstruating women , suffered from dysmenorrhea -- stabbing or aching lower abdominal or back pain that can cripple women for days each month .
For generations , the only treatment for menstrual pain was over - the - counter medicines like Motrin and Midol .
But now , there may be a cure for the root cause of the cramping .
Scientists have created a pill that targets the cause of stomach cramps , rather than just treating its symptoms .
The drug , known as VA111913 , has been manufactured by the British company Vantia Therapeutics and is in clinical trials in Britain and in the United States .
So far , it has been proven safe and has few side effects and could be on the market in four years if secondary trials are successful .
' I think it would be fair to call it a breakthrough .
There is certainly no other treatment like it , " Vantia researcher Dr. Jim Phillips told Britain 's Daily Mail .
" From our research there is nothing to suggest it wo n't work . "
During the next two months in the United States , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) will test the drug on 128 women between ages 18 and 35 who describe their menstrual pain as severe enough to interfere with daily life .
They will receive VA111913 for a maximum of six days during their menstrual cycle .
Menstrual Cramp Drug for Women Without Other Problems
The drug would be used to treat primary dysmenorrhea , which is defined as pain that occurs in otherwise healthy women .
Causes of secondary dysmenorrhea can be fibroids , endometriosis , ovarian cysts , pelvic inflammatory disease and infections from sexually transmitted diseases , according to Medline Plus , an online resource for the NIH .
The new drug works as a receptor on the hormone vasopressin , which has effects on fluid balance and smooth muscles like the heart and the uterus , according to Dr. Michelle Warren , medical director of the Center for Menopause , Hormonal Disorders and Women 's Health at Columbia University .
" About 15 percent of all women have cramps bad enough to keep them at home on strong pain medicine , especially in their early years under 20 , " Warren told ABCNews.com .
" If it last a day or more , it 's considered severe , " she said .
The " old standbys " like anti-inflammatory drugs are somewhat effective , according to Warren .
" But getting cramps is annoying and worrisome on the day you are getting married or your senior prom . "
" The pain is real , " she said .
" That 's why they call it the curse . "
Sometimes women resort to stronger painkillers that can zone them out and have numerous side effects .
Tina , a 29 - year - old administrative assistant from New York City who did not want her last name used , said she suffers so severely from cramping that her mother sends her codeine - based pain medication from Britain , where it can be purchased over the counter .
Old Painkillers Can Cause Damage
On a recent doctor 's visit , Tina was asked if she was an alcoholic , because of the damage the painkillers were doing to her liver .
She was told to stop .
But Tina said that because the pain can be " intolerable , " she continues to use the medicine .
" It 's so bad that I am left to the point where I have to leave work early , crying and breaking out into a sweat , " said Tina , who has been getting monthly pain since her first period at 10 .
" I can't stand up and it lasts until the second or third day , " she said .
" I have tried other pills , but they do n't work . "
Painful menstruation is the leading cause of lost time from school and work among women in their teens and 20s , according to NIH data .
" A lot of this is age related , " said Ellen W. Freeman , director of the premenstrual syndrome program at the University of Pennsylvania .
" About 60 percent of all adolescents are troubled with menstrual cramps .
But it tends to decrease with age .
By the late 30s it 's down to 20 percent . "
For Meghan Berry , a 28 - year - old Web editor from New York City , the stabbing pain was so severe she had to go on birth control pills , which she described as a " cure - all . "
" They were really intense my junior and senior years in high school , " she told ABCNews.com .
" At their worst , I had problems standing up and doubled over .
I would drive to school , but then my period would come and my mother would have to pick me up . "
The new drug could be " an alternative route " for young girls who do n't want to take birth control , Berry said .
" I think it 's incredibly difficult for a whole host of issues when a girl has to address that with her parents , " she said .
" Having a complete separate drug would be really nice for these young women . "
It 's not only young women who might be helped by a new drug .
Mary Beth Matterfis is 43 and said she has been buckled by menstrual cramps since she was 17 or 18 .
" My mother never had any cramps and the story used to be , you 're like your mother , " said Matterfis , who works at an investment bank .
" Great .
She saved it all up for me . "
" Sometimes I go to stand up and my legs give out , " she told ABCNews.com .
" It 's inconsistent for me .
There are times I do n't even know I have [ my period ] and times when I literally go into shakes and feel my heart going and have to stop because I feel faint with palpitations and cold sweats . "
One day , she said , she felt her period coming on and went to get some fresh air .
" On the way back it hit me and I stood behind a store vomiting , feeling like I was going to pass out , " Matterfis said .
But as bad as the pain is , Matterfis said , she is nervous about taking any kind of drug , especially ones that are stronger than ibuprofen .
" You do n't want to take strong drugs when you are 17 , and when you are older and in college or working you can't take them because you have to function , " she said .
As for the still unnamed VA111913 , Matterfis said if trials are successful , she will ask her doctor about its safety and side effects .
" If they can prevent some of these things from happening to me every month -- how long will I get this in all , for 12 periods a year and 40 years or more ? -- that would be a miracle , " she said .
The Associated Press , self - declared enemy of internet evildoers , says it has seen some awesome new Microsoft search technology — top secret stuff — that will return its content to a position of total world domination .
Google is so history .
According to Harvard 's Nieman Journalism Lab , AP CEO Tim Curley ( pictured ) recently let slip at a Hong Kong gathering of journalists that the AP has n't even talked to Google as part of its complete overhaul of the way it syndicates content online .
Why bother , when Microsoft is clearly so lethally good , online ?
" They know how to have a conversation , " for one , unlike a certain other tech giant , plus they gave AP this , just , killer demo :
Microsoft this month has some new technology that it 's unveiling that will be much more visually dramatic than anything you 've seen before .
Multimedia in ways you have n't thought about yet .
We 've seen it , we 've seen the technology .
Oh , and Microsoft also just happens to have basically promised to give AP top ranking — " privileging " their content , as Nieman puts it — over other sources reporting the same news .
Never mind if other sources add information to a linked AP story , or generate lots of buzz by using an AP link to launch an in - depth opinion piece .
Quality = AP , always .
Which is why Microsoft Bing will rule the internet , real soon now .
What could possibly go wrong ?
The Government was defeated in the Lords tonight as peers voted to give a Deputy Chief Coroner the role of specialising in military inquests .
Tory backbencher Baroness Fookes 's amendment to the Coroners and Justice Bill won support from both main opposition parties and was backed by 153 votes to 127 , majority 26 .
Lady Fookes said that since the start of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan some coroners had developed specialist knowledge .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
She said the difference a coroner experienced at holding military inquests made to the feelings of the family of a dead service person " cannot be underestimated " .
Lady Fookes added : " The fear is that that expertise might be lost with the passage of time and hence the purpose of the amendment is to ensure a senior Deputy Chief Coroner has overall responsibility for supervising any military inquest and for ensuring that those coroners who undertake it have specialist training . "
Backing the amendment , Baroness Butler - Sloss , the former head of the family division of the High Court , said that training for coroners was " extremely good " .
But she told peers that military inquests were such a specialist area it would be " inappropriate " to train all coroners to deal with them .
She said that it would be better to have " two or three " coroners specialising in the area .
" If there is n't someone in charge it is just the sort of thing that could slip through the net , " she added .
Lord Tunnicliffe , for the Government , argued that the Chief Coroner , a post created by the Bill , would ensure that coroners received appropriate training to carry out military inquests .
He said : " I remain confident that the Bill provides for all coroners to be skilled to tackle all notifications that come before them .
" There will be the oversight and responsibility for training on service personnel inquests that Lady Fookes wishes to see .
This will be the role of the Chief Coroner . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Female chief executives earned just 58 percent of what their male counterparts did in 2008 , and their compensation packages were slashed three times as much as their male peers , according to a survey released on Monday .
Corporate governance research firm the Corporate Library said total realized compensation -- which includes base salary , bonuses , perquisites , benefits , and the value realized on the exercise of options and vesting of other equity -- fell by a median of 18.5 percent in 2008 for female CEOs .
In the same period , the compensation of male CEOs fell 6.1 percent , the survey revealed .
Top female chief executives ’ median base salary was $ 40,000 higher than that for male CEOs , but men’s ’ discretionary bonuses were more than 3.5 times larger than those given to females , and men ’s perquisite payments were nearly twice the amount received by women , the survey said .
Female CEOs earned on average 58 percent of what males earned in realized compensation , the Corporate Library said .
United Therapeutics Corp ’s Martine Rothblatt was the only female CEO among the top 150 earners of 2008 , with total compensation worth $ 21.8 million .
Among female CEOs , Rothblatt was followed by Avon Products Inc ’s Andrea Jung , with $ 13.9 million in total realized compensation , and TJX Companies Inc ’s Carol Meyrowitz , with $ 12.8 million .
The survey was based on compensation data of 2,703 U.S. listed companies .
Women CEOs accounted for only 3 percent of the total , the Corporate Library wrote in the report .
The survey also found that women are more likely to serve as CEOs at smaller companies .
A friend replaced her laptop 's battery after only two years because it would n't hold a charge .
I suggested she should n't keep her laptop always plugged in , but I wondered — was this outdated geek lore , rendered obsolete by modern batteries ?

Yes and no .
It depends , of course , on what kind of battery you have .
Battery technology has come a long way over the years , and surely in 2009 you do n't have to worry about how long your laptop 's been plugged in .
However , one major notebook manufacturer ( which ships Lithium- ion batteries ) thinks you should , and suggests adding a reminder to your calendar to deplete and recharge your battery once a month .
To quote : " Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time . "

My friend , however , has a two - year - old Dell .
Cursory Googling for her model did n't turn up the equivalent of Apple 's definitive statement , only lots of opinions which ranged from " it 's a non-issue " to " yes , it kills batteries ! "
Dell.com 's battery recommendations page does n't say anything about not keeping your notebook plugged in .
HP 's battery tips page does n't answer the question , either .
I pored through my wife 's ASUS Eee PC user guide and did n't find any warning about continuous charging .
A non-mention might make you think it 's a non-problem , but if this is an issue for Apple notebook batteries , it is for PC notebooks with lithium - based batteries too .
When I asked , my Twitter followers returned mixed replies , but many notebook users ( both Mac and PC ) DID report anecdotal battery problems when the machine was plugged in constantly .
Other folks more educated about the differences in battery types than I am dropped knowledge about which ones are problematic and which are n't .

Fletcher Prouty Commentary - Sept
This article is from " People and the PURSUIT of the Truth " for June , 1978
This is the way the Warren Commission began .
They had been appointed at the end of November .
By the time of this January 27 , 1964 meeting , they had seen and beard tons of FBI and Secret Service " opinions " and " findings . "
They were overwhelmed then , even as they started overwhelmed .
This was exactly the way it ended .
Kennedy was dead .
Oswald was dead .
The FBI and the Secret Service had " solved " the case .
The Warren Commission was going to have to put its collective signatures on the verdict .
That is exactly what they did and not a bit more .
That verdict , effectively dictated to them between November 30 .
1963 and January 27 , 1964 is still the vastest coverup of this century .
Nixon 's Three Stories of Where He Was on November 22 , 1963
In the first place , strange things which could scarcely all be coincidence happened even before JFK was killed .
On the morning of November 22 , 1963 , the day Kennedy was killed the New York Times carried an item on a back page , It was datelined Dallas .
And it said that ex-Vice - President Richard M. Nixon had made a speech in Dallas before a group of businessmen ,
Not only did the Times carry that story on the very day JFK died , but Nixon was in Dallas the day Kennedy died , and it is very possible that he was still in Dallas at the moment Kennedy died .
Despite all other reports to the contrary .
And of course the thing that makes this so very important is that Nixon and others have for some reason tried to conceal that fact for more than twelve years .
By itself , this would not be important .
Being in Dallas on November 22nd .
1963 does not make just anyone .
for example , Nixon , a murderer ; but the record of Nixon 's visit to Dallas has been deliberately obscured .
Let 's pick three " official " versions of Nixon 's actions that day and see how they compare and then what the differences may signify .
Story One
Not long after Kennedy was shot , Nixon wrote an unusually long article for the Reader 's Digest .
It appeared in the November 1964 issue under the strange title , " Cuba , Castro , and John F Kennedy . "
Prepared as it was by Nixon or for his signature and prepared for the massive worldwide audience of the August Reader 's Digest , we are asked to believe that this is the factual account of what took place .
Nixon says
" I urged , in a statement to the press [ Dallas on November 21 that the President and the vice - president be shown the respect to which their office entitled them . "
Nixon added ,
" I boarded a plane in Dallas on the morning of November 22 to New York .
We arrived on schedule at 12:56 .
I hailed a cab .
We were waiting for a light to change when a man ran over from the street corner and said that the President had just been shot in Dallas .
This is the way that I learned the news . "
Story Two
Now let 's look at another Nixon account of the same day The November 1973 issue of Esquire magazine carried the following Nixon quote ;
" I attended the Pepsi Cola convention [ in Dallas ] and left on Friday morning .
November 22 , from Love Field .
Dallas , on a flight back to New York , . . on arrival in New York we caught a cab and headed for the city the cabbie missed a turn somewhere and we were off the highway . . . a woman came out of her house screaming and crying .
I rolled down the cab window to ask what the matter was and when she saw my face she turned even paler .
She told me that John Kennedy had just been shot in Dallas , "
Story Three
Now let 's look at the " official " account from " The Day Kennedy was Shot , by Jim Bishop : "
" At Idlewild Airport now JFK Airport ) in New York , reporters and photographers had been waiting for the American Airlines plane among ( the passengers ) was Nixon .
As he got off the plane he thought that he would give ' the boys ' basically the same interview he had granted in Dallas .
Nixon posed for a few pictures . . . got into a taxi- cab was barely out of the airport when one of the reporters got the message :
The President has been shot in Dallas . "
Comparison
Now let 's compare these .
Nixon was in Dallas on November 22 .
The versions agree that he took some plane out in the morning Bishop says it was American Airlines and that it went into Idlewild .
Nixon says that it landed precisely at 12:56 nearly one half - hour after Kennedy had been shot .
Certainly the crew would have heard over their radio that the president had been shot and would have told their passengers .
Then Bishop says reporters and photographers were there .
Certainly they too would have known about Kennedy 's murder by then .
Everyone else in the world did .
Bishop says the photographers took pictures .
Where are they ?
Nixon says he traveled to New York from Dallas with a friend .
Who ?
And what is his story ?
Nixon says he got in a cab , presumably well after 12:56 .
What cabbie in New York City would have not known the news by then ?
And then Nixon tells a strange story .
The first time a man ran out to the cab with the news , and the second time the cab was " lost " and a woman ran out screaming and crying the news .
These different accounts do not hold water .
With all of this very contrived series of accounts it looks as though someone has been fabricating a cover - up of Nixon 's actions that day .
Why ?
The True Story
Actually , Nixon was in Dallas when JFK was shot .
On April 2nd 1975 a young man was listening to a talk at his school when he heard the lecturer tell about the Esquire account of Nixon 's trip to Dallas , and how and when Nixon had learned about JFK 's death .
That young man then told the lecturer , " My father was an executive for the Pepsi Cola Company , and he was in Dallas on November 22nd 1963 at that convention .
He has told me that Nixon was there in Dallas at the convention when the announcement was heard that JFK had been killed , Nixon left later that afternoon , "
This young man is the son of Mr. Harvey Russel of the Pepsi Cola Company .
When Mr. Russel was informed of his son's account , he agreed that his son 's story was true .
Mr. Russel confirmed that Nixon was attending that meeting at the time the shots were fired .
He added Nixon was there representing the Pepsi Cola Company 's law firm Mudge , Rose , Nixon et al .
The Dallas newspapers stated that Nixon was attending a board meeting .
Mr. Russel confirmed that the session Nixon was attending broke up when the assassination news came through .
Nixon then returned to his hotel and later in the afternoon had been driven to the Dallas airport by a Mr. Deluca , also a Pepsi Cola official .
These surprising series of events and the manner in which they unfolded after all these years underscore that there was something unusual about Nixon 's visit to Dallas .
Telephone calls to Deluca and again to Russel did little more than highlight their growing concern over the inadvertent disclosure of this story .
Since the start of this deep recession back in December of 2007 some 7.2 million jobs have been lost in the official BLS reports .
The official non -farm employment has dropped from 138 million to 130 million .
Think of it this way , for 21 months we have lost on average over 11,000 jobs per day .
As we reach the two year anniversary of this recession not much has changed for the average American .
The banking system is still in shambles and the employment picture is still bleak .
Yet a surprising revision was made in the recent BLS report .
That is , in February of 2010 when revisions are made some additional 824,000 jobs were lost !
That is correct , some 824,000 jobs have been lost and these do not show up in the current BLS data .
Take a look at the revision :
Interestingly enough the only industry that has seen a revision to the upside is in government employment .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have been pumping trillions into the economy but only into specific sectors .
This revision if incorporated today would put the official number of jobs lost during this recession at 8 million , or 10 percent higher than what is being fed in the headline numbers .
But the headline number as we all know understates the real problems in our economy .
The U - 6 data is now at 17 percent and this looks at unemployment and underemployment .
U - 6 is an important measure because we are seeing a big leap in part - time employment in this recession .
Through furloughs or hours cut , people are losing their purchasing power and given our economy is 70 percent based on consumption this is a vital indicator on whether we move out of recession anytime soon .
The average amount of hours worked is still dropping at a steady pace :
This trend is unmistakable .
People are working less and seeing stagnant growth in their wages .
Why then would we expect people in this economic climate to be spending more money ?
The housing bubble occurred in this backdrop and instead of adjusting to the new drop in wages and working conditions people were provided easy credit to create a false economy for a decade .
As you would expect with so many people not working the government is now collecting less money but also , spending more :
The above chart is probably one of the most important charts that we have .
Going back to the late 1940s , never have we seen government spending ramp up this quickly while tax receipts have pulled back .
We would have to go back to the Great Depression for data like this .
Why is it hard to find data like this for the Great Depression ?
Not many statistical agencies existed back then .
In fact , most of the macro data tracking we now have is because of the Great Depression .
Yet even though some of the government spending during the Great Depression put people back to work today ’s government spending is basically a free giveaway to the crony banking system .
In fact , the largest amount of money has gone directly into the banks .
This is n’t like we put aside $ 1 trillion for direct job creation .
Instead , we have set aside $ 12 trillion for banks under the pretext of consumer lending and liquidity yet anything but that has occurred :
For the first time since the 1960s has consumer credit contracted on a year over year basis .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve sold the American people that banks needed money to lend out in the so - called liquidity crisis .
What really happened is banks got money to protect themselves from additional losses that they know they will face .
We can see this in excess reserves :
Banks are holding tight to this money because we have many issues coming down the pipeline including the $ 3 trillion in commercial real estate that will cause further problems .
In fact , I have felt this first hand .
Instead of getting 15 to 20 credit card offers a week I now get about 2 or 3 a week .
Also , I have had my credit line cut back on a couple of credit cards even though I have perfect credit and have never missed a payment .
I ’m sure many of you are in a similar situation .
I have had friends have home equity lines disappear because their home is no longer worth what they once thought it was .
The banks stated that they are cutting back because of “ a willingness to work with me ” and the fact that I have never maxed out my credit cards like a B - list celebrity on Rodeo Drive .
What banks are doing is understandable .
They should have been doing this in 2000 and not now when they have taken trillions from taxpayers .
I think there will be a tipping point in the near future when the public wakes up from this massive scheme and robbery .
Banks realize this and that is why Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase have come out on the overdraft robbery .
They are now trying to cut these down but somehow I doubt they ’ll give back those billions they have made over the years .
This is just a PR stunt .
Yet all of this ties back to the employment report .
If we tie in the additional job losses since the start of the recession it would look like this :
Source : Calculated Risk
Putting all of this together shows a dismal unemployment picture :
And the job losses in this recession are more permanent than in other recession .
If we look at how many people have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more , the number is off the charts :
This long term unemployment tells us that we can expect structural changes in our economy for years to come .
Someone that has been unemployed for this long is at risk of losing employment in their industry .
Just think of all the mortgage brokers , construction workers , and those closely tied to the real estate industry .
The only way they will get their jobs back at the peak rate is if we have another housing bubble .
That is highly unlikely .
The 824,000 revision is enormous .
Historically this revision is off the charts :
“ For national CES employment series , the annual benchmark revisions over the last 10 years have averaged plus or minus two - tenths of one percent of total nonfarm employment .
The preliminary estimate of the benchmark revision indicates a downward adjustment to March 2009 total nonfarm employment of 824,000 ( 0.6 percent ) . ”
In other words , the headline numbers do n’t tell the real story of the current economic situation .

The US Department of Defense is promoting the positive aspects of free and open - source software for use in sensitive and un-restricted government IT projects .
The department has highlighted six benefits to tackle what it called " misconceptions and misinterpretations " of the existing laws , policies , and regulations .
The current rules were written in May 2003 .
The DoD claimed that lingering issues have " hampered effective DoD use and development of OSS [ open source software ] , " said the department 's document , released Tuesday .
The department highlighted the confusion that surrounds open - source licenses and encouraged people to take the time to learn about the different licenses .
Specifically , it corrected the notion that use of open - source in software projects or modification of code would mean the government is then obliged to distribute its own code , that " OSS should not be integrated or modified for use in classified or other sensitive DoD systems . "
" Many open - source licenses permit the user to modify OSS for internal use without being obligated to distribute source code to the public , " the DoD wrote .
It points out that the GPL requires distribution of corresponding source code to the recipient of the software if the modified code is released .
DOD deputy chief information officer David Wennergren , who wrote the document , said : " For this reason , it is important to understand both the specifics of the open - source license in question and how the Department intends to use and distribute any DOD - modified OSS . "
Like the rest of the US government and the private sector in general , the DoD has been a large user of open source .
The White House , meanwhile , has also flown the flag for open - source in government .
Wennergren said DoD agencies must still conduct market search when procuring property or services , so they can't rule - out closed - source or proprietary software out of hand .
But he noted : " There are positive aspects of OSS that should be considered when conducting market research on software for DoD use . "
Those positive aspects are practical and financial .
On the former these center on the openness of the code , which means a continuous and broad peer review of the code , the unrestricted ability to modify the source code , rapid prototyping , reduced reliance on a single developer or vendor , and the fact that licenses do not limited access to use of the software .
On price , Wennergren pointed to the fact products build using open - source code do not use an expensive per-seat licensing model and that the open nature of the code means the maintenance load is spread , potentially reducing lower total cost of ownership . ®
Cornell researchers have discovered a genetic mechanism in fruit flies that prevents two closely related species from reproducing , a finding that offers clues to how species evolve .
When two populations of a species become geographically isolated from each other , their genes diverge from one another over time .
Eventually , when a male from one group mates with a female from the other group , the offspring will die or be born sterile , as crosses between horses and donkeys produce sterile mules .
At this point , they have become two distinct species .
Now , Cornell researchers report in the October issue of Public Library of Science Biology ( Vol. 7 , No. 10 ) that rapidly evolving " junk " DNA may create incompatibilities between two related species , preventing them from reproducing .
In this case , the researchers studied crosses between closely related fruit flies , Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans .
Nearly 100 years ago , scientists discovered that when male D. melanogasters mate with female D. simulans , normal males survive , but the female embryos die .
" It has remained an unsolved problem , " said Patrick Ferree , the paper 's lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of co-author Daniel Barbash , an assistant professor of molecular biology and genetics .
" The question is , what are the elements that are killing these female hybrids and how are they doing that ? "
The researchers found that the female hybrid embryos died very early in development .
In most species , when the male 's sperm ( carrying either an X or Y chromosome ) fertilizes the female 's egg ( containing an X chromosome ) , a new cell forms with a single nucleus containing a sex chromosome from each parent .
If the offspring inherits its father 's X chromosome , it becomes female ; if it inherits a Y chromosome , it becomes male .
Ferree and Barbash found that a unique segment of DNA in the father 's X chromosome leads to embryo death of hybrid females .
The segment of DNA was found in the chromosome 's heterochromatin , a densely packed region of highly repetitive sequences of junk DNA near the chromosome 's center .
During the embryo's initial divisions , the researchers found , a specific segment of heterochromatin gets " sticky " and halts the process , preventing the entire X chromosome from separating properly ; the result is that the early embryo dies .
Researchers have known that DNA in heterochromatin evolves faster than in other parts of the genome .
Also , during early development , the proteins required for cell division come from the mother .
The researchers speculate that the heterochromatin of the male D. melanogaster 's X chromosome has rapidly evolved , such that after mating , the machinery involved in DNA packaging from a D. simulans mother no longer recognizes the D. melanogaster father 's " junk " DNA , Ferree said .
The problematic region of D. melanogaster 's X chromosome contains about 5 million base pairs of DNA , while the same region of D. simulans '
X chromosome contains only about 100,000 base pairs , a 50 - fold difference , said Ferree .
" It points to a species - specific difference in heterochromatin between these two species , " he added .
" This could explain other instances when you have female hybrid lethality , " Ferree said .
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health .
Bluehenge unearthed : Prehistoric site that could be famous stone circle 's little sister
Archaeologists have discovered Stonehenge 's little sister - just a mile from the famous monument .
The prehistoric circle , unearthed in secret over the summer , is one of the most important prehistoric finds in decades .
Researchers have called it ' Bluehenge ' after the colour of the 27 giant Welsh stones it once incorporated - but are now missing .
The prehistoric circle has been named Bluehenge after the colour of the 27 giant stones it once incorporated
The find is already challenging conventional wisdom about how Stonehenge was built - and what it was used for .
Bluehenge was put up 5,000 years ago - around the same time as work began on Stonehenge - and appears to have been a miniature version of it .
The two circles stood together for hundreds of years before Bluehenge was dismantled .
Researchers believe its stones were used to enlarge Stonehenge during one of a number of redevelopments .
Professor Tim Darvill , Stonehenge expert at Bournemouth University , said : ' This adds to the richness of the story of Stonehenge .
' We thought we knew it all , but over the last few years we have discovered that something as familiar as Stonehenge is still a challenge to explore and understand .
It would n't surprise me if there were n't more circles . '
All that remains of the 60ft wide Bluehenge are the holes of 27 giant stones set on a ramped mount .
Chips of blue stone found in the holes appear to be identical to the blue stones used in Stonehenge .
The four - ton monsters , made of Preseli Spotted Dolerite - a chemically altered igneous rock harder than granite - were mined in the Preseli Mountains in Pembrokeshire and then rolled , dragged and floated the 200 miles to the site on the banks of the Avon in Wiltshire .
An aerial view of the world famous monument , Stonehenge , in Salisbury , Wiltshire
Once installed , the stones would have been polished to a dark blue with silver flecks resembling the night sky .
Bluehenge lies at the end of the ' Avenue ' - a ritual pathway that connected Stonehenge to the Avon .
Stonehenge itself was built and rebuilt over 600 years in three main phases .
The first - begun in 3000 BC - saw the creation of a ditch and bank which later enclosed a circle of 56 holes for posts or stones .
Around 2600
BC the site was transformed into two circles of 82 blue stones brought from the Welsh mountains .
Then , 150 years later , the ancient Britons set up 50 - ton sarsen stones quarried at Marlborough , 25 miles away .
The blue stones were dug up and repositioned , and the sarsens used to create the Stonehenge familiar today .
The new find changes this account of this history .
It suggests that the creators of Stonehenge originally built two circles - one with 56 stones at Stonehenge , and another with 27 at Bluehenge .
The stones of the smaller circle were eventually incorporated into the bigger one .
Bluehenge was discovered by Professor Mike Parker Pearson , of Sheffield University , who argues the monuments were linked to rituals of life and death .
Julian Richards , archaeologist and presenter of BBC2 TV series Meet The Ancestors , believes , however , that such certainty is beyond our reach .
' Any one person who says they have the answer is being a bit over - confident , ' he said .
' If you think that Stonehenge was created , used and modified over 1,400 years then it probably was used for many different things . '
Professor Geoffrey Wainwright , who found the source of the Stonehenge stones in Wales with Professor Darvill , said : ' This [ new ] henge is very important because it forms part of the picture of ceremonial monuments in the area and puts Stonehenge into context .
' It 's no longer Stonehenge standing alone , but it has to be seen in context with the landscape . '
Lovers of prehistoric sites will have to wait until February before the full details of Bluehenge are published .
The creators of Stonehenge - who saw the Stone Age pass into the Bronze Age - were farmers who lived in small villages in huts made of wooden stakes and twigs , covered with a thick layer of clay and chalk .
Farming had been established for at least 1,000 years and the builders of Stonehenge were skilled at growing wheat and barley and keeping pigs and sheep .
Some experts believe they made cider and beer and ground wheat into flour to make bread and cakes .
But they were still forced to depend on wild fruit , peas , lentils , nuts and honey .
Clothes were primitive leather coats and jackets , woollen leggings and simple shoes made of skins bound with twine .
No one knows what gods they worshipped , but the alignment of Stonehenge to the solstice shows that the Sun - and maybe the Moon - was important .
In an SEC filing published today , SCO revealed that CEO Darl McBride has been terminated and is no longer with the company .
The decision to fire the controversial CEO is part of a restructuring plan that is based on recommendations made by the Chapter 11 trustee who was assigned to SCO by the justice department .
McBride was the architect and public face of SCO 's misguided campaign against Linux .
He claimed that the open source operating system infringed on SCO 's copyright and included a significant quantity of code stolen from UNIX System V .
On the basis of this claim , SCO threatened to sue a multitude of corporate Linux users and demanded hefty licensing fees .
During the ensuing litigation fiasco , an internal SCO memo was revealed which indicated that SCO 's own internal code audits of Linux found no actual evidence of infringement .
The courts eventually determined that SCO never even owned the relevant UNIX copyrights in the first place .
Even after SCO 's deception was exposed and the company effectively lost its case , Darl McBride continued to insist that the company has evidence of System V code in Linux .
No such evidence has been presented and McBride 's argument directly contradicts testimony given by other SCO executives .
McBride 's stubborn detachment from reality has made him a subject of ridicule in the Linux community .
The SEC filing indicates that SCO COO Jeff Hunsaker and CFO Ken Nielsen will assume the responsibility of managing SCO in collaboration with the trustee .
The company does not intend to name a new CEO .
Additional details of the restructuring plan are said to be forthcoming , but the company says that it has undertaken several cost - cutting measures including a " a modest reduction in SCO 's workforce " and the sale of additional assets .
In a statement issued by SCO 's new leadership , the company indicates that it plans to continue its litigation efforts and will move forward with the appeals process .
The company also says that it plans to continue supporting its UNIX products .
This potentially indicates that SCO has given up on trying to unload its UnixWare assets , a plan that has fallen through several times now as various proposed deals have evaporated .
" These actions , while difficult , are essential to SCO becoming a more agile and efficient company , not just for this year , but for years to come , " said Hunsaker in a statement .
" This restructuring plan reinforces SCO 's ability to continue to sell and support its products while servicing the needs of our customers and partners on a worldwide basis through the stabilization of our financial situation . "
SCO 's numerous reorganization plans have consistently failed .
It seems unlikely that the company is still capable of resurrecting itself .
The courts are also growing impatient with the company 's antics .
Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross blocked SCO 's last attempted asset sale and remarked in his ruling that the company 's hopes for litigation success were like a bad remix of Waiting for Godot .
Now that Darl has been axed , one wonders how long the rest of the company will continue its struggle for survival .

The small squares of colored paper began cropping up on the doors and walls of Henry M. Gunn High School last week , two days after William Dickens , 16 , killed himself on the nearby train tracks .
“ Just keep swimming , ” one Post - it note said .
“ There is always someone who will listen , ” was written on another .
And , “ There ’s no meaning to happiness w/o sadness .
Take it easy . ”
Dickens was the fourth Gunn student in less than six months to commit suicide near where East Meadow Drive crosses the Caltrain tracks here in the affluent , high - achieving heart of the Silicon Valley .
A fifth student tried to kill himself but was thwarted by his mother , who suspected his intentions , followed him to the crossing and saved him with the help of a passer - by .
Community meetings and counseling sessions , soul - searching and finger - pointing have not stopped Palo Alto ’s suicide cluster from growing and have been hard - pressed to comfort grief - stricken families , friends and teachers .
Advertisement
But as debate continued over how to stop the deaths and improve safety at the crossing where the young people stepped in front of moving trains , Sophia Jiang launched Operation Beautiful .
The 16 - year - old Gunn junior got the idea online while looking for something that “ would make myself feel better after hearing about this death , ” she said in an e-mail .
Jiang posted her idea on Facebook and , along with her classmates , began pasting a blizzard of paper scraps with messages of affirmation around campus .
The idea was to “ give students a little bit of hope and sunshine to look up at after the darkness and rain , ” she said .
“ It was kind of like telling each other we were all in this together and that we were going to get through this . ”
Psychiatrists , suicidologists and experts in child development warn that the worst response to teen suicide is to make it seem glamorous or normal .
They caution against shrines .
They teach depression ’s warning signs , which can include changes in interest level , difficulty concentrating and increased isolation .
And they believe that focusing on survivors ’ pain is a key deterrent .

These days , it would be hard to find a better place to witness suicide ’s devastation than graceful , sprawling Gunn High School , with its stately redwoods and park - like grounds .
“ These past few weeks have been difficult for all of us in the Gunn High School Community , ” reads a message on the guidance office window .
“ If you need emotional support at this time or if you are concerned about a friend , please come by the counseling office at any time during the school day . ”
The community is “ shattered , ” said Philippe Rey , executive director of Adolescent Counseling Services , which offers free assistance to students at eight schools in the region , including Gunn .
One teen suicide “ is already difficult , ” he said , but “ two , three , four is really tragic .
There ’s a sense of hopelessness and social depression . ”

After the first two suicides in spring , school officials scheduled grief counselors and community meetings and spoke publicly about the tragedies .
“ You do n’t ever come to terms with it , ” Gunn Principal Noreen Likins told the San Jose Mercury News in early June .
Then an incoming freshman killed herself at the Meadow Drive railroad crossing days before the school year began in August , followed by Dickens ’ death .
Officials are now keeping a low profile .
Likins ’ office referred inquiries to Kevin Skelly , superintendent of the Palo Alto Unified School District .
He declined to comment .
Likins sent a two - paragraph e-mail to Gunn parents last week saying simply that “ William took his own life .
We at school are all struggling to come to terms with this incomprehensible loss . ”
Suicide experts throughout the country have been contacted .
Physicians from Lucile Packard Children ’s Hospital at Stanford , local clergy , Caltrain officials and education experts have all been tapped for solace or planning about how to teach depression ’s warning signs and increase resilience .

It remains unclear what is behind the deaths .
Caltrain spokeswoman Christine Dunn said that the first two have been declared suicides , while the last two are still under investigation , although they “ appear to be intentional . ”
The crossing itself is plain , weedy and less than two miles from the Gunn campus .
Some have requested that a permanent memorial be erected at the site , but the last thing Caltrain wants is to romanticize the suicides or create a safety hazard .
Train crews would “ have to see that every day , ” Dunn said , “ and it ’s very painful for them . ”
Suicide is the third leading cause of death for teenagers , after accidents and homicide .
Teens are suggestible and impulsive , said Dr. Mel Blaustein , who has studied suicides on the Golden Gate Bridge , and if the first death “ was romanticized and seemed like something special , that can start a cluster . ”
Jean - Paul Blanchard , 17 , walked onto the tracks in front of a fast - moving train on May 5 , during the two - week period that Gunn students were taking Advanced Placement tests , which grant them college credit and confer prestige upon their schools .
Early talk blamed the region ’s high standards for causing undue pressure .
Advertisement
Then , on June 2 , Sonya Raymakers , 17 , ended up at the same crossing , with the same result .
But she had already been accepted at New York University , so the pressure theory lost some currency .
Catrina Holmes , 13 , was the incoming freshman who died on Aug. 21 .
Dickens , a junior , killed himself three - tenths of a mile from the same spot .
“ Stress is part of the component , but we ca n’t say it ’s the cause of everything , the main reason these kids are doing it , ” said Denise Pope , a senior lecturer at Stanford University and author of “ Doing School : How We Are Creating a Generation of Stressed Out , Materialistic and Miseducated Students . ”
“ Several of these kids were depressed . ”
Dylan Paddock , a 17 - year - old senior , said his physics instructor found it impossible to teach on Oct. 20 after reading the announcement of Dickens ’ death .
So he took the class on a walk around campus and the park behind it .
They talked , walked and watched the ducks .
“ The teachers have it the hardest in all this , ” Paddock said .
“ They do n’t know how to deal with the fact that their students are killing themselves . ”
Advertisement
Said sophomore Andriy Khrustalyov , 15 : “ My Spanish teacher was crying all day after this latest one .
The staff seems emotionally hurt .
They want us to pull together and help each other . ”
Khrustalyov has volunteered to be a peer counselor through the school ’s new ROCK program , also known as “ Reach Out. Care . Know . ”
About the time Operation Beautiful was born , a blog called HMGGMH was created .
It was modeled after GivesMeHope.com , a forum where people share uplifting moments and shore each other up against the vagaries of life .
A student who signed a post “ Hippopotamus ” said he was grateful for the English teacher who is “ a flipping awesome guy ” because he checks in on students who seem sad .
Advertisement
“ The OtherOne ” wrote on Sunday that “ this was the longest week of my life .
The day after Sonya died , my dad lost his job .
This week has been a reminder of all the residual pain and topped with new incomprehensible pain from losing Will . ”
Then there was “ Anonymous Teacher , ” who wrote on Oct. 22 about being “ humbled by my job . . . by my students . . . by the conception and delivery of this site . ”
“ As I write this , there are tears running down my face for the students I have lost , ” the teacher wrote .
“ But I also remember with distinct clarity how I am privy to the growth of my students and how they truly make me laugh and smile . ”
Most of the Gunn bloggers sign off , “ HMGGMH ” : Henry M. Gunn Gives Me Hope .

A Southwest Airlines flight from Oakland to Las Vegas was turned around Thursday after a man allegedly exposed himself to his female seatmate , punched her when she screamed , then stripped off all of his clothes as flight attendants and passengers subdued him .
The man was arrested , and the woman was taken to a hospital for treatment of her injuries , said Alameda County Sheriff 's Sgt. J.D. Nelson .
Her condition was not known .
Darius Chappille , 21 , of Jefferson City , Mo. , who also has an Oakland address , was arrested and taken to Highland Hospital in Oakland for medical clearance .
He was expected to be booked into Santa Rita Jail in Dublin .
Chappille had an outstanding arrest warrant on drug- related charges in Jefferson City , Nelson said .
Chappille and the female passenger apparently did not know each other , authorities said .
The incident happened aboard Southwest Flight 947 , which has a scheduled departure from Oakland of 7:15 a.m .
An e-mail account from a passenger on the flight , forwarded to The Chronicle , said the incident occurred about a half hour after takeoff .
Flight attendants subdued Chappille , pinning him face - down on the floor , and enlisted the help of passengers in case he tried to escape , the passenger said .
About 10 sheriff 's deputies boarded the plane when it touched down in Oakland at 8:15 a.m. , the e-mail message said , and Chappille was arrested without incident .
Southwest officials said the plane took off for Las Vegas again at 10 a.m .
It was scheduled to continue on to St. Louis .
When Navy Lt. Cmdr. Bill Krissoff deployed to Iraq earlier this year , his assigned job was to serve as a physician at the military hospital in Anbar province .
But he had a private mission as well : to pay homage to his oldest son , Marine Lt. Nathan Krissoff , killed by a roadside bomb outside Fallouja in December 2006 .
After his son ’s death , Krissoff closed his orthopedic practice in Truckee in Northern California and sought to enlist in the Navy medical corps and serve in a war - zone unit caring for Marines .
He was 60 .
When his application for an age waiver got bogged down , a push from the White House sped the process .
He and his wife , Christine , had met President Bush as part of a group of family members of military personnel killed in action .

Krissoff did months of training , then deployed to Iraq with a medical unit from Camp Pendleton in January .
Christine Krissoff moved the household to a spacious home in this northern San Diego County suburb .
At the hospital at Taqaddum , Bill Krissoff patched up sailors and Marines , commonly with shoulder and knee injuries .
The war ’s intensity has declined in Anbar , so there were only a few blast injuries like the one that killed his oldest son .
While Krissoff was in Iraq , his younger son , Marine Lt. Austin Krissoff , 26 , was serving at the nearby base at Al Asad .
In recent weeks , father and son finished their missions and returned to Camp Pendleton .
“ I wanted a sense of completing Nathan ’s unfinished task , ” Krissoff said last week .
“ I think both Austin and I were doing that with this deployment . ”
Advertisement
Now 63 , Krissoff is assigned to the medical staff at the Camp Pendleton hospital .
He has an age waiver until 67 and would be willing to deploy to Afghanistan .
Being in Iraq , he said , helped him understand what his son experienced but did not soften the pain of his loss .
Krissoff opted not to visit the site where his son was killed .
“ I do n’t think you get closure -- at least I do n’t , ” he said .
“ Life goes on .
I was just happy to do my part . ”
Like many families of fallen military personnel , Bill and Christine Krissoff went through grief counseling .
They think of Nathan every day .

While her husband and son were gone this year , Christine Krissoff , 58 , was busy closing one household and opening another .
A horse enthusiast , she rode during the day .
But the nights in an empty house were challenging .
She said she understood the need her husband and younger son felt to go to Iraq .
“ These are the kind of men they are , ” she said .
“ I ’m very proud to have men like that in my life .
We ’re a military family now . ”
Still , there are limits .
“ If Bill asked to go to Afghanistan , we ’re going to have to talk , ” she said .
“ I think we ’ve done a great deal . ”
In his study at their new home , Bill Krissoff ’s shelves are lined with books about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
On the walls are family pictures and a display of photos of Nathan in Iraq with his fellow Marines and with an Iraqi man he befriended .

Krissoff tends to answer questions directly and without hesitation .
Only when asked what Nathan would have thought of him deploying to Iraq did he pause .
“ I think he ’d have been proud , ” he said quietly .

Artist ’s Statement
At 14 years of age , I knew that I was destined to be a fine art photographer .
While living in Rochester , NY , I stumbled across an old building associated with George Eastman , which led to my reading of his biography .
Before I even completed the book , I knew that I was going to be a photographer and for the next 10 years , photography was my complete existence .
If I was n’t taking pictures or in the darkroom , I would spend countless hours looking at every book and image I could find .
There was nothing in my life except photography .
Even at this early age I found myself drawn to a particular style of image , one that would literally cause a physical reaction in me .
They were dark images created by Adams , Weston , Bullock and others .
I knew that I was destined to create such images .
I am often asked , “ Why black and white ? ” I think it ’s because I grew up in a black - and - white world .
Television , movies and the news were all in black and white .
My heroes were in black and white and even the nation was segregated into black and white .
My images are an extension of the world in which I grew up . . . For me color records the image , but black and white captures the feelings that lie beneath the surface .

People seem offended that I treat the new atheists as a social movement rather than an intellectual one .
But the reason is that the arguments against god are all very old and so are even the sentiments .
So here 's some poetry to cheer all atheists up , both old and new .
It 's 160 years since Arthur Hugh Clough wrote this :
The foul engendered worm
Feeds on the flesh of the life - giving form
Of our most Holy and Anointed One .
He is not risen , no ,
He lies and moulders low ;
Christ is not risen .
Ashes to ashes , dust to dust ;
As of the unjust , also of the just –
Christ is not risen .
...
Is He not risen , and shall we not rise ?
Oh , we unwise !
What did we dream , what wake we to discover ?
Ye hills , fall on us , and ye mountains , cover !
In darkness and great gloom
Come ere we thought it is our day of doom ,
From the cursed world which is one tomb ,
Christ is not risen !
Eat , drink , and die , for we are men deceived ,
Of all the creatures under heaven 's wide cope
We are most hopeless who had once most hope ,
We are most wretched that had most believed .
Christ is not risen .
Eat , drink , and play , and think that this is bliss !
There is no Heaven but this !
Darwin had nothing to do with these sentiments – Easter Day was written 10 years before the publication of the Origin .
As for being rude about the pope and Catholics generally – nothing even that the moderators have deleted here comes close to the robustly Protestant sentiments of John Oldham 's ( d 1683 ) Satires upon the Jesuits , from which comes this wonderfully abusive accusation of abuse :
And here I might ( if I but durst ) reveal
What Pranks are play'd in the Confessional :
How haunted Virgins have been dispossest ,
And Devils were cast out to let in Priest :
What Fathers act with Novices alone ,
And what to Punks in shriving Seats is done ;
Who thither flock to Ghostly Confessor ,
To clear old Debts , and tick with Heav'n for more .
Oft have I seen these hallow'd Altars stain'd
With Rapes , those Pews with Buggeries profan'd :
Those of you who want to know the poet 's robustly materialist dismissal of transubstantiation will have to click through to the decent obscurity of Google Books .
In any case , the the point is that all of these arguments are very old and have been better put before .
What 's new is the belief that they are something we in this generation have discovered .
About 50 years after Arthur Hugh Clough 's poem , and decades before the first world war , atheism was already self - evident to the avant - garde , Anatole France could write :
Those who have rejected the dogmas of theological morality , as almost all of us have done in this age of science and intellectual freedom , have no means left of knowing why they are in the world and what they are come there to do .
Fate envelops us entirely in the mysterious processes of her mighty alchemy , and really our one and only resource is to give up thinking altogether , if we are not to feel too cruelly the tragic absurdity of living .
It is here , in our absolute ignorance of the why and wherefore of our existence , lies the root of our melancholy and sick disgust of life .
Physical evil , moral evil , the miseries of the soul and the senses , the prosperity of the wicked , the humiliation of the just man , all this would still be endurable , if we could grasp the system and economy of it all , if we could divine a providence directing the chaos .
The believer finds a perverse pleasure in his sores ; his enemies supply him with the agreeable spectacle of their acts of violence and injustice ; even his misdeeds and crimes do not rob him of hope .
But in a society where all faith is blotted out in darkness , sin and sorrow lose all their meaning , and only strike us as odious jests , ill omened farcical impertinences .
The only development since then is the assertion that it is meaningless to ask what we are in the world for , and perhaps the belief that now sin and sorrow have been robbed of all their meaning , technological progress can one day abolish them .
That really does seem to me " an odious jest , an ill - omened farcical impertinence " .
This year 's Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to three molecular biologists who study ribosomes , the protein factories within cells .
Ribosomes were discovered in the 1950's by George Palade , who went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the makeup of cells , but scientists were n't able to take a close look at those organelles till the end of the century .
Thomas Steitz , Venkatraman Ramakrishnan , and Ada Yonath developed tricks for examining the tiny structures with x-rays and electron beams .
The high - resolution 3D images they acquired will help chemists develop a host of better medications .
“ Scientists around the world are using the winners ' research to develop new antibiotics that can be used in the ongoing battle against antibiotic - resistant microbes that cause so much illness , suffering and death . " said Thomas Lane , president of the American Chemical Society , in a press release .
Dozens of antibiotics — including tetracycline and clindamycin — work by gumming up the ribosomes inside bacteria .
Each of those medications is made up of relatively small molecules that can wedge themselves into crevices in the ribosome , destroying the microbes ' ability to make protein , and thus rendering them helpless .
Armed with 3D images of antibiotic molecules wedged into ribosomes , medicinal chemists can refine their strategy for fighting bacteria .
They can find new weak spots in bacterial ribosomes .
That approach is a lot like the way that the Rebel Alliance destroyed the first Death Star : by looking at its blueprint and finding a weak spot .
Except , in this case the researchers are looking for vulnerable nooks and crannies in a blob of RNA and protein , rather than a thermal exhaust port .
Dozens of 3D images that show antibiotics sticking to ribosomes are available in the Protein DataBank , and you can look at them yourself with a tool called First Glance .
Just type the Protein DataBank ID number for the ribosome that you want to look at , and then start exploring .
Here are some of the best structures :
Ribosome with Clindamycin : 1YJN
Ribosome with Azithromycin : 1NWY
Ribosome with Erythromycin : 1JZY

NEW YORK and COLOMBO , Sri Lanka —
“ Dear Friends , Nice to contact after 100 days . ”
So began an email sent at the end of August from a Sri Lankan government doctor after three months of detainment by the country ’s Terrorist Investigation Division .
The author , Dr. T. Sathiyamoorthy , along with four of his medical colleagues , had been arrested and accused of giving false information to the international community during the last months of Sri Lanka ’s decades - long civil war , which the government won definitively in May when it defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE or Tamil Tigers ) .
From January to May 15 , when they were arrested , the doctors communicated from the war zone almost daily , sending reports of casualties and photographs that often showed dead bodies , shallow bunkers and malnourished children .
Held under provisions of the government 's " emergency regulations , " which allow the detainment of suspects for 18 months without formal charges or access to legal representation , the doctors went silent as they began months of interrogation by the government .
Their release in August was by no means viewed as a victory by the human rights groups and medical organizations who had been monitoring their cases .
One doctor remains in prison and the other four are on parole until their court hearing scheduled for Nov. 9 .
Physicians for Human Rights has said that the detention of the doctors was an attempt to suppress reports about civilians casualties and attacks on hospitals during the last months of the war .
" An embarrassed government has no right to detain doctors for practicing neutral medicine and for providing factual reports about the humanitarian and health situation on the ground , " said Frank Donaghue , chairman of PHR .
Many in the international community , including the EU , have called for an independent inquiry to find out what exactly happened in the war zone , known as the Vanni , where the doctors were stationed .
The final civilian death toll ranges from a U.N. estimate of 7,000 people to a Times of London report that claimed more than 20,000 civilians were killed .
Both sides of the 25 - year conflict have been accused of war crimes .
Responding to allegations that the Tamil Tigers ( LTTE ) used people trapped in the war zone as a human shield , U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said , “ the brutal and inhuman treatment of civilians by the LTTE is utterly reprehensible , and should be examined to see if it constitutes war crimes . ”
The Sri Lankan government is facing equally serious accusations .
In August , a cell phone video that purportedly shows government troops executing naked , unarmed prisoners was circulated widely online .
Government officials have rebuked calls for any independent investigations of the incident or any other war related matters .
Many human rights groups believe the physicians who were arrested could help illuminate the extent of war atrocities committed during the end days of the conflict .
The doctors kept the only known detailed accounts of civilian casualties , and provided information and documentation to media outlets around the world .
One email contained photographs showing plumes of dirt and debris from artillery shells exploding within what had been declared the " no - fire zone " where almost 300,000 civilians were trapped between government and Tamil Tiger forces .
“ Injured patient ward at Mullivaikkal primary health centre was under heavy shell attacked , ” wrote one doctor .
“ There are many death [ sic ] bodies in the roads . ”
In mid-February , faced with depleted medical supplies and overrun outdoor hospitals , the doctors began coordinating with the International Committee of the Red Cross to evacuate the most seriously wounded by boat .
Until May 9 , when the rescue operation ended , the doctors were instrumental in removing 14,000 civilians from the war zone , according to Monica Zanarelli , ICRC ’s deputy head of operations for South Asia .
Some of their dispatches revealed smaller but equally challenging scenarios undertaken by the doctors to save lives .
On April 15 , Dr Thurairajah Vartharajah delivered a set of twins by cesarean on the cement floor of a rudimentary hospital in the " no - fire zone . "
On April 16 , a second set of twins were born at the same hospital .
" These are people who performed absolutely heroically in the last few weeks and months , and deserve every praise and care , " said U.N. Under - Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator John Holmes .
Through April the government continued to deplete LTTE forces but civilians were increasingly squeezed into a smaller sliver of land that had become a death trap .
On April 20 , the army blasted through an earthen wall and an estimated 100,000 civilians flooded through the broken rampart seeking safety .
On May 15 , three of the doctors reportedly fled with 5,000 more civilians to a military checkpoint where they were arrested .
After their arrest , the doctors disappeared for two months .
Then on July 8 , all five appeared at press conference organized by the government and recanted their previous reports of civilian casualties .
" The information that I have given is false , ” said Dr. V Shanmugarajah .
“ The figures were exaggerated due to pressure from the LTTE . ”
The doctors told the assembled journalists that no more than 650 civilians were killed in the last months of the war and that the Tamil Tigers forced them to report inflated numbers in a strategic bid for international sympathy .
The public " confession " came as little surprise to those watching .
" Given the track record of the Sri Lankan government , there are very significant grounds to question whether these statements were voluntary , and they raise serious concerns whether the doctors were subjected to ill - treatment during weeks of detention , " said Sam Zarifi , the Asia - Pacific director for Amnesty International .
Nonetheless , the press conference muddled the extremely contentious issue of how many civilians had been killed and whether they fell from government artillery at the same time the defense minister was assuring the world that there were zero civilian casualties .
For now , four of the five doctors are free on bail .
Whether or not they will ever be free to testify to what really happened in the Vanni remains unknown .
In addition to O'Connor , who reported from New York , one journalist in New York and one in Sri Lanka contributed to this story but wish to remain anonymous to maintain their safety and that of their colleagues .
London , England ( CNN ) -- British singer Morrissey was hospitalized overnight after reportedly collapsing on stage during a concert , medical officials said Sunday .
Morrissey was discharged about 1 p.m. ( 9 a.m. ET ) on Sunday , " much improved , " said Great Western Hospital manager Teresa Harding .
" He was admitted ... as a precautionary measure , " she said , refusing to reveal anything further about his condition or the reason he was hospitalized .
The 50 - year - old recording artist , who seldom uses his full name Steven Patrick Morrissey , was scheduled to perform in Swindon , west of London , on Saturday night .
According to fan accounts on various
Web sites , the singer collapsed after the first song .
" Morrissey is in stable condition after his collapse in Swindon Saturday night , " said a statement on his Web site .
" Thanks go out to all his well wishers , more information will be posted as soon as it is available . "
An ambulance was called to the concert venue just after 9 p.m. ( 4 p.m. ET ) , a spokeswoman for Great Western Ambulance told CNN .
" He was treated on the scene and then taken to hospital , " she said , declining to say anything about the singer 's medical complaint .
She said the ambulance service takes 60 to 70 percent of its patients to hospitals , rather than treat them at the scene .
She asked to be identified only as a spokeswoman for the ambulance service , in line with British custom .
Morrissey was the frontman of the seminal 1980s band The Smiths , before embarking on a successful solo career .
In a 2002 piece , British music magazine NME named The Smiths " the most influential artist ever " -- ahead of the Beatles .
The singer has canceled or rescheduled more than a dozen planned concerts this year , according to his Web site .
Nowadays , Conservative provocateurs like Donald Trump , Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter get lots of media attention for coming up with snarky , quotable insults aimed at Liberals .
But the way was paved for them decades ago by Republican politician Spiro Agnew ( 1918 - 1996 ) , the former Governor of Maryland who became Vice President of the United States under President Richard M. Nixon in 1969 .
Agnew unleashed one of his most famous zingers on October 19 , 1969 .
He was speaking that day at a Republican fund - raising dinner in New Orleans .
Four days earlier , opponents of the Vietnam War had organized a major anti-war demonstration , the October 15th Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam .
Hundreds of thousands of people participated in moratorium events in the United States and Europe .
Agnew was a staunch defender of the Vietnam War , so naturally he had to take a swipe at the protesters .
He characterized them as people who “ overwhelm themselves with drugs and artificial stimulants . ”
and on and on
) to say :
“ Education is being redefined at the demand of the uneducated to suit the ideas of the uneducated .
The student now goes to college to proclaim rather than to learn .
The lessons of the past are ignored and obliterated in a contemporary antagonism known as ‘ The Generation Gap . ’
A spirit of national masochism prevails , encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals . ”
Other Conservatives and the press especially loved that last sentence .
And , soon , the pithy core of it was compressed into the phrases still used today : “ effete intellectual snobs ” and the shorter version “ effete intellectuals . ”
Spiro uttered a number of other catchy , insulting names for Liberals during his four years as Vice President .
Two others that are still cited are “ the nattering nabobs of negativism ” and “ the hopeless , hysterical hypochondriacs of history . ”
Most of Agnew ’s catchy phrases as Vice President were written for him by Nixon ’s speechwriter William Safire , who went on to become a Pulitzer Prize - winning political columnist for The New York Times .
( I was a big fan of Safire ’s “ On Language ” column in the NYT and highly recommend his many excellent books about the origins of famous quotations and phrases . )
Agnew ’s verbal attacks on Liberals made him a darling of Republicans until 1973 , when his past caught with him .
That year , he was charged with taking bribes and evading taxes during his tenure as Governor of Maryland .
He resigned as Vice President on October 10 , 1973 , as part of a plea deal to avoid jail time .
It was quite a scandal at the time .
But , hey – at least Spiro Agnew was n’t taking any of them there psycho- delic drugs or acting like a damn effete intellectual .
However , I do think he may have qualified as a nattering nabob .

On Wednesday , October 14 , 2009 , at 10:00 am in Room B2 at the State House in Boston , the Joint Committee on Revenue in the Massachusetts legislature will hold a public hearing on bill H. 2929 , An Act to Regulate and Tax the Cannabis Industry .
If passed , the new law would repeal existing marijuana prohibition laws at the state level and replace them with a system of regulation and taxation , similar to how wine is sold .
The law , in fact , is largely modeled after the alcohol control laws .
According to Northampton attorney Richard M. Evans , a former DRCNet board member and the petitioner whose Representative presented the bill , Wednesday will mark the first time a state legislature has considered a full legalization bill .
The moment is also propitious because Massachusetts this year implemented its new , voter - enacted decriminalization law , and because Gov. Deval Patrick , while not prioritizing it , is on the record as being very comfortable with the idea of legalizing marijuana .
So while we do n't expect that H. 2929 will be enacted this year , it is a rare and important opportunity to forward the debate on alternatives to prohibition .
And you can help : by showing up Wednesday if you can ; by spreading the word and getting others to come out ; by suggesting to your local newspaper that they cover the hearing ; and by contacting your state legislators to express your support for H. 2929 .
Directions to the State House are available here .
Please let us know what you 're able to do to support H. 2929 , and visit http://www.cantaxreg.com for further information about it .
Visit http://www.masscann.org to find out about extensive activist opportunities in Massachusetts .

WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear an appeal from Jeffrey K. Skilling , the former Enron Corporation chief executive who was sent to prison in 2006 for his role in the company ’s spectacular collapse .
Mr. Skilling argued that a law under which he had been convicted was unconstitutionally vague and that he had not received a fair trial in Houston , the city where Enron was based and which bore the brunt of its demise .
The law Mr. Skilling challenged makes it a crime to “ deprive another of the intangible right of honest services . ”

The Amsterdam court today ruled that The Pirate Bay must remove a list of copyrighted torrents from their website within three months .
In addition they have to block Dutch users ' access to parts of the site where copyrighted torrent can be downloaded .
If not , the three ' operators ' will have to pay penalties of 5,000 euros ( $ 7,500 ) per person , per day .
In an attempt to ensure that Dutch citizens can’t access The Pirate Bay , BREIN took three of the tracker ’s founders to court .
The anti-piracy outfit won the case and Fredrik , Gottfrid and Peter were ordered to block Dutch users , a decision they decided to appeal .
Today the Amsterdam Court announced that the earlier default judgment has been nullified .
That is , the three operators do n’t have to block access to all Dutch users .
It was concluded that The Pirate Bay itself is not necessarily guilty of copyright infringement .
However , according to the Court the site does assist in copyright infringement by allowing and encouraging its users to share torrents .
The defense had argued that not Fredrik , Gottfrid and Peter were not the owners of the site , but a Seychelles based company named Reservella .
The Court rejected this defense as the defendants could not name the current owners or provide any documents proving that the site was sold .
It concluded that the three defendants are responsible for the site .
The Court ruled that The Pirate Bay has to remove a list of torrents linking to copyrighted works .
The list is to be provided by BREIN , and is similar to the earlier ruling against Mininova .
The defendants are given three months to comply , if not , they will face penalties of 5,000 euros ( $ 7,500 ) per person , per day .
In addition to removing the torrents the defendants have to block Dutch users from accessing certain parts of the site ( across all their domains ) where users can download copyrighted files .
Finally , the three have to cover the costs BREIN made for the court case .
Ernst - Jan Louwers , the lawyer for the three Pirate Bay defendants told TorrentFreak that his clients are currently considering whether or not to appeal this judgment .

WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT
67 N LATITUDE , 71 E LONGITUDE , Russia ( Reuters ) - The Nenets tribespeople of Russia ’s frozen Yamal peninsula have survived the age of the Tsars , the Bolshevik revolution and the chaotic 1990s , but now confront their biggest challenge -- under their fur - bundled feet is enough gas to heat the world for five years .
A Nenets man works at his settlement near the remote village of Gornokniazevsk on the Yamal peninsula , above the polar circle some 2000 km ( 1242 miles ) northeast of Moscow in this February 27 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Vasily Fedosenko
“ For them it is fortune , for us terror , ” said 20 - year - old herder Andrei Yezgini , dressed from head to toe in reindeer skin , referring to ambitious plans by state gas giant Gazprom to drill the region Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as “ the world ’s storehouse ” of gas and oil .
Putin jetted into the sparsely populated region within the Arctic circle , 2,000 km ( 1,250 miles ) northeast of Moscow , in late September to woo foreign partners to develop a quarter of the world ’s known gas reserves .
Experts and the Nenets say industry will damage and pollute the tundra , whose flat marshy terrain switches from marigold russets in summer to thick winter snow and is peppered with disc - like thermokarst lakes and crystal blue waterways .
Nenets migrate north to south over 150 km every year , spending only a few days in one place , living off reindeer and fish and lugging their “ chums , ” or tents , kerosene lamps and wood - fired stoves on reindeer - pulled sleighs .
“ The fact they ’ve found deposits here is catastrophic , ” said Slava Vanuito , 34 , his Asiatic eyes narrowing as a gust of Arctic wind sweeps over a tundra bouncy from the thick carpet of springy moss that feeds the reindeer .
Like many young Nenets men , Vanuito served in the Russian army -- he fought against Chechens in the first separatist war -- and decided to return to his nomadic life in Yamal , which means “ world ’s end ” in Nenets , a distant relative of Finnish .
Numbering around 42,000 , the Nenets are entirely dependent on reindeer , which appear on the Yamal region ’s crest , and are animists .
Their strict code of superstitions and gender divisions has been virtually untouched for at least a millennium .
BROKEN DEER LEGS
From a Soviet - made helicopter , a bright blue train with 20 wagons can be seen snaking through the tundra , part of a newly - opened railway which experts say heralds severe damage .
Opened by Putin last month , it will serve Russia ’s biggest gas field Bovanenkovo at the top of Yamal , which will feed the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany from 2012 , and runs around two - thirds of the 700 - km - long peninsula .
Yezgini said it is breaking the legs of the deer .
“ There ’s debris and gravel around the tracks , frightening and hurting them . ”
He added pastures around the track have lost shrubbery .
Bruce Forbes , research professor in global change at the University of Lapland in Finland , said the railway is only the beginning : “ We are just seeing the tip of the iceberg in terms of destruction , ” he told Reuters by telephone .
The government is keen to develop the Yamalo - Nenets region as soon as possible .
Last month it proposed tax breaks to entice foreign firms to drill the frozen mass of land , which has field reserves of 16 trillion cubic meters .
Already Russia ’s main gas - producing region , Gazprom said it gives Yamal 20 billion roubles ( $ 665 million ) every year , but declined to comment on how the money is distributed .
Yamal accounts for more than 90 percent of Gazprom ’s gas output , and total revenues last year stood at 3.5 trillion roubles .
Vanuito , sharpening a saw for antler trimming , dismissed such claims by Gazprom as “ rubbish . ”
He said they received a “ pittance ” of a monthly state stipend of 2,000 roubles ( $ 66 ) .
In January , Forbes sent a research report to the firms urging the coexistence of oil and gas activities with the Nenets by asking companies to respect their demands , such as no illegal hunting by gas workers and the burying of pipelines .
Citing herders and administration officials , he said compensations for pasture degradation and land withdrawals tended to be absorbed by local government and did not reach the Nenets .
“ The European Union needs to be more responsible ethically and morally when considering where they want to buy their gas from , ” he said , adding Western firms had responded positively to the report .
It is not the first time Russian indigenous people have come under threat from industry .
Rights groups say energy firms do not fully respect the culture of the Khanty in Russia ’s oil - producing region of Khanty - Mansiysk in west Siberia .
Moscow has offered the Nenets free houses in Yamal ’s capital Salekhard , but Forbes said that was missing the point : “ Their animals and their space in the tundra give them complete freedom . ”
Some state benefits are welcomed by the Nenets -- helicopters take them to towns of several hundred people an hour ’s flight away and children from age seven are sent to Russian - language schools in towns where they live with other Nenets families .
“ I just pray Gazprom wo n’t change us , ” said Yezgini ’s mother Valentina , 52 .
“ I want my grandchildren to see our land as it is : beautiful , fresh , full of berries and deer . ”

As you may have surmised from previous posts in the series , the ' static serving ' approach we 're using can lead to regenerating a lot of pages at once .
For a long lived blog , with lots of history , regenerating the archive pages could take a significant amount of time - potentially long enough that we could run into the 30 second request deadline when updating or adding a post .
Fortunately , however , we have something custom - made for the purpose : the Task Queue API .
Using the Task Queue API , we can take care of the essential updates immediately - the post page itself , for example - then queue up other updates , such as the archive pages , on the task queue for later execution .
Using the task queue has the extra advantage that updates can be executed in parallel .
Even better , we can make use of a new library in version 1.2.5 of the SDK , called ' deferred ' .
deferred is a clone of Ruby 's delayed : : job library , and makes it easy to enqueue function and method calls on the App Engine task queue .
deferred is n't officially documented yet - though documentation is forthcoming soon - so consider this post to be an exclusive first look at this new library .
In order to use deferred , we need to add an extra stanza to app.yaml , defining a handler that the deferred library will use to execute tasks .
Add the following immediately after the remote_api handler :
Once the handler is installed , using the deferred library is straightforward : Simply import google.appengine.ext.deferred , and call deferred .
defer with the function and any arguments to pass to it .
The function invocation will be serialized and placed on the task queue , where it will be executed just as any other task would be .
Let 's modify the render ( ) method of BlogPost to use the deferred library .
Replace this section :
With this one :
The only change here is that we check if the ContentGenerator permits deferred execution .
If it does n't , we execute generate_resource as normal , but if it does , we call deferred .
defer for each changed dependency .
To make this work , we need to make a couple of small changes to our ContentGenerator classes .
The first and most obvious is to add a ' can_defer ' attribute to the class .
Add this line to the beginning of the ContentGenerator class :
Since we want the blog post itself to be regenerated synchronously , we need to modify the PostContentGenerator to set can_defer to False .
Next , we 'll add a ContentGenerator for the Atom feed .
This is very similar to the existing IndexContentGenerator code :
Note that we 're ordering by updated timestamp rather than by publication date , since we want our Atom feed to include the latest modifications to the blog .
We 're also basing the etag on the entire post rather than the summary , since we want the Atom feed to be regenerated upon any change to the post .
The contents of atom.xml are omitted for brevity ; you can see it here Finally , we want to add support for archive pages .
Update the generate_resource method of IndexContentGenerator to the following ( additions are highlighted ) :
Here , we 've modified the generate_resource function to take ' pagenum ' and ' start_ts ' arguments , so we can call it recursively to generate subsequent pages .
We 're then modifying the query to continue from where it left off , and adding extra arguments to the template variables for the current and previous pages of the archive , if applicable .
Finally , we 're rendering archive pages to / page / n URLs , and calling deferred .
defer to render the next page if there are any .
As always , you can see a demo of the blog - so - far at http://bloggart-demo.appspot.com/ , and the source is available here I 'd also like to take this opportunity to explicitly ask for feedback :
How is the series so far ?
Is it getting too dry and formulaic ?
Did you stop reading 2 posts ago ?
What can I do to improve it ?
With these latest improvements , we have a basic , but functional blog .
We 're not going to quit here , however .
In the next post , we 'll tackle tagging , which will allow us to show off the real power of our dependency based content generation system .

The attached PDF ( CNC - Part - Summary.pdf ) provides detailed cost and sourcing information for each and every required part .
Listed here is only a summary
Sheet Stock --- $ 20
- a 48 " x 48 " piece of 1/2 " thick MDF ( any 1/ 2 " sheet stock can be used I have plans to make my next version out of UHMW but cost was prohibitive this time around )
-a 5 " x5 " piece of 3/4 " thick MDF ( this is used to make spacers so any piece of 3/ 4 " stock found around the shop could be used )
Motors and Controllers ---- $ 255
- An entire instructable could be written on chosing a controller and motors .
In short what is required is a controller capable of three axes of control ( with pulsed step and direction inputs ) and motors with about 100 oz / in holding torque .
I sourced mine from http://hobbycnc.com they have worked well and the kit was quite easy to solder .
( direct link )
Hardware --- $ 275
- These parts can be acquired from three places .
The conventional items can be acquired at Home Depot , the specialty drive products are easy to find at any industrial supplier , I used McMaster Carr ( http://www.mcmaster.com)
( I chose them because they have a nice online store ) , and finally because of the large number of bearings required I found the best price from an online seller ( http://vxb.com) which sells 100 for $ 40 ( leaves quite a few left over for other projects ) ( direct link )
Software --- ( free )
- What is required is a program to draw your designs ( I use CorelDraw ) , and a programme capable of interpreting these files into pulses to be sent to your controller .
I 'm currently using a trial version of Mach3 ( http://www.machsupport.com ) but have plans to convert to LinuxCNC ( An open source machine controller which uses linux ) ( http://www.linuxcnc.org )
Router Head --- ( extra )
- I attached a dremel type cutting tool to my machine however if you are more interested in additive construction ( like fab@home or RepRap ) you may wish to look into their deposition tools .
Details
- the metric components and especially the cross nuts are n't very popular and I had to visit several Home Depots in my area before I had enough .
- I could n't find a way to link to parts directly on the MCMaster Carr site .
To find them go to www.mcmaster.com and search for the part #
President Gloria Arroyo placed the Philippines under a " state of calamity " today and terrified people fled their homes as a powerful typhoon threatened to unleash more carnage following deadly floods .
After being accused of not preparing her country adequately for last Saturday ’s storm that killed 293 people in and around Manila , Ms Arroyo also ordered forced evacuations of towns in the direct path of Typhoon Parma .
‘‘ The prediction is that this typhoon is very strong .
Our prayers are that no lives will be lost , ’’ said Bella Angara , the governor of the northern Philippine province of Aurora which is predicted to feel Parma ’s full force .
The government warned Parma would tear down houses , while likely bringing more heavy rain to the nation ’s capital , Manila , and nearby areas that were still recovering from last Saturday ’s record floods .
‘‘ We ’re praying very hard that the super typhoon will spare us , ’’ said housewife Nita Solita , 42 , who was living in a makeshift evacuation centre in Manila after losing her home in the floods .
A breakdown in communications at the highest level between the US and the UK led to the shock collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September last year , a Guardian / Observer investigation has revealed .
The downfall of Lehman , which triggered the biggest banking crisis since the Great Depression , came after a rescue bid by the high street bank Barclays failed to materialise .
In London , the Treasury , the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority all believed that the US government would step in with a financial guarantee for the troubled Wall Street bank .
The tripartite authorities insist that they always made it clear to the Americans that a possible bid from Barclays could go ahead only if sweetened by US money .
But in Washington , the former Treasury secretary Hank Paulson has blamed Lehman 's demise on Alistair Darling 's failure to let Washington know of his misgivings until it was too late .
Paulson has told journalists that during a transatlantic phone call the chancellor said he was not prepared to import the American " cancer " into Britain – something Darling strongly denies .
With finance ministers and central bank governors from the G20 countries meeting in London on Saturday , the first - hand accounts of those handling last year 's events underline a rift between London and Washington over who was to blame for the demise of Lehman , which triggered a month of mayhem on the financial markets .
Lehman 's demise sent shock waves around an already fragile financial system and raised fears that any bank , anywhere in the world was vulnerable to collapse .
Within three days , HBOS had been rescued by Lloyds TSB .
A month later RBS , HBOS and Lloyds were propped up with an unprecedented £ 37bn of taxpayer funds .
Hector Sants , the chief executive of the Financial Services Authority , said : " I have sympathy for the US authorities given the complexity of the problems they faced that weekend but I do believe it was a mistake to let Lehman 's fail . "
As well trying to find a solution for Lehman , the US authorities were also aware that Merrill Lynch was on the brink and that weekend it was taken over by Bank of America .
While admitting the UK authorities had botched Northern Rock a year earlier , Sants said the collapse of Lehman had more dire consequences .
" Without the future market shock created by Lehman Brothers ' collapse , RBS may not have failed , " said Sants .
" Was Lehman the cause or was it the manifestation ?
It was our view that if Lehman had been supported you would not have seen such a dramatic reduction in liquidity . "
Sir John Gieve , deputy governor of the Bank of England last September , said : " It was a catastrophic error .
It caused a loss of confidence in the [ US ] authorities ' ability to handle the financial crisis which really did change things and proved hugely costly . "
The UK tripartite authorities – the FSA , the Bank of England and the Treasury – had expected the US government to stand behind Lehman in the way that it had backed two crucial mortgage lenders the previous week and helped to orchestrate the bailout for Bear Stearns in March .
No explanation has ever been given for the lack of government funds offered in the final weeks of the Bush administration , which had to step in to prop up the insurance company AIG days after Lehman 's demise .
The UK tripartite authorities were concerned about the financial system in the spring of 2007 and asked their American counterparts to participate in a " war game " to prepare for the collapse of a major US bank and develop a response to a financial crisis .
However , the war game , which was to have included the UK , Switzerland , the Netherlands and the US , never took place because of a lack of willingness to participate by the US regulatory bodies .
I just spent a very frustrating hour trying to get the functional MetaPost library ( a Haskell DSL for generating MetaPost ) working .
It installs ( via cabal - install ) without a hitch , but I have n’t been able to get it to actually work .
I can write a test program which imports the FMP module , and compile it , but then when I try to run it , it spews out a gazillion .log , .tmp , .mpx , .aux … files and a nasty - looking series of error messages ( including a segfault ) .
I ’m happy to provide more details if anyone thinks they would actually be able to help …
All the more motivation to get back to a rewrite of my diagrams library …
Die FDP kauft wohl auf dem freien Markt Mailadressen auf und verschickt an diese Wahlwerbung .
Eine Mail ist uns zugeschickt worden , die von der Mailadresse „ fdp@news-lifestyle.de “ mit dem Namen „ Guido Westerwelle “ als HTML - Newsletter verschickt worden ist .
In dem HTML - Newsletter gibt es verschiedene Links , die über die Adresse „ http://nl.news-lifestyle.de/dispatcher/service?dh=90923095628174545&l=de&o=0&a=90925054516425487“ an „ http://freiheit.fdp.de/“ weitergeleitet werden .
Verschickt werden die Mails von der Firma SuperComm Data Marketing GmbH in Bonn .
Am Ende steht noch dieser Hinweis :
Sie erhalten diese E - Mail , da Sie sich auf einem unserer Portale ( www.netwerbung.de) oder durch uns gesponserten Projekte angemeldet haben .
Die auf den Seiten jeweils hinterlegten AGB fanden Ihre Zustimmung .
Kein Wunder , dass die FDP so vehement in der Novellierung des Bundesdatenschutzgesetzes gegen eine Aufhebung des Listenprivilegs war .
Sonst könnte sie nicht so praktisch auf dem Markt die Dienstleistung einkaufen , an die Mailadressen von vielen Bürgern Spam - Werbung zu verschicken .
Das ist übrigens nichts neues .
Im letzten Bundestagswahlkampf sind vor allem CDU und CSU damit aufgefallen , im großen Stil Spam - Mails verschickt zu haben .
Zufälligerweise sind das die anderen Parteien , die gegen die Abschaffung des Listenprivilegs waren .
Selbstverständlich habe ich die Pressestelle der FDP mit der Bitte angemailt , diese Mail zu verifizieren oder zu dementieren .
Mal schauen , wann und ob die antworten .
Wer unaufgefordert ähnliche Mails bekommen hat , kann diese uns gerne schicken , bzw . in den Kommentaren darauf hinweisen .
Update : Weitere Spam - Aussendungen der FDP wurden über den Dienstleister Schober ausgeliefert , wie Kommentatoren berichten .
Anscheinend hat die FDP die Aussendung der Spam - Mails bei der Firma Schober gekauft , die wiederum die SuperComm Data Marketing GmbH als technischen Dienstleister die Mails verschicken ließ .
Die FDP hat auf meine Anfrage immer noch nicht geantwortet .
In den Kommentaren bestätigen zahlreiche Kommentatoren die Verschickung , und berichten dass sie diese Spam - Mails von der FDP ( teilweise mehrfach ) bekommen haben .
Man sollte auch mal nachfragen , wo die Firma SuperComm Data Marketing GmbH Eure Mailadressen her hat !
Die werden vermutlich sagen : Von Schober .
Dann fragt mal bei Schober nach , wo die Eure Mailadressen her haben !
Update : Um 17:04 kommt die offizielle Bestätigung von „ liberal Verlag GmbH “ * als Antwort auf meine Presseanfrage an die FDP - Pressestelle :
Auftragnehmer für die von Ihnen angeführte Emailwerbung ist die Schober Information Group Deutschland GmbH .
Die SuperComm Data Marketing ist eine 100 % Tochter dieser Fa..
Mehr Hintergrund zur Arbeitsweise der Schober Information Group bietet diese ZDF - Dokumentation über Datenschutz : Der gläserne Deutsche .
( Die Dokumentation gibts auch in fünf Teilen bei Youtube )
Update : Heise berichtet nun auch und hat weitere Zusatzinformationen : FDP beendet Wahlkampf per Massenmail .
Eine Sprecherin des für die FDP - Kampagne zuständigen liberal - Verlags gab gegenüber iX an , dass nur die Schober GmbH mit dem Versenden der Werbemails beauftragt worden sei .
Die Auswahl der Adressen und das Hinzuziehen eines weiteren Dienstleisters war Schober überlassen .
Schober selbst ist anders als SuperComm Mitglied der Certified Senders Alliance des Verbandes der Deutschen Internetwirtschaft eco .
Wer CSA - zertifiziert ist , hat es deutlich leichter , seine Adressaten zu erreichen , muss aber auch gewissen Qualitätskriterien genügen .
Dass unter anderem die Newsletter - Versandadresse des Heise - Verlags und diverse Spam - Fallen der iX - Redaktion angeschrieben wurden , lässt das in diesem Fall zweifelhaft erscheinen .
Hier gibts schon ein passendes Banner : „ Unsere Stärke ist Spammen – Deutschland braucht Spam “ .
Und hier gibts „ Yes we spam “ .
Update : Anscheinend lässt die FDP auch unaufgefordert SMS verschicken .
Der Twitter - Nutzer Kojote hat uns eine Meldung geschickt , die er am Freitag um 20:31 Uhr von der Nummer 76733 erhalten hat :
Morgen FDP wählen , damit sich Ihre Arbeit wieder lohnt .
Für klare Verhältnisse .
Zweitstimme FDP .
Bitte weitersenden .
In den Kommentaren und auf Twitter häufen sich seit Samstag Mittag die Meldungen , dass zahlreiche Menschen eine Spam - SMS der FDP mit ähnlichen Sprüchen bekommen haben .
At that time , very few people knew about the plight of amphibians , and there was no public charity in existence dedicated exclusively to amphibians .
So in 2008 I founded SAVE THE FROGS !
with a mission to protect amphibian populations and to promote a society that respects and appreciates nature and wildlife .
To date , SAVE THE FROGS !
staff and volunteers have organized well over 2,000 educational events in at least 57 countries ; helped enact federal , state and local legislation on behalf of amphibians ; and created , restored and protected critical wetland habitats .

Brian Kilmeade put on a classic display of the way today 's right - wingers cling to old half - baked notions of race and eugenics yesterday morning on Fox and Friends , discussing a Scandinavian study of the benefits of marriage :
Kilmeade : Leave it to the Finns and Swedes to come up with something .
Because that 's a -- we are , we 're a , we keep marrying other species and other ethnics and other -- [ Crosstalk ]
Kilmeade : I mean the Swedes -- the Swedes have , uh , pure genes .
Because they marry other Swedes .
Because that 's the rule .
Finland --
Finns marry other Finns , so they have a pure society .
In America , we marry everybody .
So we marry Italians and Irish and -- Dave Briggs : OK , so this study does not apply .
Kilmeade :
It does not apply to us .
Other species ?
We marry other species ?
Since when ?
What , is this the man - on - dog sex that Rick Santorum was on about ?
And what the hell do " pure genes " -- whatever those are -- have to do with marriage behavior ?
It 's astonishing , really , the level of complete and utter idiocy that passes for professional news talk on our cable TV these days .
Charles Pierce is right .

A Real - Life Version of the Atari Classic Lunar Lander
The classic 1979 Atari videogame is transformed into three dimensions
Bernard L. Madoff ’s massive fraud stunned some of the wealthy denizens of Malibu Colony , especially when a couple devastated by the scheme surrendered their oceanfront home to Wells Fargo Bank .
But some neighbors say the real shocker came when they saw one of the bank ’s top executives spending weekends in the $ 12 - million beach house and hosting eye - catching parties there .
What ’s more , Wells Fargo spurned offers to show the property to prospective buyers , a real estate agent said .
“ It ’s outrageous to take over a property like that , not make it available and then put someone from the bank in it , ” said Phillip Roman , an 18 - year Colony resident who lives a few homes away from the property .
Residents identified the house ’s occupant as Cheronda Guyton , a Wells Fargo senior vice president who is responsible for foreclosed commercial properties .
Guyton could not be reached at her downtown Los Angeles office .
Wells Fargo declined to discuss Guyton , saying in a statement that representatives “ do n’t discuss specific team member situations / issues for privacy reasons . ”
But the bank said it would “ conduct a thorough investigation of the allegations ” by neighbors .
The bank also said its ethics code would n’t allow employees to make personal use of property that had been surrendered to satisfy debts .
Such conduct would pose a conflict of interest , said W. Michael Hoffman , executive director of the Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University in Waltham , Mass .
“ For a business to allow this to happen in today ’s ethically charged climate is quite suicidal , ” he said .
And because Madoff ’s fraud was the root cause of the situation , he added , “ it ’s like rubbing salt into the wounds of a national tragedy . ”
The home ’s former owners , Lawrence and Linda Elins , did n’t respond to requests for an interview .
Their real estate agent , Irene Dazzan - Palmer , said she had tried to lease the home for the couple last spring after they were “ devastated ” by Madoff losses .
But before she could find a renter , the couple signed over the property to Wells Fargo to help satisfy a larger debt , she said .
Wells Fargo subsequently denied requests to show the house to prospective buyers , said Dazzan - Palmer , a Coldwell Banker specialist in Malibu Colony properties .
“ I found it amazing at first when the bank would n’t show the house to some friends of ours who were interested in buying it , ” said Roman , the neighbor .
Residents of the gated Malibu Colony said they obtained Guyton ’s name from the community ’s guards , who had issued her a homeowner ’s parking pass .
In written responses to questions from The Times , Wells Fargo said this week that its agreement with the prior owner required it to keep the home off the market “ for a period of time ” but declined to elaborate .
The company said it now planned to list the property for sale “ in the near future . ”
The bank also confirmed that Guyton headed its foreclosed commercial property operation .
Malibu Colony stretches three - quarters of a mile along the beach in the heart of Malibu .
Its residents include actor Tom Hanks , former Univision Chairman A. Jerrold Perenchio , and high - profile investment banker Michael E. Tennenbaum .
The home the Elinses occupied is a sleekly modern , 3,800 - square - foot , two - story structure built in the early 1990s by clothing designer Nancy Heller .
Its huge glass windows look out on a patio , deck and the Pacific .
On the street side is a wall of mostly beige tile and metal .
Colony residents said the woman they believe to be Guyton , along with her husband and two children , took up occupancy in home No. 106 in Malibu Colony shortly after Lawrence Elins turned it over to Wells Fargo Bank on May 13 .
The residents said the family spent long weekends at the home and had guests over , including a large party the last weekend of August that featured a waterborne arrival .
“ A yacht pulled up offshore , with one of those inflatable dinghies to take people back and forth to the shore , ” said Roman ’s wife , Elaine Johnson .
“ About 20 people got taken over in the dinghy . ”
Malibu Colony employees who were not authorized to speak publicly said the community association at the start of the summer had issued Guyton a parking permit of the type given to Colony homeowners .
Residents also gave The Times the license plate number of a 2007 Volvo sport- utility vehicle that they say they had seen parked in the garage at No. 106 .
A check of motor vehicle license plates conducted by The Times found that vehicle to be registered to Guyton .
When a Times reporter used the buzzer at the home ’s steel gate on Labor Day , a woman answered the intercom but declined to identify herself or come to the gate .
Asked whether the home had been foreclosed on , she said : “ It ’s not foreclosed .
It ’s owned by Collin Equities ” -- a Wells Fargo unit that liquidates foreclosure properties .
The woman on the intercom denied that she was living at the house or had been using it periodically over the summer .
Asked whether she could say why she was at the home , she answered , “ No , I cannot . ”
On the website for a lenders conference next month in San Diego , a biography says Guyton , 39 , obtained an MBA from USC , worked in the state controller ’s office during the administration of former Gov. Gray Davis and now manages a team of foreclosed - property managers and a separate team that restructures troubled commercial loans .
Property records show she has owned a home in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles since 2004 .
Elins , the previous owner of the Malibu Colony home , is identified in Securities and Exchange Commission filings as the former president of Applause Inc. , a toy and gift manufacturer , who since 1988 has headed Elins Enterprises , a financial and real estate firm in Sherman Oaks .
They bought the Malibu Colony home in 1996 and refinanced it for $ 3 million with Wells Fargo Bank in December 2007 , property records show .
The home ’s value was recorded at $ 12 million when the property was transferred in May to Wells Fargo .
In January , Wells Fargo said it had written off $ 294 million of loans that had been secured by customers ’ investments with Madoff , whose Ponzi scheme collapsed late last year .
Dazzan - Palmer , the real estate agent , said she quickly found a person who was prepared to make “ a very big offer in cash ” to buy the property , but she was n’t able to show the house to any potential buyers .
The bank said it was considering offers from other agents , she said , “ and then someone moved in . ”
“ We thought maybe it had been sold , ” she added .
“ It was a big mystery .
All we knew was that Larry had lost the house and that someone was living there . ”
Because Dazzan - Palmer had the listing to lease the property , other agents have contacted her about the home , she said .
She has a website with photos of the home at www.106malibucolony.com " > www.106malibucolony.com .
“ I ’ve had calls from about 20 agents saying they ’ve got buyers and ‘ When can you get us in ? ’ ” she said .
“ And I say , ‘ My client does n’t own it anymore .
I brought the bank an offer myself , they did n’t respond , and that ’s all I know . ’ ”

This is the moment the second Gateway Bridge was joined .
Peter Rotolone smooths the last of the concrete into place joining the second Gateway Bridge .
Bridge construction manager Peter Rotolone was given the honour of applying the final shovel - loads of concrete to join the bridge deck - and it was not the first time he 'd undertaken the task .
The 63 - year - old former Main Roads engineer fulfilled a similar role in 1986 when the original Gateway was finished .
ASPEN — A municipal judge on Wednesday scolded the owner of a 13 - year - old dog with a history of biting people and ordered the canine to leave Aspen .
And if Gizmo , a Pomeranian , is seen in Aspen again , it will be put to death , Judge Brooke Peterson told the dog ’s owner , West End resident Melinda Goldrich .
“ As a judge , the hardest decision I ever have to make is to take someone ’s pet away or euthanize it , ” Peterson told Goldrich .
“ But you and I have been dealing with your dog since 2006 , and your excuses have worn out my patience . ”
Goldrich appeared in court to answer the municipal charge of keeping of a vicious dog after Gizmo bit a worker at the Aspen Club on Aug. 28 .
Gizmo had been tied to a fence when it snapped at the ankle of Susan Dodington , who visited it and three other dogs who were barking loudly .
Dodington testified that she went to pet the dogs hoping to calm them down .
But when Gizmo bit her , she called police .
Read the judge ’s blistering commentary at AspenTimes.com .
While the Obama White House , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Congressional Democrats debate among themselves whether the so - called " opt out " public health insurance option endorsed by Reid will be included in reform legislation , Minnesota Governor and GOP presidential wannabee Tim Pawlenty has already weighed in .
Asked if he would " lead a charge " in his state to opt out , Pawlenty replied , " I think so because I do n't like government run health care . "
That 's easy for him to say .
As it turns out , Minnesota is the exception that proves the rule of red state socialism .
An increasingly blue state with the 4th best health care system in the nation , the Land of 10,000 Lakes sends far more tax dollars to Washington than it receives in federal spending in return .
But for Pawlenty 's fellow Republican refuseniks , leaders of red states offering dismal health care and a beneficiaries of a one - way transfer of taxpayer funds from DC , opting out may not be an option .
In recent weeks , Texas secessionists and Georgia legislators have echoed Pawlenty 's confused reading of the Tenth Amendment by endorsing a state veto over federal health reform mandates .
But just in time for the debate over the merits of a state - by - state " opt out " of a national public health insurance option , the Commonwealth Fund has released its 2009 state health care scorecard .
As in 2007 , the data reveals the critical condition of red state health care .
All of which could present Republican governors and legislatures with a dilemma :
Will they refuse to offer lower cost insurance coverage for their residents by rejecting a system funded in part by blue state taxpayers ?
Given the contentious ongoing debate in the Senate , crystal ball - gazing for any public option , whether national , opt - in or opt - out is difficult .
But the Commonwealth Fund 's analysis of health care indicators shows the stakes for its red state opponents .
While nine of the top 10 performing states voted for Barack Obama in 2008 , four of the bottom five ( including Arkansas , Mississippi , Oklahoma and Louisiana ) and 14 of the last 20 backed John McCain .
( That at least is an improvement from the 2007 data , in which all 10 cellar dwellers had voted for George W. Bush three years earlier . )
( Here is the Commonwealth Fund 's 2009 state - by - state health care scorecard .
Here are links to the executive summary , the full report and PDF and Powerpoint chart packs . )
While New York Senator Chuck Schumer reported earlier this month that the " opt out " notion was gaining interest from conservative Democrats like Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) , Republicans were unmoved :
A spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) suggests to the Huffington Post that it 's unlikely that any GOPers will come on board .
" While Republicans support health care reform , they do n't support a new government plan , " said Don Stewart , a McConnell spokesperson , when asked about the opt - out idea .
That opposition would present a double quandary for the Republican leadership in Congress and in the states .
After all , their residents not only need health care reform most .
As it turns out , the funding in part would come from blue state taxpayers .
As the Washington Post noted in May ( " A Red State Booster Shot " ) :
Health - care reform may be overdue in a country with 45 million uninsured and soaring medical costs , but it will also represent a substantial wealth transfer from the North and the East to the South and the West .
The Northeast and the Midwest have much higher rates of coverage than the rest of the country , led by Massachusetts , where all but 3 percent of residents are insured .
The disproportionate share of uninsured is in the South and the West , the result of employment patterns , weak unions and stingy state governments .
Texas leads the way , with a quarter of its population uninsured ; it would be at the top even without its many illegal immigrants .
As it turns out , health care reform spending would be little different from the overall pattern of red state socialism .
That is , red state residents disproportionately benefit from the steady one - way flow of tax dollars and earmarks spreading the wealth from Washington to their states .
As the 2007 analysis ( above ) of 2005 federal spending per tax dollar received by state shows , the reddest states generally reaped the most green .
Eight of the top 10 beneficiaries of federal largesse voted for John McCain for President .
Unsurprisingly , all 10 states at the bottom of the list - those whose outflow of tax revenue is funding programs elsewhere in the country - all voted for Barack Obama in 2008 .
And as the Wall Street Journal documented in March and again in July , Republican states are reaping outsized benefits from the $ 787 billion Obama stimulus package they so fiercely opposed .
While not ideal , Paul Krugman , Howard Dean and Nate Silver among others have argued that the opt - out public option approach has the merit of creating economic , political and behavior pressure on Tim Pawlenty 's fellow Republican governors to offer their residents the same access to lower cost insurance as their neighbors in Democratic - controlled states .
Should the opt out scenario come to pass , Republicans leaders will have to decide :
Will they put blue state money where their red state mouths are ?
Any American who cares about the quality , accessibility and cost of health care for all Americans should hope the answer is yes .

US President Barack Obama has accused some opponents of his healthcare reform proposals of trying to " scare the heck " out of people .
Anti-reform campaigners had created " bogeymen out there that just are n't real " , he said at a town - hall style meeting in Portsmouth , New Hampshire .
Passing a healthcare reform bill is Mr Obama 's top domestic priority for 2009 .
But in recent weeks , opponents of reform have been making serious accusations about his proposals .
The former Republican vice - presidential candidate , Sarah Palin , said last week that the president wanted to set up " death panels " of government officials with the power to determine whether disabled or elderly Americans are " worthy of healthcare " .
In fact , under proposals drawn up by the US House of Representatives , the government would pay for elderly Americans to receive voluntary consultations with doctors to discuss their end - of - life care .
" The rumour that 's been circulating a lot lately is this idea that somehow the House of Representatives voted for death panels that will basically pull the plug on Grandma because we 've decided that its too expensive to let her live anymore , " said Mr Obama .
" Somehow , it has gotten spun into this idea of death panels .
I am not in favour of that , I want to clear the air here . "
Meetings disrupted Some 46 million people in America currently do not have health insurance , and rising healthcare costs are a major contributing factor to America 's spiralling budget deficit .
But there is disagreement about how to go about reforming the system .
HEALTHCARE IN THE US 46 million uninsured , 25 million under- insured Healthcare costs represent 16 % of GDP , almost twice OECD average Reform plans would require all Americans to get insurance Some propose public insurance option to compete with private insurers
Q&A : US healthcare reform Democrats in the House of Representatives have reportedly reached a deal on a bill that would mandate all Americans to take out health insurance , with subsidies for the less well - off paid for by a tax on families earning over $ 350,000 a year .
The House bill would also offer Americans who do not get coverage through their employer the chance to join a publicly - run scheme .
But in the Senate negotiations have stalled , with moderate senators expressing opposition to both the tax and the public plan proposed by the House .
Both chambers need to agree on a bill before it can become law .
HAVE YOUR SAY
People are afraid to go to the hospital in an emergency , because they do not want to saddle their families with debilitating debt Louise Wilson , Grand Rapids , MI Mr Obama had called on the Senate and the House to agree their own versions of a bill before the August recess , but lawmakers missed the deadline .
During the recess , a number of healthcare " town - hall " meetings hosted by Democratic politicians have been targeted by conservative opponents of reform .
The opposition has sometimes been quite vocal , with anti-reform campaigners chanting slogans and shouting down supporters of reform .
Proponents of reform say the protests are being organised by well - funded lobby groups , while opponents say they are a genuine expression of anger at Mr Obama 's proposals .
At the New Hampshire meeting , which did not feature any angry scenes , the president called on his opponents to temper their behaviour .
" I do hope that we will talk with each other and not over each other , " he said .
Polls suggest that a majority of Americans support many of the administration 's healthcare proposals .

Abstract
This paper considers the implications of population growth and urbanization for climate change .
It emphasizes that it is not the growth in ( urban or rural ) populations that drives the growth in greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions but rather , the growth in consumers and in their levels of consumption .
A significant proportion of the world ’s urban ( and rural ) populations have consumption levels that are so low that they contribute little or nothing to such emissions .
If the lifetime contribution to GHG emissions of a person added to the world ’s population varies by a factor of more than 1,000 depending on the circumstances into which they are born and their life choices , it is misleading to see population growth as the driver of climate change .
A review of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions levels for nations , and how they changed between 1980 and 2005 ( and also between 1950 and 1980 ) , shows little association between nations with rapid population growth and nations with high GHG emissions and rapid GHG emissions growth ; indeed , it is mostly nations with very low emissions per person ( and often only slowly growing emissions ) that have had the highest population growth rates .
The paper also discusses how in the much - needed planning for global emissions reduction , provision must be made to allow low - income , low - consumption households with GHG emissions per person below the global “ fair share ” level to increase their consumption .

" There are a lot of myths about engines ...
easy break - in is one of the biggest "
KNOWLEDGE = POWER !!
Warning :
This is a very controversial topic !!
I wrote " Break - In Secrets " after successfully applying this method
to approximately 300 new engines , all without any problems whatsoever .
Links to this article now appear on hundreds of motorsports discussion forums from all over the world .
The reason is that over time , large numbers of people have done a direct comparison between my method and the owner 's manual method , and the news of their success is spreading rapidly .
The results are always the same ... a dramatic increase in power at all RPMs .
In addition , many professional mechanics have disassembled engines that have used this method , to find that the condition of the engine is much better t han when the owner 's manual break - in method has been used .
The thing that makes this page so controversial is that there have been many other break - in articles
written in the past which will contradict what has been written here .
Several factors make the older information on break - in obsolete .
The biggest factor is that engine manufacturers now use a much finer honing pattern in the cylinders than they once did .
This in turn changes the break - in requirements , because as you 're about to learn , the window of opportunity for achieving an exceptional ring seal is much smaller with
newer engines than it was with the older " rough honed " engines .
In addition , there is a lot less heat build up in the cylinders from ring friction
due to the finer honing pattern used in modern engines .
The other factors that have changed are the vastly improved metal casting and machining
technologies which are now used .
This means that the " wearing in " of the new parts
involves significantly less friction and actual wear than it did in the distant past .
With that in mind ...
Welcome to one of the most controversial motorsports pages on the internet !!
How To Break In Your Engine For
More Power & Less Wear !
One of the most critical parts of the engine building process is the break in !!
No matter how well an engine is assembled , it 's final power output is all up to you !!
Although the examples shown here are motorcycle engines ,
these principles apply to all 4 stroke engines :
Street or Race Motorcycles , Cars , Snowmobiles , Airplanes & yes ...
even Lawn Mowers !!
( regardless of brand , cooling type , or number of cylinders . )
These same break in techniques apply to both steel cylinders and Nikasil , as well as the ceramic
composite cylinders that Yamaha uses in it 's motorcycles and snowmobiles .
What 's The Best Way To Break - In A New Engine ??
The Short Answer : Run it Hard !
Why ??
Nowadays , the piston ring seal is really what the break in process is all about .
Contrary to popular belief , piston rings do n't seal the combustion pressure by spring tension .
Ring tension is necessary only to " scrape " the oil to prevent it from entering the combustion chamber .
If you think about it , the ring exerts maybe 5 - 10 lbs of spring tension against the cylinder wall ...
How can such a small amount of spring tension seal against thousands of
PSI ( Pounds Per Square Inch ) of combustion pressure ??
Of course it can't .
How Do Rings Seal Against Tremendous Combustion Pressure ??
From the actual gas pressure itself !!
It passes over the top of the ring , and gets behind it to force it outward against the cylinder wall .
The problem is that new rings are far from perfect and they must be worn in quite a bit in order to completely seal all the way around the bore .
If the gas pressure is strong enough during the engine 's first miles of operation ( open that throttle !!! ) , then the entire ring will wear into
the cylinder surface , to seal the combustion pressure as well as possible .
The Problem With " Easy Break In " ...
The honed crosshatch pattern in the cylinder bore acts like a file to allow the rings to wear .
The rings quickly wear down the " peaks " of this roughness , regardless of how hard the engine is run .
There 's a very small window of opportunity to get the rings to seal really well ... the first 20 miles !!
If the rings are n't forced against the walls soon enough , they 'll use up the roughness before they fully seat .
Once that happens there is no solution but to re hone the cylinders , install new rings and start over again .
Fortunately , most new sportbike owners can't resist the urge to " open it up " once or twice ,
which is why more engines do n't have this problem !!
An additional factor that you may not have realized , is that the person at the dealership who set up your bike probably blasted your brand new bike pretty hard on the " test run " .
So , without realizing it , that adrenaline crazed set - up mechanic actually did you a huge favor !!
A quick " break " to tell you about

Here 's How To Break - In An Engine Properly :
There are 3 ways you can break in an engine :
1 ) on a dyno
2 ) on the street , or off road ( Motocross or Snowmobile . )
3 ) on the racetrack On a Dyno :
Warm the engine up
completely !!
Then , using 4th gear :
Do Three 1/2 Throttle dyno runs from
40 % - 60 % of your engine 's max rpm
Let it Cool Down For About 15 Minutes
Do Three 3/4 Throttle dyno runs from
40 % - 80 % of your engine 's max rpm
Let it Cool Down For About 15 Minutes
Do Three Full Throttle dyno runs from
30 % - 100 % of your engine 's max rpm
Let it Cool Down For About 15 Minutes
Go For It !!
Frequently asked Question :
What 's a dyno ??
A dyno is a machine in which the bike is strapped on and power is measured .
It can also be used to break in an engine .
NOTE : If you use a dyno with a brake , it 's critical during break - in that you allow the engine to decelerate fully on it's own .
( Do n't use the dyno brake . )
The engine vacuum created during closed throttle deceleration sucks the excess oil and metal off the cylinder walls .
The point of this is to remove the very small ( micro ) particles of ring and cylinder material which are part of the normal wear during this process .
During deceleration , the particles suspended in the oil blow out the exhaust , rather than accumulating in the ring grooves between
the piston and rings .
This keeps the rings from wearing too much .
You 'll notice that at first the engine " smokes " on decel , this is normal , as the rings have n't sealed yet .
When you 're doing it right , you 'll notice that the smoke goes away after about 7 - 8 runs .
Important Note :
Many readers have e-mailed to ask about the cool down , and if it
means " heat cycling " the engine .
No , the above " cool down " instructions only apply if you are using a dyno machine to break in your engine .
The reason for cool down on a dyno has nothing to do with
" Heat Cycles " !!!
Cool Down on a dyno is important since the cooling fans used at most dyno facilities are too small to equal the amount of air coming into the radiator at actual riding speeds .
On a dyno , the water temperature will become high enough to cause it to boil out of the radiator after
about 4 dyno runs .
This will happen to a brand new engine just as it will
happen to a very old engine .
( Always allow the engine to cool down after 3 runs whenever you use a dyno . )
If you 're breaking your engine in on the street or racetrack , the high speed incoming air will keep the engine temperature in the normal range .
( In other words , you do n't have to stop by the side of the road to let your bike cool down . )
What about " heat cycling " the engine ??
There is no need to " heat cycle " a new engine .
The term " heat cycle " comes from the idea that the new engine components are being " heat treated " as the engine is run .
Heat treating the metal parts is a very different process , and it 's already done at the factory before the engines are assembled .
The temperatures required for heat treating are much higher than an engine will ever reach during operation .
The idea of breaking the engine in using " heat cycles " is a myth that came from the misunderstanding of the concept of " heat treating " .
On the Street :
Warm the engine up completely :
Because of the wind resistance , you do n't need to use higher gears like you would on a dyno machine .
The main thing is to load the engine by opening the throttle hard in 2nd , 3rd and 4th gear .
Realistically , you wo n't be able to do full throttle runs even in 2nd gear on most bikes without exceeding 65 mph / 104 kph .
The best method is to alternate between short bursts of hard acceleration and deceleration .
You do n't have to go over 65 mph / 104 kph to properly load the rings .
Also , make sure that you 're not being followed by another bike or car when you decelerate , most drivers wo n't expect that you 'll suddenly slow down , and we do n't want
anyone to get hit from behind !!
The biggest problem with breaking your engine in on the street ( besides police ) is if you ride the bike on the freeway ( too little throttle = not enough pressure on the rings ) or if you get stuck in slow city traffic .
For the first 200 miles or so , get out into the country where you can vary the speed more
and run it through the gears !
Be Safe On The Street !
Watch your speed !
When you 're not used to the handling of a new vehicle , you should accelerate only on the straightaways , then slow down extra early for the turns .
Remember that both hard acceleration and hard engine braking ( deceleration ) are equally important during the break in process .
On the Racetrack :
Warm the engine up completely :
Do one easy lap to warm up your tires .
Pit , turn off the bike & check for leaks or
any safety problems .
Take a normal 15 minute practice session
and check the water temperature occasionally .
The racetrack is the perfect environment to break in an engine !!
The combination of acceleration and deceleration is just the ticket for sealing the rings .
Go For It !!
Yeah - But ...
the owner 's manual says to break it in easy ...
Notice that this technique is n't " beating " on the engine , but rather taking a purposeful , methodical approach to sealing the rings .
The logic to this method is sound .
However , some will have a hard time with this approach , since it seems to " go against the grain " .
The argument for an easy break - in is usually : " that 's what the manual says " ....
Or more specifically : " there are tight parts in the engine and you might do damage or even seize it if you run it hard . "
Consider this :
Due to the vastly improved metal casting and machining technologies which are now used , tight parts in new engines are not normal .
A manufacturing mistake causing a tight clearance is an extremely rare occurrence these days .
But , if there is something wrong with the engine clearances from the factory , no amount of gentle running will fix the problem .
The real reason ???
So why do all the owner 's manuals say to take it easy for the first
thousand miles ???
This is a good question ... Q : What is the most common cause of engine problems ???
A : Failure to :
Warm the engine up completely before running it hard !!!
Q : What is the second most common cause of engine problems ???
A : An easy break in !!!
Because , when the rings do n't seal well , the blow - by gasses contaminate the oil with acids and other harmful combustion by - products !!
Ironically , an " easy break in " is not at all what it seems .
By trying to " protect " the engine , the exact opposite happens , as leaky rings continue to contaminate your engine oil for the rest of the life of your engine !!
What about running it in the garage ???
Maybe you have a new snowmobile and it's not quite winter yet , or a new bike and it 's snowing ...
The temptation to fire up a new vehicle in the garage just to " hear "
the new engine run can be very strong .
This is the worst thing for a new engine , in fact , my advice is :
do n't even start it up until you 're ready to warm it up for the first ride .
The reason is that brand - new rings do n't seat all the way around the 360 degrees of their circumference .
The gas pressure from hard acceleration forces the rings to contact the cylinder around their entire circumference , which is the only way the rings can properly wear into the exact shape of the cylinder to seal the combustion pressure .
Now , imagine if the engine is run in the garage .
There is no load on the engine , so the rings are just going up and down " along for the ride " .
Only a small portion of their surface is actually contacting the cylinder wall .
The ring area that does contact the cylinder wears down the roughness of the honing pattern on the cylinder walls .
Once the roughness of the cylinder is gone , the rings stop wearing into the cylinder .
If this happens before the entire ring has worn into the cylinder and sealed , you will have a slow engine no matter how hard it gets ridden after that point .
The difference between what happens in an engine running in the garage , versus one being ridden is a hard concept to put into written words , so if I may use the sounds that we all can relate to : it 's the difference between " zing-zing - zing " and " bwaaaaaaaaaAAAAAA "
During " zing- zing - zing " the rings do n't get loaded for more than a split second , whereas during " bwaaaaaAAAAAA " , the engine is in 100 % ring sealing mode .
Recent Snowmobile Info :
Yamaha 's break - in recommendation for the RX1 has been to idle the engine for 15 minutes .
Some owners found that the heat build up from doing this was so extreme ,
that their taillight had begun melting (!!!)
Yamaha has since changed the recommendation to three 5 minute idle periods .
Why would Yamaha recommend a break in method which will prevent the rings
from sealing as well as possible ??
This is a good question ...
A Picture 's Worth A Thousand Words :
The piston on the right was broken in as
per MotoMan 's instructions .
After a full season of hard racing :
- Perfect Ring Seal ...
- No Scuffing ...
- Lots of Trophies !!!
These Honda F3 pistons show
the difference .
Although these pistons came out of engines which were raced for a full season , they were n't set - up with any special clearances or other preparation .
These engines were never worked on prior to being raced .
They were totally stock as built by Honda .
The only difference was the break in method they used ...
The one on the right was broken in as per MotoMan 's instructions .
The one on the left was broken in exactly according to the owner 's manual .
The resulting leaky rings have allowed pressure to " blow by " down into the crankcase on acceleration , and oil to " suck - up " into the combustion chamber on deceleration .
Needless to say , this bike was slow !!
It 's up to you :
The loss in power from an easy break - in and the resulting poor ring seal can be
anywhere from 2 % - 10 % !!
In other words :
The gain in power from using this break - in method can be anywhere from 2 % - 10 % !!
Some have felt that the piston which was broken in hard in the above photo is too clean to be true !!
" That piston is impossible , there must be some trick going on . "
So , here I present : " The Impossible Piston Museum "
Here are 14 pistons from 14 different bikes , with several manufacturers represented .
Some are from streetbikes and some from racebikes .
All of the engines had the correct jetting , the reason some have black carbon deposits is because they were run on " pump gas " , which burns dark regardless of the jetting .
Whereas the lighter ones were run on oxygenated race fuel , which gives a very light tan to gray color .
( Many of the black - carboned pistons were from racebikes . )
Disclaimer :
Absolutely no photo altering or physical cleaning of the pistons is allowed in the museum !!
We run a legit exhibit , and all the artifacts on display are 100 % genuine .
Note :
The controversial piston in the above picture is the last one in the middle row ,
and it 's indicated by the arrows .
You can take a closer look by clicking on the photos to see the full sized versions :
It looks like there are more than 14 pistons , because the area in the 3 photos overlap .
It 's 3 segments of a panorama photo to give you multiple views of this extraordinarily rare collection .
The pistons have been stacked for display purposes only , they are n't going back into engines .
Always be super careful when handling pistons , as the aluminum is soft and very easily dented , causing combustion leakage , and friction ... neither of which is good for power .
As in any museum , some of the specimens are better examples than others , but the point is that none have any leakage past the top ring , because they were all broken in by the method described here !
The only impossible thing about these pistons ... is that it 's impossible to achieve this result with an easy break - in .
What about street bikes ???
This piston is from a 650 Honda Hawk .
The brown discoloration that extends up into the piston pin bore is burnt oil from the extreme heat leaking past all 3 rings !!
The uneven heat leakage was so bad , that it caused the cylinder to distort and become out of round , causing piston to cylinder scuffing in the tight part of the " oval " cylinder .
When I showed the customer his
pistons , he said :
" I do n't understand how that happened , I followed the owner 's manual break - in instructions 100 % !! "
Why would Honda recommend a break in method which will prevent the
rings from sealing as well as possible ??
This is a good question ...
Q : What 's the third most common cause of engine problems ???
A : Not changing the oil soon enough after the engine is first run !!
Change Your Oil Right Away !!
The best thing you can do for your engine is to change your oil and filter after the first 20 miles .
Most of the wearing in process happens immediately , creating a lot of metal in the oil .
Plus , the amount of leftover machining chips and other crud left behind in the manufacturing process is simply amazing !!
You want to flush that stuff out before it gets recycled and embedded in the transmission gears , and oil pump etc ...
Why do the manufacturers recommend waiting until 600 miles to
flush out all the loose metal ???
This is a good question ...
3 more words on break - in :
NO SYNTHETIC OIL !!
Use Valvoline , Halvoline , or similar 10 w 40 Petroleum Car Oil for at least
2 full days of hard racing or 1,500 miles of street riding / driving .
After that use your favorite brand of oil .
Viewer Questions :
Q : If break - in happens so quickly , why do you recommend using petroleum break - in oil for 1500 miles ??
A : Because while about 80 % of the ring sealing takes place in the first hour of running the engine ,
the last 20 % of the process takes a longer time .
Street riding is n't a controlled environment , so most of the mileage may
not be in " ring loading mode " .
Synthetic oil is so slippery that it actually " arrests " the break in process before the rings can seal completely .
I 've had a few customers who switched to synthetic oil too soon , and the rings never sealed properly no matter how hard they rode .
Taking a new engine apart to re - ring it is the last thing anyone wants to do , so I recommend a lot
of mileage before switching to synthetic .
It 's really a " better safe than sorry " situation .
Q : My bike comes with synthetic oil from the factory , what should I do ??
A : I recommend changing the factory installed synthetic oil back to petroleum for the break - in period .
Q : What about the main and rod bearings , do n't they break - in ??
A : Actually , the operation of plain bearings does n't involve metal to metal contact !!
The shiny spots on used
bearings are caused from their contact with the crankshaft journals during start up after the engine has been sitting a while ,
and the excess oil has drained off .
This is the main reason for not revving up the engine when it 's first started .
The subject of plain bearings is one of the most mysterious aspects of engines , and will be covered in a future issue
of Power News .
In it , I 'll reveal more information that fully explains the non-contact phenomenon .
Q : Why change the oil at 20 miles ??
Does n't the oil pick up
screen catch the aluminum bits ???
A : It 's true that the screen stops the big pieces , but many areas of the engine are n't within the oil filtration system .
The oil that is splashed around will circulate metal debris to the lubricated bearing surfaces .
For example , transmission gears and their ball bearings are unprotected by the filtration system , and even the cam chain makes a perfect " conveyer belt " to
bring metal debris up into the cylinder head !!
A close examination of a new engine will reveal lots of aluminum deposits on steel parts .
This aluminum coats and tightens
up the clearances of the parts , which creates a loss of power .
Most of the time I spend " blueprinting "
an engine is actually inspecting every part and " de- aluminizing " them !!
I prefer to remove the oil pan and clean the aluminum bits out of a new engine out that way , but a $ 20 oil change
is an easy and inexpensive way to flush the initial particles that come loose in the first miles .
Q : What about motorcycle V.S. car oils ???
A : This is a topic all by itself !!
It will be covered in a future issue of Power News .
Q : Will this break - in method cause my engine to wear out faster ???
A : No , in fact , a poor ring seal will allow an increase in the by products of combustion to contaminate the oil .
Acid contamination and oil consumption are the 2 reliability problems which are the result of an
" owner 's manual " or " magazine tech article " style easy break - in .
By following the instructions on this page , you 'll find that your oil is cleaner and the engine will rev quicker .
Plus , you 'll have much better torque and power across the power range from the vastly improved ring seal .
Reliability and Power are 100 % connected !!

Two of the so - called Bermuda Triangle 's most mysterious disappearances in the late 1940s may have been solved .
Scores of ships and planes are said to have vanished without trace over the decades in a vast triangular area of ocean with imaginary points in Bermuda , Florida and Puerto Rico .
But journalist Tom Mangold 's new examination for the BBC provides plausible explanations for the disappearance of two British commercial planes in the area , with the loss of 51 passengers and crew .
One plane probably suffered from catastrophic technical failure as a result of poor design , while the other is likely to have run out of fuel .
Sixty years ago , commercial flights from London to Bermuda were new and perilous .
It would require a refuelling stop on the Azores before the 2,000 - mile flight to Bermuda , which at that time was the longest non-stop commercial overseas flight in the world .
The planes would have been operating at the limit of their range .
Today planes arriving at the tiny Atlantic island have sufficient reserve fuel to divert to the US East Coast 700 miles away , in case of emergency .
And the planes of the post - war era were far less reliable than today 's airliners .
British South American Airways ( BSAA ) , which operated the route , had a grim safety record .
In three years it had had 11 serious accidents and lost five planes with 73 passengers and 22 crew members killed .
Unsolved mystery On 30 January 1948 , a BSAA Avro Tudor IV plane disappeared without trace .
Twenty - five passengers and a crew of six were on board The Star Tiger .
No bodies or wreckage were found .
The official investigation into the disappearance concluded : " It may truly be said that no more baffling problem has ever been presented .
" What happened in this case will never be known and the fate of Star Tiger must remain an unsolved mystery . "
At 2,000 feet you'd be leaving very little altitude for manoeuvre - in any serious in - flight emergency the plane could have lost its height in seconds and gone into the sea
Eric Newton
Air accident investigator
But there are a number of clues in the official accident report that reveal the Star Tiger had encountered problems before it reached the Azores .
The aircraft 's heater was notoriously unreliable and had failed en route , and one of the compasses was found to be faulty .
Probably to keep the plane warmer , the pilot had decided to fly the whole transatlantic route very low , at 2,000 feet , burning fuel at a faster rate .
On approaching Bermuda , Star Tiger was a little off course and had been flying an hour later than planned .
In addition , the official Ministry of Civil Aviation report considered that the headwinds faced by Star Tiger may have been much stronger than those forecast .
This would have caused the fuel to burn more quickly .
" Flying at 2,000 feet they would have used up much more fuel , " said Eric Newton , one of the Ministry of Civil Aviation 's most senior air accident investigators , who reviewed the scenario for the BBC .
" At 2,000 feet you 'd be leaving very little altitude for manoeuvre .
In any serious in - flight emergency they could have lost their height in seconds and gone into the sea . "
Whatever happened to the plane , it was sudden and catastrophic - there was no time to send an emergency signal .
Five US
Navy planes disappeared in the triangle area in 1945 The Avro Tudor IV was a converted warplane that was eventually taken out of passenger service because of its poor safety record .
Only BSAA continued to fly the aircraft .
Gordon Store was chief pilot and manager of operations at BSAA .
In an interview with his local newspaper last November , he said he had no confidence in the Tudor 's engines .
" Its systems were hopeless all the hydraulics , the air - conditioning equipment and the recycling fans were crammed together underneath the floor without any thought .
There were fuel - burning heaters that would never work , " he said .
Second accident Almost a year to the day after the disappearance of the Star Tiger , another Avro Tudor IV belonging to BSAA vanished between Bermuda and Jamaica .
Exactly one hour after departure from Bermuda on 17 January 1949 , the pilot of the Star Ariel sent a routine communication of his position .
But then the plane vanished without trace at 18,000 feet .
According to experts , this would have required a sudden catastrophe .
Again , no wreckage , debris or bodies were ever found .
Fuel starvation at that height was not plausible , the weather report had been good , and pilot error was ruled out .
The plane 's poor design may well have been to blame , according to Don Mackintosh , a former BSAA Tudor IV pilot .
The cabin heater mounted underneath the floor where the co-pilot sat is his prime suspect .
My theory is that hydraulic vapour escaped from a leak , which got on to a hot heater and caused an explosion
Captain Peter Duffey
At the time , aircraft heater technology was still in its infancy .
" The heater bled aviation fuel on to a hot tube - and was also fairly close to the hydraulic pipes , " he says .
A pressure switch should have allowed the heater to operate when it was in the air but it was unreliable and was often deliberately short - circuited by staff , allowing the pilot manual control .
The switch prevented inflammable fuel from flowing , but if the heater was switched on manually , gas that may have collected could have ignited .
Captain Peter Duffey , a former BSAA pilot who went on to become a captain of British Airways Concorde , also believes that the proximity of the heater and the hydraulic pipes was significant .
" My theory is that hydraulic vapour escaped from a leak , which got on to a hot heater and caused an explosion , " he says .
Mr Newton 's report came to a similar conclusion : " If the heater had caught fire down below the floorboards then it could have developed to a catastrophic state before the crew knew anything about it .
" There was no automatic fire extinguisher to put it out like there is nowadays .
There was no alarm where the heater was stored so no - one would know , possibly until it was too late . "
The official accident investigation discovered that because of a communications error , search and rescue teams were not despatched until seven and a half hours later .
By then what was left of the plane and the bodies would have sunk .
The report on the disappearance of the first plane , the Star Tiger , said something which , because it could be easily misinterpreted , helped the accident achieve notoriety .
In a moment of philosophical conjecture , the investigators mused that maybe " some external cause may ( have ) overwhelm ( ed ) both man and machine " .
Those comments from sober - suited British civil servants opened the floodgates for conspiracy theorists , hack journalists and mischief makers , adding to the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle .

Neutrinos could transmit data to submarines at around 10 bits per second ( Image : Michael D. Kennedy / US Navy )
Earth - penetrating neutrinos might one day be used to send messages to lurking submarines .
The scheme could provide one - way communication with subs without requiring them to surface .
Neutrinos are particles that interact so weakly with matter that they can pass through the planet like light through glass .
In 1977 , physicists proposed that they might be used to send messages around , or through , the globe .
But because neutrinos interact so rarely , the conclusion was that it would be almost impossible to detect a signal .
Now advances in emitters and detectors make a neutrino com-link feasible in the near future , says physicist Patrick Huber of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg , Virginia .

“ This whole thing started as a lunch discussion , ” says Huber .
“ You say , yeah people have been talking about that , but it ’s basically impossible .
Then you sit down , do a little calculation , and you find that actually the numbers are not that crazy . ”
Neutrino factories
The technique might be best suited to communication with nuclear submarines , which currently use extremely - low - frequency and very - low - frequency radio waves .
ELF can reach a sub travelling at its operating depth but has a very low data rate , about 1 bit per minute .
VLF can send messages at around 50 bits per second , but cannot penetrate sea water and so requires the sub to deploy a floating antenna , which limits its manoeuvrability .
Huber has calculated that neutrinos could at the very least rival ELF and VLF .
The biggest technical advance is in producing neutrinos .
Proposed devices called muon storage rings should be able to generate an intense beam carrying around 1014 neutrinos per second , says Huber .
Most of them would pass straight through the planet , but a few would collide with the nuclei of atoms along the way , and just a very few of these collisions – about 2 per second – would happen near the submarine .
Faint glow
Each collision produces a high - energy muon , and a sub could detect the faint glow given off as the muon travels through seawater .
High - energy - neutrino detectors such as IceCube at the South Pole work by picking up this light , known as Cerenkov radiation .
Huber calculates that neutrinos could transmit data at around 10 bits per second .
That is less than VLF but can be done while the sub is operating at normal speed and depth .
One disadvantage is that subs would have to go to a prearranged area to receive the signal .
IceCube physicist Francis Halzen says that the proposal is physically feasible .
It would be expensive to implement , he says , “ but if it comes from a military budget , it ’s peanuts ” .

The first beta of MacRuby 0.5 is available , currently only for Snow Leopard ( MacOS X 10.6 ) machines .
InfoQ talked to the MacRuby core team about the present and the future of MacRuby .
InfoQ : How does MacRuby 's new VM use LLVM ?
MacRuby compiles everything at demand ( when the code is actually meant to be run ) .
The [ LLVM ] bitcode is sent through optimization passes before compilation .
The release notes for the MacRuby 0.5 beta also mention that LLVM is used to generate stubs for calling foreign functions because that 's faster than using libffi , which is used in older MacRuby versions .
InfoQ : MacRuby Ahead - Of - Time ( AOT ) compiles some of the Ruby standard libraries .
What 's the reason for that ?
The impact is definitely a faster startup time .
We are principally AOT compiling them to test the AOT compiler .
They are compiled at build time , as part of the main rake task .
InfoQ : What 's status of supporting native extensions ?
We are able to get some C extensions running , like ripper , digest , socket , zlib , etc. after a few modifications .
It is our plan to fully implement the MRI C extensions API in a future release .
InfoQ : One of the big improvements in version 0.5 is the removal of the GIL .
Now that 's been implemented for a while , what 's the experience with your solution ?
As far as we know it does n't bring any significant overhead .
Starting a thread is slightly costlier than before but most of the code can run in parallel after .
The GIL - less system was absolutely necessary for MacRuby to become a real Cocoa development platform , since it is common for desktop applications to use threads or more recently grand central dispatch ( GCD ) .
InfoQ : MacRuby allows to AOT compile Ruby code - but is it possible to opt out of the Garbage Collector , ie .
is there a way to just use Objective - C's reference counting memory management ?
It 's not possible yet [.. ] .
But we are considering a mode where the compiler would emit autorelease pools and where the runtime would not use the Autozone GC .
If you browse the mailing - list archives you will see a recent discussion on that topic .
The mentioned mailing list thread discusses how to emulate the GC , which is crucial to get MacRuby programs to run on platforms that do n't support the Autozone GC , eg the iPhone .
Another mail in the discussion explains why porting Autozone to the iPhone is n't a solution , because the iPhone 's Cocoa version is n't GC aware .
The final MacRuby 0.5 release will run on Leopard and Snow Leopard , both in 32 bit and 64 bit modes .
See previous InfoQ coverage of MacRuby , and the road towards version 0.5 .
We also put a new focus on meeting the needs of the people  not just keeping people safe , but trying to avoid violence from starting by encouraging Tel Afar ’s different groups to talk to one another .
Once we gained widespread trust in our impartiality , we could be fairly sure that any resident who saw something suspicious would quickly report it to the authorities .
The Iraqi government needs to apply these same principles to the national security forces .
Both the military and the police remain heavily politicized .
The police and border officials , for example , are largely answerable to the Interior Ministry , which has been seen ( often correctly ) as a pawn of Shiite political movements .
Members of the security forces are often loyal not to the state but to the person or political party that gave them their jobs .
The same is true of many parts of the Iraqi Army .
For example , the Fifth Iraqi Army Division , in Diyala Province northeast of Baghdad , has been under the sway of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , the Shiite party that has the largest bloc in Parliament ; the Eighth Division , in Diwaniya and Kut to the southeast of the capital , has answered largely to Dawa , the Shiite party of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki ; the Fourth Division , in Salahuddin Province in northern Iraq , has been allied with one of the two major Kurdish parties , the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan .
More recently , the Iraqi Awakening Conference , a tribal - centric political party based in Anbar Province ( where Sunni tribesmen , the so - called Sons of Iraq , turned against the insurgency during the surge ) has gained influence over the Seventh Iraq Army Division , which was heavily involved in recruiting Sunnis to maintain security in 2006 .
These political schisms are partly responsible for coordinated terrorist attacks like those on Sunday or the so - called Bloody Wednesday bombings of Aug. 19 , which killed more than 100 .
The aim of such assaults is to pull the rug from under Prime Minister Maliki in advance of the January elections .
Mr. Maliki has used the security gains of the last two years as his political trump card , a strategy that gave Dawa huge gains in provincial elections last February .
However , if attacks on the government rise , his opponents will harp on them in order to break Dawa ’s political momentum .
Sheldon 's biggest dreams are about to come true .
Wil Wheaton ( best known as Wesley Crusher from Star Trek : The Next Generation ; and recently seen on Leverage ) will guest star on the October 19 episode of The Big Bang Theory “ As much as Sheldon loves Star Trek Wil Wheaton is the only person associated with the franchise whom Sheldon has sworn eternal enmity toward , ” the actor said when asked about by TV Guide Magazine about his role .
So , why does Sheldon have such animosity for Wheaton ?
The character apparently did not enjoy an autograph experience with Wil many years ago .
“ The Wil I play in the Big Bang universe is not such a nice person , ” Wheaton said .
“ But in real life , I go out of my way to be kind and patient .
My motto is : ‘ Do n’t be a d---!’” This premise , though , sounds like it sets up perfectly for a slew

Tel Aviv University historian , Professor Shlomo Sand , opens his remarkable study of Jewish nationalism quoting Karl W. Deutsch :
“ A nation is a group of people united by a common mistake regarding its origin and a collective hostility towards its neighbours . ”
As simple or even simplistic as it may sound , the quote above eloquently summarises the figment of reality entangled with modern Jewish nationalism and especially within the concept of Jewish identity .
It obviously points the finger at the collective mistake Jews tend to make whenever referring to their ‘ illusionary collective past ’ and ‘ collective origin ’ .
Yet , in the same breath , Deutsch ’s reading of nationalism throws light upon the hostility that is unfortunately coupled with almost every Jewish group towards its surrounding reality , whether it is human or takes the shape of land .
While the brutality of the Israelis towards the Palestinians has already become rather common knowledge , the rough treatment Israelis reserve for their ‘ promised soil ’ and landscape is just starting to reveal itself .
The ecological disaster the Israelis are going to leave behind them will be the cause of suffering for many generations to come .
Leave aside the megalomaniac wall that shreds the Holy land into enclaves of deprivation and starvation , Israel has managed to pollute its main rivers and streams with nuclear and chemical waste .
The Invention of the Jewish People is a very serious study written by Professor Shlomo Sand , an Israeli historian .
It is the most serious study of Jewish nationalism and by far , the most courageous elaboration on the Jewish historical narrative .
In his book , Sand manages to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the Jewish people never existed as a ‘ nation - race ’ , they never shared a common origin .
Instead they are a colourful mix of groups that at various stages in history adopted the Jewish religion .
In case you follow Sand ’s line of thinking and happen to ask yourself , ‘ when was the Jewish People invented ? ’
Sand ’s answer is rather simple .
“ At a certain stage in the 19th century , intellectuals of Jewish origin in Germany , influenced by the folk character of German nationalism , took upon themselves the task of inventing a people ‘ retrospectively , ’ out of a thirst to create a modern Jewish people . ”
Accordingly , the ‘ Jewish people ’ is a ‘ made up ’ notion consisting of a fictional and imaginary past with very little to back it up forensically , historically or textually .
Furthermore , Sand — who elaborated on early sources of antiquity — comes to the conclusion that Jewish exile is also a myth , and that the present - day Palestinians are far more likely to be the descendants of the ancient Semitic people in Judea / Canaan than the current predominantly Khazarian - origin Ashkenazi crowd to which he himself admittedly belongs .
Astonishingly enough , in spite of the fact that Sand manages to dismantle the notion of ‘ Jewish people , ’ crush the notion of ‘ Jewish collective past , ’ and ridicule the Jewish chauvinist national impetus , his book is a best seller in Israel .
This fact alone may suggest that those who call themselves ‘ people of the book ’ are now starting to learn about the misleading and devastating philosophies and ideologies that made them into what Khalid Amayreh and many others regard as the “ Nazis of our time . ”
Hitler Won After All
Rather often when asking a ‘ secular ’ ‘ cosmopolitan ’
Jew what it is that makes him into a Jew , a shallow overwhelmingly chewed answer would be thrown back at you : “ It is Hitler who made me into a Jew . ”
Though the ‘ cosmopolitan ’ Jew , being an internationalist , would dismiss other people ’s national inclinations , he insists upon maintaining his own right to ‘ self determination ’ .
However , it is not really he himself who stands at the core of this unique demand for national orientation , it is actually the devil , master - monster anti-Semite , namely Hitler .
Apparently , the cosmopolitan Jew celebrates his nationalist entitlement as long as Hitler is there to be blamed .
As far as the secular cosmopolitan Jew is concerned , Hitler won after all .
Sand manages to enhance this paradox .
Insightfully he suggests that “ while in the 19th century referring to Jews as an ‘ alien racial identity ’ would mark one as an anti-Semite , in the Jewish State this very philosophy is embedded mentally and intellectually . ”
In Israel Jews celebrate their differentiation and unique conditions .
Furthermore , says Sand , “ There were times in Europe when one would be labelled as an anti-Semite for claiming that all Jews belong to a nation of an alien type .
Nowadays , claiming that Jews have never been and still are n’t people or a nation , would tag one as a Jew hater . ”
It is indeed pretty puzzling that the only people who managed to maintain and sustain a racially orientated , expansionist and genocidal national identity that is not at all different from Nazi ethnic ideology are the Jews who were , amongst others , the leading targeted victims of the Nazi ideology and practice .
Nationalism In General and Jewish Nationalism In Particular
Louis - Ferdinand Celine mentioned that in the time of the Middle Ages in the moments between major wars , knights would charge a very high price for their readiness to die in the name of their kingdoms ; in the 20th century youngsters have rushed to die en mass without demanding a thing in return .
In order to understand this mass consciousness shift , we need an eloquent methodical model that would allow us to understand what nationalism is all about .
Like Karl Deutsch , Sand regards nationality as a phantasmic narrative .
It is an established fact that anthropological and historical studies of the origins of different so - called ‘ people ’ and ‘ nations ’ lead towards the embarrassing crumbling of every ethnicity and ethnic identity .
Hence , it is rather interesting to find out that Jews tend to take their own ethnic myth very seriously .
The explanation may be simple , as Benjamin Beit Halachmi spotted years ago .
Zionism was there to transform the Bible from a spiritual text into a ‘ land registry . ’
For that matter , the truth of the Bible or any other element of Jewish historical narrative has very little relevance as long as it does n’t interfere with the Jewish national political cause or practice .
One could also surmise that the lack of clear ethnic origin does n’t stop people from feeling an ethnic or national belonging .
The fact that Jews are far from being what one can label as a People and that the Bible has very little historical truth in it , does n’t really stop generations of Israelis and Jews from identifying themselves with King David or Terminator Samson .
Evidently , the lack of an unambiguous ethnic origin does n’t stop people from seeing themselves as part of a people .
Similarly , it would n’t stop the nationalist Jew from feeling that he belongs to some greater abstract collective .
In the 1970 ’s , Shlomo Artzi , then a young Israeli singer who was bound to become Israel ’s all - time greatest rock star , released a song that had become a smash hit in a matter of hours .
Here are the first few lines :
All of a sudden
A man wakes up
In the morning
He feels he is people
And he starts to walk
And to everyone he comes across
He says shalom
To a certain extent Artzi innocently expresses in his lyrics the suddenness and almost contingency involved in the transformation of the Jews into people .
However , almost within the same breath , Artzi contributes towards the illusionist national myth of the peace - seeking nation .
Artzi should have known by then that Jewish nationalism was a colonialist act at the expense of the indigenous Palestinian people .
Seemingly , nationalism , national belonging and Jewish nationalism in particular create a major intellectual task .
Interestingly enough , the first to deal theoretically and methodically with issues having to do with nationalism were Marxist ideologists .
Though Marx himself failed to address the issue adequately , early 20th century uprising of nationalist demands in eastern and central Europe caught Lenin and Stalin unprepared .
“ Marxists ’ contribution to the study of nationalism can be seen as the focus on the deep correlation between the rise of free economy and the evolvement of the national state . ”
In fact , Stalin was there to summarise the Marxist take on the subject .
“ The nation , ” says Stalin , “ is a solid collaboration between beings that was created historically and formed following four significant phenomena : the sharing of tongue , the sharing of territory , the sharing of economy and the sharing of psychic significance … ”
As one would expect , the Marxist materialist attempt to understand nationalism is lacking an adequate historical overview .
Instead it would be reliant upon a class struggle .
For some obvious reasons such a vision was popular amongst those who believe in ‘ socialism of one nation ’ amongst them we can consider the proponents of a leftist branch of Zionism .
For Sand , nationalism evolved due to the “ rapture created by modernity which split people from their immediate past ” .
The mobility created by urbanisation and industrialisation crushed the social hierarchic system as well as the continuum between past , present and future .
Sand points out that before industrialisation , the feudal peasant did n’t necessarily feel the need for an historical narrative of empires and kingdoms .
The feudal subject did n’t need an extensive abstract historical narrative of large collectives that had very little relevance to the immediate concrete existential need .
“ Without a perception of social progression , they did well with an imaginary religious tale that contained a mosaic of memory that lacked a real dimension of a forward moving time .
The ‘ end ’ was the beginning and eternity bridged between life and death . ”
In the modern secular and urban world , ‘ time ’ had become the main life vessel which illustrated an imaginary symbolic meaning .
Collective historical time had become the elementary ingredient of the personal and the intimate .
The collective narrative shapes the personal meaning and what seems to be the ‘ real . ’
As much as some banal minds still insist that the ‘ personal is political , ’ it would be far more intelligible to argue that in practice , it is actually the other way around .
Within the post - modern condition , the political is personal and the subject is spoken rather than speaking itself .
Authenticity , for the matter , is a myth that reproduces itself in the form of symbolic identifier .
Sand ’s reading of nationalism as a product of industrialisation , urbanisation and secularism , makes a lot of sense when bearing in mind Uri Slezkin ’s suggestion that Jews are the ‘ apostles of modernity , ’ secularism and urbanisation .
If Jews happened to find themselves at the hub of urbanisation and secularisation , it should n’t then take us by surprise that the Zionists were rather creative as much as others in inventing their own phantasmic collective imaginary tale .
However , while insisting on their right to be ‘ like other people ’
Zionists have managed to transform their imagined collective past into a global , expansionist , merciless agenda as well as the biggest threat to world peace .
There Is No Jewish History
It is an established fact that not a single Jewish history text had been written between the 1st century and early 19th century .
The fact that Judaism is based on a religious historical myth may have something to do with it .
An adequate scrutiny of the Jewish past was never a primary concern within the Rabbinical tradition .
One of the reasons is probably the lack of a need of such a methodical effort .
For the Jew who lived during ancient times and the Middle Ages , there was enough in the Bible to answer most relevant questions having to do with day - to - day life , Jewish meaning and fate .
As Shlomo Sand puts it , “ a secular chronological time was foreign to the ‘ Diaspora time ’ that was shaped by the anticipation for the coming of the Messiah . ”
However , in the light of German secularisation , urbanisation , and emancipation , and due to the decreasing authority of the Rabbinical leaders , an emerging need of an alternative cause rose amongst the awakening Jewish intellectuals .
The emancipated Jew wondered who he was , where he come from .
He also started to speculate what his role might be within the rapidly opening European society .
In 1820 , the German Jewish historian Isaak Markus Jost ( 1793 - 1860 ) published the first serious historical work on Jews , namely The History of the Israelites .
Jost avoided the Biblical time , he preferred to start his journey with the Judea Kingdom , he also compiled an historical narrative of different Jewish communities around the world .
Jost realised that the Jews of his time did not form an ethnic continuum .
He grasped that Israelites from place to place were rather different .
Hence , he thought there was nothing in the world that should stop Jews from total assimilation .
Jost believed that within the spirit of enlightenment , both the Germans and the Jews would turn their back to the oppressive religious institution and would form a healthy nation based on a growing geographically orientated sense of belonging .
Though Jost was aware of the evolvement of European nationalism , his Jewish followers were rather unhappy with his liberal optimistic reading of the Jewish future .
“ From historian Heinrich Graetz on , Jewish historians began to draw the history of Judaism as the history of a nation that had been a ‘ kingdom ’ , expelled into ‘ exile ’ , became a wandering people and ultimately turned around and went back to its birthplace . ”
For the late Moses Hess , it was a racial struggle rather than a class struggle that would define the shape of Europe .
Accordingly , suggests
Hess , Jews better return and reflect on their cultural heritage and ethnic origin .
For Hess , the conflict between Jews and Gentiles was the product of racial differentiation , hence , unavoidable .
The ideological path from Hess ’s pseudo scientific racist orientation to Zionist historicism is rather obvious .
If Jews are indeed an alien racial entity ( as Hess , Jabotinsky and others believed ) , they better look for their natural homeland , and this homeland is no other than Eretz Yizrael .
Cleary ,
Hess ’s assumption regarding a racial continuum was n’t scientifically approved .
In order to maintain the emerging phantasmic narrative , an orchestrated denial mechanism had to be erected just to make sure that some embarrassing facts would n’t interfere with the emerging national creation .
Sand suggests that the denial mechanism was rather orchestrated and very well thought out .
The Hebrew University decision in the 1930 ’s to split Jewish History and General History into two distinct departments was far more than just a matter of convenience .
The logos behind the split is a glimpse into Jewish self - realisation .
In the eyes of Jewish academics , the Jewish condition and Jewish psyche were unique and should be studied separately .
Apparently , even within Jewish academia , a supreme status is reserved for the Jews , their history and their self - perception .
As Sand insightfully unveils , within the Jewish Studies departments the researcher is scattering between the mythological and the scientific while the myth maintains its primacy .
Yet , it often gets into a stalling dilemma by the ‘ small devious facts . ’
The New Israelite , the Bible , and Archaeology
In Palestine , the new Jews and later the Israelis were determined to recruit the Old Testament and to transform it into the amalgamate code of the future Jew .
The ‘ nationalisation ’ of the Bible was there to plant in young Jews the idea that they are the direct followers of their great ancient ancestors .
Bearing in mind the fact that nationalisation was largely a secular movement , the Bible was stripped of its spiritual and religious meaning .
Instead , it was viewed as an historical text describing a real chain of events in the past .
The Jews who had now managed to kill their God learned to believe in themselves .
Massada , Samson and Bar Kochva became suicidal master narratives .
In the light of their heroic ancestors , Jews learned to love themselves as much as they hate others , except that this time they possessed the military might to inflict real pain on their neighbours .
More concerning was the fact that instead of a supernatural entity — namely God — who command them to invade the land and execute a genocide and to rob their ‘ promised land ’ of its indigenous inhabitants , within their national revival project it was them as themselves , Herzl , Jabotinsky , Weitzman , Ben Gurion , Sharon , Peres , Barak who decided to expel , destroy and kill .
Instead of God , it was then the Jews killing in the name of Jewish people .
They did it while Jewish symbols decorate their planes and tanks .
They followed commands that where given in the newly restored language of their ancestors .
Surprisingly enough , Sand who is no doubt a striking scholar , fails to mention that the Zionist hijacking of the Bible was in fact a desperate Jewish answer to German Early Romanticism .
However , as much as German philosophers , poets , architects and artists were ideologically and aesthetically excited about pre-Socratic Greece , they knew very well that they were not exactly Hellenism ’s sons and daughters .
The nationalist Jew took it one step further , he bound oneself into a phantasmic blood chain with his mythical ancestors , not before long he restored their ancient language .
Rather than a sacred tongue , Hebrew had become a spoken language .
German Early Romanticist never went that far .
German intellectuals during the 19th century were also fully aware of the distinction between Athens and Jerusalem .
For them , Athens stood for universal , the epic chapter of humanity and humanism .
Jerusalem was , on the contrary , the grand chapter of tribal barbarism .
Jerusalem was a representation of the banal , non-universal , monotheistic merciless God , the one who kills the elder and the infant .
The Germanic Early Romantic era left us with Hegel , Nietzsche , Fichte and Heidegger and a just a few Jewish self - haters , leading amongst them , Otto Weininger .
The Jerusalemite left us with not a single master ideological thinker .
Some German Jewish second - rate scholars tried to preach Jerusalem in the Germanic exedra , amongst them were Herman Cohen , Franz Rosenzveig and Ernst Bloch .
They obviously failed to notice that it was the traces of Jerusalem in Christianity , which German Early Romanticists despised .
In their effort to resurrect ‘ Jerusalem , ’ archaeology was recruited to provide the Zionist epos with its necessary ‘ scientific ’ ground .
Archaeology was there to unify the Biblical time with the moment of revival .
Probably the most astonishing moment of this bizarre trend was the 1982 ‘ military burial ceremony ’ of the bones of Shimon Bar Kochva , a Jew rebel who died 2000 years earlier .
Executed by the chief military Rabbi , a televised military burial was given to some sporadic bones found in a cave near the Dead Sea .
In practice suspected remains of a 1st century Jew rebel was treated as an IDF casualty .
Clearly , archaeology had a national role , it was recruited to cement the past and the present while leaving the Galut out .
Astonishingly enough , it did n’t take long before things turned the other way around .
As archaeological research become more and more independent of the Zionist dogma , the embarrassing truth filtered out .
It would be impossible to ground the truthfulness of the Biblical tale on forensic facts .
If anything , archaeology refutes the historicity of the Biblical plot .
Excavation revealed the embarrassing fact .
The Bible is a collection of innovative fictitious literature .
As Sand points out , the Early Biblical story is soaked with Philistines , Aramaic and camels .
Embarrassingly enough , as far as excavations are there to enlighten us , Philistine did n’t appear in the region before the 12th century BC , the Aramaic appears a century later and camels did n’t show their cheerful faces before the 8th century .
These scientific facts lead Zionist researchers into some severe confusion .
However , for non-Jewish scholars such as Thomas Thompson , it was rather clear that the Biblical is a “ late collection of innovative literature written by a gifted theologian . ”
The Bible appears to be an ideological text that was there to serve a social and political cause .
Embarrassingly enough , not much was found in Sinai to prove the story of the legendary Egyptian Exodus , seemingly 3 million Hebraic men , women and children were marching in the desert for 40 years without leaving a thing behind .
Not even a single matzo ball , very non-Jewish one may say .
The story of the Biblical resettlement and the genocide of the Canaanite which the contemporary Israelite imitates to such success is another myth .
Jericho , the guarded city that was flattened to the sounds of horns and almighty supernatural intervention was just a tiny village during the 13th century BC .
As much as Israel regards itself as the resurrection of the monumental Kingdom of David and Salomon , excavation that took place in the Old City of Jerusalem in the 1970 ’s revealed that David ’s kingdom was no more than a tiny tribal setting .
Evidence that was referred by Yigal Yadin to King Solomon had been refuted later by forensic tests made with Carbon 14 .
The discomforting fact has been scientifically established .
The Bible is a fictional tale , and not much there can ground any glorifying existence of Hebraic people in Palestine at any stage .
Who invented the Jews ?
Quite early on in his text , Sand raises the crucial and probably the most relevant questions .
Who are the Jews ?
Where did they come from ?
How is it that in different historical periods they appear in some very different and remote places ?
Though most contemporary Jews are utterly convinced that their ancestors are the Biblical Israelites who happened to be exiled brutally by the Romans , truth must be said .
Contemporary Jews have nothing to do with ancient Israelites , who have never been sent to exile because such an expulsion has never taken place .
The Roman Exile is just another Jewish myth .
“ I started looking in research studies about the exile from the land ” says Sand in a Haaretz interview , “ but to my astonishment I discovered that it has no literature .
The reason is that no one exiled the people of the country .
The Romans did not exile peoples and they could not have done so even if they had wanted to .
They did not have trains and trucks to deport entire populations .
That kind of logistics did not exist until the 20th century .
From this , in effect , the whole book was born : in the realization that Judaic society was not dispersed and was not exiled . ”
Indeed , in the light of Sand ’s simple insight , the idea of Jewish exile is amusing .
The thought of Roman Imperial navy was working 24/7 schlepping Moishe ’le and Yanka ’le to Cordova and Toledo may help Jews to feel important as well as schleppable , but common sense would suggest that the Roman armada had far more important things to do .
However , far more interesting is the logical outcome :
If the people of Israel were not expelled , then the real descendants of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Judah must be the Palestinians .
“ No population remains pure over a period of thousands of years ” says Sand .
“ But the chances that the Palestinians are descendants of the ancient Judaic people are much greater than the chances that you or I are its descendents .
The first Zionists , up until the Arab Revolt [ 1936 - 9 ] , knew that there had been no exiling , and that the Palestinians were descended from the inhabitants of the land .
They knew that farmers do n’t leave until they are expelled .
Even Yitzhak Ben - Zvi , the second president of the State of Israel , wrote in 1929 that , ‘ the vast majority of the peasant farmers do not have their origins in the Arab conquerors , but rather , before then , in the Jewish farmers who were numerous and a majority in the building of the land . ’ ”
In his book Sand takes it further and suggests that until the First Arab Uprising ( 1929 ) the so - called leftist Zionist leaders tended to believe that the Palestinian peasants who are actually ‘ Jews by origin ’ would assimilate within the emerging Hebraic culture and would eventually join the Zionist movement .
Ber Borochov believed that “ a falach ( Palestinian Peasant ) , dresses as a Jew , and behaves as a working class Jew , wo n’t be at all different from the Jew ” .
This very idea reappeared in Ben Gurion ’s and Ben - Zvi ’s text in 1918 .
Both Zionist leaders realised that Palestinian culture was soaked with Biblical traces , linguistically , as well as geographically ( names of villages , towns , rivers and mountains ) .
Both Ben Gurion and Ben - Zvi regarded , at least at that early stage , the indigenous Palestinians as ethnic relatives who were holding close to the land and potential brothers .
They as well regarded Islam as a friendly ‘ democratic religion ’ .
Clearly , after 1936 both Ben - Zvi and Ben Gurion toned down their ‘ multicultural ’ enthusiasm .
As far as Ben Gurion is concerned , ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians seemed to be far more appealing .
One may wonder , if the Palestinians are the real Jews , who are those who insist upon calling themselves Jews ?
Sand ’s answer is rather simple , yet it makes a lot of sense .
“ The people did not spread , but the Jewish religion spread .
Judaism was a converting religion .
Contrary to popular opinion , in early Judaism there was a great thirst to convert others . ”
Clearly , monotheist religions , being less tolerant than polytheist ones have within them an expanding impetus .
Judaic expansionism in its early days was not just similar to Christianity but it was Judaic expansionism that planted the ‘ spreading out ’ seeds in early Christian thought and practice .
“ The Hasmoneans , ” says Sand , “ were the first to begin to produce large numbers of Jews through mass conversion , under the influence of Hellenism .
It was this tradition of conversions that prepared the ground for the subsequent , widespread dissemination of Christianity .
After the victory of Christianity in the 4th century , the momentum of conversion was stopped in the Christian world , and there was a steep drop in the number of Jews .
Presumably many of the Jews who appeared around the Mediterranean became Christians .
But then Judaism started to permeate other regions — pagan regions , for example , such as Yemen and North Africa .
Had Judaism not continued to advance at that stage and had it not continued to convert people in the pagan world , we would have remained a completely marginal religion , if we survived at all . ”
The Jews of Spain , whom we believed to be blood related to the Early Israelites seem to be converted Berbers .
“ I asked myself , ” says Sand , “ how such large Jewish communities appeared in Spain .
And then I saw that Tariq ibn Ziyad , the supreme commander of the Muslims who conquered Spain , was a Berber , and most of his soldiers were Berbers .
Dahia al - Kahina ’s Jewish Berber Kingdom had been defeated only 15 years earlier .
And the truth is there are a number of Christian sources that say many of the conquerors of Spain were Jewish converts .
The deep - rooted source of the large Jewish community in Spain was those Berber soldiers who converted to Judaism . ”
As one would expect , Sand approves the largely accepted assumption that the Judaicised Khazars constituted the main origins of the Jewish communities in Eastern Europe , which he calls the Yiddish Nation .
When asked how come they happen to speak Yiddish , which is largely regarded as a German medieval dialect , he answers , “ the Jews were a class of people dependent on the German bourgeoisie in the east , and thus they adopted German words . ”
In his book Sand manages to produce a detailed account of the Khazarian saga in Jewish history .
He explains what lead the Khazarian kingdom towards conversion .
Bearing in mind that Jewish nationalism is , for the most part , lead by a Khazarian elite , we may have to expand our intimate knowledge of this very unique yet influential political group .
The translation of Sand ’s work into foreign languages is an immediate must .
What Next ?
Professor Sand leaves us with the inevitable conclusion .
Contemporary Jews do not have a common origin and their Semitic origin is a myth .
Jews have no origin in Palestine whatsoever and therefore , their act of so - called ‘ return ’ to their ‘ promised land ’ must be realised as an invasion executed by a tribal - ideological clan .
However , though Jews do not constitute any racial continuum , they for some reason happen to be racially orientated .
As we may notice , many Jews still see mixed marriage as the ultimate threat .
Furthermore , in spite of modernisation and secularisation , the vast majority of those who identify as secular Jews still succumb to blood ritual ( circumcision ) a unique religious procedure which involves no less than blood sucking by a Mohel .
As far as Sand is concerned , Israel should become “ a state of its citizens . ”
Like Sand , I myself believe in the same futuristic utopian vision .
However , unlike Sand , I do grasp that the Jewish state and its supportive lobbies must be ideologically defeated .
Brotherhood and reconciliation are foreign to Jewish tribal worldview and have no room within the concept of Jewish national revival .
As dramatic as it may sound , a process of de-judaification must take place before Israelis can adopt any universal modern notion of civil life .
Sand is no doubt a major intellectual , probably the most advanced leftist Israeli thinker .
He represents the highest form of thought a secular Israeli can achieve before flipping over or even defecting to the Palestinian side ( something that happened to just a few , me included ) .
Haaretz interviewer Ofri Ilani said about Sand that unlike other ‘ new historians ’ who have tried to undermine the assumptions of Zionist historiography , “ Sand does not content himself with going back to 1948 or to the beginnings of Zionism , but rather goes back thousands of years . ”
This is indeed the case , unlike the ‘ new historians ’ who ‘ unveil ’ a truth that is known to every Palestinian toddler ; i.e. , the truth of being ethnically cleansed ;
Sand erects a body of work and thought that is aiming at the understanding of the meaning of Jewish nationalism and Jewish identity .
This is indeed the true essence of scholarship .
Rather than collecting some sporadic historical fragments , Sand searches for the meaning of history .
Rather than a ‘ new historian ’ who searches for a new fragment , he is a real historian motivated by a humanist task .
Most crucially , unlike some of the Jewish historians who happen to contribute to the so - called left discourse , Sand ’s credibility and success is grounded on his argument rather than his family background .
He avoids peppering his argument with his holocaust survivor relatives .
Reading Sand ’s ferocious argument , one may have to admit that Zionism in all its faults has managed to erect within itself a proud and autonomous dissident discourse that is far more eloquent and brutal than the entire anti-Zionist movement around the world .
If Sand is correct , and I myself am convinced by the strength of his argument , then Jews are not a race but rather a collective of very many people who are largely hijacked by a late phantasmic national movement .
If Jews are not a race , do not form a racial continuum and have nothing to do with Semitism , then ‘ anti-Semitism ’ is , categorically , an empty signifier .
It obviously refers to a signifier that does n’t exist .
In other words , our criticism of Jewish nationalism , Jewish lobbying and Jewish power can only be realised as a legitimate critique of ideology and practice .
Once again I may say it , we are not and never been against Jews ( the people ) nor we are against Judaism ( the religion ) .
Yet , we are against a collective philosophy with some clear global interests .
Some would like to call it Zionism but I prefer not to .
Zionism is a vague signifier that is far too narrow to capture the complexity of Jewish nationalism , its brutality , ideology and practice .
Jewish nationalism is a spirit and a spirit does n’t have clear boundaries .
In fact , none of us know exactly where Jewishness stops and where Zionism starts as much as we do not know where Israeli interests stop and where the Neocon ’s interests start .
As far as the Palestinian cause is concerned , the message is rather devastating .
Our Palestinian brothers and sisters are at the forefront of a struggle against a very devastating philosophy .
Yet , it is clearly not just the Israelis whom they fight with rather a fierce pragmatic philosophy that initiates global conflicts on some gigantic scale .
It is a tribal practice that seeks influence within corridors of power and super powers in particular .
The American Jewish Committee is pushing for a war against Iran .
Just to be on the safe side David Abrahams , a ‘ Labour Friend of Israel ’ donates money to the Labour Party by proxy .
More or less at the same time two million Iraqis die in an illegal war designed by one called Wolfowitz .
While all the above is taking place , millions of Palestinians are starved in concentration camps and Gaza is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis .
As it all happens , ‘ anti- Zionist ’ Jews and Jews in the left ( Chomsky included ) insist upon dismantling the eloquent criticism of AIPAC , Jewish lobbying and Jewish power posed by Mearsheimer and Walt .
Is it just Israel ?
Is it really Zionism ?
Or shall we admit that it is something far greater than we are entitled even to contemplate within the intellectual boundaries we imposed upon ourselves ?
As things stand , we lack the intellectual courage to confront the Jewish national project and its many messengers around the world .
However , since it is all a matter of consciousness - shift , things are going to change soon .
In fact , this very text is there to prove that they are changing already .
To stand by the Palestinians is to save the world , but in order to do so we have to be courageous enough to stand up and admit that it is not merely a political battle .
It is not just Israel , its army or its leadership , it is n’t even Dershowitz , Foxman , and their silencing leagues .
It is actually a war against a cancerous spirit that hijacked the West and , at least momentarily , diverted it from its humanist inclination and Athenian aspirations .
To fight a spirit is far more difficult than fighting people , just because one may have to first fight its traces within oneself .
If we want to fight Jerusalem , we may have to first confront Jerusalem within .
We may have to stand in front of the mirror , look around us .
We may have to trace for empathy in ourselves in case there is anything left .
Robin Hanson has repeatedly pointed out the difference between near and far modes of thinking , and Alicorn has repeatedly pointed out the difference between procedural and propositional knowledge .
Just occurred to me that it 's pretty much the same difference .
I will now proceed to play some obvious riffs on the theme .
Do you ever feel yourself to be an expert on some topic just from reading about it a lot ?
Every young enthusiastic programmer just entering the workforce feels like that .
( I certainly did . )
Every wannabe entrepreneur who hangs out on Hacker News and has read enough Paul Graham essays feels they can take on the world by just applying those valuable insights .
( I certainly did . )
It 's soooo fun to feel knowledgeable , maybe even project it outward by giving Internet advice to newbies .
The public relations department of my brain does n't seem to care that I have no actual experience : reading stuff is quite enough to change my self - image .
The problem is , excessively liking propositional knowledge over procedural is a bias that harms us every day .
Though some information is directly useful , most of it is worthless .
A couple days ago I had to give advice to a classmate of mine who wants to start his own " thing " but is n't sure .
See , he has this theory that one should accumulate propositional knowledge until one reaches critical mass , at which point the successful venture happens by itself .
Being the wise and experienced mentor that I am ( hah ... on my second " thing " , without much success ) , I told him outright that his theory was bullshit .
Propositional knowledge does n't spontaneously turn into procedural .
( Digression : come to think , I 'm not even sure why we need the kinds of propositional knowledge that we tend to accumulate .
It reeks of a superstimulus .
I know more about programming that I 'll ever need for work or play , but do n't remember the birthdays of all my acquaintances , which would obviously be more useful .
Memorizing birthdays just is n't as exciting as reading about comonads or whatever . )
At this point I sincerely wish I had a recipe for overcoming this bias .
Like pjeby , he always has a recipe .
Well , I do n't .
Maybe perceiving the bias will turn out to be enough ; maybe some kind of social software thing can help cure it on a mass scale , like meetup.com is trying to cure Bowling Alone ; or maybe each of us will have to apply force , the oldskool way .
It 's too early to say .
Thank me for never mentioning the example of riding a bicycle .
A motorist who was filmed drenching children at a bus stop by going through a puddle could face prosecution , police said today .
Kerry Callard 's driving in Plymouth , Devon came to the attention of officers after a 30 - second movie clip was posted on YouTube ( See below ) .
The footage from inside the car captures the drive down Weston Mill Hill and through the large puddle where the group are waiting .
Police said the 29 - year - old had contacted them voluntarily about the incident last Thursday and the evidence was now being reviewed .
A male voice is heard commenting on the clip saying : " Here we go , ready to drench the kids .. " and later " That was Brilliant !
Awesome ! " .
A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said today : " We had three complaints from members of the public and as a result a 29 - year - old woman was interviewed .
The file has gone to the CPS for consideration . "
Charges of careless or even dangerous driving could be brought for this type of offence , the force said .
The spokesman added : " Although driving through standing water may be seen as a bit of fun , potentially it is very dangerous .
" Not only is it showing no consideration to the pedestrians who may get a soaking , but it could result in the driver losing control of the vehicle due to the force of the water snatching the wheel from the hands , or by the vehicle aquaplaning . "
Callard has claimed the children asked to be splashed and would not have done it otherwise .
She told the Daily Mail : " The fun factor is mostly gone from life these days but they were playing in puddles , like kids always have done .
" If the kids were n't saying ' Splash me , splash me ' , I certainly would n't have done it .
I 'm not a serial splasher . "
The force said the children 's possible agreement to the stunt would make no difference to how the standard of driving was judged .
A motorist from Somerset who soaked a workman by driving through a puddle was prosecuted in 2005 .
He was fined £ 150 and given three penalty points by magistrates in Yeovil after he admitted driving without due consideration .

‘ When I was young , all I thought about was art and music .
Now I ’m middle - aged , and all I think about is money . ’’
That bitter line by Wallace Shawn , slightly paraphrased , from Louis Malle ’s wonderful 1981 movie , “ My Dinner With Andre , ’’ has stuck in my mind for all these years .
Recently , I ’ve thought of it more often .
I ’ve begun to think that Wally was on to something .
Newspapers used to have cheerful , wide - ranging columns on senior life .
Today , the closest thing to it is the column in the Globe business section , under the daily Wall Street report , which is often about the funding of retirement : stocks , bonds , annuities , insurance , Social Security and 401 ( k ) plans , strategies for protecting wealth .
Not about grandchildren or love or art , not friends or community or good times .
Money .
When we were first married , we lived in a tiny apartment .
We had almost no savings and lived on two jobs that paid about $ 15,000 per year combined .
We sat by the fire , listened to records on our cheap hi-fi , and sipped cloying Mateus rosé .
We rode our bikes , with our son riding on the back , to free band concerts .
When we traveled , we drove one battered car , and camped or stayed in youth hostels .
We went to movies and never ate out .
We bought every stitch we owned at Marshall’s .
We gazed at the shimmering ocean and never noticed the yachts .
We thought daisies were better than orchids .
We thought about money , of course , but did n’t let worries about it spoil our fun , so long as basic needs were met .
I seem to recall that we actually considered ourselves lucky .
We had each other .
We were confident that the future would work out .
Hindsight is a fantasy , but I believe we were reasonably happy .
What happened ?
When did I begin to think about more and fancier possessions , to pay attention to other people ’s vacations and second homes , or where their kids went to college ?
When did I begin to frown when I got a pay raise because it meant higher taxes ?
For that matter , to think of charity partly as a tax strategy ?
When did I start checking account balances more and more often ?
When did I start to think that no matter how much we had , it would be nice to have more ?
It ’s not that we have all that much .
It ’s just that while we ’re far better off than we were in those early days , it does n’t seem to me that I ’m far happier .
In fact , without a scrap of evidence , I have a hunch that there is a danger of people , like Wally in the movie , to think more about money as they get older , perhaps more than they should .
If I ’m right , why would it be so ?
Could it be that money becomes a kind of consolation of aging ?
After all , we have to let go of the light - footedness and suppleness we had when we were young , as well as the airy optimism that the future is bright and all will be well .
But money is always young .
The faces of senior citizens like Barbra Streisand , whose suspiciously unlined visage appeared in a profile in last week ’s Times , remind us that money can even buy the appearance of youth .
Yes , I know that later in life , we think different because we have no big career advances in the future .
Financial security is mostly based on savings , investments , and pensions .
That feels less secure than working ( an idea which gives the Hyatt housekeepers a bitter laugh ) .
We worry about getting sick , about not wanting to become a burden to our kids .
We think about seniors we know who are virtual paupers in nursing homes .
We being sensible and reasonable .
Still , it leaves me slightly uneasy .
Without hiring Dr. 90210 , we ca n’t turn back the calendar .
Even so , I would like to get back to that former state of mind , which might have been a fool ’s paradise but strikes me now as wise and healthy .
To think that life is good if you ’ve got friends , family , and health .
To think about real financial needs , but not continually to count assets .
To pay more attention to art , poetry , and music .
To think , even if the stock market crashed and you lost nearly everything , you ’d still have much to be thankful for .
To go out in the field , now and then , and pick a bunch of daisies .

RIO DE JANEIRO  Environmental groups hailed a decision this week by four of the world ’s largest meat producers to ban the purchase of cattle from newly deforested areas of Brazil ’s Amazon rain forest .
At a conference on Monday in São Paulo organized by Greenpeace , the four cattle companies  Bertin , JBS - Friboi , Marfrig and Minerva  agreed to support Greenpeace ’s call for an end to the deforestation .
Brazil has the world ’s largest cattle herd and is the world ’s largest beef exporter , but it is also the fourth largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions .
Destruction of tropical forests around the world is estimated to be responsible for about 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
Greenpeace contends that the cattle industry in the Amazon is the biggest driver of global deforestation .
But the Brazilian government , while pushing ambitious goals to slow deforestation in the Amazon , is also a major financer and shareholder in global beef and leather processors that profit from cattle raised in areas of the Amazon that have been destroyed , often illegally , according to Greenpeace .
The Healthy SF Plan in brief : ( NOT a snark )
- Universal coverage .
Open to all San Francisco residents ages 18 to 64 regardless of employment or immigration status .
-
No pre-existing conditions exclusions . - No deductibles . - No annual or lifetime caps .
- Health Card for member access .
- Covered services .
No limits on doctor visits and hospital stays and includes drug rehab , labs , family planning , prescription drugs , mental health and more .
- Medical Home .
A local neighborhood clinic ( you choose your clinic ) for a primary care doctor .
Referrals to specialists and hospitals as needed .
- Preventative focus encouraged to reduce the City 's emergency room visits .
What it does n’t do : Services not included .
- Care only available in San Francisco .
Not true cover - you - anywhere health insurance .
-
No dental or vision , no acupuncture : o( - Limited network of 27 City clinics and 5 hospitals .
More private hospitals are joining , Kaiser just added .
What it costs for Participants : :
- Sliding scale based on income , assets and family size up to 500 % Fed Poverty Line ( FPL ) .
Free for low income .
Income maximums for an individual = $ 54,000 / pays $ 450 / qtr. or family of 4 = $ 110,000 / pays $ 1800 / qtr .
That 's per quarter !
- Minimal Co-Pays .
$ 0 to $ 10 doctor visit , $ 0 to $ 50 ER , $ 0 to $ 25 drugs .
A similar Gold Standard private insurance plan would cost , if you could even get it as an individual with pre-existing conditions , a minimum of $ 700 / per month for individual Anthem Blue Cross .
What the Kaiser ( PDF ) Survey results say about Healthy SF :
Great talking point facts when at your friendly town hall meeting or Tea Bagger party !
Overall Results : Patient Satisfaction : 94 % Satisfied ; 63 % " Very Satisfied " 31 % " Somewhat Satisfied " Available : 60 % of participants were NOT eligible for health insurance from their employer when they signed up !
Now that 's universal care .
Program Enrollment Process : 86 % Satisfied Health Needs Met : Before program 66 % Satisfied ( 34 % very well satisfied ) ;
After enrollment in program 90 % Satisfied ( 57 % very well satisfied ) .
WOW !
Feeling Well Protected : Remember Healthy SF is NOT health insurance , even so , 50 % felt " well protected " the same percentage as people who have health insurance plans today .
Services and Access Results : Treatments and Drugs You Want : 89 % Satisfied , 9 % Not Satisfied ( where 's the exclusions " list " ? )
Routine Appointments : 84 % Satisfied , 13 % Not Satisfied ( the doctor will see you now ) Specialist Appointment : 80 % Satisfied , 16 % Not Satisfied ( where are the death panels ? )
Doctor Communication : 88 % Satisfied , 7 % Not Satisfied ( do they allow this ? )
Quality of Care : 91 % Satisfied , 4 % Not Satisfied ( nuff ' said ) See the Doctor you Want : 84 % Satisfied , Not Satisfied 10 % ( choice , who knew ? )
Administrative Answers : 89 % Satisfied , 7 % Not Satisfied .
( what planet is this from ? )
Cost Results : Cost : 44 % say they are " paying less " and 15 % say they are " paying more " .
Remember " paying more " means in comparison to when they had health insurance paid by their employer .
Overall Cost : 88 % Satisfied , 6 % Not Satisfied . ( 3 % overhead vs. 33 % profits )
In summary , PARTICIPANTS ARE 80 % + SATISFIED ON EVERY METRIC OF SF's PUBLIC OPTION .
Okay so what about business and the fiscal impact ?
aka the Blue Dog fiscal boogieman .
Financial Impact for SF City and Corporations :
Overview of population served .
73,000 uninsured SF residents ( about 10 % of the population ) .
45,000 people signed up in 2 years in Healthy SF .
About 60 % of those 45,000 are at the Fed Poverty Line and have substantially higher health care needs ( the uninsured population comprises more homeless , skews older , higher percentage of mental health and drug abuse issues , higher percentage of non-English speaking immigrants ) .
Cost to the City : 2009 budget of $ 113 million or about $ 280 / per participant / per month .
The City covers $ 199 / person of this ( from its existing health care funding base of local / State / Federal funding ) and the participant fees and employer fees cover the remainder .
Note the key here is a ) the city has reorganized its existing health care assets ( clinics , hospitals , programs ) and funding dollars into one universal coverage and access plan and b ) the plan has shown to substantially reduce very high - cost emergency room visits with regular access to local preventative care .
Health care rationalized , not rationed .
Okay so what does business pay ?
First , if you already provide health insurance for your employees , then you do n't pay .
If you have more than 20 employees and you choose not to cover them , then you pay .
The SF plan is mandatory for businesses to either provide health insurance coverage or pay the City to provide the coverage through Healthy SF .
( note mandatory choice for the employer not for the individual - what a concept ! )
Are businesses happy ?
No , and surprisingly , yes .
The SF Restaurant Assoc ( GGRA ) has sued to halt the employer mandate , lost and is now appealing to the Supreme Court .
The City has stood its ground and they have been joined in amicus briefs by , surprise , some more enlightened companies , for example .
Nibbi Bros , a major SF construction company , says it , " has an interest in not being at a competitive disadvantage when dealing with employers who choose not to bear any of the direct or societal cost of health care . "
What about the California Budget crisis and its impact on Healthy SF ?
It sucks .
SF has been forced to cut its Public Health services .
Staff cuts have been deep and clinic services reduced .
It lives .
The Healthy SF program lives on - BECAUSE it saves $ $$ , and it is more efficient in the use of health care dollars .
In fact , in February , the income limits were raised from 300 % FPL to 500 % of the FPL - meaning more people are covered .
Finally , for the personal stories on how Healthy SF has saved lives ( get out the hankies ) :
Fellow Kossack diary - a life saver !
CNN TV report on - another life saver !
My story .
I am recently unemployed .
My wife has been going through breast cancer treatment .
She has been rendered by the insurance industry as effectively uninsured and is scared to death .
Fortunately , my family of four is able to live in SF at my mother 's house .
I saw an ad ( imagine advertising for universal health care ) for the Healthy SF program on the side of a City bus .
My wife and I went down to Healthy SF , signed up that day , paid the $ 60 quarterly fee ( unemployed family of 4 ) and selected our Medical Home .
Within several days we had scheduled appointments for family checkups and an oncologist visit .
My wife 's and my sense of relief and gratitude is overwhelming for the Healthy SF program and the people ( Mitch Katz and Mayor Newsom among many others ) who created it and continue to make it possible every day .
Oh , and the final question of the Kaiser survey :
Do you think other cities should create programs like Healthy SF , or not ?
92 % Yes , 6 % Do n't Know , 2 % No ( well there are a few Republicans left in SF ) .
So at your next health care discussion or town hall meeting , ask this simple question :
San Francisco has a Public Option right now that 94 % of the participants are satisfied with .
It costs half what normal insurance costs , includes pre-existing conditions and no deductibles .
Why ca n't we have a Public Option like this also ?
NOW LET'S GO MAKE PUBLIC OPTION HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE !!!
Second diary - and Rec Listed - THANKS !
It just says to me how much we really need the Public Option .

HOLLYWOOD has made at least half a dozen films based on Mary Shelley 's gothic masterpiece — mindless travesties all of them , even the Kenneth Branagh version released in 1994 .
That is a pity because the parable of the Genevan protagonist , Victor Frankenstein , deserves wider appreciation , especially among those concerned about technology getting out of control .
In the actual story , there is no crazed assistant , no criminal brain stolen from a grave , no violent rampage , and no angry mob hunting down and killing the monster .
Instead , the rejected creation pleads to be accepted , and cared for , by its creator and tries hard to fit in with society .
Yes , there is violence and revenge — it would n't be a gothic novel without them .
In the end , however , the autonomous being departs to commit suicide after its creator dies of disease .

Out of control ?
What makes the tale such an enduring classic are the moral questions it raises about creation , responsibility and unintended consequences .
The lessons are as relevant in today 's world of autonomous technology — whether driverless vehicles or surgical robots — as they were in 1818 when the melodrama first scared the daylights out of Georgian England .
Whether consciously or not , the Royal Academy of Engineering in Britain seems lately to have taken Shelley 's fable to heart .
In a report published last week , the academy urges opinion - formers to start thinking seriously about the implications of autonomous technology — machinery that can act independently by replicating human behaviour .
The intention is to have such machines do the sort of jobs people find dull , dirty or dangerous .
Many such systems either already exist or are closer to reality than is generally realised .
And right now , the ethical , let alone the legal , framework for dealing with any untoward consequences of their actions simply does not exist .
The academy looked at two areas of the technology that are expanding fast : autonomous transport and automated help around the home for the elderly .
Within ten years , driverless vehicles that use lasers and radars to sense their surroundings will be able to thread their way through traffic .
They are already widespread in controlled environments such as warehouses , airports and mines .
Whether they will be seen on the public highways is not a technological issue , but a political and legal matter .
With their digital controllers programmed to obey the highway code , driverless trucks will be far safer and more predictable than human - operated vehicles .
They wo n't suddenly pull out in front of you , or refuse to give way when they should .
But if a mechanical failure or software glitch should ever cause a driverless truck to collide with a car , who would be legally responsible — the truck company , the manufacturer , the systems engineer ?
( Under today 's product - liability law , the motorist would doubtless get off scot - free , even if the accident was his fault . )
There are similar concerns about automatons designed to watch over the elderly .
Systems exist to check when people are awake , whether they have taken their medication , and what their vital signs are .
Privacy issues aside , such aids are to be welcomed for their greater good .
But once sensor data can be used to tell people with dementia what to do and what not to do , the potential for abuse can become real .
The benefits of such patient - monitoring in the home may be that the individual wanders around less , suffers less incontinence and sleeps better .
But can even the most responsible of families and carers be trusted to supervise such technology day in and day out for years on end , to stop accidents happening ?
The answer may be not more technology , but better social engineering .
For sure , people have barely begun to think about such issues .
In 2006 , a survey by Elon University and the Pew Internet Project in America asked some 742 technology experts and social critics whether autonomous machines would leave humans out of the loop .
Slightly over half thought people would not lose control , but not all that many fewer felt they might .
Respondents were invited to give their views .
A recurring theme was that “ technology beyond our control ” was rather alarmist .
The history of applying automation to human tasks ( telephone operators , for instance ) had not left people unduly at the mercy of autonomous contraptions .
Defying Shelley 's prognostication , many respondents felt few technologies live beyond the control of their creators : everything has a “ choke point ” of one sort or another — built in , often subconsciously , for reasons of convenience , safety or mistake .
That was three years ago , when few were probably aware of how quickly a technology known as “ evolvable hardware ” was emerging from the shadows .
Like the “ brute - force ” methods standard in code - cracking and computer chess , evolvable machines try billions of different possibilities .
But the difference is that they continually crop and refine their trial - and - error solutions — mimicking the way natural selection works in the wild .
How soon before evolvable machines become cleverer than people ?
Little over a decade is the current consensus .
One such machine has already been awarded a patent for something it quietly invented on its own .
The temptation to surrender control to machines that are smarter , more vigilant and less prone to boredom , irritation and emotional outbursts than people will be overwhelming .
People will do so for reasons of comfort , convenience , safety and cost .
So , what happens when a one - in - a - billion bug causes the software to crash , or the safety valves are not operated properly ?
That is what happened at Three Mile Island in 1979 .
Though the nuclear power station was not an autonomous system , it was running automatically with its human controllers outside the loop .
When things went horribly wrong , inexperienced operators tried desperately to take command , only to make one compounding mistake after another — turning a control system with good negative feedback into a positive , runaway disaster .
Though now dated , Langdon Winner 's oft - cited book “ Autonomous Technology ” ( MIT Press , 1977 ) was one of the first to call attention to the way the complexity of big systems can lead to loss of control and disaster .
That was two years before the explosion at Three Mile Island .
Dr Winner was also one of the first to note that Frankenstein 's invention represented a giant leap in the capability of a certain kind of technology .
Yet , it was sent it out into the world with no concern for how best to include it in the community .
When the creature returned as an autonomous force with demands that it insisted were met , its creator was unable to find a way to repair the damage done by his imperfect invention .
Shelley 's story may have been the first to show how good intentions behind technological inventions can go awry .
It surely wo n't be the last .
I want to talk about race and sex in the atheist movement .
I 'm writing this because of the recent kerfuffle in the skeptical community , in which Carrie Iwan and Rebecca Watson of the Skepchick blog did a podcast interview about sexism at The Amazing Meeting ( and about sexist remarks made at that meeting by " The Big Bang Theory " creator Bill Prady ) ... and were met with a barrage of hostile comments over the suggestion that the skeptical community might not always be the most welcoming place for women , and that maybe skeptics should be doing something about it .
( Comments arguing , among other things , that women who complain about sexism in the skeptical movement are just being whiny , unreasonable , and politically correct . )
And I 'm writing this because of the interview I ran here in this blog with Sikivu Hutchinson , on being an African - American in the atheist movement ... in which a surprising number of commenters reacted very strongly , and very negatively , to the idea that maybe there was a problem with the fact that the atheist movement is so predominantly and visibly made up of white men , and that maybe the movement should be doing something about it .
I want to talk about the fact that the atheist movement is so predominantly , and so visibly , made up of white men .
I want to talk about why this is a problem .
I want to talk about how this problem plays out , and how it perpetuates itself .
And I want to talk about why we need to do something about it .
Now , I do n't want to get deeply into overt racism and sexism in the atheist movement .
( Not today , anyway .
I may get into that in some later post . )
For the purposes of this post , I 'm going to assume that , when it comes to gender and race , everyone in the atheist movement is completely well - meaning , and has every conscious intention to not be sexist or racist .
( I do n't actually believe that ... but for the purposes of this post , I think it will be a useful assumption . )
Instead , I want to talk about why it 's important for the atheist movement to start paying attention -- now -- to race and gender .
I want to talk about why it 's important for the atheist movement to start paying attention -- now -- to the fact that it is largely a white male movement ... and to how that 's likely to affect the future of the movement , for everyone in it .
I want to talk about into how , exactly , a movement that starts out being mostly white and mostly male , with mostly white men in positions of visibility and leadership , has a tendency to stay that way ... even with the best intentions of everyone in that movement .
And I want to talk about why this matters : why it 's a serious problem , why it 's going to matter more and more as our movement grows ... and why it 's important to nip the problem in the bud , early , while our movement is still relatively young .
*
First , let 's talk about how this happens .
Let 's talk about three distinct ways that racial and gender imbalances in a movement can perpetuate themselves ... even if there is absolutely zero conscious intention to discriminate .
( BTW , these apply to other marginalized groups as well ; but race and gender are what 's on the table right now , so that 's what I 'm focusing on .
And yes , I know there are more than just these three ways .
These are just the big , obvious ones that I 'm familiar with .
Comments about others are very much welcomed . )
1 : Unconscious bias .
Even with the best of conscious intentions , people tend to be more comfortable , and more trusting , with people who are more like them .
This has been well and thoroughly documented .
It 's one of the most important reasons behind affirmative action : people in charge of hiring decisions will automatically gravitate towards people who are more like them .
So if the people doing the hiring are white men , they 're more likely to hire white men ... and then as the people they hire rise to positions of power , they in turn will be more likely to hire white men ... and so on , and so on , and so on .
If there is no conscious , deliberate attempt to seek out qualified women , people of color , etc. , this process will perpetuate itself indefinitely .
This is n't just true in hiring .
It 's true in any community , and any movement .
If a movement starts out being mostly made up of and led by white men , and there is no conscious , pro-active attempt to seek out and welcome women and people of color , then that movement will have a very strong tendency to continue being dominated by white men .
What 's more , people can have racist or sexist attitudes without being conscious of them .
You do n't need to be a torch - wielding member of the KKK or Operation Rescue to say and think dumb things about race or gender .
( As someone who has said and thought plenty of dumb things ... believe me , I speak from experience . )
A lot of racism and sexism is n't grossly overt : it 's subtle , and it 's woven so deeply into the fabric of our culture that we often are n't aware of it until it 's called to our attention .
But you can be damn well sure that the people on the receiving end of those attitudes are aware of it ... and it can put them off from participating in a community that they might otherwise be drawn to .
2 : Focus .
People have a natural tendency to focus on the issues that concern them most directly .
And if a movement -- however unintentionally -- is being dominated by white men , then that movement will tend to focus its energies on issues that concern white men ... at the expense of issues that concern women and people of color .
You want an example ?
Sure .
As just one specific example , I 'll cite the tendency of the atheist movement to provide an Internet community more than in - the- flesh communities ... a tendency that ignores the powerful social bond that churches provide in the African - American communities , and that neglects the alienation and isolation that many African - American atheists feel when they leave their churches , and that fails to offer a replacement .
3 : Self - fulfilling prophecies .
Let 's pretend , just for a moment , that # 1 and # 2 are n't happening at all .
Let 's pretend that there is no tendency , not even an unconscious one , for the leaders and organizers of the atheist movement to default to white men in citations and event organization and so on .
Let 's pretend that there are no racist or sexist attitudes in the atheist movement -- not even subtle or unconscious ones .
And let 's pretend that there is no tendency in the atheist movement , not even an unconscious one , to focus on issues that largely concern white men , at the expense of issues that largely concern women and people of color .
Let 's pretend that none of that is happening .
Let 's pretend that the atheist movement is largely and most visibly white and male , either because most women and people of color just naturally are n't that interested in atheism , or because of pure dumb random luck .
Even if that were so ?
The tendency of the atheist movement to be dominated by white men would still tend to perpetuate itself .
Remember what we talked about before .
People are more comfortable with other people who are like them .
And that is n't just true for white men .
It 's true for women and people of color , too .
If a movement is largely made up of white men , and if the leaders and most visible representatives of a movement are mostly white men ... women and people of color just are n't as likely to join up .
They -- we -- are more likely to feel like fish out of water .
We 're less likely to see the movement as having to do with us .
And maybe more to the point :
If a community is mostly white and male , a lot of women and people of color are going to assume that # 1 and # 2 are probably going on .
I know that I 'm less comfortable going to an event that 's mostly male ... since the chances of having my femaleness be inappropriately sexualized are a lot greater .
Women and people of color are naturally , and not unreasonably , going to be cautious about joining up with a movement that 's mostly white and male .
We 're going to wonder why that is .
So even if the predominant whiteness and maleness of the atheist movement had somehow happened purely by accident , with no sins of either omission or commission on the part of white male atheists ... the predominant whiteness and maleness of the movement would still tend towards a cycle of self - fulfilling prophecy .
Even if those hypothetical winds of fate that innocently led the movement to be largely white and largely male were no longer blowing in that direction , even if women and people of color suddenly sprouted an interest in atheism that they 'd somehow never had before ... this self - perpetuating tendency of largely white male movements to stay largely white and male would still tend to , well , perpetuate itself .
Plus , of course , all this is assuming that there is no overt racism or sexism in the atheist movement .
An assumption that , obviously , is n't warranted .
*
So that 's some of the ways that largely white , largely male movements stay largely white and male ... even if nobody intended it to happen that way .
But here 's the good news :
A lot of this is fixable .
Or at least , it 's addressable .
And it 's much , much easier to address in the early stages of a movement than it is down the line , after patterns have been established , and bad feelings have had time to fester .
So how do we fix it ?
And why should we care ?
That 's Part 2 .
( The second half of this piece will appear tomorrow .
I 'm not going to turn off comments , but if you can hold off on commenting until Part 2 appears , I 'd be much obliged . )
In the last couple of ( or even more :) days Yuval and I have been endlessly discussing what the asynchronous response API would look like in PSGI applications .
And that was also becoming one of the most frequently asked questions on my side , since many people from AnyEvent , POE and perlbal ( Danga : : Socket ) land are curious how to port their non-blocking application to let them run on PSGI servers .
Thursday while having frodwith on board in the discussion ( that was really helpful since he has a third person view as a POE developer ) and we sorted out the nicely done middle ground , which is actually the revive of our original start_response callback we abandoned in favor of IO : : Writer - like abstraction .
So , basically the idea is the same as the original Python WSGI 's start_response but this callback is NOT an optional parameter to the app because that stands in the way of everybody in the chain including middleware and that sucks .
Instead , an app can optionally return a callback that accepts another callback to which you can return the response array ref ( code , headers and body ) if you want to delay your response .
my $ app = sub { my $env = shift ; return sub { my $ respond = shift ; # do some event stuff $ event -> callback ( sub { $ respod - > ( [ $ code , $ headers , $ body ] ) } ) ; } ; } ;
If you also want to delay the content body delivery as well ( i.e. streaming ) you can omit the body , in which case you 'll get the writer object that has write ( ) , close ( ) and poll_cb ( ) .
my $ app = sub { my $env = shift ; return sub { my $ respond = shift ; my $w = $ respond - > ( [ 200 , [ ' Content - Type ' => ' text / plain ' ] ] ) ; # no $ body here # do more event stuff $ event -> callback ( sub { $ w - > write ( $ body ) } ) ; $ event->done_callback ( sub { $ w - > close } ) ; } ; } ;
I plan to update the PSGI specification to address this optional response style in a few days .
Yuval also has a nicely summarized blog post on this , and we already added this callback style to our AnyEvent , Danga : : Socket , Coro and POE backend as well as most middlewares , including automatic chunking middleware ( supposedly used by servers , not apps ) which I line - by - line cloned from Rack :)
Meanwhile Yuval is working on his data - pimping REST machine Hydrant and I 've been working on Real - Time - optimized web framework Tatsumaki , and both will be built on top of PSGI / Plack from the ground up .
This will definitely be how web frameworks in Perl would look like in 2010 .
Friday night I was at my friend 's party and five people talked to me how awesome Plack is and it's changing the world .
( Disclosure : it was a party full of my Six Apart co-workers and alumni like Artur , Randy and Simon , so that 's not that surprising :) )
Australian government environmental committee report warns that thousands of miles of coastline are under threat from rising sea levels and suggests banning people from living in vulnerable areas
Beach culture is as much part of the Australian identity as the bush and barbecues , but that could have to change according to a government report that raises the unsettling prospect of banning its citizens from coastal regions at risk of rising seas .
The report , from a parliamentary climate change committee , said that AUS $ 150bn ( £ 84bn ) worth of property was at risk from rising sea levels and more frequent storms .
With 80 % of Australians living along the coastline , the report warns that " the time to act is now ' ' .
Australia has no national coastal plan despite the prospect of losing large swaths of coastal land as each centimetre rise in sea levels is expected to carve a metre or more off the shoreline .
If sea levels rise 80 cm by 2100 , some 711,000 homes , businesses and properties , which sit less than 6 m above sea level and lie within 3 km of the coast , will be vulnerable to flooding , erosion , high tides and surging storms .
It argues that Australia needs a national policy to respond to sea level rise brought on by global warming , which could see people forced to abandon homes and banned from building at the beachside , according to the committee on climate change , water , environment and the arts .
The prime minister , Kevin Rudd , said the report was a reminder that " Australia has more to lose through continued inaction on climate change " than most other countries .
" The real cost for Australia of continued inaction on climate change is deep and enduring and damaging to our economy and damaging to the nation 's environment , " Rudd said .
Skirmishes between residents and local councils are already erupting up and down the coast over erosion by the sea .
On the far north coast of New South Wales , the state government has intervened to allow residents in the Byron shire council to build seal walls to protect their homes from rising sea levels .
A similar battle is being waged further south at Taree .
Meanwhile insurance companies are refusing to insure properties in seaside towns .
Among the report's 47 recommendations are that the government could consider " forced retreats " , and prohibiting the " continued occupation of the land or future building development on the property due to sea hazard " .
Some members of the conservative Liberal - National party coalition , which voted down the Rudd government 's carbon emissions trading scheme earlier this year , remain sceptical that a problem exists .
Liberal MP
Tony Abbott , a senior member of the coalition and leadership contender , said there was no reason for alarm .
" When it comes to rising sea levels I 'm alert but I can't say that I 'm particularly alarmed .
The fact is that sea levels have risen along the NSW coast by more than 20cm over the last century .
Has anyone noticed it ?
No they have n't .
Obviously an 80 cm rise in sea levels would be more serious but I 'm confident that we have the resources to cope , " Abbott told ABC news .
How much sea level could rise this century with increasing temperatures is an open question .
The much - quoted 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said it could be up to 59 cm , though warned that higher increases could not be ruled out .
The IPCC said not enough was known about the way ice sheets break up to put a reliable figure on their contribution .
Some estimates predict a 1 - 2 m rise by 2100 .
The Australian government report , Managing Our Coastal Zone in a Changing Climate , followed an 18 - month enquiry .
It said the country 's current coastal management policy is fragmented , and authorities need to adopt a national policy to coordinate new coastal building codes and relocation and evacuation plans .
Australia must examine the legal liability and insurance cover associated with property loss and damage due to climate change , improved early warning systems for extreme seas , and work to prevent the spread of tropical diseases such as dengue fever , it added .
" The key message that emerged from the inquiry is the need for national leadership in managing Australia 's coastal zone in the context of climate change , " Jennie George , a government MP and committee chair , said in launching the report on Tuesday .
" This is an issue of national significance . "
The sub-tropical state of Queensland was the most at risk , with almost 250,000 buildings vulnerable .
Next was the most populous state , New South Wales ( NSW ) , with more than 200,000 .
Coastal flooding and erosion already costs NSW around AUS $ 200 m ( £ 112 m ) a year .
The report called for a national policy which could see government authorities prohibit occupation of land or future building development on property due to sea hazards .
It called for building codes , including cyclone building codes , to be revised to increase resilience to climate change .
Alan Stokes , the executive director of the Sydney - based National Seachange taskforce , which represents coastal community councils across Australia , says banning development in certain areas is necessary .
" There 's no doubt Australia will remain and continue to be a coastal community , " he said .
" But we may have to be a bit more considerate about which parts of the coast we develop further and which ones we do n't . "
Did Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's office use a coded veto message to send the f-bomb to Tom Ammiano , soon after the San Francisco assemblyman made news by telling the governor to " kiss my gay ass " ?
Schwarzenegger 's people say no .
But the X - rated evidence is hard to miss in a message that Schwarzenegger sent to explain why he was vetoing an Ammiano bill dealing with financing for the Port of San Francisco .
A straight reading of the guv's letter laments " the fact that major issues are overlooked while many unnecessary bills come to me for consideration , " and concludes , " I believe it is unnecessary to sign this measure at this time . "
But a vertical read of the far - left - hand letters in each of the missive 's eight lines offers a more blunt explanation : " I f- you . "
Schwarzenegger 's press secretary , Aaron McLear , insisted Tuesday it was simply a " weird coincidence . "
He sent us veto messages the governor sent out in the past with linguistic lineups such as " soap " and " poet , " which he said were also unintended .
" Something like this was bound to happen , " McLear said .
Maybe .
But the veto message came after Ammiano called the governor a liar and shouted from the audience to " kiss my gay ass " when Schwarzenegger unexpectedly showed up at a Democratic Party dinner in San Francisco on Oct.
7 .
Ammiano later called Schwarzenegger 's attendance at the event a " cheap publicity stunt " that was n't at all amusing , in light of the governor 's cuts in social services , ordered furloughs of state workers and failure to act on some gay - rights issues .
The governor 's veto letter was in response to Ammiano 's AB1176 - a rather mundane bill meant to help San Francisco 's port with finance issues .
The " coincidence " was first picked up on Tuesday by the Bay Guardian newspaper .
As for Ammiano , a professional comic in addition to being a liberal Democrat , he 's playing it straight on this one : " They probably think they are even now , " he said .
" I think it was very creative , and it's time to bury the hatchet , " Ammiano added .
" I 'm not interested in prolonging it . "
The hidden message - if that 's what it was - " was certainly more subtle than ' kiss my gay ass , ' " said Barbara O'Connor , political science professor at Sacramento State University .
" But it shows the acrimony and bad feelings in Sacramento are pretty bad .
" I doubt if it was the governor himself , " O'Connor said .
" But maybe the staff was having a good time . "

US writer Edgar Allan
Poe has been honoured with a second funeral service , 160 years after his death .
Many fans of the author gathered in Baltimore for the commemoration , which also saw a replica casket pass through the city to his original burial ground .
Hundreds acted as mourners dressed in period costume at the service in Westminster Hall .
Poe died penniless at the age of 40 in 1849 , and only a handful of people attended his original funeral .
The original service is said to have lasted only three minutes , while the news of his death was not announced to the world .
Poe 's replica casket , which contained a mannequin of the writer 's body , had been visited by many fans leading up to the funeral .
His packed - out service - which took place twice to deal with demand - contained various musical performances and eulogies which did not take place the first time around .
The send - off was one of various events to mark the 200th anniversary of Edgar Allen Poe 's birth .
Poe - credited as the inventor of the detective story and creator of horror writing - is one of the most influential American writers ever .
His tombstone was destroyed and a scathing obituary , written by literary adversary Rufus Wilmot Griswold , damaged his reputation for decades .
For many years , the anniversary of his birth has been marked by the so - called Poe Toaster , a mysterious visitor who leaves three roses and some cognac on his tombstone .

young earth creationists vs. the big bang
Young Earth creationists demand scientists produce the " missing antimatter " from the Big Bang or scrap the theory altogether .
When writing articles for Answers In Genesis magazines , those seemingly bottomless pools of anti-scientific pseudo - profundities and woefully ignorant gotcha pieces ran by Ken Ham , not even basic logic seems to be allowed .
How else could you explain this article tackling the issue of matter / antimatter disparity predicted to have occurred after the Big Bang ?
After misrepresenting one of theory ’s claims , correcting himself by quoting actual scientists and explaining what would ’ve happened to the initial wealth of antimatter created by the blast , the author still demands that cosmologists produce the missing antimatter or admit that the theory is a bust .
Yes , let ’s junk the best theory for the appearance of the known universe because some hack working for the guy who thinks that The Flintstones was a documentary can’t wrap his mind around something as simple as explosive reactions and having more of one type of matter than another .
Unlike Michael Oard claims , the Big Bang theory does n’t predict equal amounts of matter and antimatter being created during the event .
Instead , it just says that antimatter would be created out of the insanely hot quark - gluon plasma spat out after the initial blast .
Any of the slightest imperfections in the flow of this bizarre state of matter could create an imbalance of these two types of matter .
When these opposites started annihilating each other with 100 % efficiency , matter was slightly more abundant and hence , it persists .
As a result , we live in a universe of matter .
But wait , how could there be just a slight surplus of matter if almost everything we know and see is made of it ?
On a macroscopic scale , matter only makes up around 4 % of the visible universe .
What may seem like a vast and endless amount to us is actually not much at all .
The missing antimatter is n’t missing .
It was destroyed in the primordial matter / antimatter interactions and therefore , to produce it to Oard ’s satisfaction would be sort of like bringing a corpse back to life and having it testify that it did indeed die .
I know that in the end of the day , the goal is to advance AiG ’s apologetics .
Yet challenging modern science with such simplistic , illogical bits utterly devoid of even the slightest attempts at finesse or putting two and two together , is downright embarrassing .
I do n’t know what kind of denial it takes to rationalize and ignore this kind of behavior , but I ’m willing to bet that most fellows working for a high brow apoplogetics foundations consider Ham and his lackeys overconfident loudmouths who give their cause a bad name .

Everything From Here to There
October 29 , 2009
If you follow some of the links I have been supplying as of late , you ’ll notice many are focused on the propaganda build up to our day of reckoning with the Swine Flu virus .
I say ‘ propaganda ’ because , in my heart , there is something mighty suspicious about declaring an emergency for something that has yet to show itself to be a grand pandemic .
Our American President Obama has declared a national emergency about this virus , which he in his own words said was , at this point , a preventative measure .
So , why declare an emergency if there is n’t one ?
I am not a doctor , and I am in no way suggesting that you should follow any medical advice from me .
What you do with your body , what you put into it , who you allow to love it or hate on it , is your business .
I am more focused on the vibration that has us all so fearful : both for how the fear affects our thinking , and how , in our fear , we attract the worst , and , in conjunction with that , how those fears are used by others without integrity to try to create a power against Us to promote discomfort and dis-ease .
I have friends that have gotten the swine flu .
All of them told me they felt very , very sick , and that it was awful .
So I ’m not in any way suggesting that the H1N1 virus is not real .
I would suggest however that it is possible the virus is not a naturally occurring virus .
I have read reports from people who say ( as doctors ) that there is evidence to suggest this virus was created by man ; to call it Swine Flu is then a misnomer , as it really is Swine Flu plus some other stuff stitched together .
These doctors said such genetic mutation was impossible in nature .
[ efoods ]
So you have a situation here where you can examine your own Mind - Body - Soul power staring in the face of Death itself .
Assume this flu is the worst thing to ever hit this planet , worse than the beubonic plague of the Middle Ages , or worse than any war ever conjured up .
Evil itself has come to wreak havoc on the planet .
Assume , for the sake of argument , it is The End .
Well , where does that leave you ?
Do you quit work ?
Do you run away ?
Do you stand still and hope Death walks past you ?
I for one will not be taking the vaccine .
I do not trust those who make the vaccines , or the apperatus behind it all to push it on us thru fear .
This is not judgment ; it is a personal decision based on research , intuition , conversations with my doctor and my ‘ family ’ .
If the virus comes to take me Home , that is between me and the Lord .
I have put up some of these links to inspire the question in you , so that perhaps you can make a better decision for yourself .
That is what holistic life is about : a willingness to look at all the facts or opinions .
I am willing to question anything : the existence of God , the existence of me or you or Robert Zimmerman .
I am willing to wonder aloud whether any of this we experience here on Earth is real .
What is there to be afraid of in questioning life itself ?
I know God is not afraid of my doubt .
That is why He gave me the faculty to doubt , to overcome its mystique to better know faith .
If the propaganda machine kicked into overdrive about kindness , manners , working together , human ingenuity , and grace , then maybe I would view its function differently .
But its current function is to maim and distort the truth , not to enlighten .
How do I know this ?
Because it has fear attached to it , because it uses fear to move energy .
Anything connected to fear is definitely not connected to Love or the promotion of Love .
Scaring the daylights out of you over a virus or an unseen enemy only weakens us .
Calm , open debate , and logical thought drive strength to its maximum effectiveness .
The system works broken , because it is to the system ’s advantage to do so .

The DOB is more like the MOB , according to shocking new revelations reported today .
At least six inspectors with the city 's Department of Buildings have been videotaped taking bribes at construction sites , and some were seen dealing cocaine and prescription pills , according to the New York Post .
The workers , some of whom allegedly have ties to the Luchese crime family , will be arrested later this month , along with about two dozen mafioso , sources told the Post .
" This is going to be big , " their source said .
The forthcoming arrests are the result of a two - year probe which spawned a 2007 New Jersey case involving a Luchese squad that ran a $ 2 billion - a - year gambling ring and supplied drugs and cellphones to Bloods members in state prisons , according to the Post .
As the investigation sprawled across the Hudson , probers began following buildings inspectors and captured crooked workers taking $ 50 and $ 100 payoffs to ignore violations .
Then , even more shocking , several inspectors reportedly were videotaped selling OxyContin , Vicodin and cocaine while on duty .
Two inspectors are now allegedly cooperating with the investigation , sources told the Post .
As of last week , none of the inspectors under investigation are still employed with the Buildings Department , according to a statement released by Commissioner Robert Limandri .
“ The allegations are disgraceful and do not reflect the diligent work of employees at the Department of Buildings .
Our inspectors are entrusted to protect the public from unsafe building conditions , and it appears that these inspectors betrayed that trust , " Limandri said in the statement .
" In June , the Department began re-inspections of all buildings associated with the inspectors in question , including visiting every site , and we expect to complete that process soon . "
Limandri also noted that the DOB recently launched a new program last month that would track the location of every inspector with global - positioning systems .
While the GPS would n't specifically prevent the kind of corruption that is alleged to have occurred in this latest case , Limandry said they " expect this new tracking system will act as a deterrent and hold inspectors accountable for their work . "
This is one of those Asian dishes that is so simple , fast and easy to make that you ca n’t believe what a punch it packs .
Each bite starts with the crisp crunch of summer , followed by the clean tang of rice vinegar , and finishing with a spicy kick like a taekwando match in your mouth .
As your mouth soaks in the burn , you quickly take another bite to cool it off and experience it all over again .
Yeah , it ’s that awesome , with only a few ingredients .
It only takes about two minutes to make and is perfect as a side salad , or a slaw on top of Korean BBQ , and I love bringing it to parties because people freak out about it being zucchini “ noodles ” .
If you do n’t want it as spicy , use less red pepper flakes or skip them all together .
Oh , and if you like this recipe , you have to try the dressing with grilled cucumber , so crazy !
Asian Zucchini Noodle Salad
serves 4 as side
Ingredients
1 large zucchini
2 TBS rice vinegar
1/2 tsp sesame oil
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes ( or less for less spicy )
1/2 tsp sugar

DALLAS , Texas ( CNN ) --
A terrorism suspect accused of plotting the bombing of a skyscraper made his first appearance in federal court Friday .
Hosam Maher Husein Smadi said through his lawyer that he understood the charges Friday .
Hosam Maher Husein Smadi , a 19 - year - old Jordanian , said little during a 20 - minute hearing at the Dallas federal courthouse .
His lawyer , however , said Smadi understood the gravity of the charge .
Judge Irma Ramirez set a probable cause hearing for October 5 .
Smadi initially drew authorities ' scrutiny because of his violent posts on an extremist chat site , court papers indicate .
He was arrested Thursday in a sting operation , the FBI said .
Federal officials said Smadi , who entered the United States illegally and lived in Texas , tried to set off an explosive attached to a vehicle at the base of the 60 - story Fountain Place office tower .
Long before authorities arrested Smadi , however , they were following his Internet discussions , according to a court affidavit .
" Smadi was discovered by the FBI within an online group of extremists , " the affidavit says .
" Among many others in the group who espoused and endorsed violence , Smadi stood out based on his vehement intention to actually conduct terror attacks in the United States . "
Undercover officers then contacted Smadi , posing as members of an al Qaeda sleeper cell .
After months of conversations , the agents considered Smadi a legitimate threat .
Smadi picked several targets to attack , including the Dallas - Forth Worth airport , before deciding on the skyscraper , which houses Wells Fargo Bank , the affidavit says .
It details a conversation that Smadi is said to have had with authorities :
" I have decided to change the target , " he said , according to the affidavit .
" God willing , the strike will be certain and strong .
It will shake the currently weak economy in the state and the American nation , because this bank is one of the largest banks in the city . "
Smadi said many times that he wanted to commit violent jihad and he was a soldier of Osama bin Laden , the affidavit says .
Undercover agents tried to get Smadi to " re-evaluate his interpretation of jihad , " saying there were nonviolent ways to commit the act .
But " Smadi again communicated his continuing commitment for violent jihad , " the affidavit says .
After casing the bank in July , Smadi told an undercover agent he would target it , according to authorities .
Initially , Smadi told the agent he wanted to bomb the bank on September 11 but decided to wait until the Islamic holy month of Ramadan ended on September 20 , authorities said .
After receiving what he thought was an explosive from an undercover agent , Smadi drove a car with the fake bomb into a parking garage under the skyscraper , authorities said .
Watch how a Jordanian was given fake explosive »
Smadi thought he could detonate the bomb by dialing his cell phone , they said .
When he dialed , the number rang a phone in authorities ' possession , the affidavit says .
Counterterrorism officials arrested Smadi on Thursday before publicly disclosing a similar but unrelated terrorism sting arrest Wednesday in Springfield , Illinois .
A federal law enforcement official familiar with the cases said authorities feared that word of the Illinois arrest could tip off the Texas suspect to the sting operation .
Watch what the recent terror arrests mean »
A charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction carries a potential sentence of life in prison and a $ 250,000 fine .
In the Illinois case , undercover FBI agents foiled a plot to bomb Springfield 's federal building , authorities said .
In neither case did authorities find ties to known terrorist groups .
Journalist Todd Bensman and CNN's Jeanne Meserve , Sean Callebs and Terry Frieden contributed to this report .
All About Terrorism • Dallas ( Texas )
FSF has now filed an amicus brief in Bilski , and they too ask the Supreme Court " to affirm that software ideas are not patentable " : End Software Patents ( ESP ) executive director Ciaran O'Riordan explained , " Every software patent is a restriction on software developers and users of computers , and there are currently 200,000 software patents in the USA .
As well as being an unjust restriction on a common household tool , time has now also proven software patents to be an economic failure and a hindrance to the progress of the useful arts .
This means they 've failed their constitutional mandate and have no legal legitimacy .
The Supreme Court has itself never authorized the patenting of software ideas , so there 's real hope that this problem can finally be solved . "
Here 's the press release .
I wonder if this is the first amicus brief ever filed with the US Supreme Court prepared on a wiki ?
From the press release : O'Riordan credited the swpat.org wiki contributors for their help , saying , " Much of the material for this brief came from our publicly editable wiki at swpat.org .
For each point we decided to make , we used the wiki to find references and quotes and further information -- and I hope other brief drafters found it useful too .
Contributing to this resource is a great way for people to get involved in the campaign -- the Bilski case will continue for months , and there is still much work to be done to eliminate software patents worldwide . "
The brief is the best so far at explaining why the country should care about the negative impact patents are having on FOSS , why the Supreme Court should care about GPL software such as GNU / Linux systems and the many applications that are available .
Here 's one reason :
Free software , specifically software distributed under the GNU GPL , is also used heavily by the government of the United States .
A 2003 report commissioned by the Department of Defense ( DOD ) , entitled  Use of Free and Open Source Software ( FOSS ) in the U.S. Department of Defense ( DOD Report ) credits Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation directly .
The DOD Report shows that roughly 50 % of all of the FLOSS used at the DOD is licensed under the GNU GPL , and evaluates what a possible world within the DOD without this software would look like , stating :
The main conclusion of the analysis was that FOSS software plays a more critical role in the DoD than has generally been recognized .
FOSS applications are most important in four broad areas : Infrastructure Support , Software Development , Security , and Research .
One unexpected result was the degree to which Security depends on FOSS .
Banning FOSS would remove certain types of infrastructure components ( e.g. , OpenBSD ) that currently help support network security .
It would also limit DoD access to - and overall expertise in - the use of powerful FOSS analysis and detection applications that hostile groups could use to help stage cyberattacks .
Finally , it would remove the demonstrated ability of FOSS applications to be updated rapidly in response to new types of cyberattack .
Taken together , these factors imply that banning FOSS would have immediate , broad , and strongly negative impacts on the ability of many sensitive and security - focused DoD groups to defend against cyberattacks .9
In addition , NASA has also recognized the importance of free software by creating its own repository of freely licensed works .
10
While the military and other divisions of government may not have to worry directly about their own use of patents , the DOD Report shows that their operation depends on the continued development worldwide of the kind of free software they use today  the kind of free software facilitated by the Foundation .
It 's really an interesting read .
Here 's the press release , followed by the brief : ***************************************
FSF files brief in Bilski case calling on the Supreme Court to eliminate software patents The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) today submitted an amicus curiae brief calling on the Supreme Court to affirm that software ideas are not patentable .
After outlining the positive impact that the free software movement and the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL ) have had on computer use , the brief explains how software patents are an obstacle and a danger to software developers .
FSF founder Richard Stallman and the free software movement have been campaigning worldwide against software patents since the late 1980s , but the effort in the United States is coming to a head with the Supreme Court now reviewing patentable scope for the first time since 1981 's Diamond v. Diehr case .
End Software Patents ( ESP ) executive director Ciaran O'Riordan explained , " Every software patent is a restriction on software developers and users of computers , and there are currently 200,000 software patents in the USA .
As well as being an unjust restriction on a common household tool , time has now also proven software patents to be an economic failure and a hindrance to the progress of the useful arts .
This means they 've failed their constitutional mandate and have no legal legitimacy .
The Supreme Court has itself never authorized the patenting of software ideas , so there 's real hope that this problem can finally be solved . "
O'Riordan credited the swpat.org wiki contributors for their help , saying , " Much of the material for this brief came from our publicly editable wiki at swpat.org .
For each point we decided to make , we used the wiki to find references and quotes and further information -- and I hope other brief drafters found it useful too .
Contributing to this resource is a great way for people to get involved in the campaign -- the Bilski case will continue for months , and there is still much work to be done to eliminate software patents worldwide . "
The 44 - page brief further details the commonly noted outrageous risks and expenses imposed by patents , which leave individuals and small projects particularly vulnerable , but also highlights the deeper injustices : " This inability to participate on an even basis amplifies the problem , but there is also a deeper problem : losing control of ones computing in his or her daily life .
Because individuals can write software , they can help themselves and solve their own problems .
Given that software development includes common activities such as making a webpage , the freedom to use a computer as you see fit for your daily life is a fundamental form of expression , just as using a pen and paper is .
...
In the context of writing an email reader , a word processor , or an image viewer , being blocked from reading , modifying , or writing in the required data format is equivalent to being banned from writing a functional program for that task . "
In April of 2008 , FSF worked with the End Software Patents ( ESP ) campaign to file an amicus curiae brief in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's ( CAFC ) hearing of the in re Bilski case .
In October 2008 , the CAFC issued its ruling , which gutted patents on program ideas running on general - purpose computers .
In June of this year , the Supreme Court decided to review the case .

INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 The Free Software Foundation ( Foundation ) , founded in October 1985 , pioneered a movement of information exchange that initially had significant impact on software development practices , but later also inspired changes in broader fields of great public benefit .
In addition to having been a major developer in the field of software , it provides via its legal , technical , and administrative infrastructure an umbrella for further software development by other programmers around the world .
As an important part of this worldwide free software movement , the Foundation has been both an inspiration for , and a close observer of , related social movements and organizations promoting legal sharing of innovative knowledge and cultural works in a variety of fields .
The Foundations mission is focused on free software , 2 which gives all users the freedoms to study , copy , modify , and redistribute their own changed versions .
The Foundation supports free software development directly in three main ways .
First , through its GNU Project , launched in 1983 by the Foundations creator to provide a fully free and functional operating system , it has provided necessary services like project hosting , development servers , network bandwidth , legal support , and funding for programmers .
Second , it provides a set of copyright licenses which can be used by any author as the terms under which to distribute his or her own software and documentation .
Rather than forbid users from modifying and redistributing the software , these public copyright licenses encourage sharing and modification , providing a way for authors to commit their work to a commons and users to share and improve those works without fear .
The Foundations primary license is the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL ) .
In addition to its own licenses , the FSF keeps an up - to - date list of licenses published by other companies and organizations which meet the Free Software Definition .
3
Third , it engages in public education and advocacy work to raise awareness about free software to create more opportunities for its use and development , and to ensure that the freedoms outlined in the Free Software Definition are respected .
Over the last 26 years , the GNU Project has successfully developed the utilities and applications that , together with the kernel Linux ( also distributed under the GNU GPL ) written by Linus Torvalds and contributors around the globe , form a complete free software operating system used by a growing number of individuals , governments , and companies in place of Microsofts Windows or Apples OS X .
This operating system , though often erroneously referred to simply by the name of its kernel Linux , is called GNU / Linux .
Though the GNU / Linux operating system is now fully functional , the GNU Project remains active , continuing to refine its software and develop new applications .
One of the GNU Projects most fundamental tools is the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) , which has become the standard for programmers working on Unix - like systems around the world .
4 GCC is used heavily in both the private and public sectors .
In 1992 the US Air Force awarded New York University ( NYU ) a contract to build a compiler for the Ada programming language , which is used extensively in systems deployed by the Department of Defense .
The contract specified that the compiler was to be released under the GNU GPL , and the copyrights assigned to the Free Software Foundation .
5
This compiler , GNAT , is an extension of the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) , and is commonly used to compile avionic systems , including the Lockheed Boeing 787 Dreamliner , C130 Hercules aircraft and Raytheon Ship Self - Defense System ( SSDS ) .
Though itself a nonprofit , the Foundation 's publicly available licenses are known worldwide and have been adopted ( as proposed or with variations ) and implemented by hundreds of thousands of people outside the GNU Project who are also creating , adopting and modifying software for both commercial and noncommercial purposes .
The Foundations software licenses are used by 65 % of the more than 200,000 coding projects listed by Black Duck .
6
The aggregate effect of their work , done with reliance on a model of freedom , has promoted science and the useful arts , the objects of copyright and patent systems set forth in U.S. Const. art .
1 , § 8 , cl. 8 ; has limited monopoly and restraint of trade , such limitation being an important object of federal and state statutes and common law ; and has promoted freedom of expression , an object of federal and state constitutions .
The extent of Foundation President Richard Stallmans contribution to free software and its social movement has been recognized by many institutions , including a Fellowship awarded to him by the MacArthur Foundation in 1990.7
The impact of the free software movement extends far beyond people who directly identify themselves as its members ; it has influenced many other software and non -software social movements .
In 1998 , a group of people calling themselves open source split off from the movement in disagreement , in order to avoid discussion of the ethical and the social ramifications of free software in favor of values that would appeal directly to businesses , i.e. , efficiency , security and cost - savings .
While the Foundation is firmly opposed to the active refusal of open source to focus on computer user freedom , the two groups often collaborate on the actual writing of software code , and because open source proponents still use free software copyright licenses , it is common to talk about them together as Free , Libre and Open Source Software , or FLOSS , for short .
Bruce Perens , co-founder of the Open Source Initiative , has explained the connection between Richard Stallman and the Foundations notion of free software , and open source :  My intent has always been for Open Source to simply be another way of talking about Free Software , tailored to the ears of business people , and that it would eventually lead them to a greater appreciation of Richard Stallmans arguments .
8 FLOSS writings , distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL and inspired in substantial part by the Foundations work , have become staples of data handling and other information systems , telecommunications , video and sound files creation and control , scientific research , bioinformatics , health care , enterprise management and  of equal importance  have been useful in the study of artificial intelligence as a science apart from industrial applications .
Although it does not achieve the public visibility or recognition of proprietary software systems like those developed by Microsoft and Apple , a closer look shows that many , if not most , uses of computers today in both the public and private sectors involve FLOSS .
Free software , specifically software distributed under the GNU GPL , is also used heavily by the government of the United States .
A 2003 report commissioned by the Department of Defense ( DOD ) , entitled  Use of Free and Open Source Software ( FOSS ) in the U.S. Department of Defense ( DOD Report ) credits Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation directly .
The DOD Report shows that roughly 50 % of all of the FLOSS used at the DOD is licensed under the GNU GPL , and evaluates what a possible world within the DOD without this software would look like , stating :
The main conclusion of the analysis was that FOSS software plays a more critical role in the DoD than has generally been recognized .
FOSS applications are most important in four broad areas : Infrastructure Support , Software Development , Security , and Research .
One unexpected result was the degree to which Security depends on FOSS .
Banning FOSS would remove certain types of infrastructure components ( e.g. , OpenBSD ) that currently help support network security .
It would also limit DoD access to - and overall expertise in - the use of powerful FOSS analysis and detection applications that hostile groups could use to help stage cyberattacks .
Finally , it would remove the demonstrated ability of FOSS applications to be updated rapidly in response to new types of cyberattack .
Taken together , these factors imply that banning FOSS would have immediate , broad , and strongly negative impacts on the ability of many sensitive and security - focused DoD groups to defend against cyberattacks .9
In addition , NASA has also recognized the importance of free software by creating its own repository of freely licensed works .

While the military and other divisions of government may not have to worry directly about their own use of patents , the DOD Report shows that their operation depends on the continued development worldwide of the kind of free software they use today  the kind of free software facilitated by the Foundation .
Software licensed under the GNU GPL is also critical to the private sector .
A world without the Foundation and FLOSS in the private sector would look vastly different .
Free software has even been incorporated under the hood into a number of consumer products .
While these products impose unethical restrictions on users and do not respect free software values , they are nonetheless built using its software .
Free software also is crucial to the business of many modern technology companies , including IBM and Novell .
These companies may claim patents are necessary for their software businesses , but in many ways they actually rely on and profit from software produced by those with no interest in patents .
Even Microsofts Bill Gates has criticized the impact of patents on software development .
In a memorandum sent to Microsofts upper management on May 16 , 1991 , Mr. Gates cited an article written by Richard Stallman for the League of Programming Freedom : Patents :
If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of todays ideas were invented , and had taken out patents , the industry would be at a complete standstill today .
I feel certain that some large company will patent some obvious thing related to interface , object orientation , algorithm , application extension or other crucial technique .
If we assume this company has no need of any of our patents then they have a 17 - year right to take as much of our profits as they want .
The solution to this is patent exchanges with large companies and patenting as much as we can .
Amazingly we havent done any patent exchanges that I am aware of .
Amazingly we havent found a way to use our licensing position to avoid having our own customers cause patent problems for us .
I know these arent simple problems but they deserve more effort by both Legal and other groups .
For example we need to do a patent exchange with HP as part of our new relationship .
In many application categories straightforward thinking ahead allows you to come up with patentable ideas .
A recent paper from the League for Programming Freedom ( available from the Legal department ) explains some problems with the way patents are applied to software .
11 Specific free software programs aimed at individual computer users  desktops have also seen wide success recently .
The Mozilla Firefox browser alone , available as free software under a number of licenses including the GNU GPL , has reached a market share of over 20 % in a field that was once so dominated by Microsofts Internet Explorer that the company was prosecuted over antitrust concerns .
12
In addition to the millions of users using free software browsers , much of the Internet they are connecting to itself is built on free software .
Though it is sometimes deployed with proprietary extensions , the majority of Web sites are based on the free software Apache Web server .
13
The Foundation has been in a unique position to contribute to and witness the development that has happened as a result of free software over the course of the last 26 years , but also to witness the development that did not and does not happen whenever the specter of patent infringement hangs over the heads of people with insufficient resources to defend against such threats .
It has seen the effort undertaken by free software developers to defend themselves against software patents  both as a preemptive measure to avoid legal disputes , and in response to specific threats from patent holders .
In some cases , the free software community has simply done without certain software or functionality because of threats from patents .
Fedora , a community distribution of GNU / Linux sponsored by Red Hat , cannot include software to play MP3s or unencrypted DVDs because of patent concerns .
14
For similar reasons , free software support for the various video codecs used by multimedia on the Web today remains hit - or - miss .
As part of its publication of a new version of the GNU GPL , the Foundation ran an international community comment process , soliciting feedback from companies and individuals about how the license needed to be improved .
This process , which ran for over a year and accumulated over 2,500 comments , 15 showed that many free software developers were deterred by the threat of patents and sought protection .
For much of its history , the Foundation has grappled with the very real possibility of patent suits against users of free software .
Users of free software have been trapped by unforeseen patent claims and forced into costly settlements and cross-licensing agreements .
16
While the respective parties involved in these suits may have reached settlements , the larger questions for all users and developers of free software involving the threat of a patent suit are left unsettled .
The Foundation has been at the center of an emerging and now overwhelming new economic and cultural model of sharing creativity and a community adopting that model .
The Foundation has distinct observations of its own , and of its larger community , to offer the Court as to the interaction of this activity with copyright and patent systems .
As discussed below , the patent system has not met the constitutional purpose of advancing useful arts in the case of software creation , but rather has been an obstacle to advancement .
The Foundation can attest to the fact that the size and shape of this obstacle cannot be understood merely by examining actual instances of patent litigation ; the mere threat of such litigation against parties without the ability to cross-license or afford sufficient representation has a substantially documented 17 chilling effect on innovative free software development , and by extension , on other socially beneficial movements inspired by free software .
The Foundation also has published the GNU Free Documentation License ( GNU FDL ) .
18 The Foundation originally created the GNU FDL to provide a basis for documentation for the GNU Project to be shared and adapted the same way that the GNU Projects software is .
However , it can readily be applied to any written reference work , and other projects have used this license as the basis for sharing information and collaborating .
Noteworthy among these is Wikipedia , an online encyclopedia which generally can be edited by anyone who visits its web site .
Creators of Wikipedia have said that they were inspired by the Foundations ideas .19 Wikipedia used the GNU Free Documentation License exclusively as the license for all of its articles until June 2009,20 and at that time it covered more than 340,000 texts .
21
The vast majority of articles on Wikipedia today are now dual - licensed , with the GNU FDL still available as an option for its users .
Those same ideas have also given birth to other movements to create works which can be shared and changed , even when they did not use the licenses published by the Foundation .
Creative Commons publishes its own licenses that allow people to distribute and modify the works they cover , and are meant to be applied to a wide variety of works ; current estimates suggest that these licenses have been used by 250 million works at minimum worldwide .
22
Most of these licenses grant permissions and have associated conditions similar to those in the Foundations licenses .
Executives at Creative Commons have frequently cited the Foundation as providing the basis for their own efforts .

While supporting the result sought by Respondent ( i.e. , affirming the judgment of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals of unpatentability of the claimed subject matter of the Bilski et al. patent application ) , the Foundation hopes this brief provides the Court a broader context and approach to software patenting limitation , which goes beyond the two part test derived by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit from this Courts decision in Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175 ( 1981 ) .
The Foundation is aligned in part , but only in part , with the separate opinion of Judge Mayer .
24 Notwithstanding the contrary assertion at sec.
I.C.3 ( pages 36 - 44 ) of Respondents brief , the Foundation submits respectfully that this case is an appropriate one to address patenting eligibility of computer software .
Several amici aligned with both parties of this case so regard it and indeed the court of appeals eschewed a categorical exclusion of business methods and , instead , applied the machine - transformation test to a claimed process which was implicitly software - based though not reciting software directly in its broadest independent claim .
Summary of argument
The Foundation asserts that software patents hinder the progress of software development and distribution , are unjust and cause deleterious socioeconomic effects upon the advancement of technology in the United States for societys benefit .
The Foundation further takes the position that computer software patents do not promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts ,  and therefore are not constitutionally justified .
Clarification or expansion of the particular machine or transformation test is appropriate to prevent the USPTO from granting software patents and to reduce uncertainty for those developing software .
An information processing algorithm with no physical manifestation of any sort is beyond the bounds of patentability .
This Court has repeatedly ruled that an information processing algorithm with insignificant post - solution activity  appended should still not be patentable .
Notably , claims for an information processing algorithm loaded in a standard way onto a standard computer were repeatedly ruled to be invalid .
The Court in Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175 , 182 ( 1981 ) , set forth a clear criterion that information processing algorithms dressed in physical terminology are not eligible to be patents , although other , more involved types of software - on - a- machine could be patentable when considered as a whole . 
Unfortunately , subsequent rulings from the Federal Circuit have applied only the second half of this criterion , thereby elevating the exception to the rule and inventing a doctrine whereby any claim which includes software must be taken as a whole  when examined for patent - eligibility .
If this line of Federal Circuit cases continues , and the holistic second half of the Diehr holding is treated as the entire ruling , patent examiners would be barred from inquiring whether claims such as those present in the Bilski patent are merely information processing claims recited in a manner that circumvents limitations on patent eligibility .
Instead , examiners would be obligated to accept any artfully styled claim as patent - eligible .
The Foundation suggests that the Court could conform to its earlier precedent whereby claims for information processing with trivial physical dressing are excluded from patent - eligibility , either via a standard Section 103 analysis or via a comparable dissection under Section 101 .
However , either method requires striking down the artificial doctrine that inventions with software  and only inventions with software  must be considered as a whole in relation to Section 101 .
There is wisdom in this Courts repeated attempts to ensure that information processing algorithms remain outside the scope of patent law , even in manifestations where insignificant post - solution activity  is appended .
Such a limitation on patent - eligible subject matter should be respected and enforced , and for good reason : allowing such patents has had perverse economic effects .
First , litigation regarding software is increasingly targeted not at producers in the information processing sector ,  but rather at parties in the general economy who are independently reinventing software in the course of business .
Second , the increased risk of liability brought about by the expansion of patent law to include software and business methods has sparked debate about the validity of the patent system at large .
Argument25 I. THIS COURTS JURISPRUDENCE CONCERNING SOFTWARE PATENTS HAS APPROPRIATELY EXPRESSED A TEMPERED APPROACH , BUT SUBSEQUENT RULINGS BY LOWER COURTS THREATEN TO UPSET THE BALANCE STRUCK BY THIS COURT OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO .
A. THIS COURT HAS RULED THAT INFORMATION PROCESSING ALGORITHMS WITH INSIGNIFICANT POST - SOLUTION ACTIVITY  ARE BARRED FROM PATENT -ELIGIBILITY .
There is little controversy that information processing algorithms in their pure , ethereal forms , with no physical component or manifestation of any sort , are excluded from patentability .
26 However , what is under debate is how much of a physical manifestation an information processing algorithm must have before it is patentable .
In a trio of opinions issued over the span of nine years , this Court clearly rejected the patentability of an information processing algorithm with insignificant post - solution activity  appended .
First , in Gottschalk v. Benson , 409 U.S. 63 ( 1972 ) , the Court quoted approvingly the 1966 Presidents Commission on the Patent System : Direct attempts to patent programs have been rejected on the ground of nonstatutory subject matter .
Indirect attempts to obtain patents and avoid the rejection , by drafting claims as a process , or a machine or components thereof programmed in a given manner , rather than as a program itself , have confused the issue further and should not be permitted .
27 Second , in Parker v. Flook , 437 U.S. 584 ( 1978 ) , this Court made a more general statement , reiterating the position that loading an algorithm onto a standard computer is merely an attempt to circumvent recognized limitations :
 The notion that post - solution activity , no matter how conventional or obvious in itself , can transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process exalts form over substance .
A competent draftsman could attach some form of post - solution activity to almost any mathematical formula .
Id. at 590 .
Third , in Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175 ( 1981 ) , the Court directly reiterated its two previous holdings , while also acknowledging that bona fide , patent - eligible inventions may include a software component :
A mathematical formula as such is not accorded the protection of our patent laws , Gottschalk v. Benson , 409 U.S. 63 ( 1972 ) , and this principle cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment .
Parker v. Flook , 437 U.S. 584 ( 1978 ) .
Similarly , insignificant post - solution activity will not transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process .
Ibid .
To hold otherwise would allow a competent draftsman to evade the recognized limitations on the type of subject matter eligible for patent protection .
On the other hand , when a claim containing a mathematical formula implements or applies that formula in a structure or process which , when considered as a whole , is performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect ( e. g. , transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing ) , then the claim satisfies the requirements of [ Section ] 101 .
Id. at 191 -92 .
The phrase considered as a whole ,  in relation to subject matter eligibility , does not appear in Sections 100 or 101 of Title 35 of the United States Code ( although it does appear in section 103 concerning obviousness determinations ) ; rather , it originates in the above - quoted statement from Diehr , 450 U.S. at 192 , and therefore its meaning should be evaluated in the context of the balance in which it was presented .
In particular , the Diehr ruling demarked a dichotomy between designs that have only insignificant post - solution activity ,  on the one hand , and processes which , considered as a whole ,  fall under the scope of patent - eligible subject matter , on the other .
The full statement directs that an inquiry first be made into whether a claimed invention is information processing with insignificant post - solution activity .
Once undertaken , that inquiry may lead to the conclusion that the invention involves significantly more and should be patent - eligible .
28 B. THE FEDERAL CIRCUITS BROAD APPLICATION OF THE CONSIDERED AS A WHOLE  DOCTRINE RELIES UPON A MISLEADING INTERPRETATION OF SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT , AND THIS HOLISTIC APPROACH HAS RESULTED IN THE EXCEPTION SWALLOWING THE RULE .
The Diehr analysis is correct , but as applied by the Federal Circuit , has improperly evolved into a one - sided doctrine whereby all claims , including software claims , are preliminarily taken as a whole  when assessing their Section 101 eligibility for patenting .
Rulings by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in In re Alappat , 33 F.3d 1526 , 1543 ( Fed. Cir. 1994 ) , State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group , Inc. , 149 F.3d 1368 , 1374 n.6 ( Fed. Cir. 1999 ) , and AT&T Corp. v. Excel Communications Inc. , 172 F.3d 1352 , 1356 -59 ( Fed. Cir. 1999 ) , are based only on the second half of the Diehr standard .
That is , these rulings state that a claim must be considered as a whole ,  while wholly disregarding the counterbalancing statement that some inventions are merely unpatentable formulae with insignificant post - solution activity .
The result is an extreme doctrine that has damaged patent law , and allowed the patentability of elements that would not be patentable under any of the above Supreme Court rulings .
Under this distorted automatic approach to the considered as a whole  doctrine , the Bilski claim ( intended to be read as information processing with a not - novel , obvious physical step appended ) and the typical Beauregard claim ( for a standard computer memory device upon which is loaded a new work of software ) are nevertheless deemed patentable , even though they could ( and should ) easily be dissected into an information processing step and insignificant post - solution activity .
When viewed through the Federal Circuits clouded lens , even the claim in Flook would be read as a patent - eligible alarm , instead of the dressed - up , unpatentable equation that the Diehr ruling took it to be .
Such a result is wrong , and the Court in this case has the opportunity to prevent the considered as a whole language of Diehr from being considered as the whole of that ruling , which it is not .
If left unchecked , an incorrect legal standard would prohibit examiners from inquiring whether claims such as those present in the Bilski patent are merely information processing claims recited in a manner that circumvents limitations on patent - eligibility , as opposed to bona fide patent - eligible inventions .
Instead , examiners would have to accept any correctly worded claim as patent - eligible , thereby elevating form over substance .
C. THE SECTION 103 INQUIRY COULD ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT , BUT IS ALSO BLOCKED BY THE AS A WHOLE  DOCTRINE .
The preceding discussion of the Section 101 inquiry advises a dissection of a patent application that is in many ways comparable to the inquiry of non-obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103 .
When evaluating the non-obviousness of a patent application , the following process is prescribed :  Under 103 , the scope and content of the prior art are to be determined ; differences between the prior art and the claims at issue are to be ascertained ; and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art resolved .
Against this background , the obviousness or nonobviousness of the subject matter [ as a whole ] is determined . 
Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City , 383 U. S. 1 , 17 ( 1965 ) .
As the Diehr ruling acknowledges , the combination of information processing and machinery is sometimes greater than the sum of its parts ; the same could be true of combinations in a Section 103 context .
But in a parallel manner , this Courts ruling in KSR v. Teleflex , 550 U.S. 398 ( 2007 ) , points out that if a combination of elements in the prior art is obvious to try ,  the combination does not pass the conditions of Section 103 .
Given a set of rules for information processing  such as Bilskis hedging scheme or any computationally - intensive number - crunching scheme  it is blatantly obvious to try loading the algorithm onto a standard computer .
In fact , in Northern Telecom v. Datapoint , 908 F.2d 931 , 940-41 ( 1990 ) , the Federal Circuit ruled that loading an algorithm onto a computer is a mere clerical function . 
That is , a software - plus - computer claim consists of one piece of prior art ( an information processing algorithm ) , a second piece of prior art ( a standard , unmodified computer ) , and the obvious - to - try combination of one with the other .
II .
FOR MANY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS , THE PATENT SYSTEM IS UNJUST .
Development in a domain where ideas are patentable carries risks .
In certain domains , such as the manufacturing of vehicles and pharmaceuticals , product developers are almost always large companies .
Because they have the resources for manufacturing , and thereafter attaining the necessary government approval for their product , it is reasonable to assume these companies also have the resources to perform patent searches , get legal opinions and , if necessary , mount a defense when accused of patent infringement .
Manufacturing vehicles and pharmaceuticals is inherently expensive , with or without the patent system , so manufacturers can be assumed to be prepared to expend money .
The expense of the patent system does not change who can participate , but rather , simply increases the cost .
None of these factors apply for software .
Software is developed not just by large companies , but also by small companies , project communities , students , and individuals .
Participation in software development has no fundamental need to consume any resource ( other than , perhaps , ones time spent at a computer ) .
Thus , it cannot be assumed that developers active in the field of software have the resources to perform patent searches , nor that they expect to incur expenses for their activity .
This leaves many developers in a situation where they cannot afford the legal resources necessary to minimize their risk of infringement , and if accused of violating a patent , they cannot afford to defend themselves .
The system is disproportionately expensive , by orders of magnitude .
This inability to participate on an even basis amplifies the problem , but there is also a deeper problem : losing control of ones computing in his or her daily life .
Because individuals can write software , they can help themselves and solve their own problems .
Given that software development includes common activities such as making a webpage , the freedom to use a computer as one sees fit for his or her daily life is a fundamental form of expression , just as using a pen and paper is .
III .
COMPUTER SOFTWARE PATENTS CAN COMPROMISE COMPATIBILITY
AND DATA FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS .
In software , access to data format specifications holds a role of importance unparalleled in other fields .
Examples of data that come in specific formats include email , images , and word processing documents .
In the context of writing an email reader , a word processor , or an image viewer , being blocked from reading , modifying , or writing in the required data format is equivalent to being banned from writing a functional program for that task .
This gives too much power to the holder of a patent on a widely used format .
In terms of the proper functioning of the software industry , this power is harmful to competition .
In terms of individuals , it translates to banning them from writing useful software for themselves and for others .
In some fields of development , the barriers made by patents may spur useful innovation when developers search for a different way to accomplish a patented task .
With data formats , this type of innovation is impossible to encourage because by reading or writing the data differently , the software would be failing its compatibility objective .
Software patents can also hold back freely implemented standards such as those that structure the World Wide Web .
HTML version 4 has been the standard for web pages since 1997 .
Efforts are ongoing to produce its successor , HTML5 .
This effort is making progress , except concerning which video format to recommend .
Due to patents , the popular MPEG H.264 video format cannot be recommended because it cannot be implemented without permission .
The other option was the patent - free Ogg Theora format , but when improving the quality of this format was discussed , Chris DiBona of Google said ,  Heres the challenge : Can [ T ] heora move forward without infringing on the other video compression patents ?
29
Yet another way in which compatibility is essential is in the look and control of an application .
If one develops an innovative word processor which doesnt resemble any existing word processor , it will be difficult for people to use .
Software users have certain expectations .
Using new design paradigms can be useful , but it adds initial inconvenience for the users , so this change should only be made if the benefits clearly outweigh the annoyance to users .
Having a strange interface because of patent problems is not beneficial for computer users .
IV .
THE CONTINUED BROAD ALLOWANCE OF SOFTWARE CLAIMS PLACES UNJUST RESTRICTIONS ON EVERYONE AND HAS RESULTED IN PERVERSE ECONOMIC EFFECTS AND AN EPIDEMIC OF LITIGATION .
Litigation regarding software is increasingly targeted not at producers in the information processing sector , but at persons in the general economy who are independently reinventing course - of - business software .
One large software project has been the subject of two analyses .
First , the Linux kernel  which is the kernel of the widely used GNU / Linux operating system  was examined by patent attorney Dan Ravicher , who announced on August 2 , 2004 , that he had found no court - validated patents to be infringed by the Linux kernel , although 283 // issued // patents existed which could potentially be used to support patent claims against it .30
Thereafter , Microsoft in the year 2007 began claiming that the Linux kernel violates 235 of its patents - although the patents have never been specified .
31 Yet the kernel Linux is just one component of the GNU / Linux operating system .
The kernel Linuxs human - written source code is publicly available , and contains approximately 4,000,000 ( four million ) lines of source code .
Accounting for the two suggestions discussed in the preceding paragraph about the number of patents possibly violated , one ends up with one instance of patent infringement for every 14,275 to 17,191 lines of code .
Taking the one calculation one step further , given the fact that complete GNU / Linux operating systems , often distributed with sets of applications , can contain software with more than 225 million lines of source code , we arrive at the possibility of 13,160 or 15,848 patent infringements per complete distribution .
32
The resulting legal entanglements would be simply absurd .
This massive uncertainty is what this Court can end by clearly excluding software ideas on computers from patentability .
A second example is the previously mentioned MPEG H.264 video format .
This one format is covered by patents from numerous companies and institutions , including Columbia University , Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute of Korea ( ETRI ) , France Télécom , Fujitsu , LG Electronics , Matsushita , Mitsubishi , Microsoft , Motorola , Nokia , Philips , Robert Bosch GmbH , Samsung , Sharp , Sony , Toshiba , and Victor Company of Japan ( JVC ) .
33
Not only do these two examples demonstrate the absurd situation created by granting patents on something as complex and abstract as software , 34 but the latter instance is also an example of an important standard the implementation of which depends on permission from patent holders .
In other industries , practitioners may know which companies in their field are applying for patents which might be pertinent .
In software , the number of practitioners is too great for it to be possible to know which companies or groups one should monitor for applications or pertinent patents .
As researcher Ben Klemens , who estimates the cost of software patents to the United States economy to be $ 11.26 billion per year , points out ,  Any company with a web site could be liable for software patent infringement .
35
In fact , the risks of patents on software are not limited to companies that consider themselves software companies , and Klemens notes that among the companies facing litigation for violating one particular software patent are CDW Corp. , Motorola , the Green Bay Packers , OfficeMax , Caterpillar , Kraft Foods , ADT Security Services , AutoNation , Florida Crystals Corp. , HearUSA , Tire Kingdom , and Boca Raton Resort and Club .36
The increased risk of liability brought about by the expansion of patent law to include software and business methods has sparked debate about the validity of the patent system at large .
Thus , there is wisdom in the Supreme Courts repeated attempts to ensure that information processing algorithms remain outside the scope of patent law , even in manifestations where insignificant post - solution activity  is appended .
The limitations on patent - eligible subject matter should be respected and enforced .
V. INNOVATION CAN BE , AND HAS BEEN , ACHIEVED IN THE ABSENCE OF SOFTWARE PATENTS .
It may be surprising to many people that Microsoft Corporation is an example of a company built without patents .
In 2005 , Grace Murray Hopper Award - winning software developer Dan Bricklin and New York Times journalist Randall Stross researched the patent ownership history of Microsoft .
The pair found that in 1987 , when Microsoft had only had one patent granted to them , their revenue was $ 350 million .
By 1990 , the corporation had five patents , and a revenue of $ 1.18 billion .
By 1995 , they still had only 77 patents , their revenue was $ 5.94 billion .37
In other words , at the time Microsoft completed its Windows 95 operating system , Microsoft still had only 77 patents .
The development of its flagship product was fostered by copyright , not patents .
Though copyrights possess their own problems , those problems are more solvable under the current law , and copyrights do not block independent development as patents do .
On February 10 , 2009 , Microsoft announced that it had been granted its 10,000th patent .
Since 1995 , the companys premier position in the operating systems and word processor markets have not changed .
More recently , since at least 2006 , Microsoft has been approaching distributors of other operating systems and demanding payments of patent royalties .
One could deduce that patents did n't help them compete with others , but did help them entrench the position gained .
Also , Microsofts current long - standing dominance and its recent use of its patents are strikingly similar to the problems that Bill Gates predicted in 1991 about industry standstill and patents being used to take profits of other software companies .
38 The GNU / Linux operating system is another example of a top class operating system built on copyrights , not patents .
GNU / Linux uses copyright much differently than Microsoft .
Before 1995 , GNU / Linux was developed by individuals , communities , universities , and those who developed software as a side activity to use for other work .
The license used by the majority of free software , the GNU General Public License , does not allow distributors to use patents to require royalties39  thus excluding , for example , licensing the MPEG H.264 under its current terms .
VI .
NOTABLE ANALYSES HAVE NOTED THE RISKS POSED BY SOFTWARE PATENTS .
Experts from around the globe repeatedly have concluded that software patents are not good for progress , innovation , or the economy : Bessen & Hunt  MIT : ' Thus the extension of patent protection to software did not generate a relative increase in R&D spending as predicted by the static model ; instead , consistent with the dynamic model , R&D spending seems to have remained roughly steady or to have declined .
40 Bessen & Maskins :
 The very large increase in software patent propensity over time is not adequately explained by changes in R&D investments , employment of computer programmers , or productivity growth . [ ]
We find evidence that software patents substitute for R&D at the firm level ; they are associated with lower R&D intensity .
41 U.S. Federal Trade Commission :  The software and Internet industries generally are characterized by five factors : ( 1 ) innovation occurs on a cumulative basis ; ( 2 ) capital costs are low , particularly relative to the pharmaceutical , biotechnology and hardware industries ; ( 3 ) the rate of technological change is rapid , and product life cycles are short ; ( 4 ) alternative means of fostering innovation exist , including copyright protection and open source software ; and ( 5 ) the industries have experienced a regime change in terms of the availability of patent protection .
Panelists consistently stated that competition drives innovation in these industries .
Innovation is also fostered by some industry participants  use of copyright protection or open source software .
Several panelists discounted the value of patent disclosures , because the disclosure of a software products underlying source code is not required .
Many panelists and participants expressed the view that software and Internet patents are impeding innovation .
They stated that such patents are impairing follow - on incentives , increasing entry barriers , creating uncertainty that harms incentives to invest in innovation , and producing patent thickets .
Panelists discussed how defensive patenting increases the complexity of patent thickets and forces companies to divert resources from R&D into obtaining patents .
Commentators noted that patent thickets make it more difficult to commercialize new products and raise uncertainty and investment risks .
Some panelists also noted that hold - up has become a problem that can result in higher prices being passed along to consumers .
42 Lord Justice Jacob , Supreme Court of Judicature :  The patent system is there to provide a research and investment incentive but it has a price .
That price ( what economists call transaction costs ) is paid in a host of ways : the costs of patenting , the impediment to competition , the compliance cost of ensuring non-infringement , the cost of uncertainty , litigation costs and so on .
There is , so far as we know , no really hard empirical data showing that the liberalisation of what is patentable in the USA has resulted in a greater rate of innovation or investment in the excluded categories .
Innovation in computer programs , for instance , proceeded at an immense speed for years before anyone thought of granting patents for them as such .
There is evidence , in the shape of the mass of US litigation about the excluded categories , that they have produced much uncertainty .
If the encouragement of patenting and of patent litigation as industries in themselves were a purpose of the patent system , then the case for construing the categories narrowly ( and indeed for removing them ) is made out .
But not otherwise .43 Report for the United Kingdoms Chancellor of the Exchequer :  The software industry in the USA grew exponentially without pure software patents , suggesting they are not necessary to promote innovation .
The evidence suggests software patents are used strategically ; that is , to prevent competitors from developing in a similar field , rather than to incentivise innovation .
44 Deutsche Bank Research :  Chances are that patents on software , common practice in the US and on the brink of being legalised in Europe , in fact stifle innovation .
Europe could still alter course .45 Report for The Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs :  There are particular threats to the European ICT industry such as the current discussion on the patent on software .
The mild regime of IP protection in the past has led to a very innovative and competitive software industry with low entry barriers .
A software patent , which serves to protect inventions of a non-technical nature , could kill the high innovation rate .
46 Conclusion
The decision below should be affirmed , and further clarified or expanded to ensure that no patents are granted for software running on a computer .
Beyond that , this Court should recognize how its decisions in Diehr , Parker and Gottschalk have been misapplied in a manner that is no longer acceptable , and acknowledge that patenting software is inconsistent with the Constitutions mandate .

The Briton , who has not been named , was working for a foreign company building a road from the southern city of Kandahar to the western city of Herat .
At least three policemen were killed when the convoy the two were travelling in was attacked yesterday in western Afghanistan .
Major Andrew Elmes , a spokesman for a Nato - led peacekeeping force in the region , confirmed that a Briton had been abducted and said : " We are now standing by ready to give any assistance . "
He said Nato troops had set up checkpoints in the area and were searching for signs of the abducted pair .
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said : " We are aware an incident has taken place in Afghanistan as a result of which a UK national is missing and we are urgently seeking further details from the Afghan authorities . "
The local police chief , Allah Uddin Noorzi , said a Filipino employee of the same company who escaped the attack had been found hiding under a bridge .
The police chief blamed the Taliban for the man 's disappearance but an interior ministry spokesman , Latfullah Mashal , said it was the work of a criminal gang .
He said no contact had been made with the kidnappers and that a delegation from Kabul was hurrying to the area .
The kidnappings come just weeks after a Lebanese engineer building another road in southern Afghanistan was abducted .
He was released unhurt days later .
Militants have stepped up attacks ahead of elections on September 18 and more than 1,100 people have been killed in the past six months .
