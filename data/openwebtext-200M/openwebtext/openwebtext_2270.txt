Next up in the Republican “ blame the Dems for flawed energy policy ” spin machine ( drum roll , please ) â€ ” H.R. 6566 , the American Energy Act , which the House Republican Conference Web site says is all about “ Reducing the Price at the Pump through an ‘ All of the Above ’ Energy Strategy . ”
On Wednesday , 84 members of the Republican caucus gathered to support a packaged solution to the nation ’s energy woes drafted by prime sponsor House minority leader Rep. John Boehner .
And they demanded that Democrats allow an up - or - down vote on the bill before the August recess begins .
Howzat for Republican provision of careful , thoughtful deliberation on perhaps the most vexing issue the nation faces ( a few wars notwithstanding ) ?
The GOP used this bill to drag in all its earlier measures that have gone nowhere .
â€¢ from H.R. 6108 : a demand to “ open deep water ocean resources , which will provide an additional three million barrels of oil per day , as well as 76 trillion cubic feet of natural gas . ”
â€¢ H.R. 6107 : a proposal to “ open the Arctic coastal plain , which will provide an additional one million barrels of oil per day . ”
â€¢ H.R. 6138 : a proposal to “ allow development of our nationâ€™s shale oil resources , which could provide an additional 2.5 million barrels of oil per day . ”
â€¢ H.R. 6139 : a proposal to “ increase the supply of gas at the pump by cutting bureaucratic red tape that essentially blocks construction of new refineries . ”
â€¢ H.R. 1618 , H.R. 765 and H.R. 778 : proposals to “ provide tax incentives for businesses and homeowners who improve their energy efficiency . ”
â€¢ H.R. 6384 : a proposal to “ provide a monetary prize for developing the first economically feasible , super - fuel - efficient vehicle reaching 100 miles - per- gallon ( sic ) . ”
â€¢ H.R. 765 : a proposal to “ provide tax incentives for businesses and families that purchase more fuel efficient vehicles . ”
And there ’s more .
The bill , again from earlier measures , seeks development of alternative fuels through government contracting , establishment of a renewable energy trust fund using revenues generated by oceanic and Arctic exploration , extension of tax credits for alternative energy production , and ( drum roll for the biggie here ) elimination of barriers to the expansion of emission - free nuclear power production .
The Republicans want all that ?
By the beginning of August recess ?
And an up - or - down vote ( I hate that phrase ) without full and comprehensive hearings ?
And the GOP is selling this with flawed PR .
The Republican Conference Web site ’s energy section dedicated to this bill contains several deceptive charts , such as this one :
This is the same basic chart sent to me last month by my congressman in a franked mailing labeled “ Energy Report . ”
Many Republican members of Congress used it , too .
But it ’s inelegant , inaccurate and laced with hidden assumptions , which I detailed earlier .
My congressman used this data to tout the GOP ’s “ The No More Excuses Energy Act , ” H.R. 3089 â€ ” another bill that went nowhere .
Now here ’s my favorite chart offered by the GOP .
Over the chart is this copy : “ Gas Price Increase during the Democrat Congress : A 74 % Price Increase since January 1 , 2007 . ”
This is absurd .
The size of the blue color ( Republicans ) implies that the GOP has kept gasoline prices low while it held power in the House .
The black ( there ’s that fear factor again ) shows that gasoline prices shot up when the Dems took power after the mid-term elections .
Yet this chart is limited to price increases since 2001 , implying that no other GOP - induced factors or actions from before that time had any impact whatsoever on energy costs .
That ’s a preposterous and simplistic analysis designed solely to blame Democrats rather than reveal true understanding of a complex issue .
The GOP conference Web site also displays a chart that uses a vibrant red color to tell Americans what ’s off limits to oil exploration and recovery .
Howzat for thoughtful consideration of an issue ?
The decision to drill in offshore waters or parts of the Arctic is environmentally and economically complicated ( and not just in ANWR ; geologists just reported that three years ’ worth of world supply rests under the Arctic ) .
Yet the GOP demands that the issue be resolved in the next week .
It ’s an election year .
The GOP is driving the “ pain at the pump ” theme hard to win votes .
But the nation ’s energy problems require far more than bipartisan bickering about which energy bills are best for what purpose .
The Democrats are not without fault here , either .
That ’s another topic for another time .
A woman in southern Ontario is one of the first cases in Canada of a rare neurological syndrome in which a person starts speaking with a different accent , McMaster University researchers report in the July issue of the Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences .
The puzzling medical phenomenon known as foreign - accent syndrome ( FAS ) arises from neurological damage , and results in vocal distortions that typically sound like the speaker has a new , " foreign " accent .
This particular case , however , is even more unusual because the English - speaking woman did not acquire an accent that sounds foreign but one that instead sounds like Maritime Canadian English .
The woman , referred to here as Rosemary , was recovering from a stroke two years ago , when her family noticed a change in her speech .
They asked medical personnel at the Integrated Stroke Unit of Hamilton General Hospital why their mother was suddenly speaking with what sounded like a Newfoundland accent .
It was at that point that the medical team joined forces with researchers in McMaster 's Cognitive Science of Language program to study the case .
" It is a fascinating case because this woman has never visited the Maritimes , nor has she been exposed to anyone with an East Coast accent , " says one of the study 's authors , Alexandre Sévigny , associate professor of cognitive science in the Department of Communication Studies & Multimedia at McMaster University .
" Her family lineage is Irish and Danish , and neither of her parents ever lived anywhere but in southern Ontario . "
Karin Humphreys , the principal investigator in the study , and an assistant professor in McMaster 's Department of Psychology , Neuroscience & Behaviour at McMaster University , says that while the new accent was apparent to the woman 's family the woman could not detect the changes herself .
Despite intensive speech therapy the new accent persists , even two years later .
" Rosemary 's speech is perfectly clear , unlike most stroke victims who have damage to speech - motor areas of the brain , " says Humphreys .
" You would n't guess that the speech changes are the result of a stroke .
Most people meeting her for the first time assume she is from out East .
What we are seeing in this case is a change in some of the very precise mechanisms of speech - motor planning in the brain 's circuitry . "
Sévigny says Rosemary 's speech after the stroke became slow , and included changes in phonological segments ( using " dat " for " that " , and " tink " for " think " ) as well as the opening of some vowels and diphthongs ( " greasy " was pronounced " gracey " , and " dog " was pronounced to rhyme with " rogue " . )
Humphreys says the research makes her wonder whether FAS might be under - reported because doctors rely on family members to alert them to speech changes post - stroke .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The White House Office of Administration is not required to turn over records about a trove of possibly missing e-mails , a federal judge ruled Monday .
The White House Office of Administration is not bound by the Freedom of Information Act , a judge says .
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly found the agency does not have " substantial independent authority " so it is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act .
The decision means the White House does not have to disclose documents relating to its troubled e-mail system .
That system developed problems that may have caused millions of White House e-mails to be unaccounted for .
The watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington had sued under FOIA .
The group expressed disappointment in the ruling and said it is appealing the decision .
" The Bush administration is using the legal system to prevent the American people from discovering the truth about the millions of missing White House e-mails , " said Melanie Sloan , the organization 's executive director .
In January , the White House said it cannot rule out that it may have lost certain e-mails .
The possibly lost e-mails are from a period in which the United States decided to go to war with Iraq , White House officials leaked the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame and the Justice Department started a criminal investigation into who leaked the information .
The White House has denied any evidence , including e-mails , have been destroyed .

Previously I have described a thin lock as a very efficient implementation of object monitor .
It ’s time to flesh out the design .
Since most of the thin lock implementation is itself lock free , all kinds of multicore subtleties come into play .
I did my best to analyze every step , but I ’m only human .
The code has n’t yet been written in D , much less tested .
Object Layout
Every object ( instance of a class ) in the D programming language inherits from Object .
Object contains a hidden header consisting of two fields :
pointer to vtable
pointer - sized thin lock
I ’m not adding any new fields , just replacing an existing pointer field with the thin lock .
The pointer used to point to a lazily evaluated Monitor object .
Thin lock is a union of a bit field and a pointer to a FatLock struct .
The union is discriminated by the two lowest bits–if they are zero , it ’s a pointer .
A null pointer has special meaning –the object can never be shared ( it was created as non-shared ) .
See sharing and unsharing n D .
Here ’s the thin lock bit - field layout ( the low 32 - bits ; the whole field is either 32 - or 64 - bit wide , depending on native pointer size ) .
Bits Name Purpose 11 thread index
One - based index into the global thread table 19 recursion counter Used for recursive locking by the same thread 1 currently shared Set during the creation of a shared object .
It can be turned off and back on with the help of sharing casts .
1 created shared
Set only if the object was created as shared
D runtime has a fixed - size global array of threads .
An index into this array is used to identify a thread .
This is different from the operating - system - defined thread ID .
Sharing policy
To share an object between threads , it must be created as shared ( possibly allocated from a separate , shared heap ) .
Any global object that is not declared shared is only accessible through thread - local handles .
A shared object ’s thin lock ( which has n’t been inflated to a fat lock , see later ) has the two lowest bits set .
Sharing can be cast away , at which point the currently - shared bit is cleared , but the created - shared bit is still on .
The object can then be cast back to shared ; however , if the created - shared bit is not on , such a cast will throw an exception .
This guarantees that an object that was not created for sharing can never be cast to shared .
When sharing is cast away , the casting thread ’s identifier is remembered in the thread index field .
The object becomes exclusively owned by the current thread ( essentially , locked by it ) .
Any attempt by a different thread to lock such an object will result in an exception .
Locking a never - shared object
An object that was created as non-shared ( the default ) has zero in its thin lock .
This state is permanent and not reachable from any other state .
Originally I thought that the comparison ( thinlock == 0 ) did n’t require any synchronization .
I totally spaced out on publication safety ( thank you , Andrei , for a reality check ! ) .
In general , this test has to be preceded by a read fence .
Fortunately , on an x86 , publication safety is guaranteed without fencing , so at least on that platform , the check is lightning fast .
Because the thin lock is co-located with the rest of the object–next to the vtable pointer–even the overhead of fetching it from main memory is rarely incurred .
Therefore the incentive for writing two versions of a class–one with synchronized , and the other with non-synchronized methods –is practically absent in D .
I mentioned before that the D compiler might be able to elide synchronization of non-shared objects altogether .
If that happens , the testing of the two sharing bits in the thin lock would be redundant .
There is however a code - size / performance trade - off between the two solutions .
Locking algorithm
– Test thin lock for zero ( on an x86 , without any synchronization , otherwise precede it with a read fence ) .
If zero , return .
This is the most common case : the object was not created for sharing and will never be accessed by another thread .
– Fetch current compact thread ID , which is conveniently stored in thread - local memory .
Compact thread ID is pre-calculated for each thread using an 11 - bit thread index ( see above ) shifted left by 21 and OR ’ed with 3 ( the lowest two bits are set ) .
This is an optimization .
Notice that an XOR with a compact thread ID flips the two lowest bits of the thin lock , which makes subsequent tests look logically inverted .
– XOR thin lock with this ID .
If the result is 2 ( remember the inversion ) , return .
This is the case when the object was created shared , but was cast to non-shared by the current thread .
This operation does n’t require any synchronization , because only the current thread could cast the object back to shared .
if ( thinlock ^ compact Thread
Id == 2 ) return ;
– If we are past this point , we know that the object is shared , or we are attempting ( incorrectly ) to lock an object that is exclusive to ( cast to non-shared by ) another thread .
– Perform a CAS ( atomic Compare And Swap operation ) on thinlock .
The value we are expecting is 3 ( two lowest bits set and noting else ) , the replacement value is the compact thread ID of the current thread .
This operation will succeed in the next most common case – the object is shared but is not currently locked .
The resulting thin lock state has the thread index filled with a non -zero value , and the two lowest bits set ( see the description of compact thread ID ) .
This state is interpreted as “ locked once by a given thread ” .
– If the CAS fails ( thinlock did n’t have the expected value and the swap did not occur ) , we know that the object is locked ( or the thin lock has been inflated to a fat lock , see later ) .
– Try the next most common case – the object is locked by the current thread ( recursive locking ) .
First XOR the value of the thin lock with the current compact thread ID to isolate the count field .
If the result is less that the maximum count shifted left by 2 and the two lowest bits are zero ( meaning , they were set before the XOR ) , then increment the count .
These operations do n’t require any synchronization , because they only succeed when the lock is owned by the current thread .
uint tmp = thinlock ^ compactTID ; if ( tmp < MAX_COUNT_MASK && ( tmp & 3 ) == 0 ) { thinlock += COUNT_INCREMENT
; return ; }
– Check for the error of trying to lock an object that is owned exclusively by another thread .
if ( ( thinlock & 3 ) == 1 ) throw new ExclusiveLockViolation ;
– Check if the lock has been inflated ( the two lowest bits are zero ) .
If so , interpret the thin lock as a pointer to FatLock and lock it .
Fat lock is implemented using the operating system locking primitives and can deal with contention .
Return .
– If we reach this point , we know that there is contention for the lock or the count has overflowed .
In either case we have to inflate the lock .
We have to preserve one invariant –the lock can only be modified by the thread that holds it , otherwise we are open to all kinds of races .
Therefore we have to busy - wait for the lock to be released .
while ( thinlock != 3 && ( thinlock & 3 ) != 0 ) compiler_fence ( ) ;
Notice that busy waiting requires that the compiler not optimize this loop –we need a “ compiler fence ” .
However , no processor memory fences are required , because there is no ordering dependence .
It ’s enough that , when another thread modifies the lock , the new value eventually becomes visible to the spinning thread .
It ’s possible to miss the unlocked state and spin longer than necessary .
Starvation is theoretically possible if the other thread keeps unlocking and locking without discovering a contention ; with the current thread repeatedly missing the unlocked state .
( This part of the algorithm may be optimized further by introducing exponential backup . )
– The loop is exited if either the lock has been released ( thinlock == 3 ) or another thread managed to inflate the lock ( the two lowest bits are zero , signifying that the value stored is a pointer to FatLock ) .
– Try to acquire the lock using CAS ( the arguments are the same as in the original attempt ) .
– If it succeeds , allocate the fat lock , lock it , and atomically store the pointer to it in the thin lock .
Return .
Once the lock has been inflated , it will remain so for the lifetime of the object .
– If we reach this point , we know that : either the lock has been inflated , another thread is in the process of inflating it , or another thread has acquired the lock without contention while we were busy waiting .
– Try again : go back to busy waiting .
Unlocking
When unlocking , we have the guarantee that the current thread owns the lock , so we do n’t need any additional synchronization .
If the thin locks is zero , return .
The object was not created for sharing .
XOR thin lock with the compact thread ID .
If the result is 2 , we own the object exclusively .
Return .
If the result is zero , we hit the next most common case – the lock has been taken once by the current thread .
Store 3 in the thin lock and return .
If the result of XOR is non-zero and its lowest two bits are clear , decrement the recursion count .
Otherwise , the lock has been inflated .
Unlock the fat lock .
FatLock must also contain a field exclusively - owned - by .
This field is filled with a compact thread ID when sharing is cast away .
When sharing is re-established , this field goes back to zero .
Therefore , after locking the fat lock , additional checking is done :
If the field is non-zero and the result of XOR with the current compact thread ID is also non-zero , an exception is thrown ( attempt to lock an exclusively owned object ) .

Illustration of e-textile pants .
Credit : Liu , et al. ©2008 IEEE .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A pair of pants may help determine if elderly individuals have a high risk of slipping and falling by sensing fluctuations in their walking gait .
A Virginia
Tech engineering team designed the pants in hopes that , by identifying individuals with a higher risk of falling , it may be possible to reduce the number of injuries associated with fall accidents .
According to the Center for Disease Control , about one - third of adults age 70 and over fall every year , with one - fourth of these falls resulting in injuries .
“ One of the main issues in developing a wearable system is making sure that people will wear it , ” said Thurmon Lockhart , Associate Professor and Director of Locomotion Research Laboratory at Virginia Tech , to PhysOrg.com .
“ Comfort and technological innovation are keys for future designs of wearable systems . ”
The e-textile pants are embedded with several e-TAGS , which are small printed circuit boards containing microcontrollers , sensors , and communication devices ( designed by Electrical Engineering professors Tom Martin and Mark Jones of Virginia Tech ) .
The researchers attached four e-TAGs with gyroscopes and accelerometers to each of an individual ’s ankles and knees , as well as two e-TAGs with accelerometers to each hip .
Also , each foot had a piezoelectric sensor attached to the heel that was connected to an e-TAG on the pants .
The set - up was powered by a 9 - volt battery attached near the waist .
During walking trials , the data collected by the e-TAGs was transmitted to a single Bluetooth e-TAG , which wirelessly transmitted the data to a host computer .
The researchers tested the feasibility of the pants by comparing measurements from a group of nine healthy individuals ( young and old ) and a group of four elderly individuals with a medical history of falling .
The participants walked on a treadmill at various speeds as the sensors monitored local perturbations at the six joints .
These local instabilities – for example , ankle or knee movements that varied from step to step – differed between the healthy group and the group with a falling history .
For two different parameters ( angular velocity and vertical acceleration ) , the researchers determined which joints had significant instabilities at different walking speeds .
Overall , they found that local dynamic stability as measured by the pants varies significantly between the two groups , meaning that the pants can accurately differentiate individuals with a high risk for falling from their healthy counterparts .
As the researchers explain , this local instability measurement may indicate how well the human motor control system can compensate for small perturbations between gait cycles , such as uneven surfaces or the individual ’s own motor control error .
Because the pants are unobtrusive and can be connected to a remote health care facility , the technology could enable elderly individuals to live independently for longer , with the pants as a safeguard .
When the pants detect instabilities in an individual ’s gait , the system could notify both the health care facility and the individual , warning them to avoid potentially unsafe walking surfaces .
“ In the future , the diagnostic power is going to increase for wearable systems , and may include checking blood pressure , blood oxygen levels , and more , ” Lockhart said .
“ We ’re also looking into other designs , such as jewelry which people can wear on the wrist and other small single - node systems . ”
Lockhart added that the research team has begun working with several companies to try to bring the wearable sensor system to a reality , possibly in the next few years .

Tens of thousands of Americans have put their names on the line by signing the petition supporting Articles of Impeachment against the President .
In the next few days , it will become clear whether Congress will respond or further action is necessary .
Well , it looks like giving China some face will have little to no impact on the way things are done in this country .
If anything , it will give the Party the confidence to continue harassing parents , journalists , and dissidents of all kinds in the name of social cohesion .
Most local foreigners were skeptical when the first wave of praise passed over China for its handling of the quake .
Even now , when German Red Cross volunteers gush over the dedication of the volunteers , the efficiency of the relief process , and the selflessness of their Sichuanese counterparts , it seems strange .
Is this the China that I have come to know and love ?
Open and selfless ?
Efficient and just ?
Yes and no .
The hysterical youngsters that unleashed a wave of patriotic protests around the world , shocking the West with their fury , are the same youngsters who arrived in Sichuan in droves to help the victims of the quake rebuild their lives and homes .
The Chinese journalists who were the first into the quake zone , reporting throughout the night , are the same reporters that bow down when a directive arrives from the government ordering them to shut up about those tents that were funneled somewhere else , about the dead children and their protesting parents , about anything that might possibly reflect badly on the Party .
The Germans lavish praise on the doctors of Shanghai ’s prestigious Hua Shan hospital , and they deserve it .
I have been throughout the quake zone , from Hanwang to Dujiangyan up to Beichuan , and I have seen determined soldiers and police from all over the country sleeping in tents along with the refugees .
I have seen volunteers asking for directions to the middle of a disaster zone , carrying nothing but a couple bottles of water and a red scarf to denote their status as unaffiliated volunteers .
In Mianyang , victims of the quake are shipped off to factories in Guangdong and Shandong Provinces that have offered thousands of jobs to those who have lost everything .
Teachers volunteer in makeshift tents wherever there is room , and if there is no room , the kids are shipped to schools in Jinan , Qingdao , or Chongqing .
At the same time , this wave leaves dry spots in its wake : the villagers , farmers , children , and workers of the small , insignificant towns reaching up from the poverty of China ’s suburbs to snatch crumbs from the tables of the middle class .
The Old Hundred Names  the commoners  are the real China .
What the Western media decries  the injustice and corruption of the government  is the small minority of this nation that unfortunately wields unassailable power .
The local officials , far from the capital , loot the farmers and uneducated laborers for everything they can , drive in caravans of black cars with red license plates , and honk madly for everyone to dive out of the way .
We all know the sound of that particular CCP honk : loud and obnoxious , rude and indifferent .
These are the people the Chinese must fight against , the “ local snakes ” who encourage gangsterism and sneaky deals in the shadows while the people hold pictures of their children up begging for some sign that the government is what they have been led to believe it is : the father of the people .
I recently read an essay by Peter Hessler written in 1999 about Tibet through Chinese eyes .
Hessler describes the complexities of the Tibetan situation , which involves not just evil officials and righteous monks , but broke migrants and uneducated nomads , heroic teachers and students struggling to find out who they are .
I wrote last month that a wave of patriotism might lead to an invitation for the Dalai Lama to come to Beijing , and all would be rosy in the Garden of China .
One man wrote back saying I was delusional for even contemplating that the CCP would do something so enlightened .
I admit it ’s a long shot .
The Party is clamping down hard here in Sichuan , spitting out crude propaganda like always .
But there are cracks in the wall .
Chinese bloggers and their counterparts on the ground are aware that lying , cheating bastards lead them .
Now is not the time , they say ; we are still developing .
Wait till we are rich and powerful , then we will throw the bastards out .
Perhaps .
But the hopelessness inside of me grows when I read the papers and see Obama and Clinton haggling over pieces of the pie , Bush spreading more ridiculous lies , and McCain spinning a web of deceit in a desperate bid to gain power .
It grows darker when I think about the CCP , leader of the next superpower , as some would have it , still unable to show the slightest inclination toward justice and fairness .
Their fear is palpable , and it stinks .
They crush dissent , censor all media , and blame everything that goes wrong in this country on foreigners , the Falun Gong , or separatists  anything to avoid taking responsibility for their actions .
The anniversary of the June 4 , 1989 , Tiananmen Massacre came and went with nary a peep , save this impassioned plea by Ma Jian .
The kids today have no clue about their older brothers and uncles who died .
This year is this generation ’s June 4 , their crowning moment , the year when they went toe - to - toe with the international critics of their homeland and then went on a crusade to rebuild Sichuan .
For this generation of idealists , the pictures of the dead children will be a just reminder of the good they did for their country and the massive outpouring of love and good deeds that followed .
Justice is n’t a part of this dream .
Why mar the memories of heroic acts done together with the specter of bad construction and the 10,000 - 15,000 children and teachers who died because of it ?
Why fight against the all - powerful Party , when life is so good ?
We have the Olympics coming up , and we ’ll win the most gold medals , they say .
We are strong , and you Westerners will have to shut up sooner or later .
Corrupt officials are part of the package , others say , resigned to a system that they were born into .
This is China .
From the outside looking in , the Party looks crude , fearful , and brutal .
From within , they are the glue that binds everything .
Are the Chinese so different from Americans , who view their government as indispensable , while the rest of the world is baffled at how stupid we can be ?
This is 2008 , not 1989 .
The victims of Tiananmen and the Sichuan quake  children and students  are part of the collective sacrifice many Chinese feel must be made to attain that which they hold so dear : power and glory .
Are n’t all too many Americans willing to sacrifice our dignity and freedoms for the very same thing ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States told Russia on Friday to withdraw its forces from U.S. ally Georgia and stop its air attacks on the tiny Caucasus state following fighting in the breakaway region of South Ossetia .
“ We call on Russia to cease attacks on Georgia by aircraft and missiles , respect Georgia ’s territorial integrity , and withdraw its ground combat forces from Georgian soil , ” U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a statement .
Rice issued her statement as Georgia , a former Soviet state that now wants to join NATO , said it would declare martial law and battled to get control of the rebel enclave , which was fortified by Russian forces .
Georgia said Russian fighter jets bombed container tankers and a shipbuilding plant in the port of Poti , prompting Washington ’s sharpest rebuke of Russia since the crisis began .
“ We deplore the Russian military action in Georgia , which is a violation of Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity , ” U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad told reporters at a U.N. Security Council meeting in New York .
The State Department summoned the Charge d’Affaires at Russia ’s Embassy in Washington , Aleksander Darchiyev , to see Rice ’s deputy John Negroponte , who pressed Moscow to stop its military activities in Georgia .
“ The deputy secretary said that we deplore today ’s Russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles , which are threatening civilian lives , ” said State Department spokesman Robert Wood of Negroponte ’s meeting with the Russian diplomat .
“ These attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension , ” he added .
Both Rice and the White House urged an immediate cease - fire in South Ossetia , and U.S. officials said they would send an envoy to the region to help mediate .
As fighting raged in and around the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali , Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said Russia and Georgia were at war .
Rice said the United States was working with its European partners to launch international mediation , and “ we urgently seek Russia ’s support of these efforts . ”
Diplomatic sources said the U.S. envoy would be Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs , Matthew Bryza , who is expected to join a mission that includes the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe .
Georgia is at the center of a battle for influence between the United States and Russia in the Caucasus .
President George W. Bush spoke to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin about the crisis while both men were in Beijing for the Olympics .
Bush has called Georgia a “ beacon of democracy ” in a volatile region .
NATO MEMBERSHIP
The Russian intervention came as something of a surprise to U.S. military officials who spent recent days monitoring the fighting in South Ossetia and Russia ’s military buildup .
“ The build - up of forces was more than expected and they moved earlier than we thought they would , ” said a U.S. military official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
American military planners reviewed contingency plans for the possible evacuation of up to 3,000 U.S. citizens from Georgia , including about 130 defense personnel there to train Georgian military forces for duty in Iraq .
Washington has pushed hard for NATO membership for Georgia , despite European misgivings over the state ’s stability .
Russia strongly opposes Georgia ’s NATO bid .
Robert Hunter of the RAND Corporation , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , said “ no one wants to fight for Georgia . ”
He said the United States had pushed too hard to try to get NATO membership for Georgia , and now Russia was trying to demonstrate , in part , that U.S. - led NATO efforts had their limits and Moscow ’s interests must be taken into account .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain said Russia should pull its forces out .
“ The consequences for Euro - Atlantic stability and security are grave , ” he said .
Democrat Barack Obama condemned Russia ’s role .
“ What is clear is that Russia has invaded Georgia ’s sovereignty , has encroached on Georgia ’s sovereignty , and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible . ”

I made a brief mention of this story on the weekend in " Short Takes " , but I came across a more detailed accounting of what is happening from Pacific Magazine which is worth a read .
In summary - rising oil prices are pushing smaller countries like the Marshall Islands that generate power using diesel to the ( economic ) brink .
In this case they are taking the novel approach of considering using OTEC to supply their energy needs .
With spiraling fuel costs threatening the government ’s ability to maintain power services in Majuro , Ebeye and other islands , the Marshall Islands declared a state of emergency Thursday afternoon to address the deteriorating economic situation .
Government officials said that declaration of a national state of economic emergency is aimed at fast - tracking domestic energy reduction and cost cutting measures , while lending weight to appeals by the Marshall Islands to donor countries and regional lending agencies for help .
“ The national power utilities are projected to face an estimated shortfall of $ 17.5 million to $ 21 million over the next 12 months assuming the global trend continues , ” said President Litokwa Tomeing in a nationally broadcast statement Thursday night .
This deficit amounts to close to 20 percent of the entire national budget .
The government ’s utility companies have raised power rates three times since January , but revenues have fallen as customers have cut back energy use or been disconnected for not being able to afford power costs that now range from 39 cents per kilowatt hour for “ lifeline ” residential use to 47 cents for businesses .
The Marshall Islands has enough diesel on island to keep the lights on until the end of August .
But if it cannot come up with $ 8.5 million by next weekend to pay Seoul - based SK Networks for last month ’s diesel shipment and a down payment on the next shipment , the likelihood of power rationing — and the possibility of running out of fuel — is looming .
The Marshalls Energy Company told Cabinet last week that without an immediate cash injection , it cannot raise the $ 8.5 million by next weekend .
...
While over the past three years a big alternative energy push has led to nearly half of the remote outer atoll homes getting donor - funded solar units , the state of emergency has ordered government agencies to redirect their alternative energy efforts to the two urban centers to help get people off costly electricity supplied by the government ’s diesel - fired power plants .
The Cabinet has called for an fast - tracking a study on the feasibility of ocean thermal energy conversion ( OTEC ) as an alternative to using fossil fuels for power generation , while also ordering the cost - cutting measure of parking government vehicles immediately after work to end the current practice of workers using government vehicles for personal needs after working hours .
This is Miroslav Tichy , a Czech photographer :
This is one of Tichy ’s homemade cameras , fashioned from cardboard tubing , string , and thread spools :
Here ’s a photo taken with one of his homemade cameras :
Of the apparent quality of his photography Tichy says :
Photography is painting with light !
The blurs , the spots , those are errors !
But the errors are part of it , they give it poetry and turn it into painting .
And for that you need as bad a camera as possible !
If you want to be famous , you have to do whatever you ’re doing worse than anyone else in the whole world .
Awesome .

Delia Derbyshire is the composer of the original theme music to the cult favorite TV show Dr. Who .
She worked for the BBC ’s Radiophonic Workshop in 1963 and was asked to record the theme written by a composer named Ron Grainer .
She turned this composition into a ground breaking ( at the time ) electronic masterpiece .
Delia passed away in 2001 and recently it ’s been revealed that a huge archive of 267 tapes of previously recorded material were discovered in her attic , laying dormant for over 30 years .
This hidden horde of music includes some groundbreaking work , including a very modern sounding techno track recorded in the late 60 ’s that could easily just have been released on Warp Records .
Paul Hartnoll ( former member of the electronic group Orbital ) said the track was , “ quite amazing ” .
Near the beginning of the track , you can hear Delia ’s voice saying “ Forget about this , it ’s for interest only ” .
Here are some other samples :
A recording of her voice , playing forwards and backwards from a documentary about the Tuareg people on the Sahara
The final version of the recording above mixed with electronic - sounding elements
A soliloquy from Hamlet set to strange science fiction swooshes .
Ms Derbyshire did most of this music BEFORE synthesizers came along .
Ms Derbyshire was known for using found objects such as a green metal lampshade as musical instruments and said she took some of her inspiration from the sound of air raid sirens , which she heard growing up in Coventry in the Second World War .
“ The next thing that we want to do is make the archive available to everyone who wants to hear it , ” says David Butler , of Manchester University ’s School of Arts .
“ But also this has to be a living , breathing archive so we are going to commission new works as well . ”
The sound effects on the Dr Who show were widely regarded as groundbreaking .
Here is a collection of videos describing how 4 famous sounds were made .
Unfortunately we have also recently lost another pioneer of electronic music and sounds from the BBC , Daphne Oram .
She was arguably one of the pioneers of techno and electronic music .
PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - The United States began a pilot program on Tuesday that allows some illegal immigrants to come forward and schedule their own deportation , after criticism that stepped - up raids cause traumatic family splits .
Immigration -- principally what to do with some 12 million mostly Hispanic illegal immigrants living and working in the shadows -- is a hot issue in the United States , especially in the midst of an election year and an economic downturn .
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency ’s Scheduled Departure program is set to run through August 22 in five cities .
It offers fugitive illegal immigrants with no criminal history up to 90 days to leave the United States , during when they can stay out of jail .
An ICE fugitive is an illegal immigrant who has failed to leave after a final order of removal , deportation or exclusion from an immigration judge .
The program gives some 457,000 “ non-criminal fugitive aliens an alternative to having us basically track them down , arrest and remove them on the government ’s terms , ” said Jim Hayes , ICE ’s acting director for detention and removal operations .
“ This will allow them a little bit of control over the removal process that ultimately will come for each and every one of them . ”
The pilot program will run in Phoenix , Chicago , Charlotte , North Carolina , and San Diego and Santa Ana in California .
It may be expanded .
In the past 10 months , ICE has nabbed more than 26,000 fugitives in stepped - up workplace raids that have been criticized by some immigration activists for breaking up families .
ICE said in a statement the program would be of particular benefit to fugitives with families because it allows them to make removal arrangements without being held in custody .
Eligible people must report to the police or wear an electronic monitoring device while making their travel arrangements .
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , which advocates for the rights of Latinos living in the United States , dismissed the program .
“ It is reflective of a directionless immigration enforcement policy , ” said John Trasvina , the group ’s president and general counsel .
“ There is no incentive for people to do this .
If people want to leave the country they can leave . ”
OFFICIALLY , the European Union is no more worried about the closure of two oil pipelines running through Georgia than are the world 's oil traders , who have so far shrugged off the news .
After all , less than 3 % of Europe 's oil imports come from Azerbaijan via Georgia , according to the European Commission , and none of its gas .
The commission plans to do no more than “ monitor the situation closely ” .
Yet the Eurocrats , complains one European diplomat , are not looking at recent events in the Caucasus “ with their energy spectacles on ” .
Some of his colleagues certainly suspect that a principal Russian motive for invading Georgia was to highlight its vulnerability as a transit route for oil and gas .
European countries have long dreamt of securing access to gas from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan through a pipeline that crosses Georgia .
That route would bypass Russia , which controls all the existing pipelines between Central Asia and the EU , and so leave less of Europe 's gas supply at Russia 's mercy .
At the very least , the war in Georgia has highlighted the region 's instability , and thus the difficulty of this plan .
Russia is easily the biggest supplier of oil and gas to the EU .
It provided 38 % of gas imports and 33 % of oil imports last year .
Some European countries — especially former Soviet republics and satellites — rely on Russia for virtually all their energy .
The EU 's dependence will only grow , as its own production declines , along with that of its second - biggest supplier , Norway .
By 2030 , predicts the International Energy Agency , a watchdog for big energy consumers , Europe 's gas imports will have doubled — with much of the extra supply coming from Russia .
Russia has demonstrated its willingness to use oil and gas for political purposes on several occasions .
In early 2006 it cut off the gas to Ukraine , which in turn siphoned off some supplies intended for countries such as Hungary and Italy .
Russia has also cut off supplies of oil to Lithuania and gas to Belarus and Georgia .
More recently , it cut by half the amount of oil it sends to the Czech Republic through the “ Friendship ” pipeline , in what many have interpreted as punishment for the Czechs ' willingness to host a radar base for America 's planned missile defences .
Despite much high - minded talk , Europe has responded to these events with indecision and division .
Big energy firms in France , Germany and Italy , to name but three , have rushed to sign long - term contracts with Gazprom , Russia 's state - controlled gas giant , so as to secure their own supplies .
There is also unseemly competition to sign up to Gazprom 's various pipeline schemes , while plans for alternatives that circumvent Russia languish .
Iran and Iraq both have gas to spare , but the EU is reluctant to do business with the first , because of its nuclear ambitions , and unable to do business with the second , because of its instability .
It does not help that pipelines from either place , or from the Caspian , would have to cross Turkey , with whom Europe 's relations are getting frostier and Russia 's are getting warmer .
The commission would like to reduce individual countries ' vulnerability to supply interruptions by getting them to build more links between Europe 's largely separate national gas grids .
To overcome the big gas companies ' reluctance to invest in pipelines that would expose them to more competition , the commission has suggested forcing them to sell their distribution networks .
European governments hammered out a compromise , whereby firms could continue to own the network and sell the gas , as long as the two businesses are separately run .
But the European Parliament has rejected this plan , leaving “ unbundling ” in limbo .
There is also talk of increasing imports of liquefied gas from farther afield .
But the cost of building the necessary infrastructure has risen dramatically , and many proposed plants have run into planning problems .
European governments might dust off such ideas again after the war in Georgia .
In recent pow - wows , some observers have detected somewhat greater unity and resolve over Russia than before .
There is also the comforting thought that the Soviet Union never cut supplies of gas to Europe throughout the cold war .
Russia , after all , is almost as much at the mercy of the pipelines as the EU , in that it cannot easily send its gas anywhere else .
Rockport , Missouri ( TGW ) -
The 1300 person town of Rockport , Missouri will become the first town in the United States to be completely powered by wind power .
The $ 90 million Loess Hills Wind Farm , built by the Wind Capital Group and the John Deere Corp. on bluffs west of Rock Port , generates five megawatts each day .
That is approximately twice as much power as is needed to power Rockport ; in other words , the 4 turbine Loess Hills Wind Farm could power two towns the size of Rockport .
To celebrate being America ’s first wind - powered community , Rock Port , which is located in the far northwest corner of Missouri , will host a “ Green Switch ” celebration on Friday .

This week brings good news and bad news for PlayStation 3 owners .
The good news is that on Thursday , Sony will debut Qore , an interactive online magazine that will give PS3 gamers a monthly dose of news , interviews , and other exclusive PS3 - related video and game content .
The bad news ?
Qore will now be the home of the hottest PlayStation 3 game betas and demos , and what used to be served up for free will now carry a $ 3 / month price tag – and interstitial ads for Burger King , who is sponsoring the new download center .
Demoing the service to Wired.com Monday afternoon , PlayStation Network senior director Susan Panico implied that while the PlayStation Store would still get game demos , the big ones would go on Qore : " Qore is like the network broadcast " of a TV show , she said , and PlayStation Store is like " syndication . "
Users can pay $ 3 for each monthly " episode " of Qore , or $ 25 for a one - year , 13 - episode subscription .
As an added bonus , early subscribers will get a copy of the downloadable game Calling All Cars for free .
The inaugural episode , set to launch on Thursday , will contain interviews and preview videos for SOCOM : Confrontation , plus an exclusive invite to the game 's open beta , scheduled for later this year .
Other content lined up for launch includes an exclusive six - minute trailer for the upcoming Incredible Hulk movie , a preview of Secret Agent Clank for PSP , and exclusive pages from an upcoming Star Wars : Force Unleashed graphic novel .
Sony is even hiding Easter Eggs in each issue – apparently , there 's a mini - game hidden somewhere in the first issue .
Sony has partnered with game developer Backbone to create this half - game , half - TV show experience .
The content will be provided by Future , publishers of PlayStation : The Official Magazine .
Panico says that 80 to 90 percent of the content in each issue of Qore will be exclusive .
It 'll also be ad - supported .
In my brief demo of the service I saw ads for Guitar Hero : Aerosmith , Metal Gear Solid 4 , and the aforementioned Home of the Whopper .
You can skip the ads , but only after they 've run for about five seconds .
Sony still offers more for free than its nearest competitor :
While PlayStation Network does n't offer nearly as many features as Xbox Live , Microsoft 's service costs $ 50 a year while online gameplay is free on PlayStation 3 .
My only question is whether the value - add over what Sony was already providing for free justifies the minimum $ 25 / year cost for the information .
Although wrapping it in the very pretty package of an interactive magazine does make it seem a lot less like Sony is backpedaling on their stance of a largely free online environment , they'd be silly to release any really good demos , trailers , or interviews in the free section of PS3's network from here on out – not when any halfway decent piece of content is another potential carrot to get users to pay them $ 3 .

Kilobyte Constants , a Simple and Beautiful Idea that Has n't Caught On
Eric Isaacson's A86 assembler ( which I used regularly in the early 1990s ) includes a great little feature that I 've never seen in another language : the suffix " K " to indicate kilobytes in numeric literals .
For example , you can say " 16 K " instead of " 16384 " .
How many times have you seen C code like this :
char Buffer [ 512 * 1024 ] ;
The " * 1024 " is so common , and so clunky in comparison with :
char Buffer [ 512 K ] ;
In Forth this is trivial to add , at least outside of compiled definitions .
All you need is :
: K 1024 * ;
And then you can write :
512 K allot

A few years ago , Dr. Joe , a dentist from Palm Beach County , had a female patient with a special problem .
Her upper and lower dentures rattled when she performed oral sex on her boyfriend .
Dr. Joe suggested she simply take them out .
But the woman was distraught .
Her boyfriend , she said , did n't know she wore false teeth .
The ever - helpful doctor made her a soft night guard to fit discreetly over her false teeth .
The patient and her unsuspecting love interest were thrilled with the results .
As time went by , though , Dr. Joe could n't get that interaction out of his head .
Why not mass - produce a sex toy , throwing in a little vibrating action ?
So he did .
Dr. Joe says he and his wife have tested the product he christened his fellatio aid " Blowguard . "
Each of them has left the vibrating object in place for 30 minutes at a time , and their fillings and caps were intact .
Info vibrating oral sex aid
The swinger crowd , especially the geriatric subset , has embraced the product , Dr. Joe says .
" This is a unique , revolutionary product . "
Apple is the target of yet another lawsuit seeking class - action status and damages for iPhone cracks and slow 3G browsing speeds .
The lawsuit is available for review online , and after reading through it , I was surprised to find that the basis for many of its arguments rely upon blogs , anonymous message boards , and what can only be described as misleading and incomplete factual allegations .
Without touching upon every allegation , I will instead focus on the most conspicuously questionable portions of the suit .
Software Updates Didn’t Help Reception Issues
On p.6 of the lawsuit , the plaintiff asserts that he and others experienced poor 3G reception , and were often bumped down to the lower speed 2G Edge network .
The plaintiff also asserts that subsequent software upgrades from Apple , including the September 12th 2.1 update , did nothing to alleviate network reception problems .
In attempting to substantiate this claim , the plaintiff asserts that he was not the only one who failed to notice any improvements , and states on p.9 of the suit
“.. there have been postings by customers on the Internet that , like Plaintiff , have installed the new iPhone firmware , as recommended by Defendants , and have not had the iPhones ’ problems fixed .
In fact , it appears that , like Plaintiff , the iPhones ’ “ bugs ” have gotten worse with the upgrades . ”
The Internet posting relied upon for this argument comes from an August 19th article from InformationWeek blogger Eric Zeman .
However , on the date of the September 12th iPhone 2.1 update , Eric Zeman wrote a post exclaiming that the update had drastically improved his iPhone and had essentially fixed it of previous bugs .
Essentially , the plaintiff uses an article from August to show that other iPhone users were not helped by subsequent software upgrades , when the same author wrote less than a month later that an iPhone software did , in fact , alleviate the problems plaguing his iPhone .
Cracked iPhones
The Plaintiff in this case also asserts that his iPhone experienced a hairline crack , which was also noted by a multitude of other iPhone users .
Cracked iPhones were well documented in the weeks following the iPhone 3 G ’s release , and many believe the cracks to be the result of an initial manufacturing error .
In the weeks following the iPhones release , many owners of cracked iPhones were able to exchange their cracked models for new ones .
The plaintiff , however , does not seem to have attempted a return or exchange of his cracked iPhone at all .
Apple products are known to be sleek and robust , and indeed , this is often a selling point for consumers .
So while some might scoff at the cracks and claim that they are merely cosmetic in nature , one should keep in mind that the cosmetic appearance of Apple products is often the key to the sale of its products .
That said , owners of cracked iPhones should , without a doubt , be allowed a replacement .
There is no basis , however , for an individual to purchase a cracked iPhone , and subsequently initiate a lawsuit claiming an implied breach of warranty when there is no evidence that that individual made any attempt to exchange his defective model .
Should Apple be a party to this lawsuit ?
Also , and has been mentioned elsewhere , the addition of Apple as a defendant in a case like this seems questionable .
Recently , AT&T ’s chief technology officer John Donovan confirmed that AT&T was not expecting the iPhone 3G to sell so well , and that as a result , its networks were ill prepared for the onslaught of devices on its 3G network .
The lawsuit , however , claims that Apple should have been aware of how many iPhones it was going to sell and that it was therefore foreseeable that the phones would strain AT&T ’s network .
This is a flawed argument because there was no way for Apple to accurately gauge just how many 3G iPhones it was going to sell right off the bat .
It of course has internal projections , but the number of iPhones that were sold even in the first weekend of its release surpassed all expectations , including investment analysts who are paid to monitor such things .
Why this lawsuit should raise some eyebrows
In today ’s lawsuit - happy society , individuals too often feel that they are owed something more that what should reasonably be required .
If an individual purchases an iPhone and it ’s 3G features do n’t work properly , then that user should be remedied .
But if that same individual claims that subsequent software upgrades have n’t helped his situation , or the situation of others , and if the basis of that claim is an outdated blogpost from August 19th , eyebrows should be raised .
Similarly , if an individual purchases an iPhone that soon develops a crack , that user too should be remedied .
But if that individual seemingly makes no attempt to return or exchange that iPhone , should his cracked iPhone be the basis for a lawsuit ?
Even companies with the strictest of product quality testing bring to market products that develop unforeseen defects and problems .
In such a scenario , customers should absolutely be given the right to either receive a new product , or return the product for a refund .
In this case , however , the Plaintiff appears to have attempted neither .
Moreover , there is no evidence that the cracks affect functionality , and in terms of wear and tear , the iPhone seems as resilient as any other phone on the market .
In the end , Apple is a company just like any other .
Sometimes its products do n’t work as expected , but that ’s not to say that every lawsuit against them is warranted .
Frivlous lawsuits ultimately result in higher prices for consumers , and only serve to put money in the pockets of lawyers .
Again , this latest lawsuit against Apple seems to largely be based on a number of outdated blogposts , the majority of which were written in July of 2008 , just 2 - 3 weeks after the iPhone 3G was launched .
By skirting around the fact that the latest iPhone firmware update seems to have overwhelmingly fixed any remaining iPhone 3G reception problems , and by seemingly making no effort to return or exchange his iPhone , the Plaintiff in this case seems to have filed what can only be described as a frivolous lawsuit .
The officials , with trade experts , blame America for overstating the potential dangers of certain goods or passing on tips about illicit shipments that are inaccurate or too vague to act .
“ They like to exaggerate , or at least try to point to some strategic significance of the item , like saying , ‘ This software program could be used to design nuclear power plants , ’ even if someone is just buying it to draw puppies and flowers , ” said Clif Burns , an export control lawyer at Powell Goldstein in Washington .
American officials have been increasingly alarmed about trade in the United Arab Emirates since 2002 , when the Commerce Department sent an inspector , Mary O’Brien , there .
From her spot checks of factories , freight forwarders and other companies that had ordered American products subject to export controls , Commerce officials say , it was clear that dual - use goods , including computer equipment , were being diverted on a grander scale than imagined .
An entity said to be a woodworking shop , for example , had ordered a sophisticated American machine for making metal parts .
The device , Ms. O’Brien knew , could also shape components for a missile system .
The supposed factory contained almost no sawdust , and the few employees could not explain how they intended to use the machine .
“ This is not right , ” Ms. O’Brien said she had said to herself , convinced that she had turned up her first “ briefcase business ”  open for inspection , but closed for good as soon as she walked out .
She pressed a Dubai pistachio wholesaler on why he had bought an American infrared camera , which can detect living objects in the dark , and where it had gone .
Later she found he had arranged its return from Iran , where it had apparently been diverted , while stalling a follow - up inspection .
In nearly 40 percent of her inspections in four years , she found that regulated items were missing or that the recipient would not cooperate .
Many of those companies were placed on a list , warning American exporters to be careful when selling to them .

The media narrative now being woven around the apparent suicide of U.S. government scientist Bruce E. Ivins  a prominent anthrax researcher who worked at Ft. Detrick ’s U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases bio-weapons research lab ( USAMRIID )  is that he was a lone nut , a " homicidal maniac " who poisoned the five people killed in the 2001 anthrax attacks and was determined to go on another killing spree at his workplace as the Feds closed in on him .
The Times of London headline says it all : " Mad Anthrax Scientist in Threat to Kill Co-Workers . "
However , as we sift through the reams of media coverage occasioned by this startling development in a 7 - year - old case , we get quite a different story from the alleged objects of his rage : his colleagues on the job at Ft. Detrick .
As the Washington Post reported :
" Colleagues and friends of the vaccine specialist remained convinced that Ivins was innocent :
They contended that he had neither the motive nor the means to create the fine , lethal powder that was sent by mail to news outlets and congressional offices in the late summer and fall of 2001 .
Mindful of previous FBI mistakes in fingering others in the case , many are deeply skeptical that the bureau has gotten it right this time .
" ’I really do n’t think he ’s the guy .
I say to the FBI , " Show me your evidence , " ’ said Jeffrey J. Adamovicz , former director of the bacteriology division at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases , or USAMRIID , on the grounds of the sprawling Army fort in Frederick .
‘ A lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support .
The FBI just continued to push his buttons . ’"
Another one of his co-workers , Richard O. Spertzel , pointed out that “ USAMRIID does n’t deal with powdered anthrax .
I do n’t think there ’s anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it .
You would need to have the opportunity , the capability , and the motivation , and he did n’t possess any of those . ”
In what seems very similar to the coordinated series of " leaks " that pinned the blame on Steven J. Hatfill , a former bio - warfare scientist recently awarded nearly $ 6 million in recompense and effectively exonerated , the effort to posthumously demonize Ivins has blanketed the " mainstream " media .
The main feature of this effort has been the testimony of one Jean Duley , a counselor , who claims Ivins not only threatened her but also came to a group therapy session with a detailed story about how he had bought a gun , a bulletproof vest , and was planning to " go out in a blaze of glory " and kill as many of his coworkers as possible as the FBI closed in on him .
It ’s passing strange , then , that these very same coworkers are springing to his defense .
Two Ft. Detrick scientists , who presumably would have been mowed down by Ivins , the so - called " revenge killer " ( as Duley describes him ) , told the Baltimore Sun they were " stunned and angry " at the posthumous targeting of Ivins .
“ Nobody thinks Bruce did it , ” said one of them .
Nobody , that is , but the FBI , Duley , and Ivins ’ estranged brother Tom , who had n’t spoken to Bruce since 1985 , and who averred , “ It makes sense , what the social worker said .
He considered himself like a god . ”
Giving credence to such crass bad - mouthing of the dead has got to be a new low , even for the agenda - driven " journalism " we ’ve become so inured to .
As doubts arise about the government / media narrative , it is becoming all too clear that Ivins ’ suicide  likely brought about by the unrelenting pressure brought to bear on him over many months of constant harassment by the FBI , rather than actual guilt  is the occasion for the institutional whitewashing of the FBI ’s almost unbelievable incompetence , which seems more like a cover - up as events unfold .
We are being treated to media reports burbling about how the suicide of Ivins means that the victims of the anthrax attack and their families will finally have " closure "  but what ’s all too clear is that it ’s the FBI seeking closure of a case that exposes its shameful ( and , perhaps , criminal ) conduct .
Move along , nothing to see here !
Or is there ?
No doubt the FBI will come out with its own version of the " scientific " evidence that supposedly led them to Ivins ’ doorstep .
We are told that " new techniques , " developed since the pursuit and eventual exoneration of Hatfill , conclusively prove Ivins was the lone culprit .
This has long been the methodology favored by anti-biological weapons activist and scientist Barbara Hatch Rosenberg , whose pronouncements in the early stages of this case were taken as gospel by the major media .
It was Rosenberg ’s theory that the anthrax killer was an " insider " with detailed knowledge of the government ’s bio -weapons research  and that his motive was to draw attention to a supposedly overlooked and under - funded field of vitally important research  that led to the persecution of Hatfill .
Today , the same theory is being trotted out to finger Ivins .
This concept of the anthrax killers ’ motive drops the entire context of the postal terrorism that put the nation in a post - 9/11 panic and energized the march to war with Iraq .
As Glenn Greenwald and others have pointed out , the anthrax attacks were used by administration officials and neoconservative commentators to make the case for war : administration officials and their amen corner ( including John McCain ) used this " talking point " to promote the invasion of Iraq .
The Rosenberg thesis also ignores the text of the anthrax letters , in which the author (s ) clearly meant to indicate these horrific acts were being perpetrated by a Muslim who hated the U.S. and Israel .
It seems to me a stretch to divorce motive not only from context , but also from important physical evidence in this case , i.e. , the letters themselves .
Other equally important evidence has been completely ignored .
Over the years , I ’ve presented much of this neglected - albeit - fascinating aspect of the anthrax mystery in a series of columns  here , here , here , here , here , and here  in which I related the story of what happened to another Ft. Detrick scientist , Dr. Ayaad Assaad .
Assaad , an American citizen born in Egypt , worked for USAMRIID in the early 1990s and was involved in a conflict with a group of Ft. Detrick employees who dubbed themselves the " Camel Club . "
As detailed in a series of eye - popping pieces by Dave Altimari and Jack Dolan of the Hartford Courant , this cabal was engaged in systematic harassment of Assaad and other Arab - American employees at the facility , including putting obscene and racist poems on his desk and presenting him with a rubber camel adorned with a sex toy .
The Camel Club ’s harassment of Assaad had a distinctively ideological edge , one that pre-dated the " invade their countries , bomb their cities , and convert them to Christianity " meme that later became so popular with post - 9/11 neocons of a Coulterish stripe .
In September 2001  before the news of the anthrax letters broke , but after they had been postmarked  a letter addressed to the " Town of Quantico police " was received that accused Assaad of being a terrorist who was planning to wage biological warfare against the U.S. on American soil .
As the first anthrax letters were opened , Assaad got a call from the FBI .
Agent Gregory Leylegian wanted to have a little talk with him .
The meeting , also attended by Assaad ’s lawyer , proved quite a shock to Assaad .
As the agent read the accusing letter aloud , one thing became readily apparent : the Camel Club was getting its revenge .
Whatever the motives of the Quantico letter ’s author , one fact seems fairly obvious : whoever wrote it very likely had foreknowledge of the anthrax attacks .
Yet all attempts to examine this vital piece of evidence have been deflected by the FBI .
Don Foster , a professor of English at Vassar and an expert in the field of textual analysis  it was Foster who identified Joe Klein as the author of Primary Colors  was asked to analyze the anthrax letters , and on the subject of the Quantico letter he had this to say in Vanity Fair :
" It was now December 2001 , yet Dolan and Altimari ’s Hartford Courant story was the first I had heard of the Quantico letter .
[ Supervisory Special Agent James R ] .
Fitzgerald had not heard of it , either .
In fact , there were quite a few critical documents that Fitzgerald had not yet seen .
What , I wondered , has the anthrax task force been doing .
Hoping that the Quantico letter might lead , if not to the killer , at least to a suspect , I offered to examine the document .
My photocopy arrived by FedEx not from the task force but from FBI headquarters in Washington .
Searching through documents by some 40 USAMRIID employees , I found writings by a female officer that looked like a perfect match .
I wrote a detailed report on the evidence , but the anthrax task force declined to follow through : the Quantico letter had already been declared a hoax and zero - filed as part of the 9/11 investigation . "
" The trail that leads us to the perpetrators of the anthrax letter terrorist attacks ends at Ft. Detrick " 
I wrote those words in July , before the suicide of Ivins , yet we have n’t quite yet reached the end of this particular road .
Foster refers to the yeoman ’s work done by the Hartford Courant ‘s team of reporters in uncovering the chaotic and dangerous conditions that existed at Ft. Detrick for years , as well as the victimization of Assaad .
One Courant story in particular , which detailed the wide variety of pathogens the facility lost track of over the years  including one developed by U.S. scientists known simply as " Pathogen X "  sent chills down my spine .
In exposing this laxity , the Courant reported an incident in which a former employee , Dr. Philip Zack , was videotaped sneaking into the supposedly secured facility where pathogens were stored , assisted by his " good friend " Dr. Marian Rippy .
They were both involved in conducting unauthorized experiments , according to Dolan and Altimari , and were charter members of the Camel Club .
Indeed , the reason for Zack ’s departure reportedly had much to do with his constant harassment of Assaad .
I make no connection between Rippy and Foster ’s discovery of " writings by a female officer that looked like a perfect match " to the Quantico letter .
It ’s just that inquiring minds want to know
The suicide of one tortured soul does n’t put the anthrax mystery to rest .
Instead , it raises more questions than it answers .
According to the obituary in his hometown newspaper , Ivins worked at Ft. Detrick for his entire professional life : he was there for the Camel Club ’s antics and doubtless knew all the major participants , including Assaad .
What he knew about the highly suspicious extracurricular activities of the Camel Club , and the true origins of the deadly anthrax letters , is not known , and may never be known as this point .
And that ’s just how the real perpetrators of one of the scariest crimes in our history would have it .
You ’ll note I use the plural , perpetrators : it is almost inconceivable that a single person could have been responsible for the anthrax terror .
Logistically , it ’s near to impossible to imagine that a single " lone nut " could have produced the anthrax , let alone distributed it , without being caught .
Did he travel all the way to New Jersey , of all places , just to mail these deadly missives , after single - handedly whipping up a substance that required all sorts of advanced equipment ( and safety precautions ) to prepare ?
It hardly seems likely .
Which means that , even if Ivins was in on the plot , he was n’t alone  and the rest of the poisoners are still out there .
Did Ivins wind up a " suicide " because he knew too much and was about to reveal what he knew to investigators ?
We may never know the answer to this question , but that should hardly stop us from raising it .
This whole sorry episode exemplifies media complicity with U.S. government agencies in creating narratives that reflect well on official Washington .
The wide dissemination of the Ivins - was - a - psychopathic - killer meme , which depicts the departed scientist as an " obsessed " nerd who was a danger to his therapist  actually , Duley was n’t his therapist , and her charge that Ivins was a " sociopath " is based on her version of what his actual psychiatrist , Dr. David Irwin , is reputed to have said  underscores the American media ’s evolving role as the handmaiden of the state , rather than the citizens ’ watchdog .
We ’ve been covering this scary story at Antiwar.com ever since the anthrax attacks hit the headlines , and we ’ve continued to cover it even while the rest of the media tried to bury it .
I believe that practically every year since 2001 I ’ve written about it in this space and noted many of the facts related above .
The sudden reemergence of this case in this spectacular manner emphasizes the need for outlets like this one , which present the facts the " mainstream " media would rather not deal with  because they ’re too busy creating phony narratives to cover the asses of government officials , or worse .
Eight new natural wonders , including the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in Mexico and what has been dubbed " the Galápagos of the Indian Ocean , " have been added to the World Heritage List .
World Heritage Sites are named by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) .
The sites , both cultural and natural , added to the list are deemed " of outstanding value to humanity " and deserve protection and preservation , according to the UNESCO Web site .
With the new additions , the World Heritage List now boasts 878 sites ( 679 cultural , 174 natural and 25 mixed ) in 145 countries .
The eight new natural sites added this year include :
Joggins Fossil Cliffs ( Canada )
Mount Sanqingshan National Park ( China )
Lagoons of New Caledonia : Reef Diversity and Associated Ecosystems ( France )
Surtsey ( Iceland )
Saryarka - Steppe and Lakes of Northern Kazakhstan ( Kazakhstan )
Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve ( Mexico )
Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona ( Switzerland )
Socotra Archipelago ( Yemen )
" These eight stunning natural sites are amongst the best of what nature has to offer , " said David Sheppard , head of the IUCN 's Protected Areas Program , which recommended the sites .
( IUCN stands for International Union for Conservation of Nature . )
Below are details on all the sites :
The Socotra Archipelago is known as " the Galápagos of the Indian Ocean " and is home to 825 plant species of which 37 percent can only be found there .
Ninety percent of its reptile species can be found nowhere else .
Its marine life is also diverse , with 253 species of reef - building corals , 730 species of coastal fish and 300 species of crab , lobster and shrimp .
Socotra is already well set up for long - term conservation , IUCN officials say , as about 75 percent of its land area is already included in natural sanctuaries and national parks .
The Joggins Fossil Cliffs have also drawn a comparison to the diverse Pacific Islands made famous by Charles Darwin 's work , as they are sometimes called " the Coal Age Galápagos . "
The cliffs are considered to be an excellent reference site to the Coal Age ( about 300 million years ago ) .
The rocks there bear witness to the first reptiles in Earth 's history and preserve upright fossil trees .
" This is a fascinating site where you can literally see a slice of history , " said Tim Badman , World Heritage advisor of IUCN 's Protected Areas Program .
Surtsey , a new island formed by volcanic eruptions off the southern coast of Iceland from 1963 to 1967 , is interesting for the new life forms that have settled there .
The young bit of land has provided a unique scientific record of the ways in which plants and animals colonize land .
The Mariposa Monarca Biosphere Reserve protects eight areas of wintering habitat of the monarch butterfly in the oyamel fir forests of central Mexico .
After traveling thousands of kilometers , as many as a billion monarchs overwinter there .
More than 200,000 hectares of Central Asian steppe , a vast region of open grassland , is found in Saryarka , Kazakhstan — more than half of it is pristine .
The area 's Korgalzhyn - Tengiz lakes provide feeding grounds to around 16 million birds and support hundreds of thousands of nesting waterfowl .
" The wetlands of Korgalzhyn and Naurzum State Nature Reserves are key stopover points for migratory birds , " Sheppard said .
" Some of these species are globally threatened .
Saryarka offers them a safe haven on their journeys from Africa , Europe and South Asia to their breeding grounds in Western and Eastern Siberia . "
Saryarka is also home to the critically endangered saiga antelope ( Saiga tatarica ) .
Mount Sanqingshan National Park in China was selected for its " outstanding natural beauty , " the IUCN said .
The park features a diverse forest and unusual granite rock formations , including shaped pillars and peaks , which can be viewed from suspended walking trails .
The Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona , on the other hand , was picked for its geological value ; it features a dramatic display of mountain - building , including an area called the Glarus Overthrust , where older rock overlays younger rock .
The highly diverse coral reef ecosystems of the Lagoons of New Caledonia put it on the new list — they equal or possibly surpass the larger Great Barrier Reef in coral and fish diversity .
These eight natural sites were accompanied by 27 cultural sites as inductees into the World Heritage program .
The IUCN also helps monitor conservation at the natural sites .
It has deemed several World Heritage sites as under threat , including the Galápagos Islands , in Ecuador , Machu Picchu , in Peru , and Virunga National Park , in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Wi -Fi is heading skyward .
Delta Air Lines Inc. announced Tuesday that it would begin offering the service -- for a fee -- on its domestic flights this fall .
The airline expects to outfit 330 planes by next summer , making it the first major U.S. carrier to offer Wi-Fi on its entire domestic fleet ( not including regional subsidiaries such as its Comair service ) .
“ Our customers asked for in - flight connectivity , and we ’re responding by rolling out the most extensive Wi-Fi network in the sky , ” said Richard Anderson , Delta ’s chief executive .
Delta will use Aircell ’s Gogo service .
It will cost $ 9.95 for flights three hours or shorter and $ 12.95 for longer flights .
Delta will offer it first on its MD - 88 and MD - 90 planes and expand to its Boeing 737s , 757s and 767s by next summer , the company said .

American Airlines has been testing Gogo and plans to offer Wi-Fi on selected flights , including those from Los Angeles International Airport to New York ’s John F. Kennedy International Airport .
Virgin America also will be offering the service , according to Aircell .
Gogo says it turns the plane ’s cabin into a Wi -Fi hot spot , allowing laptops , smart phones and PDAs to access the Internet .
( Cellphone calls are forbidden in U.S. skies , but the European Union is making that technological leap . )
Aircell said everyone on a flight can use Gogo , which allows streaming audio and video but not voice - over - Internet services such as Skype .

Do you feel your career is stagnating ?
Does it seem there is not much room for growth in the workplace ?
Then perhaps you need to make a huge career move by learning about coding .
With people becoming more dependent on technology , the need to learn how to code becomes more glaring than ever .
Though some areas in the United States are teaching coding in their classrooms , there is still a lot more grounds to cover .
Since you ’re already working , one of the best ways is to join a coding bootcamp .
But do coding bootcamps work ?
Is paying for a bootcamp worth the investment ?
Continue reading below as we discuss how joining one can help take your career to the next level .
What Is Coding ?
Before you join any coding bootcamp , you must first understand what coding is .
In layman ’s terms , coding is writing a programming language .
This language serves as the script that the computer understands .
It is the script that tells the computer how it performs certain tasks .
It also determines the way a computer behaves and acts .
Coding also helps developers create apps , computer software , and websites .
Though coding may seem easy to understand , the reality is it involves numerous intricacies .
Though there are online coding tutorials available , they still do not match the benefits a bootcamp offers .
Joining a camp helps you learn faster .
Since you are following a program , you have no choice but to follow the camp ’s schedule .
Moreover , you get to enjoy both a cohesive curriculum and mentorship .
Combine these two and you ’ll progress faster .
Coding Bootcamp : Reasons to Join One
Though some may feel joining a coding bootcamp is more of an expense , they can not be any farther from the truth .
Let ’s take a look at some of the biggest ways a bootcamp can help you in your career and as a person .
Save More Money
Even if you have to pay certain fees , joining a bootcamp will save you more money .
Compared to what you have to pay in universities , bootcamps are relatively cheaper .
Some bootcamps like Azure DevOps Bootcamp charge you under $ 2,000 for a six - week course .
Others may charge a bit higher , depending on the features of the packages .
On the flip side , enrolling in some of the bigger schools can cost you around $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 a year .
Focus More on the Subject
Another benefit of joining a bootcamps is you can focus more on the subject .
Since universities offer a broader curriculum , you may take some courses and subjects that do not relate much to coding .
Meanwhile , bootcamps allow you to focus solely on coding .
Bootcamps do not come with general education requirements .
The subjects are all about coding and programming .
Furthermore , you can expect intense lessons .
Some bootcamps use a structure similar to that of a full - time job .
This means spending 40 hours a week in classes at the very least .
Furthermore , you will get more attention from your instructors .
Considering the smaller size of your bootcamp class to a university setting , your teachers can focus more on your inquiries .
They can guide you much better as the lessons become harder .
Get More Motivation
Considering how tough the coding lessons are , bootcamps allow you to draw extra motivation from your classmates .
Coders require a dependable support network .
These are people who share the same ideas and interests that they have about coding and programming .
In a bootcamp , you have fellow students encouraging and supporting one another .
Moreover , you and your classmates can hold one another accountable .
You can remind each other of your home works and other tasks .
You can share ideas especially when solving problems .
You can develop teamwork and strengthen relationships .
Enjoy a Higher Starting Salary
After completing the bootcamp and acquiring new coding knowledge , you can command a higher salary .
Whether you ’re applying to a new company or aiming for a promotion , you can pitch for a higher paycheck than before .
Newbies who only learned about coding upon joining a bootcamp make an average of a little over $ 70,000 on their first jobs .
Furthermore , you can enjoy an average salary increase of 50.5 % .
This is more than enough to cover your bootcamp expenses .
Additionally , you will have more confidence to say “ no ” to prospective employers who lowball you .
With your knowledge , you know that other lucrative opportunities are waiting for you .
Make More Impact
With your knowledge of coding , you are likely to make a bigger impact on the tech industry .
You can now understand technical conversations that you never thought you would understand .
You can participate in discussions that involve complex terminologies involving programming .
In turn , you can provide your inputs and suggestions .
You can become a catalyst for change and improvement .
Open Up New Networks
Joining a bootcamp also gives you a chance to expand your network .
You can connect with other tech professionals who can link you to different job opportunities .
You will never know who you will bump into in a bootcamp .
There are fresh graduates and there are professionals who wish to expand their skillset .
Others who have links to large companies are always in need of coders and programmers .
Who knows , you may even find a potential business partner .
Build Your Career
Last but not least , you can build your career in many different ways .
First , you can join a company that offers lucrative paychecks for coders .
You can work as a software developer or a tech consultant .
You can also take on the path of a freelancer .
Several companies outsource manpower .
You will find numerous firms that are looking for freelance coders .
The good thing about this is you can arrange your schedule and demand the rates that you want .
Additionally , you can look into opportunities outside the tech industry .
There are opportunities outside computer science that require a high level of understanding of coding languages .
Never Stop Learning
Joining a coding bootcamp is an investment that goes a long way .
Not only will you gain valuable knowledge , but you will also expand your network and open up new opportunities .
But learning never stops inside a bootcamp .

In an IGN interview with Cliff Bleszinski , it was revealed by Cliff that Gears of War 2 would not be coming to the PC .
The point of interest came up in a question about Gears 2 ’s “ Linked Achievements ” and the Achievement portability with an account from Games for Windows Live .
Cliff said that if you use the same gamertag as you had with the original Windows version on your 360 , you would get the retroactive content .
When prompted about a PC version of Gears 2 , Cliff spilled the beans :
Gears of War is a great franchise first and foremost for Xbox 360 , and therefore we 're focusing on that platform for Gears of War 2 .
We 've decided we 're not going to do a PC version this time around .
Community member Too Much Coffee Man and I echo the same sentiment in this matter .
It ’s really unfortunate that the series will not be hitting the PC because of its visual quality and originality .
But , the lack of a PC version means that we will get all of the goodies on the Xbox 360 that we should have had last time around .
Since my Macintosh ca n’t run anything past Tetris clones and World of Warcraft , I ’m not too injured by this statement and therefore will eagerly consume all of the exclusive Xbox 360 content greedily .
Kriminalität Republik im Raster
Der tödliche Holzklotz - Anschlag in Oldenburg zeigt , wie selbstverständlich sich Fahnder mittlerweile der massenhaften Auswertung von Telefondaten bedienen .
Juristen bezweifeln allerdings die Rechtmäßigkeit der Ermittlungsmethode .
The existence of a prototype management system for anti-piracy company ' Logistep ' was revealed at the weekend .
The online system called ' Logistep Data Management Tool ' , was located at eparken.com but since the revelations the site has been taken down .
It is still available in limited form via Google 's cache .
The P2P community is becoming more aware of the anti-piracy tracking company Logistep .
Infamous for working with lawyers across Europe gathering information about many thousands of alleged copyright infringements , Logistep is quickly becoming a household name in the anti-P2P world .
It has been declared to operate illegally in Italy and has fallen foul of Swiss privacy laws , but it carries on operating regardless .
Now , thanks to a Gulli investigation , the existence of a prototype anti-p2 p management system has been revealed , which seems to be being developed for Logistep to more effectively manage its growing offensive against alleged file - sharers .
Gulli received a tipoff to visit the site at eparken.com which although appeared incomplete , seemed to be fairly operational .
Headed with a Logistep banner and entitled ‘ Logistep Data Management Tool ’ , one could be forgiven for linking the tool with the anti-piracy company of the same name .
However , just to be certain , Gulli dug a little deeper , checking the WHOIS record of the site which revealed the registrant as Joly Nkondo Zacharie , at ‘ HÃ¤ndelstraÃŸe 25 ’ in Karlsruhe .
A German subsidiary of the Swiss - based Logistep is reported at the same address .
Searches on ‘ HÃ¤ndelstraÃŸe 25 ’ connect to both Logistep and Joly Nkondo Zacharie , who has his name present in the eparken .com WHOIS .
The connection to Logistep seems unavoidable .
The site , since taken down but available in limited form via Google ’s cache , appears to offer management facilities for those chasing alleged copyright infringers , including accommodation to reduce ‘ fines ’ and payment periods if the accused digs in his heels when confronted .
Additional features of the system include being able to sort alleged infringers in the database by location and their corresponding ISPs .
It is also possible to sort by the number of users who have actually paid up following threats .
In the ‘ Call Center ’ section could be found receipts for payment of ‘ fines ’ and the ability to change the terms of the compensation demands .
Logistep is absolutely adamant that it runs its operations in a completely flawless manner , using systems that produce 100 % perfect results so it is of some interest that this online system has been developed with WYSIWYG Web Builder , which will be seen as some as a very unprofessional way to create a website .
Calls to the administrators of eparken.com for clarification have gone unanswered .
In the coming week , I ’m going to drive about 1,200 miles through four states .
During that journey , I ’ll cross bridges over several significant rivers , including the Hudson and Connecticut rivers .
The bridges I ’ll cross are older than I am â€ ” and I ’m no spring chicken .
I ’ll drive over â€ ” and under â€ ” numerous highway overpasses .
Most of them , too , will be older than I am .
Since Aug. 1 , 2007 , I ’m more aware of wondering about the condition of those bridges and overpasses that carry me to and from here and there .
Are they safe ?
A year ago , the I - 35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed during evening rush hour , killing 13 people and injuring hundreds more .
Politicians everywhere immediately called for ( harrumph , harrumph ) the inspection of and repairs to the nation ’s thousands and thousands of deteriorating bridges .
One year later , how much has been accomplished to allay travelers ’ fears of another bridge collapse ?
Diddley squat .
Robert Tanner , Steve Karnowski and Frank Bass of the Associated Press reported today “ [ a ] year after the worst U.S. bridge collapse in a generation brought calls for immediate repairs to other spans , two of every three of the busiest problem bridges in each state â€ ” carrying nearly 40 million vehicles a day â€ ” have had no work beyond regular maintenance ” [ emphasis added ] .
The three newsmen reviewed “ repairs on each state ’s 20 most - traveled bridges with structural deficiencies found just 12 percent have been fixed ” [ emphasis added ] .
In another piece of exceptional reporting by the AP , reporters Tanner , Karnowski and Bass collected data on 1,020 bridges in 48 states .
Here ’s what they found :
â€¢ Sixty - four percent of the bridges received no work beyond regular maintenance , though most were targeted for some kind of future work .
â€¢ Twelve percent had their structural defects fixed â€ ” usually through a major rehabilitation or outright replacement .
â€ ¢
An additional 24 percent have seen a partial improvement , either through a short - term repair to temporarily address the defect or an ongoing project that is not yet complete .
[ emphasis added ]
The worst states ?
“ Indiana , Oklahoma , New Hampshire and South Carolina , where work was conducted on only one of each state ’s 20 most heavily traveled structurally deficient bridges , ” they wrote .
( I ’ll be driving through New Hampshire next week .
Pray for me , please . )
Well , surely Congress has stepped up to the plate over the past year , right ?
Nope .
Despite having a few ( although bad ) bills filed almost immediately after the I - 35W bridge collapsed , Congress has provided no substantial , effective leadership on immediate bridge remediation â€ ” or dealt significantly with any of the other significant needs in highways , sewerage , public drinking water , airports , seaports and other public facilities brought on by long - deferred maintenance .
Will Congress act soon ?
Nope .
All 535 of our members of Congress , who are paid at minimum $ 169,000 a year by taxpayers , and many of whom are millionaires , are by law and tradition entering their annual sabbatical â€ ” the August recess .
In short , these characters have earned their declining job approval rating , now at 13 percent , by doing zilch to address public infrastructure needs .
For the next month , instead of dealing with the public ’s problems , your members of Congress are going to be out and about the district , meetin ’ and greetin ’ constituents , and acceptin ’ campaign donations â€ ” hey , it ’s an election year .
When Sen. Idiot or Rep. Bozo kisses your baby or shakes your hand , do n’t let go .
Pull ’em in close , look ’em in the eye , and say :
Fix things , goddamn it .
Then threaten to vote for his or her opponent .
That might get some attention .

" It 's got a picture of you looking hot , " he said .
A similar heat related joke told to any Phoenix resident would come off as trite , but somehow Izzard 's impish grin and predilection to inserting F - bombs in his charming British way makes even a joke about how hot it is in Phoenix seem new again .
Fried egg , anyone ?
Izzard exposed the audience to his rambling , comedic style for nearly two hours sometimes forgoing speaking entirely to get jokes across with exaggerated body movement and sound effects produced using only a microphone .
The one coherent message Izzard through into his rant - filled routine was also the most succinct thing he said all night :
" You 've got an election this year .
Do n't fuck it up .
Vote for Barack Obama ; then you 'll be able to travel the world and not pretend you 're Canadian . "
But Lewis
Black this was not and while Izzard did inject a few political musings into his act , the majority consisted of jazz chickens , the existence ( or lack thereof ) of God , mime routines , dinosaurs , boats and of course Charles Darwin 's famous book " Monkey Monkey Monkey Monkey Monkey Monkey You " .
And it is from this obscure assortment of topics from the night 's show that we present to you the top 10 things Eddie Izzard said last night that make even less sense taken out of context .
Truth the be told , they did n't make that much more sense last night , but they did have the Orpheum 's audience in stitches .
10 . " You ca n't mime a religion "
9 . " No one does air oboe , do they ? "
8. Speaking about dinosaurs : " We 're pretty sure ' Ah , fuck it ' was the last thing they said . "
7 . " One thing was big before language and that was Scrabble .
No one lost ! "
6 . " I 'm not actually a transvestite , it was a tax thing that I did . "
5 . " You are an oxymoron ... without the front bit . "
4 . " Then we 'll kill gophers , helicopters and the color indigo . "
3 . As God : " Then we film it and make snuff spider movies . "
2 . " We 're gonna kill you .
I 'm sorry .
If you 've got a Kit - Kat you can just go . "
1. Speaking about elephants : " Squirrels in toasters ?
Yeah , a bit like that . "
I do apologize to anyone who has posted a comment in the last year or so .
We really did move and I also have n't been very active on this blog .
I just went ...

After further work on PlainConfig , and in the light of the impending 0.8 release , it was decided that PlainConfig really does n’t belong in xmonad - contrib .
No one is going to use PlainConfig from their xmonad.hs , that completely misses the point .
Cabal does n’t provide an easy parallel to having make for ordinary contrib and make plainconfig for a PlainConfig - ready binary .
Considering all this , it would be far simpler to have the PlainConfig functionality as a separate Cabalized project with the binary target , that can be configured using ~/.xmonad/xmonad.conf and does n’t depend on GHC for configuration .
With that , xmonad - light was born .
It bears only some resemblance to the XMonad .
Config .
PlainConfig module currently in xmonad - contrib .
I had modified it heavily in my local repository before splitting it into xmonad - light , and never pushed it due to the 0.8 release freeze .
Misconceptions
To be perfectly clear , let me explain a few things xmonad - light is , and is not .
Most importantly , xmonad - light is not a fork of xmonad !
It depends on xmonad and xmonad - contrib for building .
Rather it is an alternative configuration framework for xmonad , and will be distributed as a binary which has been statically linked to xmonad and xmonad - contrib .
xmonad - light is not a sign that xmonad has crippled its configuration , or has moved away from Haskell configurations .
The goal of xmonad - light is not to replace Haskell configurations , but to provide an alternative with a much more gradual learning curve .
The xmonad.conf to xmonad.hs compiler ( see below ) makes the transition to a more powerful config easy .
This is almost inevitable given the often - seen ramp - up in users ’ desire for customization .
xmonad - light is a standalone binary , that does not depend on GHC , xmonad or xmonad - contrib to run on a user ’s machine .
It has been statically linked against a version of xmonad and xmonad - contrib , namely whatever version was registered with ghc - pkg when xmonad - light was built .
When xmonad - light is executed , it will look for ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs .
Yes , the Haskell file .
If it exists , xmonad - light will try to execute it as xmonad normally does .
If this fails ( GHC error , GHC does n’t exist , xmonad not installed / registered , etc. ) or the xmonad .hs does n’t exist , it then looks for ~/.xmonad/xmonad.conf and uses that .
If neither file exists , it will run the default xmonad config .
When moving to Haskell configuration files , users will need to install xmonad , xmonad - contrib , and GHC normally , as they do now to install and configure xmonad .
It will be possible ( due to the sequence described above ) to mod+q from xmonad - light to normal xmonad .
Current Features
xmonad - light currently supports everything PlainConfig did , which is to say basic configuration of most of the parts of an xmonad.hs .
It ’s easier to list the omissions and caveats , which are :
Layouts are selected from a predefined list , which currently includes only the standard three .
Any key sequence , including submaps , can be bound using EZConfig syntax , but the actions are selected from a list .
This list includes all the actions required to reproduce the defaults , and can spawn anything .
anything .
ManageHook conditions are fully expressive , but the actions are selected only from doIgnore , doFloat and doShift " workspace " .
conditions are fully expressive , but the actions are selected only from , and .
No support for logHook s .
s. No support for ManageDocks .
The former three are easily expanded to include more layouts and actions as necessary .
The latter two are both on my to - do list before releasing a first version of xmonad - light .
The other notable feature is that the compiler from xmonad.conf to xmonad.hs is complete , and supports all the same features as the main part of xmonad - light .
Testing ( calling it thorough would be to describe having an umbrella as being prepared for a hurricane ) has shown that using the generated xmonad.hs works ( ie. ghc accepts it ) and that the resulting configuration appears to match the xmonad.conf .
This functionality will be accessed with a command - line option to the xmonad - light binary .
Usability and Stability
xmonad - light is usabile in the sense that it works , and one could actually use it to configure xmonad without GHC .
It is not usable in the sense that there ’s no easy way to get and install it yet .
There are no known bugs in the code .
xmonad - light is stable in the sense that the API ( the xmonad.conf format ) is likely to change only by addition of new features .
It is unstable in the sense that code and API changes are coming ( see below for features I plan to add imminently and in the longer term ) .
To-Do
In roughly descending order of priority :
Support for ManageDocks .
. Support for logHook s ( probably just basic dzenPP , xmobarPP ) .
s ( probably just basic , ) .
Actually add the - - to - haskell command - line option .
command - line option .
Release a version guaranteed to work against the 0.8 release of xmonad .
Add more layouts , key actions and ManageHook actions as they are desired by users .
Contributing
This has so far been my baby , but I would welcome input ( in the form of comments or code ) on the design or implementation .
The code is available as a darcs repository :
darcs get http://code.haskell.org/~shepheb/xmonad-light
The one part of the code that bothers me is the seemingly large amount of duplication , with often nearly identical functions for the XConfig output and the Haskell code output .
However , I ca n’t see a way to do it more generally .
Conclusion
I ’m off to add ManageDocks support .

A Chicago bar has installed a timely work of art celebrating the human form : a nude portrait of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin posing with a gun ( a phallic symbol ! )
Two questions : Why ?
And , um ... wanna see ?
A semi-NSFW version of the painting , and the creepy story behind it , after the jump .
Here 's what the artist , Bruce Elliott , told the Windy Citizen about how the idea came to him :
" The idea for the painting came to him a week earlier when he noticed his daughter Grace , who works behind the bar , was performing an uncanny Sarah Palin impression .
" My daughter is a heck of a stand - in for Sarah Palin .
She can even do the voice , " he said . "
Thank you , America .

Why is Senator Jim Webb the only national figure focused on the prison economy ?
I find it so very exciting that Senator Jim Webb continue to question the US incarceration rate and to explore the economic consequences of mass incarceration and criminal justice drug policies .
Senator Webb 's congressional hearing on these topics this week is nicely reviewed in this Nation piece , and it ends with an encouraging report that Senator Webb is just getting revved up :
With this hearing , Senator Webb continues to lead a much overdue Congressional reaction to the US 's failing drug policy .
Indeed two colleagues on the committee , Senator Amy Klobuchar and Representative Maurice Hinchey praised Senator Webb for his " courage . "
And do n't expect the Senator to back off any time soon .
His press secretary , Kimberly Hunter , e-mailed me following the hearing , " Senator Webb has been interested in the US incarceration rate and drug policies since he was a journalist studying the Japanese prison system in 1984 .... [ This ] issue is far from popular but needs to be debated in the public view .
With every hearing , his efforts help to raise the awareness of the American people and draw attention to a problem that is easier to ignore then address head - on . "
Also encouraging is that , as detailed in this new Wall Street Journal article , Senator Webb may soon have an even bigger stage from which to draw attention to these issues .
I sincerely hope that Senator Webb will continue to make these issues a priority even if he becomes Senator Obama 's VP choice .
What mystifies me , however , is the failure of any other national politicians to talk seriously about these issues .
As Senator Webb is rightfully highlighting , mass incarceration and failed US drug policies are very , very costly for national , state and local governments .
I think modern bloated criminal justice systems are a telling example of big government gone bad .
And yet , with all the government bashing and economic hand - wringing , it seem that Senator Webb is still among a rare few politicians with the courage to explore important policy realities without an undue and misguided concern about political rhetoric .

It is very sad that it takes courage for a senator to hold a hearing on an important public policy issue .
Obviously Senator Webb is a leader and I hope he will be joined by others .
I have no idea what the Office of National Drug Policy Control does other than testify before congressional committees but in this case they did not show up .
No doubt they were afraid of Professor Peter Reuter how pathetic can you get ?

My Husband received 8 years in prison along with co-defendants for importing lobster tails from Honduras ( violation of the lacey act . )
This case should have been nothing more than civil remedies .
He sold his lobster tails to Red lobster Resturant .
Please read See Quinn Hillyer 's article beow dated june 13 , 2008 , which pretty well sums up our lobster case .
Thanks Dianne Blandford .
Violent prisoners are released , because the prisons are so full , yet my husband along with co defendants remain in prison
Commentary
Quin Hillyer : Crustacean frustration
Quin Hillyer
2008-06-13 07:00:00.0
Current rank : # 1,100 of 8,003
WASHINGTON -
When the story first broke in 1999 , the Mobile Register played it tongue - in - cheek .
“ The defendants , ” wrote reporter Mike Wilson , “ have proved model prisoners , detained at present at minus 8 degrees Fahrenheit . ”
The originally named defendants were 70,787 pounds of spiny lobster tails .
Less than 5 percent of them were , horror of horrors , too short – which may or may not have been a violation of Honduran sea-harvest laws .
Even worse , the dastardly tails entered Bayou La Batre , Ala. , not in the required cardboard containers , but in plastic .
Again , Honduran law may have been violated .
U.S. prosecutors , perceiving a dangerous conspiracy , stopped bothering the lobsters and threw their net at the lobster importers .
Using something called the Lacey Act , which makes it illegal in the United States to import goods in contravention of another nation ’s laws , the prosecutors began building their case .
And building , and building .
Because all of the lobster , not just the tails adjudged too short , was in the wrong packaging , that bumped up the “ value ” of the amount in violation .
And if it were an illegal import , well , that made it “ smuggling , ” right ?
And if the importers used the money they earned to buy any goods in the United States , well , that turned the case into “ money laundering . ”
Suddenly , the allegation of minor civil violations became a major criminal case .
Three defendants were given sentences of – get this !
– eight years each .
In federal prison .
To enforce a foreign regulation .
About undersized lobsters .
Never mind that the importers openly took the lobsters through Customs , seemingly unaware they were doing anything wrong .
Never mind that the U.S. Department of Commerce published an official price list for Honduran lobsters of the very sizes supposedly outlawed .
Never mind that one of the importers was a Honduran businessman , David Henson McNab , who willingly returned repeatedly to the United States to defend himself , apparently thinking it was all a misunderstanding .
And never mind that from the very start , there was conflicting , expert testimony about whether Honduran law was violated at all .
The original trial judge , citing a midlevel Honduran official , allowed the trial to continue , all the way to convictions .
Later , when the attorney general of Honduras (! ) wrote to say the regulations at issue had been repealed four years before this case began , the appeals court said it was too late .
“ There must be some finality with representations of foreign law by foreign governments , ” wrote the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals .
So : Prison !
Even though no existing law had been violated .
McNab and his American co-defendants applied for executive pardons or commutations .
No response .
Finally , in December 2004 , the president of Honduras – yes , the president of the whole country , Ricardo Maduro – wrote a letter to President Bush .
“ In the case of Mr. McNab , ” Maduro wrote , “ all the legal bodies of Honduras … have determined that Mr. McNab has not violated any law of Honduras … .
I believe the interest of justice will be best served if you assent to the request for clemency . ”
No such luck .
Miguel Estrada , the brilliant lawyer whose judicial nomination ( by Bush ) was famously filibustered by Democratic senators , represented McNab on appeal .
Estrada ’s administration connections did not help .
“ No one has done squat about it , ” he told me this week , in frustration .
“ I never got the time of day . ”
In retrospect , well - meaning prosecutors did what they always do :
Take seriously their charge to enforce environmental laws .
But the courts badly mishandled the case .
It was a case in which the U.S. government claimed to enforce Honduran law , but where the Honduran government said the law no longer exists , and for which there was no U.S. violation unrelated to the original non-offense .
And one defendant was a Honduran who by logic ( if not law ) should be under the jurisdiction of his own country rather than this one , all about an “ offense ” that most people would find inoffensive .
President Bush ought to cut through the idiotic red tape at the Department of Justice and pardon all three defendants , immediately .
For co-defendants Robert Blandford and Abner Schoenwetter , Americans who began serving their time three years later than McNab did , a pardon would give them back their freedom .
For McNab , who finally is due to be released on Sept. 4 , a pardon will merely clear his record .
This case has been an abominable injustice from the start .

Even though the Wall Street Journal article did n't say anything about Webb 's mission to shine a light on our incarceration policies , I was very happy to see him portrayed as a contender and a coming force in our political dialog .
There is n't much more to say about the state of our criminal justice system .
Unfortunately Mr. McNab's case is one where we use prisons egregiously for non violent offenders .
In many cases we can't be clear about the offense .
Being sorry will not give him back his life .
Posted by : beth curtis | Jun 21 , 2008 8:24:24 PM
I believe that the only reason Mr. Webb is standing alone on this issue is because the others have accepted the prison system as big business .
I have heard it from a prison camp staff myself , as long as the prison is full , his job was secure .
How sad , to incarcerate people for a paycheck .

More people are employed by prisons than Wal - Mart , the nation 's largest private employer .
And because conservatives have been so successful in outsourcing ( for profit ) core government functions like building and running prisons , there is now a large private prison industry , .
The economic impact , in terms of GDP , therefore cuts both ways , although both ways are socially negative ( which is why GDP is a meaningless statistic ) .
The fact of the matter is our brand of capitalism cannot employ all the people we have .
So a good chuck of 'em get warehoused and another good chunk of 'em get paid to watch them .
From the perspective of conservatives / rank capitalists , that kind of socially negative government spending is the only acceptable kind .
( Socially positive government spending might give us ideas and builds solidarity , a big no - no for conservatives .
This is why they seek to dismantle social security . )
And for the prison industrialists , well , a profit is a profit , regardless of how you come by it .
All the better when the profit is guaranteed by the government .
Until the grip our modern day robber barons have over our government and culture is broken , Webb will stand alone .

Great .
Now I hate to spend excessive amount of my spare time pushing a rollback for the return of Federal Parole for non-violent offenders .
The problem is that we have the perfect storm to pass it in Congress but the one person who rally the masses is going to be me .
I have no interest in this cause unless I know that this 111th Congress will do it and there is high probablity of it .
This shows me that there is potential Congress has the will but it takes the grassroots to make it happen

the story about Mcnab is my story .
i was sent to prison for the same violation of the Lacey Act .
here is what i learned about the prison sysytem
1. a HUGE business
2. a corrupt business
3 , heard heroin was sold in my unit 3 weeks before i left , by fellow prisoners .
how did it get in ?
( wink wink )
4 , corrupt lawyers as they extract huge fees and sit back knowing full well , the fight is a losing cause .
5 cowardly federal judges who sit sanctimoniously without any compassion and who are surely not judges , but act different because either their hands are tied or are cowards themselves to speak out and say " guilty !!
sentence : 1 day for importing illegal lobsters , that would stop the nonsense .
6. the evil empire , the USA .
called what i did as and i quote , " moral turpitude "
described as a depravity of social deeds by some .
what a crock !
the immorality lies with the GREAT SATAN , the USA .
7. every prisoner I met , some in prison for inane reasons , so inane you would cry , all said to me
that the USA is on its way down , because as Gandhi said ; ' you can judge a nation on how they treat their animals " exactly describes the usa in how they treat their prisoners .
I was at a medical facility ( LOL ) where the staff
was a joke .
lawsuits were many and treatment almost non-existent .
records ; made up to look good
sounds incredible ?
welcome to the BOP of the usa and
the laws of the usa .
I signed a paper where i would not enter the usa again for 10 years , i asked for 25 , making me 90 .
NEVER AGAIN .
oh yes , civil rights , you have zero .
lastly , i entered voluntarily from Canada and when i left , law does provide the same courtesy , but i left in chains , driven to the border and dropped off .
I had been willing to pay my way myself 3 days earlier .
perfect example of USA arrogance at its height .!!
do I hate americans , absolutely NOT !
some of the best people one would want to know .
do I hate the legal system ?
dare i say ?

I am an informal student of constitutional law ( self - educated and rather late in life , at that ) .
You might say that until the last few years I was one of those Americans who was politically unconscious .
Clearly , I needed to be educated .
I also think that , like me a few years ago , the majority of Americans are simply unaware and would be appalled at what happens in our country .
Most private sector federal criminal defense attorneys come out of the DOJ .
They know our criminal justice system has little to do with fairness and justice , but speaking out against it represents a huge conflict of interest .
After all , it 's how they make their living .
It 's how a lot of people make their living .
One can only hope that the prosecutors in the Blandford et al lobster / Lacey Act case will get their due rewards in the hereafter .
Even more so for the judges sitting on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals .
( Note : I would n't want to be them . )
I am taken aback by such ... such .... such evil ( I was trying to think of another word for it , but there really is n't one ) .
The prosecutors were motivated to advance their careers ( another notch on their career belts ) - not right but given human nature one can understand it , but what excuse is there for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals who upheld prison sentences for these men when no existing law had been violated ?
Answer : None whatsoever !
I wonder how they would feel if one of those men were a father , brother or son and were taken from them for 8 years - all for breaking a law that did n't exist .
Let 's just hope it 's true , that what goes around comes around ... in spades .
I agree that a grass - roots movement is the only way things are going to change .
Too many people have a vested interest in having things stay the way they are , from our Congressmen and Senators on down .
Ours is supposed to be a government by the people ; it 's time we took our country back .

JUDICIAL INJUSTICES BEING INFLICTED ON POORER AMERICAN'S NEEDS .... C*H* A * N * G*E ......
SENATOR OBAMA PLEASE LET THIS COUNTRIES VOTERS KNOW YOUR FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS ABOUT A NEEDED FUTURE REPAIR AND RENOVATION OF OUR BROKEN JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT CONTINUES TO ALLOW THE EXECUTION'S OF EVEN POSSIBLE INNOCENT AMERICAN’S LIKE TROY DAVIS OF GEORGIA ?????
BEING THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD SENATOR OBAMA , DON'T WE NEED AS THE LEADERS OF THE FREE WORLD TO BEGIN ONCE AGAIN TO RE - INVEST THE PROPER MONIE $ IN OUR OWN US JUDICIAL SYSTEM , ASSURING ALL OF OUR CITIZENS THEIR RIGHTS TO FAIR TRIALS WITH PROPER LEGAL REPRESENTATION ???
DOES GOD NEED TO LOBBY OUR US CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS OF THE FREE WORLD ON BEHALF OF OUR poorer american ’s SENATOR OBAMA , OR ARE YOU WATCHING OUT FOR THEM ??
*** OUR US CONGRESS CONTINUES TO DENY MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING POOR AMERICANS PROPER LEGAL REPRESENTATION EVEN THOUGH WRONGFUL EXECUTIONS & FALSE INCARCERATIONS CONTINUE ALL ACROSS AMERICA ???
*** 700 BILLION $ $$ AVAILABLE FOR US BAILOUT , & NO $ $$ FOR ALL POORER AMERICANS PROPER LEGAL REPRESENTATION ?
SENATOR OBAMA , THIS JUDICIAL INJUSTICE HAS BECOME AN AMERICAN ART FORM , AND NO LONGER CAN BE KEPT HIDDEN OR SECRET FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EVEN IF CERTAIN ( 501c3 ) U$ RELIGIOU$ LEADER $ HAVE BEEN $ ILENCED ??
LETS ALL HOPE OUR MEDIA FRIENDS CONTINUE TO SHOW AN INTEREST IN REPORTING ON THIS AMERICAN HORROR FACING THESE ( TENS OF THOUSANDS ) FORGOTTEN AND TRAPPED POORER AMERICANS , AND HOW THIS PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER HANDLES THIS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE FACING AMERICA’S LATINO AND BLACK AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ????
WITH 80 % OF THE BLACK AMERICAN VOTERS SAYING THEY SUPPORT SENATOR OBAMA IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION , IT IS ONLY FAIR FOR EVERYONE TO KNOW PRIOR BEING ELECTED OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HOW THIS DEMOCRATIC SENATOR TRULY FEELS ABOUT THIS AMERICAN JUDICIAL INJUSTICE CONTINUING TO INFLICT GRAVE HARM ON THE BLACK & LATINO AMERICAN FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES NATIONWIDE ??????
*** WHEN GOD’S FACE BECAME VERY RED *** THE US SUPREME COURT GAVE ENEMY COMBATANTS FEDERAL APPEAL HC RIGHTS LAWYERS AND PROPER ACCESS TO US FEDERAL COURTS , AND POORER AMERICANS ( MANY EVEN ON DEATH ROW ) ARE DENIED PROPER FEDERAL APPEAL LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO OUR US FEDERAL COURTS OF APPEAL , AND ROTTING IN AMERICAN PRISONS NATIONWIDE ?????????
**** INNOCENT AMERICANS ARE DENIED REAL HC RIGHTS WITH THEIR FEDERAL APPEALS !
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE $ LOWLY FINDING OUT HOW EA$Y IT I$ FOR MIDDLE CLA$ $ AND WORKING POOR AMERICAN $ TO FALL VICTIM TO OUR U$ MONETARY JUDICIAL $ Y$ TEM .
**** WHEN THE US INNOCENT WERE ABANDONED BY THE GUILTY ****
The prison experts have reported that there are 100,000 innocent Americans currently being falsely imprisoned along with the 2,300,000 total US prison population nationwide .
*** WHERE ARE AMERICA'S RELIGIOUS LEADERS ???????
Since our US Congress has never afforded poor prison inmates federal appeal legal counsel for their federal retrials , they have effectively closed the doors on these tens of thousands of innocent citizens ever being capable of possibly exonerating themselves to regain their freedom through being granted new retrials .
This same exact unjust situation was happening in our Southern States when poor and mostly uneducated Black Americans were being falsely imprisoned for endless decades without the needed educational skills to properly submit their own written federal trial appeals .
This devious and deceptive judicial process of making our poor and innocent prison inmates formulate and write their own federal appeal legal cases for possible retrials on their state criminal cases , is still in effect today even though everyone in our US judicial system knows that without proper legal representation , these tens of thousands of innocent prison inmates will be denied their rightful opportunities of ever being granted new trials from our federal appeal judges !!
Sadly , the true US * legal * Federal Appeal situation that occurs when any of our uneducated American prison inmates are forced to attempt to submit their own written Federal Appeals ( from our prisons nationwide ) without the assistance of proper legal counsel , is that they all are in reality being denied their legitimate rights for Habeas Corpus with our US FEDERAL COURTS and will win any future Supreme Court Case concerning this injustice !
For our judicial system and our US Congressional Leaders Of The Free World to continue to pretend that this is a real and fair opportunity for our American Middle Class and Working Poor Citizens , only delays the very needed future change of Federal Financing of all these Federal appeals becoming a normal formula of Our American judicial system .
It was not so very long ago that Public Defenders became a Reality in this country .
Prior that legal reality taking place , their were also some who thought giving anyone charged with a crime a free lawyer was a waste of taxpayers $ $ .
This FACADE and HORROR of our Federal Appeal proce$ $ is not worthy of the Greatest Country In The World !
*** GREAT SOCIETIES THAT DO NOT PROTECT EVEN THEIR INNOCENT , BECOME THE GUILTY !
A MUST READ ABOUT AMERICAN INJUSTICE :
1 ) YAHOO 2 ) GOOGLE MANNY GONZALES THE KID THAT EVERYONE FORGOT IN THE CA PRISON SYSTEM .

AMERICA'S GREAT LIE
by Gerry Spence
The idea that we should furnish the poor with a public defender has been an effort to save our nation from shame - for sending the poor to prison without adequate representation .
But today the nation 's public defender system has become a mockery of justice .
To provide an accused with a public defender who has three hundred other cases to defend is simply to laugh in the face of both justice and the accused himself .
It takes me months to prepare the average criminal case for trial .
The trial itself can take weeks , even months .
While O.J. Simpson was being tried in Los Angeles for murder , a case that cost millions to defend and months to conclude , another black man was being tried in the same courthouse for a similar murder .
It took only three days for a jury to find him guilty .
He had a public defender with scores of other cases to defend .
Many prosecutors boast that they have over a 90 percent conviction rate .
Little wonder .
Under the present public defender system the prosecutors should enjoy one hundred percent convictions , and many in fact approach perfect conviction rates .
The public defenders in seven states have finally refused to take on any new cases .
It 's about time .
If I walked into court to defend my client and had never talked to him , never previously opened his file , never discovered the witnesses against him , much less interviewed them , never reviewed the evidence in the hands of the prosecution , never demanded my clients rights to discovery , never read the cases relevant to the case at hand , never prepared the cross examination of the witnesses against my client , never ... and on and on , I would be guilty of legal malpractice .
Every public defender who purports to represent an accused under circumstances in which he or she has neither the time nor the resources to fully defend the client is guilty of malpractice .
These public defenders cannot be saved from malpractice because they are crushed under a ridiculous case load - some with even as many as five hundred cases or more .
No one who was accused with such an attorney has received a fair trial and every such accused is entitled to an appeal on that basis alone .
The judge must not sentence the accused under these circumstances because the judge would be taking part in a fraud on the system .
Yet hundreds of thousands of indigent persons go to prison each year under circumstances no better than those outlined above .
When I was coming up as a young prosecutor , the defendants were represented pro bono by the lawyers in the local bar .
It was part of the duty of members of the bar to take part in the justice system .
Today that idea is unheard of .
The practice of law is first and foremost a money - making profession .
I see nothing wrong with that notion , but what about giving back ?
Every trial lawyer should be required to take on a couple of pro bono cases every year .
At our office we have a separate pro bono law firm and have for over ten years .
It often brings us more satisfaction than our big money wins .
The job of a lawyer is to represent the people - the lost , the forgotten , the damned , the hated , the voiceless and the poor .
Indeed ,
God forbid , we may one day become one of those who are entitled to representation but cannot afford it .
Every time an accused goes to prison without having received a fair trial we are one step closer to the loss of our own freedoms .
Our rights are , in fact , being fought for by public defenders who can never fulfill their duty to their clients because of their pathetic , impossible , caseloads .
When they fail , we are in danger .
Our system becomes a hypocritical charade .
And we prove , once and for all , that the promised justice for all in America is an evil lie that is imposed on the poor .
If only those with money can receive justice , then how can we permit our children to recite a horrible falsehood in school when they chant , " with liberty and justice for all . "
That can no longer be the truth in America .

IS THIS REPORTED GAY SANTA MONICA COMMISSIONER JUST ONE BAD EXAMPLE OF A NEW POLICY IN AMERICAN FAMILY COURTS ALL ACROSS AMERICA OF DON'T ASK AND WE WON'T TELL ???
LAWYERS FOR POOR AMERICANS IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY THAT COMMISSIONER DAVID J. COWAN OF SANTA MONICA CA COURT HOUSE IS A CLOSET GAY MAN OR FOR THAT MATTER ~ OPEN GAY MAN , THAT HAS SOMEHOW BEEN GIVEN COURT CASES INVOLVING FAMILY CHILD CUSTODY ISSUES AND IS THE NEWEST FACE OF WHAT IS TO COME IN AMERICAN FAMILY COURTS ACROSS AMERICA ?????????????????
MR.DAMON DUVAL AND HIS TWO WONDERFUL CHILDREN ( MAYA & JAZZ ) HAVE ALL NOW BEEN KEPT APART FROM ENJOYING EACH OTHERS COMPANY BY COMMISSIONER DAVID J. COWAN SINCE DECENBER 4 2008 .
FOR SOME VERY UNCLEAR REASONING THIS APPARENT GAY NAPOLEON COMMISSIONER APPEARS TO BE MORE INTERESTED IN MR.DUVALS MENTAL HEALTH STATUS THEN THE LIVE IN BOYFRIEND OF HIS EX WIFE OF THE LAST 2 YRS . , WHO HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THE EL SEGUNDO POLICE DEPARTMENT AS HAVING TOUCHED MR .
DUVALS LITTLE 3 YR OLD MAYA ON HER PRIVATE PARTS ??
THIS SANTA MONICA COURT COMMISSIONER APPOINTED CHILDREN'S COUNCIL AT MR .
DUVALS REQUEST ( LAWYER AMY NEIMAN OF SANTA MONICA CA ) WHO HAS BEEN MORE INTERESTED IN ACTING AS A MENTAL HEALTH EXPERT ( WITHOUT THE QUALIFIED DEGREES ) AND MISLEADING THIS CHILD CUSTODY MATTER INTO GAY NEVER NEVER LAND WITH THIS SANTA MONICA COMMISSIONER FOLLOWING HER FEMALE INTUITION & ADVICE CONCERNING THE MENTAL HELATH STATUS OF MR .
DUVAL !
FOR SOMEONE WITHOUT MENAL HEALTH DEGREES TO QUESTION THE PROFESSIONAL JUDGEMENT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH EXPERT WHO HAS ALWAYS STATED CLEARLY TO THE COURT THAT MR .
DUVAL IS OF SOUND MIND AND WOULD TESTIFY IN PERSON TO THE COURT CONCERNING THIS FACT , IS ALMOST ANOTHER FUTURE LEGAL CASE FOR LA COUNTY WAITING TO HAPPEN ?
**WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE LA COUNTY COURT SYSTEM TO OPEN A INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS THAT ENCOMPASS THIS POSSIBLE CHILD PEDOPHILE CUSTODY CASE AND HOPE THAT ALL CURRENT COURT APPOINTED LAWYERS WORKING FOR LA COUNTY LIKE AMY NEIMAN ARE ADVISED TO HELP PREVENT CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS RATHER THEN CREATING ONE IN THE FUTURE !
LAWYERS FOR POOR AMERICANS WILL CONTINUE WRITING ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC LEGAL CASE ON THE WWW UNTIL A PROPER OUTSIDE INVESTIGATION OF THESE PEDOPHILE CHARGES HAS BEEN PROPERLY ANSWERED !!!
LAWYERS FOR POOR AMERICANS HAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME WITH ANY RESULTS THAT COME FROM THE EL SEGUNDO POLICE CONCERNING THIS INVESTIGATION DUE TO THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP OF MR .
DUVALS FORMER WIFES CURRENT DIVORCE ATTORNEY ( MR.ROY KIGHT ) HAVING HAD HIS LAW OFFICE SITUATED IN EL SEGUNDO FOR THE LAST 20 YRS .+ , AND HAVING GOOD FRIENDS IN EL SEGUNDO TO DO HIM CERTAIN FAVORS WHEN NEEDED !!!

DUVAL OUTSIDE A SANTA MONICA COURT~ ROOM THAT HE WAS " GOING TO TAKE AWAY ALL HIS CHILD VISITATION AWAY BETWEEN HIM AND HIS CHILDREN AND THAT THIS IS A POKER GAME FELLA AND ARE YOU READY TO PLAY " ***
NO MR .
DEVALS MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT THE ISSUE IN THIS LEGAL CASE , THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS DID THIS DIVORCE LAWYER ROY KIGHT SET MR .
DUVAL UP WITH GAINING FALSE TESTIMONY IN EL SEGUNDO CA AND INFLUENCE THE EL SEGUNDO PEDOPHILE INVESTIGATION OF HIS 3YR , OLD DAUGHTER ???
ATTORNEY ROY KIGHT IS ON THE RECORD AS HAVING PREVIOUSLY THREATENED MR .
DUVAL OUTSIDE THE SANTA MONICA COURT ROOM AND WE FEEL MIGHT ALSO BE SO CAUGHT UP IN THIS CUSTODY BATTLE AND THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD WAY TOO MUCH INFLUENCE AND INTEREST WITH THE PEDOPHILE INVESTIGATION THAT NEVER TOOK PLACE ????????????????
LAWYERS FOR POOR AMERICANS WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IF LAWYER ROY KIGHT WOULD ADMIT UNDER OATH ( AND SUPPLY INVESTIGATORS HIS PHONE RECORDS ) AS TO NOT EVER ATTEMPTING TO INFLUENCE THE FORMER ( NOW RETIRED EL SEGUNDO POLICE DETECTIVE MULRONEY CONCERNING THIS PEDOPHILE CRIMINAL LEGAL CASE ???????????????????????????
WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE INTERESTED IN PREVENTING FAMILY COURT GAY COMMISSIONERS AND JUDGES ACROSS AMERICA FROM CONTINUING TO ALLOW THEIR COURT APPOINTED LAWYERS LIKE ( AMY NEIMAN OF SANTA MONICA ) TO MISLEAD JUDGES AROUND THE COUNTRY LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN MR .

DOES PRESIDENT OBAMA OR OUR U.S. SUPREME COURT DO WINDOWS ???
~ AMERICANS CONTINUE TO DEMAND FAIR TRIALS IN IRAN & NORTH KOREA , BUT NOT HERE IN OUR GLASS HOUSE ~
OUR AMERICAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY ONLY OBLIGATED ( U.S.SUPREME COURT 1963 GIDEON RULING ) TO PROVIDE OUR POORER AMERICANS WITH A INITIAL CRIMINAL LAWYER AT THEIR TRIALS .
MANY TIMES IN AMERICAN STATE TRIALS THERE IS REALLY VERY LITTLE INVESTIGATION BEING OFFERED TO DEFEND OUR POORER AMERICANS AGAINST EVEN UNFOUNDED CRIMINAL CHARGES ?
IF AMERICA IS ONLY NOW FINDING OUT ABOUT ( 17YRS AFTER THE FACT ) SEVEN OF NINE WITNESSES LYING IN THE TROY DAVIS LEGAL CASE , ARE WE NOW SUPPOSE TO THINK THAT TROY DAVIS HAD A PROPER LEGAL Defense AT HIS CRIMINAL TRIAL IN GEORGIA ???
CARING AMERICANS KNOW REAL JUSTICE AND SADLY OUR POORER AMERICANS ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY INFLICTED ON THEM IN OUR U.S.JUDICIAL SYSTEM.WE CONTINUE EXECUTING INNOCENT AMERICAN CITIZENS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE OUR IVORY TOWER U.S. CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS OF THE FREE WORLD HAVE NEVER EVEN CARED ABOUT SPENDING THE NEEDED $ $$ TO CORRECT THIS LACK OF PROPER LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR OUR MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING POOR AMERICANS .
FALSE IMPRISONMENT FOR TWENTY YEARS OR MORE , WRONGFUL EXECUTIONS , RAPES AND MURDERS IN OUR AMERICAN PRISONS ARE HAPPENING EVERY DAY IN AMERICA AND JUST MAYBE THE TIME HAS COME WITH OUR SPECIAL AND UNIQUE PRESIDENT AND U.S.ATTORNEY GENERAL RUNNING OUR COUNTRY TO OFFER OUR POORER CITIZENS THE NEEDED C*H* A * N*G * E ….. TO HELP MAKE OUR NEW AMERICA AND HER UNJUST JUDICIAL SYSTEM A MUCH MORE JUST SOCIETY FOR ALL AMERICANS TO RESPECT AND CHERISH !!!
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,AND THE NAACP ARE JUST TWO INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL HIGHLY RESPECTED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT THESE TWO SEPERATE AMERICAN HUMAN LIFE INJUSTICES TO THE WORLDS ATTENTION , BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE IN THINKING THAT TROY DAVIS AND MUMIA ABU - JAMAL ARE ALONE IN NOT EVEN BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE NEW AND FAIR TRIALS IN THE WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD !
** GEORGIA HAS HAD AT LEAST FIVE OTHER PREVIOUS LEGAL CASES OF INNOCENT BEING RELEASED ON THEIR DEATH ROW BEFORE THEY WERE FALSELY EXECUTED **
DOES THAT MEAN THAT TROY DAVIS IS ALSO INNOCENT OF THE CRIME OF MURDER ...NO , BUT MOST ALL AMERICANS WANT TO KNOW FOR SURE THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS EXECUTED IN ANY AMERICAN STATE , THAT THEY ARE TRULY THE GUILTY PARTY WHO DID THE CRIME , NOT JUST THE TIME ?
I DO NOT SEE WHY ANYONE WOULD OBJECT TO HAVING NEW TRIALS FOR ANY OF OUR DEATH ROW INMATES IN AMERICA WHERE TREMENDOUS DOUBT ABOUT THEIR INITIAL GUILT IS IN PLAY ?
WHY WOULD ANY FAMILY MEMBER OF ANY MURDERED RELATIVE WANT OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO RUSH TO SO CALLED JUSTICE AND BE IN REALITY CONTRIBUTING TO HAVING ANOTHER POSSIBLE INNOCENT PERSON MURDERED IN THE NAME OF THEIR FORMER INNOCENT LOVED ONE ?

THE NATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMISSION ACT OF 2009
The National Criminal Justice Commission
Act of 2009 that I introduced in the Senate on March 26 , 2009 will create a blue - ribbon commission to look at every aspect of our criminal justice system with an eye toward reshaping the process from top to bottom .
I believe that it is time to bring together the best minds in America to confer , report , and make concrete recommendations about how we can reform the process .
This legislation has already garnered wide bipartisan support in Congress and from interest groups representing a range of backgrounds and political viewpoints .
Why We Urgently Need this Legislation : With 5 % of the world 's population , our country now houses 25 % of the world 's reported prisoners .
Incarcerated drug offenders have soared 1200 % since 1980 .
Four times as many mentally ill people are in prisons than in mental health hospitals .
Approximately 1 million gang members reside in the U.S. , many of them foreign - based ; and Mexican cartels operate in 230 + communities across the country .
Post - incarceration re-entry programs are haphazard and often nonexistent , undermining public safety and making it extremely difficult for ex-offenders to become full , contributing members of society .
America 's criminal justice system has deteriorated to the point that it is a national disgrace .
Its irregularities and inequities cut against the notion that we are a society founded on fundamental fairness .
Our failure to address this problem has caused the nation 's prisons to burst their seams with massive overcrowding , even as our neighborhoods have become more dangerous .
We are wasting billions of dollars and diminishing millions of lives .
We need to fix the system .
Doing so will require a major nationwide recalculation of who goes to prison and for how long and of how we address the long - term consequences of incarceration .

Oct. 23 , 2008  --
Novice chefs beware .
With gourmet chefs increasingly using rare , exotic or long - forgotten ingredients in food , even experts can hurt themselves .
Last Thursday , a Japanese sushi chef died after accidentally eating the highly - poisonous liver of the fugu , or puffer fish .
While many parts of the fish are tasty and safe , certain organs can be deadly .
The 34 - year - old chef was licensed by the Tokyo government to prepare the fugu dish , yet mistakenly thought the liver was safe to eat , according to reporting by The Mainichi Daily News .
Europe saw several widespread hazardous gourmet mistakes earlier this year .
In late August , a popular Swedish food magazine recalled 10,000 store copies after a mistake in one of its cake recipes left four people sick , dizzy and in pain .
" There was a mistake in a recipe for apple cake .
Instead of calling for two pinches of nutmeg it said 20 nutmeg nuts were needed , " Matmagasinet 's chief editor Ulla Cocke told Agence France - Presse .
Agence France - Presse reported that the magazine had issued leaflet warnings about the dangers of nutmeg poisoning , but recalled the magazines after four adults overdosed .
Earlier this fall , celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson Tuesday apologized for a potentially fatal mix - up during a magazine interview when he recommended wild henbane as a great addition to salads .
Thompson said henbane , but he meant fat hen .
Fat hen is a weed .
Henbane extract was the poison famously poured into Hamlet 's father 's ear , also often called nightshade .
Nutmeg , henbane and fat hen are n't the only plants that cause confusion .
Many herbs have several different names , and many foods have unseen dangers .
The following pages outline just a few toxic plants that share common names with common foods , or common foods that have toxic qualities .
The Dose Makes the Poison
Seeds from fruit trees in the Prunus genus -- cherries , peaches , plums , apricots and almonds -- all produce low levels of cyanogenic glycosides that can lead to cyanide poisoning , according to William J. Lamont Jr. , a professor of horticulture at Pennsylvania State University .
But not to worry , Lamont and other horticulturalists noted it would take eating several whole pits to get sick .
Several popular flavors can be dangerous in high doses , too .
High doses of licorice can cause high blood pressure and low potassium levels , causing problems for people with heart conditions .
As the Swedish magazine knows , nutmeg , a spice usually enjoyed safely in pinches and teaspoons , can become quite dangerous in large doses .
According Lamont , nutmeg contains a substance called myristicin , a narcotic that can cause hallucinations , nausea , vomiting and sometimes circulatory collapse .
Lamont explained that it takes eating one to three whole nutmegs to affect someone – far less than the pour Swedes put in the cake .
However , novice chefs may need to pay more attention to names than to doses when it comes to food safety .
What 's in a Common Name ?
" Common names can sometimes be confusing , " said Richard Jauron , the extension horticulturalist at Iowa State University in Ames .
" When you get into these names , that makes me a little squeamish . "
One plant may have several different common names .
On the other hand , a single common name might be attributed to several different plants , Jauron said .
For example , the common name " pea " may cause trouble .
There 's the edible garden pea , but there 's also the sweet pea .
Gardeners often plant the sweet pea , or Lathyrus odoratus , for the great scent of its flower .
According to the Cornell University Poisonous Plants Database , the sweet pea is a known toxin to horses , rodents , turkeys , sheep and humans .
Even more toxic than the sweet pea , the grass pea has been known to cause serious damage .
According to the Canadian Poisonous Plants Information System , eating grass pea ( Lathyrus sativa ) consistently for three months can cause neurolathyrism , a syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity , weakness and paralysis of the leg muscles .
" In severe cases , victims may be reduced to crawling , " the Canadian Poisonous Plants Information System says .
" Young men between 20 and 30 years old are primarily affected . "
Most grass pea victims live in India , where the pea is grown for flour and often eaten safely by most of the population .
Other slight name mix -ups can include the edible cherry and the toxic Jerusalem cherry , mustard and the toxic Indian mustard .
We eat sage , but the plant Lantana camara , known as red sage , or yellow sage , can be poisonous .
Scientific names may not sound sexy , but Jauron thinks they save people from the sort of trouble chef Thompson created .
" You want to know exactly what you 're dealing with , so typically when we deal with plants , we would provide the common name and the scientific name , " Jauron said .
" No other plant would have another scientific name . "
But being careful with plants does n't end with the name .
Even if the gardener has the name right , the part of the plant matters .
Parts Matter
Careful chopping -- many common fruits and vegetables in the grocery store have toxins lurking in the leaves , roots or seeds .
For example , take the humdrum potato .
The entire potato plant , from the edible tuber to the top leaves , has toxic glycoalkaloids lurking in it , according to the Canadian Poisonous Plants Information System .
The tuber part of the potato is usually safe because it has far less toxin than the green parts .
But toxins can concentrate in the tuber if it is exposed to sunlight and starts photosynthesis .
" A potato has buds , it 's a stem , it 's actually an underground stem , " Jauron said .
" When we see that [ green color ] , we can still use them , we just have to cut off the green section , " said Jauron .
Other green dangers can be found in the leaves of the tomato plant , the leaves of the avocado plant , the leaves of horse radish and the green parts of the tasty rhubarb .
Like the potato , the edible portion of the rhubarb contains a low level of a toxin found in the green parts .
Also , like the potato , cooking the green parts does n't help .
" Human [ rhubarb ] poisoning was a particular problem in World War I , when the leaves were recommended as a food source in Britain , " the Canadian Poisonous Plants Information System says .
Modern day health food advice may still get people into trouble when they use traditional foods in new ways .
The taro root must be cooked to remove toxins , so no raw juicing is allowed .
Those who'd like to include the green parts of the buckwheat plant in their wheat grass shots should also take care .
Lamont said that the substance fagopyrin in the green part of the buckwheat plant can react with sunlight causing redness , numbing , itching , and pain on contact with cold water .
More often , toxins in our food are lying right in the center of the fruit or nut we eat such as apples , pears and almonds .
Luckily , it often takes much more exposure to become sick from these foods .
What To Do
" Almost anything , if you eat it in large amounts , could be dangerous , " said Charlie Nardozzi , the senior horticulturalist with the National Gardening Association .
" It does n't mean you should n't garden , you just need to do it with a bit of knowledge . "
Nardozzi recommends that anyone who starts a garden , or who is just checking out farmer 's markets , ask lots of questions .
" If you 're just buying food at a farmer 's market -- sometimes people are just really shy about it , they see an unusual food there and they do n't really know how to eat it , " Nardozzi said .
" I would trust the person growing it . "

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
All we have heard from John McCain for months is , " Barack Obama is too young .
Barack Obama is too inexperienced to be commander - in - chief .
Who do you want answering the phone in the White House at three a .m.?
Blah , blah , blah . "
So what does McCain do ?
He picks someone to be his running mate who is even younger than Barack Obama and has less experience .
Sara Palin is 44 – Obama is 47 .
Sara Palin is in her first term as governor of Alaska , a state that has 13 people and some caribou .
Obama is a member of the United States Senate from Illinois .
It 's not a big deal , except for this :
If McCain wins , he will be the oldest person ever inaugurated for a first term at 72 .
He has a history of health problems that include bouts of melanoma , a potentially deadly form of skin cancer .
It is reasonable to consider that McCain 's running mate could be called upon to be our president .
Watch : Cafferty : McCain's VP mistake ?
Meanwhile , some may see this as a move for McCain to attract disaffected women who voted for Hillary Clinton and are n't yet behind Obama .
But that might not work for a few reasons : Palin , like McCain , is pro-life .
Also , she might be a woman , but she 's no Hillary Clinton – when it comes to her experience or her ideology .
At some point , voters will have to ask themselves who they would want running the country if it ever became necessary : Joe Biden or Sarah Palin .
Here ’s my question to you : Does John McCain undercut his own message by naming someone even younger and more inexperienced than Barack Obama to be his running mate ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Rebecca from Santa Barbara , California writes :
As a life - long Republican soccer mom living in an affluent community , I was impressed with Senator Obama 's acceptance speech last evening .
Having my morning latte with a few of my Republican friends , I almost spit my coffee out when I heard the news .
Is McCain really putting the best interests of our nation first ?
To me , he is pandering to women , trying to obtain their vote .
It seems he wants another ' trophy ' to parade around with .
What is wrong with this man ?
Dave writes :
Jack ,
The fact that absolutely no one in or around her or McCain 's inner circle had not even the smallest clue this would happen shows it was a last minute , desperation pick .
McCain is falling all over himself after the Dems ’ convention and grasping at straws .
Mitch from Michigan writes :
I think McCain 's selection of Sarah Palin as V.P. is very similar to Bush 's nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court .
It shows how much a McCain presidency would be like the Bush presidency with the selection of totally unqualified individuals for government posts .
We 've seen the disastrous results of such picks by Bush .
We can not let McCain continue this saga .
Horatio writes :
These negative comments about Palin 's inexperience are hilarious .
She 's a whopping 3 years younger than Obama , and has about the same amount of experience ( his in the legislature , hers in the executive ) .
If she 's an irresponsible choice , Obama as president is even worse - since he's at the top of the ticket !
Palin is a great balance for the ticket : young , smart , and has an independent streak a mile wide .
Christine writes :
I am a true - blue Hillary supporter , but I am sure Hillary did not mean to put 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that a pro-life , pro-gun , home - schooling nobody from the frozen tundra of Alaska could slide in .
Go Obama .
Doug writes :
Had I known that being a hockey mom , being under 45 , and having virtually no political experience was the desired VP running mate for McCain , I would have asked my wife to throw her hat into the ring …
McCain has just handed the presidency to Obama .
Meagan writes :
Cafferty ,
For once , and probably the only time , I actually agree with you .
Better than I could ’ve said it .
Glenn writes :
It was a bold move by John McCain to reach out to the Eskimo vote , which has been totally ignored by the media .
In my extended family , I have something of a reputation for being a privacy Nazi .
This is due to my penchant for not giving out addresses and phone numbers to stores that seem to think my buying something from them is a good enough reason to ask for it , but it turns out I 'm only playing in the minor leagues .
The American Library Association is raising more than a million dollars to fund a new " Right to Information Privacy Campaign " with a goal of nothing less than getting Americans " to recommit to information privacy . "
Librarians might not be the group you 'd first imagine out in the streets , manning the barricades , but they can get pretty agitated about both censorship and privacy .
( Note : never tell a librarian that you 'd like to ban a particular book unless the two of you are separated by an inch of plexiglass . )
In this case , the 64,000 librarians of the ALA believe that their work remains vital to a vibrant democracy , since " the right to read and search for information is the foundation of individual liberty . "
The ALA 's new campaign wants to 1 ) educate people , and then 2 ) turn them into activists .
The education component of the three - year program will make people aware , for instance , that " checking out a biography of Osama Bin Laden could prompt seizure of their library records " or that " online searches create traceable records that make them vulnerable to questioning by the FBI . "
The ALA also worries about provisions in the law that " gag " the people who are on the receiving end of government orders to turn over these records .
" Law enforcement agencies at every level are exploiting fears about terrorism and child safety to encourage lawmakers to strip away statutory privacy protections for library records , " says the ALA .
" This eliminates anonymity in the library , and encourages the mind set that ' good ' people should have nothing to hide . "
But , as Cory Doctorow wittily points out in a talk he gave to the group last month , people have all sorts of behaviors for which they want " privacy , " even if these behaviors are n't " secret . "
When someone heads off to the bathroom , for instance , and closes the door , their behavior is n't a " secret , " but it is " private . "
And everyone 's parents engaged in at least one nonsecret but private activity to produce a child .
The librarians are well suited to mount such a campaign .
By nature , they 're guardians of anonymity and free access to information , and they also have access to a huge variety of outlets for their message .
US public libraries have more locations than McDonalds , and 62 percent of American adults hold library cards .
That gives ALA members a natural place to educate the public about these issues and channel that education into public discourse and , hopefully , a new consensus on privacy and its importance .
You know that moment in a football game when the players are streaking downfield , the quarterback has lofted a pass , the ball is in the air , and you just ca n’t tell yet whether the receiver is going to come down with the catch or the defensive back is going to bat it away ?
That ’s where we are right now on the issue of energy in the presidentialrace .
Republicans have had their fun with tire gauges , and as John McCain relentlessly hammered home his support for offshore drilling ( which he used to oppose ) , he narrowed Barack Obama ’s lead in national polls .
But now a group of five Democratic and five Republican senators is pushing compromise legislation that could blunt the GOP attacks .
Last week , the “ Gang of 10 ” announced a plan to expand drilling off the Gulf of Mexico and southern Atlantic states , keep the ban on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and along the West Coast , extend tax credits and incentives for fuel - efficient purchases , put $ 20 billion into developing alternative fuels , and pay for the whole $ 84 billion package by repealing tax breaks on oil and gas companies and hiking their licensing fees .
Liberals and conservatives can each find things to dislike about this proposal .
But it ’s pretty clear that the Gang of 10 plan has a better chance of getting through Congress this fall than any Republican proposal to simply start more drilling , and it ’s far more politically viable than Nancy Pelosi ’s attempt to quash discussion of the entire subject .
If it passes , its sponsors will be able to boast that they got something done on a pressing issue and will gain approval from media types ( and maybe undecided voters ) who like bipartisanship and compromise .
But McCain ’s ground game was working in the pre–Gang of 10 environment , and he was looking forward to keeping Obama uncomfortable on drilling .
Because he has supported tax breaks for oil companies , and has opposed repealing them to pay for investments in clean energy , McCain now faces an uncomfortable choice .
He can oppose the Gang of 10 plan , which will force him to defend his past votes and to explain how his stance fits into the “ all of the above ” approach on energy that he says he advocates .
Or he can change his position and support the plan ’s tax increases and limits on drilling .
For Obama , in contrast , the Gang of 10 plan is a Hail Mary of a godsend .
It might let him not only get past drilling and refocus on energy efficiency , but also highlight his willingness to work with Republicans at a time when the congressional Democratic leadership has been particularly inept .
That ’s why Obama was willing to risk charges of flip - flopping on another issue and support the plan .
“ I am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good , particularly since there ’s so much good in this compromise , ” he said last Monday .
Lefties and righties alike smell the whole issue turning .
“ Has McCain walked into an energy trap ? ” Sam Stein wondered last Wednesday .
“ The Gang of 10 : Obama ’s Checkmate ? ” Nate Silver asked on Thursday .
“ You can start with stupidity , you can start with selfishness , ” Rush Limbaugh spluttered on Friday .
“ McCain wants to open up drilling , it ’s become his issue , and these five Republican senators just nuked it . ”
All that ’s premature , particularly since the elements of Obama ’s energy plan that are n’t about improving fuel efficiency , such as his proposal to open the strategic petroleum reserve , are pretty gimmicky .
But the football is in the air .

Summary :
The bad news is that much of the good news about energy is wrong .
Repeated so confidently by so many for so long , these fallacies have become a major obstacle to our preparation for peak oil .
This post examines one such fallacy : that the world has massive reserves of unconventional oil , and that those will prevent peak oil .
This post substantially expands to my replies in a discussion with M. Simon , lifted from the comments to “ A powerful perspective on the candidates for President of the US “ .
M. Simon posts actively on his blog , Power and Control , and at Classical Values– an influential libertarian weblog discussing politics , current affairs and pop culture ( to which the Instapundit frequently links ) .
M. Simon is an engineer , and involved in some cutting edge projects .
I gave a broad but brief reply to his comments in “ Discussing geopolitics with the famous M. Simon ( of the “ Classical Values ” blog ) “ .
This post focuses on one specific subject that he mentions : reserves of unconventional oil sources .
M. Simon reiterates his views in his post of 29 August : “ How Much Oil Is There ? ”

M. Simon ’s comments
Comment # 10 :
There is no energy problem .
There is a restraint of trade problem : cartels .
You break cartels by bringing more product on to the market .
We are 20 to 30 years away ( due to technology and logistics issues ) from making a serious dent in the necessity for oil .
What can America do if Congress and local Democrats get out of the way ?
Drill , mine , refine .
At this point in time energy is a political problem not a geological one .
Where do you folks get your misinformation ?
BTW the most misunderstood discipline in war and industry is logistics .
You know – arm chair generals study battles , real generals study logistics .
Comment # 13
Two trillion barrels of oil shale in America .
1.5X that in tar sands in Canada .
The Canadians are producing at around $ 15 to $ 20 a bbl .
And that does n’t even count the amount we might have in the continental shelf which is not well explored thanks to Congress .
Yep .
Not enough oil .
I ’m convinced .
Fabius Maximus replies
2 . What are nconventional oil sources ?
They include , among others :
biofuels ,
low - flowing deposits ( Bakken Formation in the US )
deepsea petroleum ( e.g. , new finds off Brazil ) ,
polar petroleum and natural gas ,
heavy oil ( e.g , Venezuela )
bitumen ( aka oil sands , as in Alberta ) ,
kerogen ( misleadingly called shale oil , as in America ’s NW ) ,
converting coal to diesel fuel ( coal - to - liquids , CTL ) .
They are often described as a bounty that will save us from peak oil .
This is almost certainly wrong .
Peak oil is a transitional phase as production shifts from conventional oil sources to unconventional sources .
Unconventional reserves are immense .
They are , in effect , low quality petroleum “ ore ” ; conventionals represent high - quality “ ore . ”
There is , of course , more low - quality than high - quality ore .
However , they are not directly comparable as Simon implies .
Let ’s look at M. Simon ’s comments , line by line .
M. Simon says : “ Two trillion barrels of oil shale in America .
1.5X that in tar sands in Canada . … Yep .
Not enough oil .
I ’m convinced . ”
Unconventional sources differ from conventional petroleum in three ways .
Their extraction costs — either initial capital outlays or operating costs ( or both ) — are usually far higher .
Their production flows tend to be lower .
Nothing like the massive flows from the great fields of Texas and Saudi Arabian .
For example , by 2020 Canada ’s bitumen mining might produce 5 million barrels / day — not enough to offset the reduced production from Mexico ’s supergiant Cantarell and other North American fields .
They often require far larger inputs of energy for their extraction and refining than conventional sources .
For example : heavy oil , bitumen , and kerogen all must be mined , heated , and hydrogenated to produce useful products .
Unconventional sources are valuable , and will play an increasing role in our global oil supply .
But their reserves , flows , and costs cannot easily be compared to the ample and cheap conventional fields now being sucked dry .
That is the missing element in these euphoric stories told by M. Simon and so many others .
“ All unconventional oil needs time to be produced in great quantity , no matter how much effort is made .
It is not possible to have a baby in a month with nine women . ”
— Jean Laherrere , A - team oil expert ( from a DOE internal energy briefing paper , August 2007 )
This also applies to “ crash programs ” hoping to develop new energy sources .
3. Comparing conventional and unconventional reserves
Unconventional reserves are not easily comparable to conventionals .
Gross numbers of barrel - equivalents have little meaning .
Numbers on a net BTU basis ( net after extraction costs ) , would be more useful , but still misleading .
That is because reserves of unconventional energy resources mean little .
Most unconventionals are production - constrained , not reserve - constrained , due to their combination of high capital costs , operating costs , resource requirements ( e.g. , energy , water ) and environmental impacts ( each has a different mix of these ) .
Also , they require longer to scale - up than conventional sources ( time is money ) .
An analogous situation between rate and “ reserve ” appears with water .
The planet ’s surface is covered with it ( approximately 71 % ) and to great depths , yet we have “ water shortages . ”
If the same approach of those advocating large oil reserves reserves meaning “ no problem ” was applied to water , how could we ever have a water shortage ?
However , it ’s not in a usable form and much effort has to be expended to treat it for suitable use .

4. Considering the two unconventional sources that M. Simon mentions
( 4a ) Bitumen ( aka “ Oil sands ” )
From Wikipedia ( this article also links to some good sources ) :
Tar sands is a colloquialism for what are technically described as bituminous sands , and commonly known as oil sands or ( in Venezuela ) extra heavy oil .
The sands are naturally occurring mixtures of sand or clay , water and an extremely dense and viscous form of petroleum called bitumen .
They are found in large amounts in many countries throughout the world , but are found in extremely large quantities in Canada and Venezuela .
Oil sands are mined and extensively processed ( requiring major energy input ) to become a liquid fuel , in no way comparable to a field like Ghawar .
It has taken 20 years to get Alberta ’s output to 1 million b/ day ; their goal for 2020 is 5 million b/ day — which might not be feasible due to resource limitations ( water , natural gas ) and ecological impacts .
None of these are “ political ” limitations in any meaningful sense .
The capital invested , and planned to be invested , is staggering .
Canadian companies spent close to $ 9 billion on oil sands capital investments in 2005 .
Currently , there are close to 35 projects in the planning or expansion process in oil sands .
Canada ’s NEM said in their November 2007 report that “ capital costs for adding integrated mining and upgrading capacity , to come on in the 2010 - 2011 timeframe , are estimated to be in the range of $ C 80,000 to $ 100,000 per flowing barrel ” and aprox .
$ C 80 billion will be spent over the next decade to boost tar - sands output from the current 1.3 million barrels a day .
This report also lowered their forecast for 2015 output due to rising costs and regulatory uncertainties , from their 2006 forecast of 3 million barrels / day to 2.8 million barrels .
Update : Costs are rising rapidly , with estimates of $ 80 – $ 100 oil required to justify investment in new projects .
See these two articles for details :
“ High costs squeeze oil sands “ , Financial Post , 5 September 2008 — “ Break - even price jumps 31 % . ” Now aprox $ 85 / barrel . ” “ UBS says new oil sands projects need pricey crude “ , Reuters , 19 September 2008 — New projects need $ 100 + / barrel oil to turn a decent profit .
For more information on this see the following studies of the oil sands industry .
They provide balanced looks at the challenges and costs of expanding production in Alberta .
( 4b ) Kerogen ( aka “ shale oil ” )
We do not yet have a commercially - proven method of extracting oil from “ shale oil ” ( kerogen ) .
Commercially - proven means more than economics .
The engineering must work reliably on a large scale , with acceptable environmental impacts , and the available inputs ( esp water ) .
We are not yet there .
I believe the largest plant is that of Fushun Mining Group in China , scheduled to produce 7,400 barrels / day in 2008 and 14,000 b/ day at some point in the fuure ( source ) .
From Wikipedia ( an excellent article , with links to the sources used ) :
There are hundreds of patents for oil shale retorting technologies .
However , only a few dozen have been tested in a pilot plant ( with capacity 1 to 10 tonnes of oil shale per hour ) and less than ten technologies have been tested at a demonstration scale ( 40 to 400 tonnes per hour ) .
As of 2008 , only four technologies are in commercial use , namely Kiviter , Galoter , Fushun , and Petrosix .
Once the engineering is proven by operation of a commercially feasible plant , it will probably take roughtly a decade to scale up production ( building progressively larger plants ) to a meaningful fraction of global oil use .
“ Shale oil ” might be part of a solution to peak oil , but time and money will be required to find out .
Then more time will be needed to put this technology into play .
It ’s not magic .
Most estimates show that decades will be required to perfect and scale - up extraction and refining of these reserves — assuming the many technical problems can be overcome .
For more information see :
5 . Cost of mining oil sands
M. Simon says : “ The Canadians are producing at around $ 15 to $ 20 a bbl ”
I do not know what Simon means by this .
The key — and obvious — aspect of most unconventional sources is that today they are more expensive than conventional oil ( with a few exceptions , such as recycled waste vegetable oil or meat ) .
In the past 5 years growth in demand has been met by expensive alternative sources , which has pushed up the price of oil .
When unconventional sources become less expensive than conventional oil , we will have left the Age of Oil ( the third age of humanity ) for a new era .
This will happen , eventually .
As for Simon ’s statement , the companies themselves state much higher operating costs .
For example , on 29 July 2008 Canadian Oil Sands
Trust forecast operating costs of $ 32 / barrel for 2008 , plus $ 14.50 in royalties to the resource owners ( in Canada , the government ) for a break - even point of about $ 46.50 a barrel .
This does not include capital costs on the massive investments they have made , which pushes the break - even numbers even higher .
6. Reserves are complex , and not just for oil .
How much coal do we have ?
America ’s coal reserves are far less than most people have been led to believe .
We have mined most of the dense , high BTU coal .
We are mining the remainder of the good stuff .
We have vast reserves , but some large fraction of this might have the BTU content of Kitty Litter .
Too little research has been done on these reserves .
For more about this , see these reports :
Here is the key paragraph from the last report ( # 4 ) :
“ Present estimates of coal reserves – which take into account location , quality , recoverability , and transportation issues – are based upon methods that have not been updated since their inception in 1974 , and much of the input data were compiled in the early 1970s .
Recent programs to assess coal recoverability in limited areas using updated methods indicate that only a small fraction of previously estimated reserves are actually recoverable .
Such findings emphasize the need for a reinvigorated coal reserve assessment program using modern methods and technologies . ”
7 . What happens when their urban legends are disputed ?
Challenges : “ Where do you folks get your misinformation ? ” —
An interesting response , in that that Simon provides no sources ( not that he needs to , of course ) .
sources ( not that he needs to , of course ) .
Irrelevant Sarcasm : “ BTW the most misunderstood discipline in war and industry is logistics .
You know – arm chair generals study battles , real generals study logistics . ”
Insults : “ Honestly , I ’m dumber after I visited here than before I came . ”
Here is a gentle paraphrase of an email discussing my review of his work , reprinted with M. Simon ’s permission :
The thing lacking in most people discussing the issue is :
Not an engineer .
Not studied war sufficiently .
Ignorance of history .
Ignorance of logistics .
Too invested in Shrinking Media memes .
Too utopian .
8. Conclusions
Belief in the ability of our vast reserves of unconventional sources to save us from peak oil is an urban legend , in the sense of “ widely dispersed misinformation ” that meets an emotional need — in this case , reassurance .
M. Simon is a respected figure on the Internet , a reputation gained one post at a time over the years .
This is a requirement for passing on urban legends , so that people take his words seriously .
This brings us to the reason for posts like this , other than public education about this important issue .
I believe that for the Internet to fullfil its promise we need to use it better .
We must be more careful what we write .
We must attempt to hold each other to a reasonable standard of accuracy .
We are all in this together .

Open Source CRM Comes of Age
by Ostatic Staff - Aug. 26 , 2008
Few categories of open source software have seen so much solid teamwork and rapid development as customer relationship software ( CRM ) projects .
As evidenced by huge proprietary players such as Salesforce.com , CRM implemented on the web as an on - demand tool for teams of co-workers also creates substantial business efficiencies .
If you have a business and have n't looked into some of the top open source CRM offerings lately , here 's a look at what you can start doing .
Concursive is now offering a completely free , open source 100 - user CRM system to everyone .
The company 's ConcourseSuite 5.0 ConcourseSuite is notable in that it offers flexible deployment options .
You can have it implemented as a hosted traditional SaaS ( Software - as - a - Service ) application , where it works on the web for mobile employees and office employees alike .
( This is similar to how Salesforce works . )
Or , alternatively , you can implement it as a standalone , in - office installation , where a team can use it as central database - driven application .
If you 're interested in Concursive 's offering , you can sign up for it here .
You can also find a PDF case study on a business that uses the suite midway down the page here .
The company gets revenues from supporting CRM solutions in businesses with more than 100 employees , but the open source , 100 - worker offer is free .
Of course , no discussion of open source CRM offerings would be complete without mentioning SugarCRM .
SugarCRM is for businesses of all sizes .
It supports sales force automation , marketing campaigns , support cases , project management , calendaring and more .
It also supports MySQL and SQL Server .
Sugar CRM was also recently named best open source CRM technology by CRM Magazine .
Looking for another choice ?
I 've used SplendidCRM extensively .
It 's free and open source , and is particularly good at producing snazzy charts that you can add annotations and business logic to .
Take a look at the home page for the many recent additions made to it by its community , and many screenshots .
It also generates PDFs of customer orders , invoices and more , and is available in many languages .
For many types of businesses , there is no need to front up the substantial fees required for proprietary CRM applications such as Salesforce .
Give some of these open source alternatives a try .
READERS of a certain age may remember that Volkswagen Beetles once had air - cooled engines .
That made for simplicity .
But , eventually , increasing power meant that even VW conceded the point and started to cool its motors with water .
Something similar is about to happen with computer chips .
Each flipping of a “ one ” to a “ zero ” , or vice versa , generates heat — and the flipping is happening so fast that if nothing is done chips will soon start melting .
Moreover , the trend is to stack chips on top of one another , to improve communications between them .
The adverse side of stacking is that it makes shedding the heat even harder , because of the falling ratio of the processor 's surface area ( through which heat can escape ) to its volume ( the amount of material generating heat ) .
According to Thomas Brunschwiler , a researcher at IBM 's laboratory in Zurich , when you build processors this way you generate heat at about one kilowatt per cubic centimetre — more intensely than in a nuclear reactor and ten times the record of any other man-made device .
That would destroy an uncooled chip within a hundredth of a second .
Water , however , conducts heat 4,000 times faster than air , and can also carry more much of the stuff in a given volume .
Mr Brunschwiler and his colleagues have therefore been experimenting with water - cooled chips .
They have developed a stacked processor that is permeated by a network of channels .
These channels , which have a diameter of 50 microns ( about the width of a human hair ) are etched using standard silicon fabrication .
They enable water to be pumped in a network that runs between the horizontal layers of a stack and the thousands of vertical interconnections that carry information between these layers .
The water collects the heat and carries it away .
IBM
Cooler than it looks
That , in the prototypes at least , is enough to keep the chips from melting .
But in these days of environmental awareness , not to mention high energy prices , it seems a waste simply to throw the heat thus collected into the atmosphere .
If chips are as hot as power stations , the thinking goes , why not use them as such ?
In practice , not enough heat is generated to make a useful amount of electricity .
But heat is useful stuff in its own right .
It might , for instance , be used to warm buildings .
The Zurich laboratory has already constructed a prototype that feeds the water from the chips into a heat - exchanger .
The next stage is to link this exchanger to a district - heating system so that it can be pumped into central - heating .
Bruno Michel , manager of advanced thermal packaging at the laboratory , reckons the heat from a medium - sized data centre — one consuming a megawatt of power — would be enough to warm about 70 houses within a range of 3 km .
IBM hopes to build such a centre within five years .
If it works , the potential is huge .
At the moment , the world 's data centres are estimated to consume about 14 gigawatts of power , and to be responsible for 2 % of global carbon - dioxide emissions — roughly the same as air traffic .
Water - cooling of this sort may also make a more direct contribution to the reduction of greenhouse - gas emissions , by promoting the use of solar energy .
Solar cells are also made of silicon , and the latest fashion is to concentrate sunlight on them using mirrors .
That means you need less silicon to make a given amount of electricity , but it also makes the silicon very hot — as hot as a commercial microprocessor .
By cooling such devices with liquids , IBM reckons it can increase the amount of sunlight that can be focused on them without destroying them , thus increasing the amount of electrical energy they produce .
Supratik Guha , a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Centre in Yorktown Heights , New York , has put this to the test and found that he can concentrate 2,300 times more sunlight on a cell than nature would provide , while maintaining that cell at a ( relatively ) cool 85 °C .
Without the cooling system , its temperature would rapidly exceed 1,500 º , causing it to melt .
With cooling , the cells can manage an output of 70 watts a square centimetre — a record , according to IBM , and a demonstration that plumbing , too , can be a high - tech form of engineering .
Uninsured Americans will spend $ 30 billion a year in out of pocket expenses and incur another $ 56 billion in government - subsidized expenses , says a new study for healthaffairs.org by Jack Hadley of George Mason University in Virginia and a team at the Urban Institute .
" The uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured , and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket .
Contrary to popular myth , they are not all free riders , " Hadley said .
Current estimates show that 47 million Americans lack any health insurance , and 28 million have gone without for some part of the year .
The U.S. Census bureau is scheduled to release new estimates on Tuesday .
The study goes on to suggest that if the uninsured were covered , they would spend more on healthcare .
An insured person spends about $ 100 dollars more a year , on average , out of their own pocket than does someone without insurance .
And in the meantime , Sen. Bernie Sanders has a sensible suggestion for a filler measure .
For a relatively small amount of money , we can provide primary health care to every American in need of it through an expansion of the successful Federally Qualified Health Center program .
On a budget of only $ 2 billion a year , this program , which has enjoyed widespread bipartisan support , now provides primary health care , dental care , mental health counseling , and low - cost prescription drugs to 17 million people through 1,100 health center organizations in every region of the country for an average cost of $ 125 per patient per year .
The doors of these centers are open to all , including patients with Medicaid , Medicare , private insurance , or no insurance at all , with sliding - scale fees .
... for a total of $ 8.3 billion a year , we could have 4,800 centers caring for 56 million people in every medically - underserved region of the country .
This upfront investment – which constitutes less than 0.5 percent of overall U.S. spending on health care – would more than pay for itself .
The centers are among the most cost efficient federal programs in existence today .
On average , medical expenses at health centers are 41 percent lower than in other health care settings .
Most importantly , from a financial point of view , by treating people when they should be treated , we can save billions by keeping patients away from emergency rooms and expensive hospitalizations .

Why choose in - season produce ?
Just like a home - grown tomato tastes better , locally grown , in - season produce usually tastes better .
Studies also indicate that seasonal food can be fresher and more nutritious than food consumed out of season .
And by purchasing in season from local farms , your food dollar goes directly to farmers , supporting your local economy and environmental damage caused by shipping foods thousands of miles .
To ensure the data in the guide is as accurate as possible , we sourced our information from the experts : the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , state agriculture extension offices and state departments of agriculture .
Erica Campbell does n't want to die from drinking tap water .
She does n't trust Houston 's public water system , and as a homeopathic doctor , she says she does n't believe in the supposed benefits of the fluoride contained in city water and wants nothing to do with the chlorine used to treat it .
Instead , Campbell shops for bottled water .
" I like just pure water , " she says .
" In life , I try to control the factors that I can , and then do the best I can with all the rest . "
On a Friday afternoon , Whole Foods is bustling with people .
The water aisle , however , is virtually empty of shoppers .
Campbell is one of only seven people to buy bottled water there in an hour .
The shelves are stocked with more than a dozen brands , some infused with added oxygen , others with electrolytes , and that 's not to mention all the varieties of sparkling water .
The incredible array of choices signals what for years has been the indomitable surge of the bottled water industry .
It 's been one of the great trends in recent eras .
Americans downed more than 8.2 billion gallons of it in 2006 , a 9.5 percent rise from the previous year .
Recently , however , a rising resistance has been splattering cold water upon the hitherto omnipotent ( and still hot ) ­industry .
Tap is coming back .
It 's cheap , healthy and , in Houston , safe .
Consumers griping about rising gas prices , which hover around $ 4 a gallon , are becoming more aware that the bottled water they 're buying can cost more than $ 8 a gallon .
That 's compared to less than a cent per gallon for Houston tap water .
Environmentally , it takes millions of barrels of oil to make all those plastic bottles , most of which end up in landfills .
It takes a lot of gas to drive those bottles to retailers across the country , too .
Tap water , on the other hand , simply flows forth with the flick of the faucet .
The Sierra Club , World Wildlife Fund and other earth - friendly societies urge subscribers to consume less bottled water .
Presbyterians for Restoring Creation and the National Coalition of American Nuns have adopted resolutions asking church members to abstain from purchasing water on moral grounds : Essential God - given resources should not be privatized .
As if renunciation by nuns is n't bad enough news for the bottled water producers , politicians are also hopping onto the little green bandwagon .
Mayors in San Francisco , Miami , Los Angeles and Austin have banished bottled water from their city budgets , saving taxpayer money that was being spent on bottled water and encouraging people to drink tap .
Houston Mayor Bill
White 's spokesman , Patrick Trahan , says the city has a deal with Sparkletts to provide large water - cooler jugs for employees to drink from at City Hall .
Trahan says the contract is worth about $ 6,000 a year .
Last year , the bottled water industry showed the slowest growth in its relatively brief history .
It may be that water - in - a - bottle has finally jumped the shark .
_____________________
" Water is water , " once wrote that old Prairie Home Companion Garrison Keillor .
" If you want lemon flavoring , add a slice of lemon .
You want bubbles , stick a straw in it and blow . ''
This is more or less the message of Think Outside the Bottle , a national campaign aimed at swaying city officials , businesses and the public at large to turn on the tap .
Twenty - six - year - old Deborah Lapidus is the national organizer for Boston - based Corporate Accountability International , the organization leading the Think Outside the Bottle efforts .
Lapidus first dipped her toes into the bottled water morass in Texas during the summer of 2006 .
She helped launch tap water campaigns in eight cities , including Houston and Austin .
" Hardly anyone had heard of bottled water being an issue back then , " she recalls " I had to do a lot of public education .
We chose Houston as one of the original cities because it has really high - quality tap water and it brings home the absurdity of people drinking bottled water . "
Nick Denning , 23 , is Corporate Accountability International 's Assistant Director of Environment in Florida .
He and Lapidus take turns discussing what they say are the rumbling dark clouds of waste , cost , pollution and privatization caused by the bottled water industry .
" Four billion plastic bottles end up in landfills each year , " starts Lapidus , " at a cost to cities of over $ 70 million . "
Denning notes that " Production of plastic water bottles produces more than two - and - a - half million tons of carbon dioxide , and requires the energy equivalent of 17 million barrels of oil per year " — enough " to generate fuel for over a million cars . "
Lapidus steers the stream of thought toward the pocketbook .
" A family of three who rely exclusively on bottled water will , by the time the first child is 18 , have already spent on that water the equivalent of that child 's college education in a public university , " she says .
Because of their backgrounds in international studies , the two are quick to place corporate control of water in a broader worldwide context — which can be summed up by saying that there are an increasing number of places on the globe with water water everywhere and not a drop to drink .
" With the amount of money Americans spend on bottled water , " says Denning , " we could provide every citizen on this planet with access to safe water . "
Lapidus mentions Mexico , where Coca - Cola has a stronghold .
" All the tourists in these countries , and the upper echelons of society can buy bottled water , " she says , " so the political will to insure safe drinking water to the rest of the citizens declines . "
She adds that " Nestlé gets their water from springs and underground sources , usually in economically depressed ­communities . "
Lapidus resides in Boston , but went to Miami to attend the U.S. Conference of Mayors , where Resolution 70 had been up for consideration .
Host Mayor Manny Diaz was a main proponent of the declaration , which " encourages cities to phase out , where feasible , government use of bottled water and promote the importance of municipal water . "
" It passed with flying colors " Lapidus announces ­triumphantly .
Trahan says there are no propositions on the table in Houston that address bottled water­ .
" What we desire to do , " Trahan says , " is see the cultural change occur .
Though we have not ruled out creating ordinances , we would much prefer that the city culture and its leadership and environmental efforts encourage people to continue to use our water .
We also recognize that people have choice , and if they 're going to choose other water products , that they do so conscientiously and use products that are contained in recyclable containers . "
Thirsty Mexicans , cloddish carbon footprints and the minutiae of municipal law may not whet the public 's whistle , but one thing that has managed to muster outrage is the notion that 40 percent of all bottled water comes from the faucet — or , more specifically , from your tax - funded municipal water supply .
" People feel duped " says Denning .
" We pay the money to get clean public water , and corporations are taking advantage of that and selling it back to us at thousands of times the price .
We are , in effect , subsidizing the industry . "
He is speaking here not of high - end imported waters , which are steeped in problems of their own , but those such as Coca - Cola Company 's Dasani brand , which buys its water from the City of Houston .
Houston 's Public Works spokesman , Alvin Wright , says that several companies use Houston tap water as source water , including Budweiser , Pepsi , Coke and Nestlé .
" We sell water to basically everyone , " says Wright .
" All the companies that make bottled water get their water from us . "
Pepsi , for instance , pays Houston an average of $ 33,037 a month ; Coke pays a monthly average of $ 20,380 .
Ozarka and Sparkle Ice each buy more than $ 10,000 of water a month .
Houston used to bottle its own water years ago , says Trahan .
The high costs of bottling , however , forced the city to shut down the business .
Other than the beverage vending machines at City Hall , the city does n't use a lot of bottled water .
Not even during emergencies , like a hurricane .
Wright says that the water department has no plans to provide bottled water to residents during a disaster .
" In the unlikely event that one of our surface water sources became unusable , " says Wright , " the utility would switch to using one of our other alternative sources , such as ground water , to supply our ­customers . "

Thirty years ago , most folks if they were thirsty took a second to chug a glass of water before leaving the house .
No longer .
" There are people who walk out of their apartments in New York City every morning of every workweek carrying a little bottle of water in a sling , as if it was a little baby , " comedian Lewis Black rants during his act .
" They 're carrying a liter bottle of water with them as if they were crossing the goddamn Mojave ! "
The late George Carlin also noticed the trend .
" What is it now in America ; everybody 's walking around with a water bottle .
Tell me this , when did we get so fuckin ' thirsty in this country ? "
It 's tough to find a single store in America , from supermarkets to mom-and - pop gas stations in the middle of nowhere , that do n't sell at least one brand of bottled water .
They are simply everywhere .
A fact , according to experts , that explains why bottled water has become so popular .
It 's not so much a health concern as it is convenience and taste .
" You go to Barnes & Noble and get some chilled water , which is basically the same stuff you get from the tap , but it 's there and it's convenient , " says Houston environmentalist Ed O'Rourke .
" It 's a convenience and a sort of chic thing to do . "
The bottled water industry does not pit itself against tap water .
It heaps praise on city water , saying there 's nothing wrong with it .
Bottled water is just a healthy alternative to soda or juice .
" There 's no question that our biggest competitors are soda companies , " says Ozarka spokeswoman Catherine Herter .
" People are on the go all the time , they 're in their cars and it 's something they can grab quickly and take with them and then recycle . "
When asked if bottled water companies try to convey that their water is better than tap , Herter says , " No , no , no .
Absolutely not .
And it 's sad it 's sort of being portrayed as that , because it 's absolutely not the case .
We think everybody should drink more water ...[ bottled water ] is just an alternative to caffeinated sugary beverages ; that 's really all it is . "
Gary Hemphill , Managing Director of Beverage Marketing Corporation , a beverage industry consulting group in New York , says there are two distinct bottled water markets : one made up of people replacing tap water completely , and another comprised of people using bottled water as they would a soda .
The first category is dramatically smaller , growing only 1 to 2 percent a year , says Hemphill .
These customers either do n't trust the city water or do n't think it tastes good , and they buy bottled water in bulk .
This segment is also affected by the economy , as bottled water is seen as somewhat of a luxury item .
The large majority of bottled water drinkers , however , buy water instead of soda .
" It 's driven by a demand for healthier refreshment , " says Hemphill .
" Portability is important to consumers , and the packaging is important to them , the lightweight plastic and the resealability .
I guess if consumers could carry their kitchen sinks on their back , the market for bottled water would probably be a lot smaller than it is . "
Of course , if it does n't taste as good as , or even better than the free stuff , there probably would n't be much of a market , either .
The Houston Press recently asked 20 people to take a blind taste test between tap water ; Dasani , which is filtered municipal water ; and Ozarka , which is natural spring water .
Ozarka won in a landslide .
Dasani came in a distant second , and Houston 's finest came in last by only a few votes .
The results do not surprise University of Houston professor of environmental engineering Dennis Clifford .
Two years ago , he conducted a similar test with 23 students who were taking Clifford 's water quality class .
He used distilled water , Ozarka , Evian and tap water .
Clifford says the distilled water and Ozarka finished on top , while Evian and tap water were the least favorite .
The reason , Clifford says , is simple science .
The fewer minerals present , the more people seem to prefer the taste .
( The Houston Press had its own tests done .
Click here for a chart and here for the full results . )
Drinking water contains a number of solids and minerals , including calcium , magnesium , sodium and potassium .
Taste is determined by how many of those solids are present and left undissolved .
For example , says Clifford , spring water may have only 20 or 30 parts per million in it , whereas city water levels hover between 100 and 300 parts per million .
Evian , on the other hand , has more than 400 parts per million , which is right at the taste - limit of 500 parts per million .
In these quantities , the minerals are perfectly safe , says Clifford .
The 500 - parts - per- million­ number is not a health limit .
Therefore , Clifford reasons , it makes sense that the more popular waters in his class and in the Press taste test were the ones with the least number of minerals present .
The Coca -Cola Company does n't bottle the municipal water as is , because then it would have to be duly affixed with the dull " bottled water " designation .
Putting it through a secondary purification known as reverse osmosis turns it into the more pedigreed " purified water . "
Clifford says companies such as Dasani filter city water and extract all the minerals and salts , and then add in a mixture of the two that makes the water more ­palatable .
" Generally , " says Clifford , " the taste preference is for lower - mineral - content waters like Ozarka and Dasani .
Most brands pretty much cut the mineral content pretty low .
The popularity of bottled water I do n't think is so much a health issue .
Many people can taste the difference .
Bottled water is a taste thing and a convenience thing . "

For the last five years , the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has rated Houston 's drinking water " superior , " the highest ranking .
" We deliver a much higher quality of water than is required by the government , " Wright says .
" We check the water daily and monitor for taste , color , clarity and all that good stuff . "
Houston 's drinking water comes from several nearby sources .
The city owns 70 percent of Lake Livingston and Lake Conroe and all of Lake Houston .
Water also comes from the Trinity River and from the Evangeline and Chicot aquifers .
Surface water is fed into one of three purification plants for treatment and disinfection .
Groundwater is also pumped from wells , on average 750 feet deep , and delivered to one of five re-pump stations , where the water is treated and distributed .
All drinking water is chlorinated and has fluoride .
Each year , the city distributes more than 146 billion gallons of water to nearly three million customers through 7,000 miles of pipeline .
In addition to Houston , the city provides water to Pasadena , Friendswood , Webster , Clear Lake , League City , Clear Brook , La Porte and South Houston .
Wright says that the pipes are constantly checked and treated .
Every month , city workers sample more than 600 locations , looking to wipe out any traces of bacterial residue .
Less frequently , the city also checks consumers ' taps for lead and copper residue .
The most common cause of water problems , Wright says , comes from users ' plumbing systems in their homes or offices , where contaminants can build up .
Professor Clifford agrees .
He says , for example , that during his taste test at UH many students noticed that the city water had a yellow hue , due in large part to the rust in the university 's pipes .
" The water delivered from the treatment plant is quite clean , " Clifford says , " but then it goes through miles and miles of pipe and the pipes may not be so clean .
The water picks up contaminants , particularly in your own house from plumbing that may be corroding . "
Filters , however , can combat the problem , Wright says .
But filters , especially the commonly used ones containing carbon , can pose their own set of issues , particularly if they are not replaced frequently .
Clifford says that when a filter is used for too long , it no longer keeps unwanted particles out of the water .
In fact , old filters actually compound the problem .
Contaminants , such as chloroform , are picked up by the filter and then essentially stored inside the device , says Clifford .
When the filter gets too old , those contaminants are released back into the water in greater number and strength than they originally existed in the unfiltered tap water .
" It 's actually more dangerous to have such a filter if it 's beyond its useful life , " says Clifford .
Even though it passes federal muster , drinking tap water can be risky .
The chances of getting sick , however , are quite low .
Chlorine is used to treat natural contamination caused by decaying vegetation found in surface water from sources such as Lake Houston , says Clifford .
The byproduct of chlorine , at least in rats , is carcinogenic .
Tap water is " regulated to one cancer death in a million in a lifetime , " says Clifford , " which means there 's a one in a million chance of getting cancer if you drink two liters a day for 70 years .
Your chances [ in general ] of getting cancer is 25 percent , so yeah , there 's a risk , and some people do n't want to take the risk , but it 's not a significant risk . "
Bottled water is by no means immune to such concerns .
Plastic bottles should not be used over and over , and drinkers should keep their bottles out of the scorching heat .
Over time , the plastic begins to disintegrate and chemicals dissolve into the water .
" Any material , whether it 's plastic or wood , is going to leak some contaminant , " says Clifford .
" I know some situations where companies have claimed that storage houses got too hot and their bottled water had an off taste .
Well , it did n't come from the outside . "
Nothing is perfect .
It 's all a game of calculated risk .
But if you ask scientists like Clifford , he 'll say , " I drink both tap water and bottled water .
I do n't have any real fear of either one . "

After being seated inside Houston 's posh * 17 restaurant , diners are asked whether they'd like a glass of wine or something nonalcoholic , like a soda or iced tea .
If they say yes to the second option , then the waiter does not always offer water .
If the diner just wants water , then the server lays out the options : Italy 's Ducale brand bottled water , sparkling or still , for $ 7 a pop , and tap water .
" There definitely is an emphasis , especially in the evening , with the bottled water service , " says the restaurant 's manager , Heath Lagrone .
" We do a bit higher end of clientele , so bottled water does take precedence more times than not . "
Jason Kerr of Café Rabelais , also a frequent contributor to the Houston Press , has been in the restaurant business for more than 20 years .
He says he remembers a time , not more than a decade ago , when no one at restaurants was downing bottled water .
Those days are long gone .
" In restaurants , they push it a lot , " he says .
" It 's almost like they try to sell it to you .
Some people have come to expect that when they sit down , they have the option .
Then , of course , there 's those people who the last thing they want is to be sold some overpriced water .
But almost every restaurant has it . "
In some cities , such as New York and Miami , residents can stroll into a chic eatery and peruse a water menu to find just the right brand to pair with their food .
That trend has yet to hit Houston .
" I 've never seen that here before , " says Kerr .
" That 's ridiculous .
I do n't think it 'll ever get that bad here , but I think it could get to the point where that 's all people will drink when they go out to eat . "
Not all restaurants , though , force bottled water down customers ' throats .
" Our standard is tap , " says Susan Bennett , an operating partner at The Grove .
" We deliver it automatically to diners , but we also offer bottled water .
It 's mainly something we do more for visitors from other countries , or conventions sometimes request it , but we really do n't want people to feel obligated to buy water . "
Think Outside the Bottle runs a campaign in which they get restaurants to pledge not to serve bottled water .
Spokeswoman Sara Joseph says no restaurants in Houston have signed up .
At Beaver 's , there is no obligation to buy bottled water
" I do n't even offer it , " says chef and general manager Dax McAnear .
" We just give you a glass [ of tap water . ]
So far , it 's going well .
I have n't had any complaints . "
Beaver 's is partly owned by award - ­winning chef Monica Pope , one of the biggest names on the Houston culinary scene when it comes to shunning bottled water and embracing the environment .
Kerr , who used to work for Pope at Bistro Boulevard , says Pope recycles everything from glass bottles to vegetables .
It 's her commitment to the environment that is partly the reason why Beaver 's does n't ever serve bottled water .
" It 's just so wasteful , " says McAnear .
Last year Americans tossed over 22 billion plastic water bottles into the trash .
It is estimated that only 15 to 20 percent of these get recycled — and probably even less here in Houston .
According to the trade magazine Waste News , Houston residents are the worst in the country , recycling only 2.6 percent of their waste .
" I have seen those newspaper articles talking about the sheer amount of plastic that is thrown away from water bottles , and that is a staggering number , " says Karl Pepple , director of environmental programming for the city .
" You know , we have more pressing issues right now , looking at our air quality .
Bottled water has n't boiled to the top yet .
It 's something that we have n't spent a lot of time looking at . "
Marina Joseph , the city 's Solid Waste Management spokeswoman , says that unless people recycle their water bottles , they get tossed into the landfill , which is not where the city wants them .
Easier said than done .
Almost all of the restaurateurs that the Press spoke with said they do not recycle water bottles .
" We do consider ourselves a green company , " says Kevin Haagenson , general manager at Voice , located inside Hotel Icon , " but unfortunately there still is the bottle that 's wasted at the end .
We are throwing them away right now ... "
Lagrone at * 17 says the same thing .
" We do try to do our part , " he says , " [ but ] I do n't really pay a lot of attention to it . "
Kerr says that when he worked under Pope , recycling " eventually got to the point where it was so much work . "
Plus , he says , " there 's no money in it . "
What there is money in , depending on who you talk to , is selling bottled water at restaurants .
" There is quite a big profit margin , " says Haagenson .
" When you 're going from a product where you normally charge nothing at all , to be able to add $ 5 or $ 7 , and sometimes they 'll do a couple of bottles , onto the tab , it 's not real substantial , but it definitely is another avenue we have to create revenue . "
Lagrone , on the other hand , says the sale of Ducale at * 17 does not fatten up the bottom line all that much .
" The cost on the bottles is fairly high as well , " he says , " so the bump up in revenue is not a large amount .
I 'd say that over a month 's time , the revenue for bottled water reaches about $ 3,000 . "
For some diners , like O'Rourke , that 's way too much .
" At restaurants , " he says , " I want my water in a glass , not a bottle .
Good God .
Bottled water is a needless expense with ramifications all the way down the line .
It 's wrong environmentally , it 's wrong for your budget , it simply costs more . "

Bottlemania ai n't dead yet .
Three out of four Americans drink bottled water , 20 percent preferring it exclusively over tap ; we consume more of it per capita than any other nation in the world .
Last year this translated to our swilling more than 70 million bottles per day , and spending nearly $ 11 billion doing so .
Dasani was America 's number - one selling brand , with wholesale sales of $ 1.6 billion , PepsiCo 's Aquafina sopped up $ 1.47 billion for second spot , and together with Nestlé 's three top sellers they comprised 60 percent of the U.S. market .
Not bad for the big boys of the beverage world , especially considering how slow on the sip they were : Pepsi did n't roll out Aquafina until 1994 , and Coke took five additional years to answer with Dasani — an ice age for companies such as these .
Yet recently , sales have begun to go flat .
In 2007 , those 70 million bottles a day , when measured by volume , represented a 6.1 percent rise from the prior year — the lowest rate of growth since 1992 .
And Coca - Cola Enterprises Inc. recently cut its outlook for the quarter , the stated culprit a weak North American economy that has bottlenecked water and soda sales — especially 20 - ounce single serving sizes .
In the 1990s , the sale of personal - sized bottles was growing more than 20 percent a year , says Hemphill of the Beverage Marketing Corporation .
That number is also beginning to dip .
In 2006 , the growth rate was 18 percent , says Hemphill , and in 2007 it was about 10 percent .
" Some of it is the fact that the category at this point is just so large , " says Hemphill , " and some of it is because of some of the recent publicity questioning it from an environmental standpoint and some of the comparisons made with tap water .
I would expect the growth rate in 2008 to be slower .
Given that , though , I still think the upside for growth is pretty solid for the years ahead . "
Numbers aside , what has to be most distressing for the industrialists is that the cachet of bottled water , a product so iconic as to have once been described by Lisa Margonelli in The New York Times as " an iPod for your kidney , " is slipping away slowly but definitely .
The industry , meanwhile , is strenuously slogging to stem public backlash from swelling into a wave .
And it is doing so by wielding the same weapon that stimulated the public 's thirst in the first place .
Marketing : Now available in vi­brant green .
" Sip with a clear conscience " read recent promos for Fiji water , a " truly eco- friendly " drink .
Nestlé 's Zephyrhills brand boosts itself as being " a celebration of what 's most natural about Florida . "
PepsiCo really pours it on when touting its partnership with a Return The Warmth program " that transformed recycled Aquafina bottles into 100,000 fleece jackets for children . "
Dasani and Aquafina alone spent $ 43.4 million in advertising last year .
According to Hemphill , this is a departure for the industry .
" One of the things that I think is kind of interesting , " he says , " is that the bottled water category has grown to a fairly large - scale size with comparatively minimal marketing in terms of the dollars spent versus some of the other beverage categories .
Pepsi and Coke did some limited television advertising , and you might see some print campaigns in magazines or the occasional billboard , but it 's pretty much been a consumer phenomenon based on the desire for healthier products and ­convenience . "
Environmentally , more is being done these days than just superimposing eco-evocative words upon images of glistening mountain streams .
The big three nowadays all utilize lighter - weight containers that use less plastic —
Nestlé claims its Ozarka bottles are 30 percent lighter than the average bottles on the market , and an even lighter container is in the works .
Aquafina indicates that its 35 percent slimmer bottle prevents 45 million pounds of plastic from landing in the dump each year .
Coca - Cola 's newly greened portfolio includes contributions to some 70 public water projects in 40 countries , and construction of the world 's largest plastic bottle recycling plant , in Spartanburg , South Carolina ( expected to open next year ) .
In one of its clearest victories to date , Think Outside the Bottle pressured Pepsi-Cola into agreeing to print " Public Water Source " on its Aquafina label .
" If this helps clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources , then it's a reasonable thing to do , " said Michelle Naughton , a Pepsi spokesperson .
Ray Crockett , her counterpart at Coca - Cola , disagrees .
" The FDA 's definition of purified water does not require ( revealing ) the source , " he has been quoted as saying .
" We believe consumers know what they 're buying . "
Or at least some do .
Probably about the same percentage as those knowing that Evian , spelled backwards , is naive .

NEW YORK , Aug 14 ( Reuters ) -
The global junk bond default rate rose to 1.79 percent in July from 1.44 percent in June as U.S. financial and real estate firms struggled to keep up with debt payments , Standard & Poor ’s said on Thursday .
The U.S. default rate rose to 2.37 percent in July from 1.92 percent in June and is likely to rise to 4.9 percent over the next 12 months , S&P said in a release .
The copyright ambulance - chasers at Davenport Lyons have a High Court order demanding 25,000 UK ISP subscribers ' names and addresses , it emerged today .
Davenport Lyons will send letters to the addresses it obtains demanding £ 300 to avoid a potentially costly court battle .
The London law firm hit headlines on Tuesday when it won £ 16,000 from a woman it accused of illegally sharing the game Dream Pinball 3D over a peer - to - peer network .
Davenport Lyons will get £ 10,000 and the game 's publisher Topware Interactive £ 6,000 in damages .
Codemasters , British developer of higher profile games such as Colin McRae DiRT has also employed Davenport Lyons , which opened up its new market in chasing filesharers last year .
In possibly related news , customers of Be Unlimited , BT , Easynet ( Sky ) , Entanet , KCom ( Karoo and Eclipse ) Orange , Plusnet , Thus ( Demon ) and Tiscali were all fingered for filesharing in an application for personal details granted by the High Court on 30 June .
IP addresses were seen participating in peer - to - peer networks sharing copyright material .
The application to identify the subscribers was granted on grounds there was " prima facie case that each of the subscribers associated with the IP addresses ... have copied the Applicant 's work (s ) on to his or her personal or office Computer without the [ rights holder 's ] permission for the purpose of making it available via file sharing " .
That High Court order is here on the website of Digiprotect , a German firm that identifies alleged copyright infringers on behalf of rights holders before sending in Davenport Lyons .
All the broadband providers had until 29 July to comply with the order , except BT and Plusnet , who have until 30 September .
Failure to meet the demands would put the ISPs in contempt of court and liable to prosecution .
We 've asked Davenport Lyons if the order on Digiprotect 's website is the same one detailed by The Times today as accusing 25,000 , but it has n't given us an answer yet .
We 'll update this story if it does . ®
Using a business credit card can be a great thing .
It can help you keep a close eye on expenditures .
If you have a business credit card , your accountant may very well applaud you .
A credit card can greatly help lighten your accountant ’s workload and he or she will have a lot less work to do than with cash transactions when it comes time to prepare your tax paperwork .
However , whatever the reason or reasons you choose to have a business credit card , there are still things you need to know about the terms and conditions attached to such a card .
For example the annual fee for a business credit card is higher than that of a personal credit card .
You could find yourself paying as much as $ 150 per year for cards with extras but if you simply need a credit card to make basic purchases , you would be best choosing a card offering an introductory interest free period .
Credit Cards with an introductory interest free period do n’t charge interest during this time .
This time usually lasts anywhere from a month to 12 months .
This can be great news for you as a business , especially if you are new and have setup expenses to deal with .
Because of this , a card like this can generally be looked at as an interest free loan .
Your statement shows when the payment is due and this is the last date your money must be received by the company .
Some cards such as American Express require that you pay the balance in full each month , so make sure you take a good look at the terms of any credit card before signing up .
If you run over there will be no hesitation on the part of the company to apply a late payment fee onto your existing balance and if you are not on an interest free or fixed rate card , you are likely to be penalized for late payment by an increase in your APR too .
The Annual Percentage Rate ( APR ) is the amount of interest you are charged on the balance outstanding on your credit card .
Choose a fixed rate as opposed to a variable one so that the company is not given the option to up your rate of interest for a late payment .
This way you can at least keep an eye on your budget .
There is nothing to stop you shopping around for a new interest free or low rate introductory offer card if you find yourself paying higher interest rates than you can afford .
You are often allowed to transfer balances as an incentive to take out a new card and this can save you quite a large amount of money over a period of time .
Should you need cash to help the business out , some credit cards offer you the benefits of an immediate cash advance .
Nonetheless , the interest rates on cash advances are usually higher than purchases so only use this option in an emergency situation .
There may come a time when you have a problem about an aspect of your business credit card or require information quickly , and you will need to know that you can get in touch with your credit card company straight away .
Many companies have a frequently asked question page on their website and this is always a good place to start as more likely than not other people have asked the same question previously and the answer will be there on your screen .
Most credit card companies will offer you the service of communicating with a customer services operator either on line or by telephone and you can always test this method out and see what kind of response you receive before committing to a particular card .
Be sensible when considering applying for a business credit card .
For example if you are running a small DBA business , you may well not need a credit card .
As the credit will be built under your social security number , you have to be sure than you can manage the debt in an effective manner .

PITTSBURGH , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
A highly decorated Green Beret , Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth died a painful death in Iraq this year .
He died not on the battlefield .
He died in what should have been one of the safest spots in Iraq : on a U.S. base , in his bathroom .
Ryan Maseth , a 24 - year - old Green Beret , died in his shower January 2 .
The water pump was not properly grounded , and when he turned on the shower , a jolt of electricity shot through his body and electrocuted him January 2 .
The next day , Cheryl Harris was informed of his death .
A mother of three sons serving in Iraq , she had feared such news might come one day .
" I did ask exactly , ' How did Ryan die ?
What happened to him ? '
And he had told me that Ryan was electrocuted , " she said .
Her reaction was disbelief .
" I truly could n't believe he would be electrocuted ... in the shower , " she said .
Maseth , 24 , was not the first .
At least 12 U.S. troops have been electrocuted in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003 , according to military and government officials .
Watch mom describe horror , heartbreak over son's electrocution »
In fact , the Army issued a bulletin in 2004 warning that electrocution was " growing at an alarming rate . "
It said five soldiers died that year by electrocution , with improper grounding the likely culprit in each case .
The Army bulletin detailed one soldier 's death in a shower -- eerily similar to Maseth 's case -- that said he was found " lying on a shower room floor with burn marks on his body . "
Maseth 's mother says the Army was not immediately forthcoming with details about her son's death .
At one point , she says , the Army told her he had a small appliance with him in the shower on his base , a former palace complex near the Baghdad airport .
" It just created so much doubt , and I know Ryan , I know Ryan , I know how he was trained , I know that he would not have been in a shower with a small appliance and electrocuted himself , " she said .
Watch " I can't make sense around Ryan 's death " »
The Army refused to answer CNN 's questions about the case , citing pending litigation by Maseth 's family .
Maseth 's mother says she pressed the military for answers , eventually uncovering more details about her son's electrocution .
The surging current left burn marks across his body , even singeing his hair .
Army reports show that he probably suffered a long , painful death .
Fellow soldiers had to break down the door to help , said Patrick Cavanaugh , an attorney for Maseth 's parents .
" When they kicked down the door , they smelled burning hair , and they rushed over , saw Sgt.
Maseth lying there unconscious , and one of the rescuers himself was shocked electrically and sustained a fairly good jolt because the water and the pipes were still electrified , " Cavanaugh said .
Army documents obtained by CNN show that U.S. - paid contractor Kellogg , Brown and Root ( KBR ) inspected the building and found serious electrical problems a full 11 months before Maseth was electrocuted .
KBR noted " several safety issues concerning the improper grounding of electrical devices . "
But KBR 's contract did not cover " fixing potential hazards . "
It covered repairing items only after they broke down .
Only after Maseth died did the Army issue an emergency order for KBR to finally fix the electrical problems , and that order was carried out soon thereafter .
In an internal e-mail obtained by CNN , a Navy captain admits that the Army should have known " the extent of the severity of the electrical problems . "
The e-mail then says the reason the Army did not know was because KBR 's inspections were never reviewed by a " qualified government employee . "
Larraine McGee is the mother of Sgt. Christopher Everett , another soldier electrocuted in Iraq .
" The impression I got was that this was the first time that it had happened , " McGee said .
Her son was cleaning a Humvee on his Iraqi base with a power washer that was not properly grounded in 2005 .
" I thought Chris was the first and that because of that , they were going to correct the problem , and it was n't going to happen again , " she said .
When she learned of Maseth 's electrocution , she was stunned .
" It makes me very angry , because there is no reason for this to be going on , " said McGee .
The electrocution of soldiers is prompting anger in Washington .
" How did this happen ? " asked Rep. Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Oversight Committee .
Waxman has called for an investigation .
" Why was n't it corrected when we had the first signs that people were dying from electrocutions ? "
In a statement to CNN , the U.S. Department of Defense said it " considers this to be a serious issue and has referred it to the DoD Inspector General 's office for action . "
The Defense Department said that there are nearly 40,000 structures and housing units in the Iraqi theater and that " we believe there was adequate oversight of the KBR contractors . "
" In the past 12 months , KBR performed over 2 million service or work order repairs across the theater , " the Defense Department said .
It went on to say that the Pentagon has " no information " that personnel with Defense Contract Management Agency , which handles the KBR contract , was aware of the 2004 Army bulletin or that they " failed to take appropriate action in response to unsafe conditions brought to our attention . "
The Defense Department inspector general 's office said it could not comment on the new investigation at this time .
KBR declined a CNN interview , but in an e-mail the company said it found " no evidence of a link between the work it has been tasked to perform and the reported electrocutions . "
The Defense Contract Management Agency declined to be interviewed , citing the Defense Department investigation .
Harris says she will continue to fight to make sure other soldiers do n't die similar deaths .
" I 'm not going to sit around quietly , " she said .
" I want the answers surrounding Ryan 's death -- the accountability .
And even further , I want to make sure that our troops are taken care of that are left on the ground ... [ so ] they do n't have to wake up and worry about taking a shower and electrocution . "

Salman Rushdie with one of his subjects ( Photos : The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation / Prashant Panjiar )
Some of India 's best - known writers have come together in a unique anthology of writing which tells the human stories behind HIV / Aids in the country .
India has one of the largest numbers of HIV - positive people in the world and they suffer serious social stigma .
Aids Sutra : Untold Stories from India has been published in collaboration with Avahan , the India Aids initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , a leading HIV prevention project .
Roughly $ 2 from the proceeds of each book sold will go to support children affected by HIV / Aids in cities which have a high prevalence of the disease .
For the project , 16 writers travelled across the country to talk to housewives , vigilantes , homosexuals , drug addicts , policemen and sex workers - and served up engaging essays on the disease and its fallout in India .
' Huge achievement '
They include Booker Prize - winners Sir Salman Rushdie and Kiran Desai ; Vikram Seth , the celebrated author of A Suitable Boy ; and internationally - acclaimed writer and historian William Dalrymple .
Other contributors include novelist Amit Chaudhuri , leading Bengali writer Sunil Gangopadhyay , historian - writer Mukul Kesavan and popular novelist Shobhaa De. India has one of the largest numbers of HIV - positive people in the world " This [ anthology ] is a huge achievement ... it is critically important to recognise that the Aids epidemic is primarily a crisis of human lives ...
We are in it together , " says Nobel Prize - winning economist Amartya Sen in the foreword .
The range of essays is truly impressive .
Sir Salman , for example , spends a day with eunuchs in the western city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) to write up a piece called The Half - Woman God .
" India has always understood androgyny , the man in the woman 's body , the woman in the man's .
Yet ... the third gender of India still need our understanding , and our help , " he says .
Kiran Desai travelled to the southern coastal state of Andhra Pradesh to meet its sex workers .
The state has one of the highest rates of infection in India .
" What I had seen , really seen , were lives lived with the intensity of art ; rife with metaphor , raw , distilled , " Desai writes .
" The emotions of love and friendship , you 'd assume would be missing or rotten , in these communities - existing even more so for their being sought amidst illegality , fragmentation and betrayal .
" These were lives lived beyond ordinariness , insisting on a personal story , not exchangeable with any other . "
William Dalrymple met a number of devadasis - literally , slaves of the goddess of fertility - who often end up as sex workers in India .
" I was completely unaware of the scale of the Aids epidemic in India before I took part in this project , " said Dalrymple .
Kiran Desai found ' raw ' intensity in the lives of sex workers " I was both intellectually challenged and emotionally moved by what I saw and learned .
When an epidemic gains a human face , and you actually meet people who are dying of this disease , everything changes . "
Vikram Seth simply wrote a poem on Aids , opening with : I shall die soon , I know / The thing is in my blood / It will not let me go / It saps my cells for food And he ends poignantly : Stay by my steel ward bed / And hold me where I lie / Love me when I am dead / And do not let me die .
Silence and shame Seth says that HIV / Aids in India is " exacerbated by our ignorance and shame about sex " .
" We simply do n't like to talk about it - even to impart or receive essential , life saving information . "
Amit Chaudhuri talks to Indian doctors fighting the disease and the stigma attached to it in an essay called Healing .
There is ignorance and shame about sex in India , says Vikram Seth " None of the doctors I met ... had initially been trained to face the disease .
What they were now was shaped by it ; and HIV had confronted each in a slightly different incarnation - a rumour ; a makeshift pedagogy ; a death . "
Celebrated Bengali writer Sunil Gangopadhyay returned to the thriving red light district of Sonagachi in the eastern city of Calcutta after nearly five decades .
Sonagachi has managed to keep infection rates lower than other red light districts in India by empowering sex workers - infection rates have hovered between 5 % and 10 % here , compared to nearly 50 % in Mumbai 's Kamathipura district .
Siddhartha Deb travelled to India 's north - eastern state of Manipur , parts of which are ravaged by HIV , heroin addiction and a separatist war .
" Whether it is violence , addiction , poverty or Aids , these miseries seem to take place in the state - an invisible corner of India that seems to have received nothing from modernity except drugs , guns and draconian laws , " he says .
There are also essays on the last days of a film - maker dying of the disease , orphans made by the disease , and high - risk truck drivers .
Aids Sutra is published in the US and UK by Anchor Books and Vintage respectively , and in India by Random House India .

Buchanan accuses ' McCain 's neocon warmonger ' of treason Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday August 22 , 2008
Print This Email This According to conservative commentator and former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan , Sen . John McCain 's chief foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann is a ' dual loyalist , ' ' neocon warmonger ' involved in activities that ' none dare call treason . '
Scheunemann 's former employer , Orion Strategies , is a lobbying firm with strong ties to Mikheil Saakashvili 's administration in Georgia .
Since Georgia attempted to retake South Ossetia by force , triggering a sharp , violent rebuke by Russian forces , Sen. McCain has been by far the most strident advocate of US support for the former Soviet state .
And his top adviser , says Buchanan , may well be the next Henry Kissinger or Zbigniew Brzezinski .
" He is a dual loyalist , a foreign agent whose assignment is to get America committed to spilling the blood of her sons for client regimes who have made this moral mercenary a rich man , " he wrote .
In his recent history , Scheunemann was a key member of the Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) , which lobbied President Clinton for war with Iraq for years before the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
He was also a signatory on a letter to President George W. Bush , just days after the terrorist attacks , demanding an invasion of Iraq and threatening political consequences if the president did not comply .
In addition , Scheunemann served as executive director of Ahmad Chalabi 's group , " The Committee for Liberation of Iraq , " a pro-war organization formed in 2002 .
Chalabi , once dubbed the " George Washington of Iraq , " has since been accused of providing false information to US authorities and is currently under investigation .
" Most important , Scheunemann 's former lobbying firm , Orion Strategies , received at lest $ 800,000 from the government of Georgia between 2004 and May 15 , 2008 , when Scheunemann finally severed his ties -- officially , at least -- to the firm , " notes The Nation .
" Before that , between January 1 , 2007 , and May 15 , 2008 , Scheunemann was officially on the payroll as both Georgia 's lobbyist and McCain 's top adviser , during which time Georgia paid Orion and $ 290,000 and McCain paid him $ 70,000 . "
While the Bush administration has conceded that the Russian response to Georgia 's aggression is not grounds for starting another war , Scheunemann and Orion Strategies have succeeded in making Georgian membership in NATO a popular position .
Sens. McCain and Obama , along with the Bush administration , are all pushing to have the embattled nation inducted into the alliance , bringing a pact of war along with it should Russian forces again cross into the country .
" Others who were once uneasy about the influence of conservatives on Mr. McCain say that their worries have not been realized , even as Mr. McCain has taken conservative positions , " writes Elizabeth Bumiller in the New York Times .
" This is the situation in which the interventionists have placed our country : committed to go to war for countries and causes that do not justify war , against a Russia that is re-emerging as a great power only to find NATO squatting on her doorstep , " said Buchanan .
" [ T ] here does n't seem to be any momentum either for a direct legal challenge or a congressional investigation , which could subpoena the players and get sworn testimony , " reported Robert Dreyfuss for The Nation .
McCain staff have called the criticism of Scheunemann 's ties to Georgia " disgraceful , " and even alleged that Democrats are parroting claims injected into Western media by a Russian public relations firm .
EROI of Canadian Natural Gas , Revised
Preamble
[ Hughes 2007 ] Interview transcript with David Hughes of the Canadian Geological Survey .
" The assessment of discovered and undiscovered gas is based on statistical methodology .
So , we look at what 's called pool size distributions - discovered and undiscovered - and we can make an estimate of how many undiscovered pools are left , and the size of those pools .
I 'm also on the Canadian Gas Potential Committee - a group of senior geoscientists that prepares periodic national assessments of Canada 's discovered and undiscovered gas resources - and in our most recent assessment , on the conventional gas side , in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin , the two - thirds of the gas that we found were contained in 44,000 pools .
The one - third of the gas that we have n't discovered , yet , is contained in 500,000 pools .
And the last 200,000 - 300,000 pools on that tail will be far too small to be commercially developed .
So , roughly 90 % of what 's left of the undiscovered resources are contained in probably 250,000 pools .
It takes us two wells to find each one - that 's 500,000 wells to find the last 30 % of Canada 's gas .
To put that in perspective : we 've drilled 300,000 wells to find the first 70 % , so we can see that 's the treadmill , the law of diminishing returns . "
Introduction
This paper uses data collected by the Canadian National Energy Board to estimate the Energy Return on Energy Invested ( EROI ) of Canadian natural gas production .
EROI is critical because no fossil fuel can remain an energy source with a low EROI .
A falling EROI is an indication that technology is losing the race against depleting reserves .
( See Ten Fundamental Principals of Net Energy by C. Cleveland )
In the prior article on the EROI of Canadian Natural Gas showed that EROI was falling rapidly , and that it could possibly hit unity in less than 10 years .
This article refines the prior estimate after helpful suggestions from Nate Hagens , Dr. C. Hall , and Dr. C. Cleveland .
Unfortunately , the estimates were revised downward because the natural gas industry is more energy intensive than the national average industry .
North American Natural Gas Production and EROI Decline .
This article also focuses in greater detail on the Canadian EROI calculations .
It would be helpful to hear from anyone who has access to drilling and operating cost data so we might form a more complete picture of what is happening with the most recent wells in the United States .
Decline in the WCSB
Canada is a major natural gas producer and supplies about 18 % of the natural gas used in the United States .
Most of Canada ’s natural gas is extracted from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin , which is located north of Montana and North Dakota .
The WCSB is a mature region and well productivity has been slowly falling .
Falling well productivity means that more wells must be drilled each year to produce the same amount of natural gas .
Natural gas drilling and extraction is very energy intensive and more wells means more fuel must be used , more steel pipe , more drilling rigs , and more labor .
Eventually the energy required to drill and operate a well will require more energy than the well produces .
At that point natural gas extraction will stop being a fuel source and if continued would only be a fuel upgrade
We examine how to calculate EROI and how to forecast EROI trends below .
The Basic Calculation
There are many ways to calculate EROI described in the literature [ Hall 1979 ] ( the primary reason there is not ONE way is the lack of available data in parsed energy terms ) .
The method used here is one that could be repeated with the same information needed to calculate the financial ROI .
The basic equation is :
EROI = Eoutput / Einput
The Eoutput is easy to calculate .
This is the energy in the sum total of natural gas produced by a well ( or group of wells ) .
Natural gas production is often measured in cubic feet and this should be converted to Joules of energy .
The Einput is harder to calculate .
Einput includes all fuels used to drill , complete and operate the natural gas well (s ) .
But it must also include all capital equipment , materials , and labor .
The energy embodied in these materials often exceeds the energy consumed directly as fuel .
( Casing pipe being one major energy cost ) .
Our society does not track the energy content of every item we use .
Instead , our society does accounting using money .
This means that we need a mechanism for converting from money into energy .
The equation to do this is simple ( in principal ) :
Einput = Eintensity * ( drilling cost + completion cost + operation cost ) .
Eintensity is the conversion factor from $ to Joules .
It is expressed in J per $ .
National Energy Intensity
An accurate Eintensity conversion factor is very important .
One method is to calculate a national average Eintensity .
This is done by taking the GDP of the country and dividing by the total energy used by a country .
Eintensity = Total Energy / GDP
For Canada the GDP was taken from the Statistics Canada and the Total Energy was taken from the BP Statistical review .
[ Can Stat 2007 ] [ BP 2007 ]
As an example here is 2006 :
9.4e6 j /$ = 1.36e19 j / 1.45e12 $
Now we have an ( approximate ) method of converting $ ( Can ) into energy .
The next step is to get the Eoutput and cost input data .
Canadian National Energy Board Data
The Canadian National Energy Board calculates the total natural gas production from each year 's newly drilled wells .
And they calculate the cost of drilling and operating those wells .
The data is summarized in the following table .
Notice how costs have been rising to produce the same 1 Gj of natural gas .
The equation is :
EROI = Eoutput / Einput
Eoutput = 1 Gj ( because the NEB data is provided this way )
Einput = Eintensity * $ Can / Gj ( the NEB data for the chart is also in table form )
This is done for every year from 1996 to 2006 and is graphed below :
This method yields a 2006 EROI from 15 - 18 .
Inflation Adjustment
One issue with using a conversion from money to energy is that monetary inflation will skew the results .
An inflating currency will appear as a dropping EROI .
Inflation must be removed from the cost data .
There are two series in the above chart .
Each series represents a different technique for removing inflation .
The first method ( CPI Adjust ) is to adjust all $ values using the Canadian Consumer Price Index .
All cost data is inflation corrected to the same base year .
Then the Eintensity is calculated for the base year and is applied to all years .
The second method ( Mtoe / GDP on the chart ) does not use the CPI but instead recalculates the Eintensity every single year .
If monetary inflation is happening , that should show up as inflating GDP numbers and should be canceled out .
Both methods yield similar results .
The CPI method is used for the rest of this paper because it works better for the technique explained next .
Industry Energy Intensity
The problem with an Eintensity based on the National Average is that some industries are much more energy intensive than other industries .
Specifically energy producing industries can use double the energy per $ that other economic sectors use .
And this is the case with natural gas .
Dr. Hall provided an updated estimate of Eintensity for the natural gas industry of 20e6 j per $ ( 2005 ) .
This is just about double the national average and means that the prior EROI calculations were twice as optimistic as they should have been .
The yellow line in the chart below shows the EROI recalculated using the industry Eintensity .
The yellow line is much lower than the prior estimates .
This apparent bad news is offset somewhat by a more moderate rate of decline .
Forecasting EROI
In my prior article , future EROI was calculated using a simple linear regression of the EROI data points and extending that line to unity .
This resulted in a forecast of EROI hitting unity in just a few years .
However , EROI does not have a linear behavior at low values .
A change in EROI from 100 down to 10 requires only a 10 % change in energy input .
But a change in EROI from 10 down to 5 takes another 10 % increase in energy input .
The shift from a slow input change to a fast input change is easiest to see graphically - it resembles a knee or cliff .
This sudden bend in the chart suggests that we cannot use a linear regression to forecast EROI .
Instead we forecast EROI using an exponential function .
While the exponential fit is good , it depends on there being a very large number of future wells , each with smaller and smaller URR .
There is evidence to support this position [ Hughes 2007 ]
If the graph is changed to a Log Normal plot then the exponential appears as a straight line and the new intercepts can be seen to occur about 2030 .
Which brings up the question :
How low can EROI drop before we have serious issues with our natural gas supply ?
How Low Can EROI Go ?
Not down to 1:1 .
Look at this graph of natural gas prices .
The well head price is much lower than the delivered price .
Looking at the 1990 numbers , you can see that most of the cost was in distribution .
By 2008 that had reversed and the largest cost was at the well head .
Natural gas distribution uses significant amounts of natural gas for compression and storage .
Estimating the EROI at the well head is just the first step in calculating the minimum EROI for a fuel source .
For a residential consumer the distribution cost would at least double the energy input needed to get the fuel to the customer .
This means a well head EROI of 2:1 sounds like it would be energy positive , but actually all the net energy surplus would be consumed in distribution and the residential customer would receive no heat .
( Other types of customers have lower distribution costs ) .
After distribution , the energy cost of the furnaces or heating equipment must be added because it is vital to turn the natural gas into usable heat for the consumer .
Again , this ratchets upwards the minimum EROI threshold .
There are many other uncounted energy drains in the natural gas production chain .
A truly wide boundary analysis would include more of these indirect costs .
Universities and colleges are needed to train the technical staff that oversee the whole production and distribution system .
The road and transport system is vital to transport and maintain the natural gas infrastructure .
If society stops paying any of these hidden energy costs , it would be impossible to maintain the natural gas production and distribution system .
So a holistic analysis must set aside extra energy to account for these necessary expenses .
Thus we can place a very approximate lower bound for EROI somewhere between the absolute minimum of 2.5:1 up to possibly as high as 5:1 .
This approximate lower bound leaves us with a serious natural gas net energy issue somewhere between 2013 and 2020 .
Results and Discussion
Using this method , the EROI of Canadian natural gas production has dropped by nearly 50 % in the last 10 years and is trending strongly downwards .
The WCSB is clearly showing signs of depletion .
A heroic effort by natural gas producers has held production relatively flat , but at a tremendous energy cost .
Depletion is fast outpacing drilling technology .
It is possible that within the next 10 years Canada will no longer be a supplier of energy positive natural gas .
( Again , they might still produce natural gas , but only by utilizing abundant lower quality energy inputs , if available .
Forecasts that show flat natural gas prices and flat or rising production are likely in error ( Such as the EIA 's AEO 2008 ) .
Either prices must rise to cover the rising production energy cost , or production must fall .
And most probably , prices will rise at the same time production falls .

You can see that most of the gas production in the year 2003 was actually from prior years drilling ( red and green and blue on the bottom ) .
That means that the EROI calculation is going to be skewed by prior years drilling .
There are two ways to deal with this problem .
The first is to just accept the error if there is no way to separate out new gas from old gas .
The second method is to separate out the production of each year ( as the graph above does ) and then estimate the future production of each years wells .
Then calculate the EROI for each year using only the gas produced that year .
( So take only the production costs for 2006 and only the natural gas produced from year 2006 vintage wells ) .
The future estimate of each year 's production is done with a decline model .
This next graph shows what a decline model looks like .
There are several downward slopes and eventually production hits zero cubic feet of gas per day .
The amount of gas produced is totaled up and the energy value of that gas is calculated .
Then energy output is divided by the cost to drill the well and you get Gj / $ .
Or would if there was data for every single well .
In reality , lots of wells are averaged together ( read the report for further details ) .
The NEB uses this decline model strategy to calculate Gj / $ .
And that is why we can see the EROI decline very quickly .
It is not getting " muddied " by prior year 's gas production .
Appendix B. Real Demand Inflation
Inflation can cause drilling costs to rise and can look like falling EROI .
That was corrected by using the CPI .
However , during a period of high demand for drilling rigs , it is possible that companies bidding against each other ( real demand ) pushes prices up faster than the CPI .
This brings up the question :
Is Canadian EROI falling because energy inputs are rising or because demand for rigs and equipment is pushing up prices and it just looks like EROI is falling ?
To try to answer this question , the daily rental cost for drilling rigs was taken from the annual reports of the Precision Drilling Trust ( PDT ) .
PDT operates a very large number of the rigs in Canada .
It is assumed the costs they charge are a good proxy for all rig costs .
Charting the data from multiple annual reports and inflation correcting the prices shows that the cost of renting drilling rigs is trending upwards .
Rig utilization data shows that some years have a high demand and in other years the demand drops quite a bit .
We would expect that on years with high demand we would see much higher prices .
And on years with low demand we would get much lower prices .
However , this is not what we see .
When rig rental rates are plotted against rig utilization , we see no correlation ( we expected a line running from lower left to upper right ) .
Instead we get data points scattered all around .
Statistical analysis finds no correlation ( regression p = 0.51 ) .
If competition is not driving up the cost of rigs , then what might be the cause ?
One possible answer is that the number of rigs is increasing quickly and the cost of these new rigs must be paid for in drilling rental rates .
Increased capital expenses must be included in the EROI .
Increased costs to pay for new drilling rigs are a valid inclusion .
The EROI drop does not appear to be caused by rig demand in Canada .
However , further study should examine rig demand in the US .
And further study should also examine other major inputs to drilling , such as steel and casing pipe .
Another approach might be to look at the profits of major companies that supply drilling services .
High profits are more indicative of real demand inflation .

「 インターネット上の犯罪予告を検知できるソフトウエア」という話には、何か根本的な違和感を感じるのだけど、強いてそれを言葉にすれば、ここで求められているのは「謀議」を検知するソフトなのか「絶望」を検知するソフトなのかということ。
はっきりと凶行を決意した人間が「人を殺せるナイフはどこの店で買えますか」とか掲示板で聞いているのを検知するソフトなら意味を持つ。困難であるし道義的な疑問はあるが、技術的にはかろうじて意味のある仕様が書けると思う。
それは「謀議」を検出するソフトということになるが、それでは加藤智大のケースには無意味だ。
加藤が掲示板に吐露していたのは、自暴自棄な気持ちであり絶望である。加藤は掲示板で情報を求めていたわけではなくて、救いを求めていた。加藤は見つかりたくなかったわけではなくて見つけてほしかったのだ。
自分は救いを得られることがないと絶望した人間を救うには、彼を「検知」するより、彼が救われるような場なり手段なりを用意した方がいい。そうすれば、加藤は自分から名乗り出てくるだろう。
加藤を救うことは困難である。それはよくわかる。でも困難だからまず加藤を「検知」するソフトを作れという話なのだろうか。
それができたとして、「検知」した加藤をどうするのか。加藤を救うつもりなのか、加藤を拘束するつもりなのか。救うことが困難だから「検知」するのであるから、拘束するつもりなのだろう。
つまり、深い絶望を吐露した人間を検知して拘束しようという話としか思えない。
そんなソフトがもし本当にできたとしたら、まず、この書き込みをテストデータとして入力してみたい。
これだけ深い絶望を表現している書き込みに反応しなかったら、そのソフトは役立たずだ。
そして、そういうふうに深く社会に絶望しそれを表現している人間を拘束すべし、というのが社会の総意であるなら、赤木智弘も拘束すべきだろう。
そうすれば、私もこんな悪夢に悩まされないですむ。ついでにサイレントテロとか言ってる連中も根絶やしにして欲しいものだ。

NINE years ago , Ahmad Batebi appeared on the cover of The Economist .
He was a 21 - year - old student , one of thousands who protested against Iran 's government that summer .
He was photographed holding aloft a T - shirt bespattered with the blood of a fellow protester .
Soon afterwards , he was arrested and shown our issue of July 17th 1999 .
“ With this ” , he was told , “ you have signed your death warrant . ”
During his interrogation he was blindfolded and beaten with cables until he passed out .
His captors rubbed salt into his wounds to wake him up , so they could torture him more .
They held his head in a drain full of sewage until he inhaled it .
He recalls yearning for a swift death to end the pain .
He was played recordings of what he was told was his mother being tortured .
His captors wanted him to betray his fellow students , to implicate them in various crimes and to say on television that the blood on that T - shirt was only red paint .
He says he refused .
He was sentenced to death for “ creating street unrest ” .
But after a global outcry , the sentence was commuted to 15 years in jail .
He speculates that his high profile made it hard to kill him without attracting negative publicity .
For two years , he was kept in solitary confinement , in a cell that was little more than a toilet hole with a wooden board on top .
He was tortured constantly .
Only when he was allowed to mingle with other prisoners again did he begin to overcome his despair .
He suffered a partial stroke that left the right side of his body without feeling .
He needed medical attention .
The regime did not want to be blamed for him dying behind bars , he says , so he was allowed out for treatment .
Three months ago , on the day of the Persian new year , he escaped into Iraq .
On June 24th he arrived in America .
He spoke to The Economist on July 7th .
Looking at the picture that sparked his ordeal , he says that another man in his place might be angry , but he is not .
Mr Batebi is a photographer himself .
He says he understands what journalism involves .
Had we not published the picture , he says , another paper might have .
Looking at the same picture , his lawyer , interpreter and friend Lily Mazahery says she is close to tears : in it , the young Mr Batebi 's pale arms are as yet unscarred by torture .
The protests Mr Batebi took part in nine years ago frightened Iran 's rulers .
The students were angry about censorship , the persecution of intellectuals and the thugs who beat up any student overheard disparaging the regime .
Mr Batebi thinks Iran could well turn solidly democratic some day .
In neighbouring states , religious extremism is popular .
In Iran , he says , the government is religiously extreme , but the people are not .
He is cagey about how exactly he escaped .
But he says he used a cellphone camera to record virtually every step of his journey , and will soon go public with the pictures and his commentary .
Meanwhile , he seems to be enjoying America .
He praises the way “ people have the opportunity to become who they want to be ” .
Shortly after he arrived , he posted a picture of himself in front of the Capitol on his Farsi - language blog , with the caption : “ Your hands will never touch me again . ”
Russia 's invasion of Georgia strikes at the heart of western values and our 21st - century system of security .
If the international community allows Russia to crush our democratic , independent state , it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere .
Russia intends to destroy not just a country , but an idea .
For too long we underestimated the ruthlessness of the regime in Moscow .
Within 24 hours of agreeing to a ceasefire , Russia 's forces were rampaging through Gori ; blocking the port of Poti ; sinking Georgian vessels ; and - worst of all - brutally purging Georgian villages in South Ossetia .
The Russian leadership cannot be trusted - and this hard reality should guide the west 's response .
Only western peacekeepers can end the war .
Russia also seeks to destroy our economy and is bombing factories , ports and other vital sites .
Accordingly , we need to establish a modern version of the Berlin airlift .
The United Nations , the US , Canada and others are moving in this direction , for which we are deeply grateful .
As we consider what to do next , understanding Moscow 's goals is critical .
It aims to satisfy its imperialist ambitions , to erase one of the few democratic , law - governed states in its vicinity - and , above all , to demolish the post - cold war system of international relations in Europe .
It is showing that it can do as it pleases .
The historical parallels are stark : Russia 's war on Georgia echoes events in Finland in 1939 , Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 .
Perhaps this is why so many eastern European countries , which suffered under Soviet occupation , have voiced their support for us .
Russia 's leaders see us as a threat because Georgia is a free country whose people have elected to integrate into the Euro - Atlantic community .
But Russia 's rulers do not want their nation or its borders contaminated by democratic ideas .
Since our democratic government came to power after the 2003 Rose revolution , Russia has used economic embargoes and closed borders to isolate us , and has illegally deported thousands of Georgians .
It has tried to destabilise us politically with the help of criminal oligarchs .
It has tried to freeze us into submission by blowing up vital gas pipelines in midwinter .
When all that failed to shake the Georgian people 's resolve , Russia invaded .
Last week Russia , using its separatist proxies , attacked several peaceful , Georgian - controlled villages in South Ossetia .
On August 6 , just hours after a senior Georgian official travelled to South Ossetia to attempt negotiations , a massive assault was launched on Georgian settlements .
Even as we came under attack , I declared a unilateral ceasefire in the hope of avoiding escalation , and announced our willingness to talk to the separatists by any means .
But we then learned that columns of Russian tanks and troops had crossed Georgia 's sovereign borders .
The thousands of troops , tanks and artillery massed on our border are evidence of how long Russia had been planning this aggression .
Our government had no choice but to protect the country from invasion , secure our citizens and stop the bloodshed .
For years Georgia has been proposing 21st - century , European solutions for South Ossetia , including full autonomy guaranteed by the international community .
Russia has responded with crude , 19th - century methods .
It is true that Russian power could overwhelm our small country - though even we did not anticipate the ferocity and scale of Moscow 's response .
However , we had to try to protect our people : any democratic country would have done the same .
Facing this brutal invading army , our government decided to withdraw from South Ossetia , declare a ceasefire and seek negotiations .
However repeated attempts to contact senior Russian leaders were rebuffed .
Russia 's foreign ministry even denied receiving our notice of ceasefire hours after it was officially - and very publicly - delivered .
This was just one of many cynical ploys to deceive the world and justify further attacks .
This war threatens not only Georgia but security and liberty around the world .
If the international community fails to take a resolute stand , it will sound the death knell for the spread of freedom and democracy everywhere .
Georgia 's only fault in this crisis is its wish to be an independent , free and democratic country .
What would western nations do if they were punished for the same aspiration ?
I have staked my country 's fate on the west 's rhetoric about democracy and liberty .
As Georgians come under attack , we must ask : if the west is not with us , who is it with ?
If the line is not drawn now , when will it be drawn ?
We cannot allow Georgia to become the first victim of a new world order as imagined by Moscow .

Police fire water cannon at Bush protesters in South Korea Associated Press
Published : Tuesday August 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Police fired water cannons at thousands of protesters Tuesday as President Bush got a volatile reception in South Korea at the start of his three - nation Asian trip .
Dueling demonstrations reflected mixed sentiments in this U.S. ally , where public opinion surveys remain generally positive about America , though many people decry Washington for a variety of issues .
Bush will meet Wednesday with President Lee Myung - bak for the third time since the conservative , pro-American leader took office in February .
Some 18,300 police were on high alert with riot gear and bomb - sniffing dogs to maintain order during Bush 's brief visit , the National Police Agency said .
About 30,000 people gathered in front of Seoul City Hall for an afternoon Christian prayer service supporting Bush 's trip .
Large South Korean and U.S. flags were held aloft by balloons overhead along with a banner reading , " Welcome President Bush . "
" The United States made sacrifices for South Korea during the Korean War and helped us live well , " said Kim Jung - kwang , a 67 - year - old retired air force colonel who wore his military uniform to the rally .
" The United States is not our enemy .
Without the U.S. , we will die . "
As evening approached , an estimated 20,000 anti-Bush protesters gathered nearby .
Police turned water cannons on them as they tried to move onto the main central downtown boulevard , telling the crowd that the liquid contained markers to tag them so they could be identified later .
" I do n't have anti-U.S. sentiment .
I 'm just anti-Bush and anti-Lee Myung - bak , " said Uhm Ki-woong , 36 , a businessman who was wearing a mask and hat like other demonstrators in an apparent attempt to conceal his identity .
The anti-Bush crowd dwindled later in the evening to several thousand people , with the hard - core remnants turning aggressive .
Protesters shattered the windows of a police bus and authorities responded by again firing water cannons .
About 70 demonstrators were arrested , police said , in addition to another 12 near the military airport where Bush landed .
Bush held off on visiting Seoul earlier this year when protesters staged nightly candlelight vigils and repeatedly clashed with riot police over imports of American beef , saying Lee ignored public health concerns over the possibility of mad cow disease and failed to consult with citizens .
Lee has promised to patch up relations with Washington that became strained under Seoul 's previous decade of liberal governments .
Bush calls
Lee a friend , which is good considering the raft of sensitive topics they will tackle before the American president heads to Thailand , then to the Beijing Olympics .
At the top of the list is getting North Korea to live up to its commitment to dismantle its nuclear weapons program .
Sunday is the earliest that Washington could move to strike North Korea from a list of state - sponsors of terrorism , a long - held demand from Pyongyang .
But first , Washington wants the North to agree to procedures for verifying a declaration of its nuclear programs that Pyongyang submitted to the international arms talks - six months late and with fewer details than the U.S. originally demanded .
Washington has called for North Korea to allow thorough inspections and interviews with nuclear scientists , but Pyongyang has so far not accepted the proposal .
" We 're at a very critical moment now for the North Korean government to make a decision as to whether or not they 're going to verify what they said they would do , " Bush said in an interview with China 's state - run CCTV last week .
" It 's one thing to say it , but I think it 's going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us . "
Grateful for South Korea 's troop contribution in Iraq , Bush also will try to persuade Lee to make a bigger contribution in Afghanistan to help deal with the Taliban 's resurgence .
" Obviously we 'd like to see a greater role for South Koreans in Afghanistan , if the South Korean people are willing to move in that direction , " Dennis Wilder , the National Security Council 's senior director for Asian affairs , told reporters on Air Force One .
Also on the agenda will be efforts by both presidents to have their legislatures approve a free trade agreement , with estimates it could increase bilateral trade by 25 percent .
But with free trade deals with Colombia and Panama stalled in Congress , the prospects for ratification by the end of the year are unlikely .
Bush will meet with U.S. troops based in South Korea , as he did during a stopover in Alaska , where he expressed gratitude for their role in fighting terrorism .
" About a year ago , people thought Iraq was lost and hopeless , " Bush said at Eielson Air Force Base , where he posed for photos with airmen and soldiers and worked the crowd , at one point lifting a baby in the air .
" People were saying , ' Let 's get out of there , it does n't matter to our national security . '
" Iraq has changed - a lot - thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country .
The terrorists ( are ) on the run .
The terrorists will be denied a safe haven , and freedom is on the march .
And as a result , our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world . "
Bush 's Asia trip also includes stops in Thailand and China .
In an interview aboard Air Force One with The Washington Post , Bush said it was " really hard to tell " whether human rights in China had improved over the past eight years .
Bush said he speaks candidly with Chinese President Hu Jintao about human rights , but he skirted a question about a pre-Olympics security drive by Chinese authorities .
" They 're hypersensitive to a potential terrorist attack , " Bush said in the article for Tuesday 's editions of the paper .
" And my hope is , of course , that as they have their security in place , that they 're mindful of the spirit of the Games , and that if there is a provocation , they handle it in a responsible way without violence . "

The scariest thing about Sarah Palin is n't how unqualified she is - it's what her candidacy says about America
By Matt Taibbi
Created Sep 27 2008 - 12:57 pm
I 'm standing outside the XCEL ENERGY CENTER in St. Paul Minnesota Sarah Palin has just finished her speech to the Republican National Convention , accepting the party 's nomination for vice president .
If I had n't quit my two - packs - a - day habit earlier this year , I 'd be chain - smoking now .
So the only thing left is to stand mute against the fit - for - a - cheap - dog - kennel crowd - control fencing you see everywhere at these idiotic conventions and gnaw on weird new feelings of shock and anarchist rage as one would a rawhide chew toy .
All around me , a million cops in their absurd post - 9/11 space - combat get - ups stand guard as assholes in papier - mache puppet heads scramble around for one last moment of network face time before the coverage goes dark .
Four - chinned delegates from places like Arkansas and Georgia are pouring joyously out the gates in search of bars where they can load up on Zombies and Scorpion Bowls and other " wild " drinks and extramaritally grope their turkey - necked female companions in bathroom stalls as part of the " unbelievable time " they will inevitably report to their pals back home .
Only 21st - century Americans can pass through a metal detector six times in an hour and still think they 're at a party .
The defining moment for me came shortly after Palin and her family stepped down from the stage to uproarious applause , looking happy enough to throw a whole library full of books into a sewer .
In the crush to exit the stadium , a middle - aged woman wearing a cowboy hat , a red - white - and - blue shirt and an obvious eye job gushed to a male colleague they were both wearing badges identifying them as members of the Colorado delegation at the Xcel gates .
" She totally reminds me of my cousin ! " the delegate screeched .
" She 's a real woman !
The real thing ! "
I stared at her open - mouthed .
In that moment , the rank cynicism of the whole sorry deal was laid bare .
Here 's the thing about Americans .
You can send their kids off by the thousands to get their balls blown off in foreign lands for no reason at all , saddle them with billions in debt year after congressional year while they spend their winters cheerfully watching game shows and football , pull the rug out from under their mortgages , and leave them living off their credit cards and their Wal - Mart salaries while you move their jobs to China and Bangalore .
And none of it matters , so long as you remember a few months before Election Day to offer them a two - bit caricature culled from some cutting - room - floor episode of Roseanne as part of your presidential ticket .
And if she 's a good enough likeness of a loudmouthed middle - American archetype , as Sarah Palin is , John Q. Public will drop his giant - size bag of Doritos in gratitude , wipe the Sizzlin ' Picante dust from his lips and rush to the booth to vote for her .
Not because it makes sense , or because it has a chance of improving his life or anyone else 's , but simply because it appeals to the low - humming narcissism that substitutes for his personality , because the image on TV reminds him of the mean , brainless slob he sees in the mirror every morning .
Sarah Palin is a symbol of everything that is wrong with the modern United States .
As a representative of our political system , she 's a new low in reptilian villainy , the ultimate cynical masterwork of puppeteers like Karl Rove .
But more than that , she is a horrifying symbol of how little we ask for in return for the total surrender of our political power .
Not only is Sarah Palin a fraud , she 's the tawdriest , most half - assed fraud imaginable , 20 floors below the lowest common denominator , a character too dumb even for daytime TV - and this country is going to eat her up , cheering her every step of the way .
All because most Americans no longer have the energy to do anything but lie back and allow ourselves to be jacked off by the calculating thieves who run this grasping consumer paradise we call a nation .
The Palin speech was a political masterpiece , one of the most ingenious pieces of electoral theater this country has ever seen .
Never before has a single televised image turned a party 's fortunes around faster .
Until the Alaska governor actually ascended to the podium that night , I was convinced that John McCain had made one of the all - time campaign season blunders , that he had acted impulsively and out of utter desperation in choosing a cross-eyed political neophyte just two years removed from running a town smaller than the bleacher section at Fenway Park .
It even crossed my mind that there was an element of weirdly self - destructive pique in McCain 's decision to cave in to his party 's right - wing base in this fashion , that perhaps he was responding to being ordered by party elders away from a tepid , ideologically promiscuous hack like Joe Lieberman -- reportedly his real preference -- by picking the most obviously unqualified , doomed - to - fail joke of a Bible - thumping buffoon .
As in : You want me to rally the base ?
Fine , I 'll rally the base .
Here , I 'll choose this rifle - toting , serially pregnant moose killer who thinks God lobbies for oil pipelines .
Happy now ?
But watching Palin 's speech , I had no doubt that I was witnessing a historic , iconic performance .
The candidate sauntered to the lectern with the assurance of a sleepwalker - and immediately launched into a symphony of snorting and sneering remarks , taking time out in between the superior invective to present herself as just a humble gal with a beefcake husband and a brood of healthy , combat - ready spawn who just happened to be the innocent targets of a communist and probably also homosexual media conspiracy .
It was a virtuoso performance .
She appeared to be completely without shame and utterly full of shit , awing a room full of hardened reporters with her sickly sweet line about the high - school - flame - turned - hubby who , " five children later " is " still my guy . "
It was like watching Gidget address the Reichstag .
Within minutes , Palin had given TV audiences a character infinitely recognizable to virtually every American : the small - town girl with just enough looks and a defiantly incurious mind who thinks the PTA minutes are Holy Writ , and injustice means the woman next door owning a slightly nicer set of drapes or flatware .
Or the governorship , as it were .
Right - wingers of the Bush - Rove ilk have had a tough time finding a human face to put on their failed , inhuman , mean - as - hell policies .
But it was hard not to recognize the genius of wedding that faltering brand of institutionalized greed to the image of the suburban American supermom .
It 's the perfect cover , for there is almost nothing in the world meaner than this species of provincial tyrant .
Palin herself burned this political symbiosis into the pages of history with her seminal crack about the " difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull : lipstick , " blurring once and for all the lines between meanness on the grand political scale as understood by the Roves and Bushes of the world , and meanness of the small - town variety as understood by pretty much anyone who has ever sat around in his ranch - house den dreaming of a fourth plasma - screen TV or an extra set of KC HiLites for his truck , while some ghetto family a few miles away shares a husk of government cheese .
In her speech , Palin presented herself as a raging baby - making furnace of middle - class ambition next to whom the yuppies of the Obama set - who never want anything all that badly except maybe a few afternoons with someone else 's wife , or a few kind words in The New York Times Book Review -- seem like weak , self - doubting celibates , the kind of people who certainly cannot be trusted to believe in the right God or to defend a nation .
We 're used to seeing such blatant cultural caricaturing in our politicians .
But Sarah Palin is something new .
She 's all caricature .
As the candidate of a party whose positions on individual issues are poll losers almost across the board , her shtick is not even designed to sell a line of policies .
It 's just designed to sell her .
The thing was as much as admitted in the on-air gaffe by former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan , who was inadvertently caught saying on MSNBC that Palin was n't the most qualified candidate , that the party " went for this , excuse me , political bullshit about narratives . "
The great insight of the Palin VP choice is that huge chunks of American voters no longer even demand that their candidates actually have policy positions ; they simply consume them as media entertainment , rooting for or against them according to the reflexive prejudices of their demographic , as they would for reality - show contestants or sitcom characters .
Hicks root for hicks , moms for moms , born - agains for born - agains .
Sure , there was politics in the Palin speech , but it was all either silly lies or merely incidental fluffery buttressing the theatrical performance .
A classic example of what was at work here came when Palin proudly introduced her Down syndrome baby , Trig , then stared into the camera and somberly promised parents of special - needs kids that they would " have a friend and advocate in the White House . "
This was about a half - hour before she raised her hands in triumph with McCain , a man who voted against increasing funding for special - needs education .
Palin's charge that " government is too big " and that Obama " wants to grow it " was similarly preposterous .
Not only did her party just preside over the largest government expansion since LBJ , but Palin herself has been a typical Bush - era Republican , borrowing and spending beyond her means .
Her great legacy as mayor of Wasilla was the construction of a $ 14.7 million hockey arena in a city with an annual budget of $ 20 million ; Palin OK'd a bond issue for the project before the land had been secured , leading to a protracted legal mess that ultimately forced taxpayers to pay more than six times the original market price for property the city ended up having to seize from a private citizen using eminent domain .
Better yet , Palin ended up paying for the fucking thing with a 25 percent increase in the city sales tax .
But in her speech , of course , Palin presented herself as the enemy of tax increases , righteously bemoaning that " taxes are too high , " and Obama " wants to raise them . "
Palin has n't been too worried about federal taxes as governor of a state that ranks number one in the nation in federal spending per resident ( $ 13,950 ) , even as it sits just 18th in federal taxes paid per resident ( $ 5,434 ) .
That means all us taxpaying non-Alaskans spend $ 8,500 a year on each and every resident of Palin 's paradise of rugged self - sufficiency .
Not that this sworn enemy of taxes does n't collect from her own : Alaska currently collects the most taxes per resident of any state in the nation .
The rest of Palin 's speech was the same dog- whistle crap Republicans have been running on for decades .
Palin 's crack about a mayor being " like a community organizer , except that you have actual responsibilities " testified to the Republicans ' apparent belief that they can win elections till the end of time running against the Sixties .
( They 're probably right . )
The incessant grousing about the media was likewise par for the course , red meat for those tens of millions of patriotic flag - waving Americans whose first instinct when things get rough is to whine like bitches and blame other people - reporters , the French , those ungrateful blacks soaking up tax money eating big prison meals , whomever - for their failures .
Add to this the usual lies about Democrats wanting to " forfeit " to our enemies abroad and coddle terrorists , and you had a very run -of - the - mill , almost boring Republican speech from a substance standpoint .
What made it exceptional was its utter hypocrisy , its total disregard for reality , its absolute unrelation to the facts of our current political situation .
After eight years of unprecedented corruption , incompetence , waste and greed , the party of Karl Rove understood that 50 million Americans would not demand solutions to any of these problems so long as they were given a new , new thing to beat their meat over .
Sarah Palin is that new , new thing , and in the end it wo n't matter that she 's got an unmarried teenage kid with a bun in the oven .
Of course , if the daughter of a black candidate like Barack Obama showed up at his convention with a five - month bump and some sideways - capwearing , junior - grade Curtis Jackson holding her hand , the defenders of Traditional Morality would be up in arms .
But the thing about being in the realitymaking business is that you do n't need to worry much about vetting ; there are no facts in your candidate 's bio that cannot be ignored or overcome .
One of the most amusing things about the Palin nomination has been the reaction of horrified progressives .
The Internet has been buzzing at full volume as would - be defenders of san-ity and reason pore over the governor 's record in search of the Damning Facts .
My own telephone began ringing off the hook with calls from ex-Alaskans and friends of Alaskans determined to help get the " truth " about Sarah Palin into the major media .
Pretty much anyone with an Internet connection knows by now that Palin was originally for the " Bridge to Nowhere " before she opposed it ( she actually endorsed the plan in her 2006 gubernatorial campaign ) , that even after the project was defeated she kept the money , that she did n't actually sell the Alaska governor 's state luxury jet on eBay but instead sold it at a $ 600,000 loss to a campaign contributor ( who is now seeking $ 50,000 in taxpayer money to pay maintenance costs ) .
Then there are the salacious tales of Palin 's swinging - meat - cleaver management style , many of which seem to have a common thread :
In addition to being ensconced in a messy ethics investigation over her firing of the chief of the Alaska state troopers ( dismissed after refusing to sack her sister 's ex-husband ) , Palin also reportedly fired a key campaign aide for having an affair with a friend 's wife .
More ominously , as mayor of Wasilla , Palin tried to fire the town librarian , Mary Ellen Emmons , after Emmons resisted pressure to censor books Palin found objectionable .
Then there 's the God stuff : Palin belongs to a church whose pastor , Ed Kalnins , believes that all criticisms of George Bush " come from hell , " and wondered aloud if people who voted for John Kerry could be saved .
Kalnins , looming as the answer to Obama 's Jeremiah Wright , claims that Alaska is going to be a " refuge state " for Christians in the last days , last days which he sometimes speaks of in the present tense .
Palin herself has been captured on video mouthing the inevitable born - again idiocies , such as the idea that a recent oilpipeline deal was " God 's will . "
She also described the Iraq War as a " task that is from God " and part of a heavenly " plan . "
She supports teaching creationism and " abstinence only " in public schools , opposes abortion even for victims of rape , denies the science behind global warming and attends a church that seeks to convert Jews and cure homosexuals .
All of which tells you about what you 'd expect from a raise - the - base choice like Palin :
She 's a puffed - up dimwit with primitive religious beliefs who had to be educated as to the fact that the Constitution did not exactly envision government executives firing librarians .
Judging from the importance progressive critics seem to attach to these revelations , you 'd think that these were actually negatives in modern American politics .
But Americans like politicians who hate books and see the face of Jesus in every tree stump .
They like them stupid and mean and ignorant of the rules .
Which is why Palin has only seemed to grow in popularity as more and more of these revelations have come out .
The same goes for the most damning aspect of her biography , her total lack of big - game experience .
As governor of Alaska , Palin presides over a state whose entire population is barely the size of Memphis .
This kind of thing might matter in a country that actually worried about whether its leader was prepared for his job - but not in America .
In America , it takes about two weeks in the limelight for the whole country to think you 've been around for years .
To a certain extent , this is why Obama is getting a pass on the same issue .
He 's been on TV every day for two years , and according to the standards of our instant - ramen culture , that 's a lifetime of hands - on experience .
It is worth noting that the same criticisms of Palin also hold true for two other candidates in this race , John McCain and Barack Obama .
As politicians , both men are more narrative than substance , with McCain rising to prominence on the back of his bio as a suffering war hero and Obama mostly playing the part of the long - lost , futureembracing liberal dreamboat not seen on the national stage since Bobby Kennedy died .
If your stomach turns to read how Palin 's Kawasaki 704 glasses are flying off the shelves in middle America , you have to accept that middle America probably feels the same way when it hears that Donatella Versace dedicated her collection to Obama during Milan Fashion Week .
Or sees the throwing - panties - onstage - " I love you , Obama ! " ritual at the Democratic nominee 's town - hall appearances .
So , sure , Barack Obama might be every bit as much a slick piece of imageering as Sarah Palin .
The difference is in what the image represents .
The Obama image represents tolerance , intelligence , education , patience with the notion of compromise and negotiation , and a willingness to stare ugly facts right in the face , all qualities we 're actually going to need in government if we 're going to get out of this huge mess we 're in .
Here 's what Sarah Palin represents : being a fat fucking pig who pins " Country First " buttons on his man titties and chants " U - S - A ! U - S - A ! " at the top of his lungs while his kids live off credit cards and Saudis buy up all the mortgages in Kansas .
The truly disgusting thing about Sarah Palin is n't that she 's totally unqualified , or a religious zealot , or married to a secessionist , or unable to educate her own daughter about sex , or a fake conservative who raised taxes and horked up earmark millions every chance she got .
No , the most disgusting thing about her is what she says about us : that you can ram us in the ass for eight solid years , and we 'll not only thank you for your trouble , we 'll sign you up for eight more years , if only you promise to stroke us in the right spot for a few hours around election time .
Democracy does n't require a whole lot of work of its citizens , but it requires some :
It requires taking a good look outside once in a while , and considering the bad news and what it might mean , and making the occasional tough choice , and soberly taking stock of what your real interests are .
This is a very different thing from shopping , which involves passively letting sitcoms melt your brain all day long and then jumping straight into the TV screen to buy a Southern - Style Chicken Sandwich because the slob singing " I'm Lovin ' It ! " during the commercial break looks just like you .
The joy of being a consumer is that it does n't require thought , responsibility , self - awareness or shame :
All you have to do is obey the first urge that gurgles up from your stomach .
And then obey the next .
And the next .
And the next .
And when it comes time to vote , all you have to do is put your Country First -- just like that lady on TV who reminds you of your cousin .
U - S - A , baby .
U - S - A! U - S-A !

Enlarge By Matthew Holst for USA TODAY Mount Vernon , Iowa resident Linda Dona has Chron 's disease and fears she might miscarry if she stops taking her medication .
YOU CLICKED : WEEK'S MOST POPULAR HEALTH STORIES YOU CLICKED : WEEK'S MOST POPULAR HEALTH STORIES 1 : Feds rate U.S. nursing homes 2 : Doctors detail first U.S. face transplant 3 : Surgeon finds foot in newborn 's brain tumor 4 : Nursing homes talk new ratings 5 : Colonoscopy prep pills carry kidney risk 6 : Duggars welcome 18th child No. 7 - 10 : Diabetes drug risks , placebo effect Leslie Candy of Boston was expecting her first baby when she developed dangerously high blood pressure .
The condition , called pre-eclampsia , can cause women to have seizures or strokes if it 's not controlled .
Doctors ordered bed rest and gave Candy , 38 , intravenous medications to try to lower her blood pressure .
There are no effective drugs for pre-eclampsia , however , and her condition worsened after she was hospitalized .
After two days , doctors said the only way to treat the condition was to perform an emergency C-section .
They delivered her son in January , seven weeks before his due date .
He spent 2 ½ weeks in neonatal intensive care .
Candy says she wishes doctors were working on a cure for pre-eclampsia .
Although 4 million American women give birth each year , almost no one is developing medications for complications of pregnancy , including conditions that threaten the lives of mothers and children , says Nicholas Fisk , an obstetrician - gynecologist and director of the University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research in Australia .
There are so few effective drugs for pregnancy - related conditions , Fisk says , that in many cases , doctors can save their patients only by delivering babies early .
Researchers also rarely test drugs for common conditions such as depression on pregnant women , says Fisk , whose review of drugs under development was published in January in PloS , a free online medical journal .
No new classes of drugs have been approved for conditions of pregnancy such as pre-term labor or a liver condition called cholestasis in the past two decades , Fisk says .
The absence leaves obstetricians to use decades - old medications , making obstetrics " a specialty stuck in a time warp . "
Most of the medications taken during pregnancy are prescribed " off label " for unapproved uses , Fisk says .
Linda Dona of Mount Vernon , Iowa , is due July 5 and also faces an early delivery — possibly this week — because of pre-eclampsia and cholestasis .
Dona , 38 , says she trusts that the hospital staff will give her baby the best of care .
She wishes she were as confident about off - label drugs she has taken throughout her pregnancy to treat Crohn 's disease , an inflammatory condition that causes severe diarrhea , bloody stools and joint pain .
One of her medications can cause birth defects in high doses ; the other has never been tested in pregnant women , so doctors do n't know how it will affect her child .
Without the medications , however , Dona 's disease likely would flare up , causing a miscarriage .
" When I asked my doctors if these drugs are safe , they said , ' We just do n't know .
We do n't have the data , ' " Dona says .
Pharmaceutical company researchers would love to help women such as Dona and Candy , says Alan Goldhammer , deputy vice president of regulatory affairs for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America .
But companies also must consider the risks of exposing a developing fetus to experimental chemicals .
Given those concerns , experts says the " drug drought " is n't likely to end any time soon .
Worldwide , scientists are actively developing only 17 medicines for maternal health , Fisk says .
That is less than 3 % of the 660 drugs being developed for heart disease and half as many being researched for Lou Gehrig 's disease , which affects only 5,600 new patients a year .
No new drugs made primarily for pregnant women are in clinical trials , which is the final phase of testing , Fisk says .
On average , only about one drug in 10 makes it from early tests to final approval — a process that takes about a decade , Fisk says .
" We 're not going to have a new drug in the next 10 years , " he says .
Past problems
Researchers say history has taught them to be cautious about testing drugs on pregnant women .
The medication thalidomide , used to treat morning sickness in the late 1950s and early 1960s , caused severe limb deformities in babies .
A drug used for morning sickness from the 1940s through the early 1970s , diethylstilbestrol , or DES , caused cancer in the daughters of women who took it .
Today , few pregnant women would sign up to test experimental drugs even if they were available , says Candy 's doctor , Michael Greene , an obstetrician - gynecologist at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital .
Dona 's doctor , Jennifer Niebyl , says she understands the need to protect children from birth defects .
But Niebyl , head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics , says few drugs have been found to increase these risks .
The real risks of developing drugs for pregnancy , Niebyl says , are financial .
The market for drugs to treat conditions of pregnancy is relatively small , Fisk says .
Relatively few women develop these conditions , and those who get sick need treatment for only a few weeks or months .
Companies can be ruined if their drugs are accused of causing birth defects even if a real link is never proven , Greene says .
In one famous example , manufacturer Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals was sued by women who blamed their children 's birth defects on its morning sickness drug , Bendectin , which combines vitamin B6 and a common antihistamine , doxylamine .
The company stopped selling Bendectin even though scientific tests found no increased risk of defects , says Sandra Kweder , deputy director of the Food and Drug Administration 's office of new drugs .
But Bendectin 's manufacturer was n't the only one to suffer .
Without Bendectin on the market , the number of pregnant women hospitalized for nausea and vomiting increased substantially , Kweder says .
Because so few drugs have been formally tested and approved in pregnancy , women do n't know for sure how the medicines will affect them or their babies , Fisk says .
That leaves doctors and patients to weigh a drug 's risks with its benefits , Greene says .
" For many pregnant women , the bar gets raised for treatment , " he says .
" You ask , ' How bad is your headache ?
Do you really need this medication or can you live with it ? ' "
Often , doctors must choose between recommending a newer drug whose risks are unknown or an older , perhaps less effective one that has been used for several decades , Niebyl says .
Many doctors feel comfortable prescribing older drugs if they have a safe track record , she says .
" It 's the devil you know vs. the devil you do n't know . "
FDA officials say they 're trying to get better answers .
In May , they proposed overhauling the ways drugs are labeled for use during pregnancy and lactation to give women and their doctors a better idea of the risks and benefits .
The FDA also hopes to perform more studies , using a database that will include 100 million patients by 2012 , Kweder says .
Recent legislation also gives the FDA the power to require companies to study drugs in pregnant women and other " vulnerable populations " that have n't been well - researched .
The agency also works with pharmaceutical companies to study drugs used by pregnant women after they 're approved , says Karen Feibus , medical team leader on the FDA 's maternal health team .
These collaborations , called drug registries , avoid the ethical dilemmas of testing drugs on pregnant women by following only patients who already have decided to take a drug .
For example , a 15 - year study of the drug acyclovir , used to treat herpes and chickenpox , helped prove it was safe to take during pregnancy .
Ways to help
Fisk argues that pregnant women should n't have to wait 15 years to learn if their medications are safe .
But the government could help in other ways by providing incentives to study drugs during pregnancy , he says .
Existing incentives , for example , allow companies that test drugs in children to get longer patents for their products , Fisk says .
Companies that make drugs for rare diseases can get tax breaks .
And those that make drugs for unmet medical needs , such as cancer and AIDS , can receive " fast - track " approval .
Dona says she hopes researchers are able to find a way to help families like hers .
" My husband and I had to make a moral and ethical decision and say , ' Is it ethical to expose an unborn baby to these drugs when we do n't have information about whether it will be harmful in the future ? ' " Dona says .
" It 's a leap of faith for anyone to have a baby , but we have more risks than most . "

As I walked from booth to booth looking for something new and different at last month ’s Greening the Heartland conference , I actually did a double take when I saw the words “ Green Insurance ” on one display .
Here was something new that I had to learn more about – was it another gimmick or attempt to force green into an unrelated industry ?
I spoke to Stephen Horack , a “ Green Insurance Specialist ” of St. Louis based Huntleigh McGehee , and I have to say that I was sold on the idea right away .
Green insurance is not just a good idea , it ’s potentially a revolutionary idea .
Started in 2006 by Fireman ’s Fund , a member of the United States Green Building council , green insurance protects owners of green commercial or residential buildings .
In the case of a loss , Fireman ’s Fund would bring in a LEED - AP to oversee reconstruction of the building to its original LEED certification level , making sure that the building systems operate at peak performance and in alignment with one another .
If this seems like a no - brainer , consider submitting rebuilding plans to an insurance company that has no experience with green building .
Would you have to explain why every component of the building was built that way , rather than a less expensive non-green alternative ?
The potentially revolutionary aspect of green insurance is the option for owners of non-green commercial buildings and homes .
For a small cost of about $ 70 a year per $ 1 million insured , the owner of a non - green home can make sure that home is rebuilt to LEED Silver certification standards in the event of a total loss .
For those who are interested in green homes but do n’t want to move from their current homes , this insurance would provide the peace of mind that in the event of a loss , their home would be rebuilt green .
But consider if this type of insurance becomes widespread :
If federal and state governments , businesses , and homeowners realize that non-green buildings have become obsolete and insure that any rebuilding will be done green , there will be a wave of green rebuilding across the country .
Instead of damaged homes being rebuilt to yesterday ’s standards , they will be rebuilt to tomorrow’s .
Though Fireman ’s Fund was the first to offer green insurance , other companies such as AIG / Lexington Insurance Company , Travelers , Zurich , and Chubb have jumped on board , indicating that green insurance is here to stay .
As some companies offer premium discounts for current green homes and options such as upgrading LEED certification levels in the event of a loss , make sure you do your homework and choose a borker who knows the nuances of green insurance .

By attaching a " free broadband " condition to the sale of the spectrum , Martin says he thinks he can help drive broadband adoption in rural areas in particular .
Figures show 38 percent of rural households are broadband customers compared to 57 percent in urban areas and 60 percent in the suburbs .
Under Martin's plan , 25 percent of network capacity would have to be reserved for free broadband , USA Today said .

Dongria Kondh tribespeople say their livelihood will be destroyed India 's Supreme Court has said two huge and controversial mining projects can proceed in the eastern state of Orissa .
The ruling follows fierce protests by farmers , campaign groups and tribes who have vowed to oppose the projects .
It means an arm of the British - listed mining giant Vedanta can now use bauxite from a mountain in Orissa which local hill tribes view as sacred .
In a separate ruling , South Korean steel firm Posco was given the go - ahead for a $ 12bn plant in the same state .
The BBC's Damian Grammaticus in Delhi says environmental and tribal campaigners are now calling on India 's prime minister to halt the Vedanta project .
They say India 's rush to development should not come at the expense of the traditional and sustainable way of life of tribal and marginalised people .
' Home to God ' Vedanta has an agreement with the Orissa state government to set up a bauxite refinery in the Niyamgiri mountains , as part of a vast project in Orissa , one of India 's poorest states .
Niyamgiri is rich in bauxite , from which aluminium is derived .
Tribe takes on global mining firm Vedanta has already invested $ 1bn to build a giant alumina refinery close to the mountain .
The court has said Vedanta must invest at least $ 2.5 m in the area to help local tribes .
But leaders of the 8,000 - strong Dongria Kondh say no amount of money can compensate for the damage to their sacred mountain and the forests they depend on .
They have vowed to " fight to the death rather than leave their sacred home " .
" Even if you kill us we will not give Niyamgiri , " said one tribal member Jairam , in a press statement released on the tribe 's behalf by British charity ActionAid .
Another member of the tribe , Jitu Jakeskia , said : " We are deeply connected with the mountain .
It is home to our God Niyamraja .
" We will not allow the company to mine our land , our sacred place .
Any compensation they offer is worthless to us . "
The Indian and Orissan governments both back the Vedanta plan as part of efforts to industrialise and exploit mineral resources in the east of the country , which they say is under - developed .
Steel jobs
The giant Posco project in Orissa is the country 's biggest direct foreign investment .
It has faced stiff opposition for more than two years from local farmers who are angry over losing their land .
" Posco is permitted to continue the iron ore mining , " the Supreme Court said .
Reuters reported that Posco had so far been able to acquire about a quarter of the 4,000 acres it says it needs for the plant .
The court gave it the green light to use another 3,000 acres of forest land , the agency reported .
Critics say the plant could displace 20,000 people .
The company and the government argue that badly - needed jobs will be created in a poor part of the country .

No one 's saying teetotaling President Bush would actually try and sneak some shots of alcohol while enjoying himself at the Beijing Olympics as his apocalyptically bad presidency recedes into history .
That 's the sort of thing you 'd read in , say , the National Enquirer , which as everyone knows is full of trashy tabloid lies .
Besides , the president does n't have to consume actual alcohol to act like a bumbling fraternity president .
Still , it 's worth noting that Bush has been doing a funny / terrifying impersonation of a drunk president for all the press photographers at the Olympics .
He 's even got the red face thing down !
After the jump , enjoy a photo gallery of the president looking his most wasted , from that beach volleyball embarrassment to daughter Barbara looking embarrassed next to Bush at a swimming match , plus some of the other ones Wonkette found on Four Winds 10 last night and some other ones thrown in for fun .
The AP caption reads , " U.S. President George W. Bush stumbles as he and his wife Laura , front , arrive to watch the swimming competitions . "
So it 's not that he 's having trouble standing , as some have suggested .
It 's sitting that 's the problem .
Totally different .
" This is all you have to show for the past four years of your life ? "
Note the nose .
" Kidding , heh .
Actually I 'll take this now . "
Note the red face .
" Nice flip turn or whatever , dude . "
" Seriously , Dad , maybe just ... "
" OK , what the hell are you even ... "
" Now you 've gone and embarrassed yourself in front of both of Mitt 's wives .
Ugh . "
Bush with Chinese president Hu Jintao , looking a bit ruddy ....
... and a bit droopy - eyed .
To be fair , she asked him to back - spank her .

If you think buying junk food in small packages will help you eat less , look out — marketers know the truth .
Two new marketing studies found that some people tend to consume more calories when junk food portions and packages are smaller .
For some , it 's because they perceive small packages to be … get this … diet food .
For others , it 's just the temptation of small sins .
Already in stores
Manufacturers are releasing more and more products in smaller packages .
And in recent years , several brand - name products , from chips to cookies to candy , have been released in smaller packages promoted as having just 100 calories .
In terms of sales , the tactic has proven successful , past research shows .
The strategy might seem counterintuitive , because in many past studies , people tended to consume more when given more .
In a 2005 test , for example , people who were offered 12 - inch sandwiches ate more than those given shorter sandwiches .
But one of the new studies , led by Rita Coelho do Vale at the Technical University of Lisbon , found people believe smaller packages help them " regulate hedonic , tempting consumption , " but in fact their consumption can actually increase .
Large packages , on the other hand , trigger concern about overeating .
The participants watched episodes of " Friends " and were told the study was about evaluating ads .
Bags of potato chips — of differing sizes , of course — were slipped into the test .
The result : Smaller packages are more likely to fuel temptation .
" Because they are considered to be innocent pleasures , [ small packages ] may turn out to be sneaky small sins , " the researchers conclude .
The finding is detailed in the October 2008 issue the Journal of Consumer Research .
Diet food ?
In the other new study , Maura L. Scott at the University of Kentucky and colleagues at Arizona State University assessed people 's perceptions and eating habits of M&Ms in regular and miniature packages .
The participants were sorted into two groups : restrained and unrestrained eaters .
Oddly , the restrained eaters — chronic dieters , basically — tended to consume more calories from mini-packs than unrestrained participants .
“ While restrained eaters may be attracted to smaller foods in smaller packages initially , presumably because these products are thought to help consumers with their diets , our research shows that restrained eaters actually tend to consume more of these foods than they would of regular foods , " the researchers write in same journal .

Frequently - Asked Questions for Atheists
This FAQ is intended to be general in nature , but some parts may address specific religions .
In most cases , the claims apply to most other religion as well .
What is an atheist ?
An atheist is a person who lacks positive belief in god(s ) .
If a person does n't maintain any active belief any gods exist , they are by definition an atheist , regardless of other labels they may apply to themselves , such as agnostic .
There are different types of atheists such as strong atheists , who hold that no gods exist .
This position can be harder to defend as one cannot prove the non-existence of gods .
Most atheists are of the weak atheist variety , that simply lack belief in gods .
What is an agnostic ?
An agnostic in the formal sense is a person who holds that whether god(s ) exist is unknown , as nobody truly knows the nature and origin of existence .
There are both agnostic atheists ( who do not believe in gods ) and agnostic theists ( who believe , but recognize their belief is based on faith ) .
Like atheism , there are " strong " and " weak " varieties of agnosticism .
The strong agnostic suggests that whether or not there are gods will never be known .
The weak agnostic simply says , " I do n't know . "
In the colloquial sense , agnostic can mean that a person is undecided about the existence of gods , is unsure of their own beliefs , or does n't believe but is reluctant to call themselves an atheist due to potential social stigma .
What is a freethinker ?
Freethought is a naturalistic philosophy which stresses the importance of reason , skepticism and open‐mindedness in life .
Freethinkers tend to be atheistic , non-spiritual , and non-superstitious and reject ideals that are dependent upon any paranormal claims , which are not confirmed by reason , reality and evidence .
Why are you an atheist ?
Everyone starts out atheist - nobody is born believing in any gods .
Nonetheless ,
If you ask 100 atheists , you 'll get 100 different answers .
Here are a few examples of why some people are atheist :
I was not raised in a religious household , therefore I was not indoctrinated into religion .
I studied the bible and religious scripture and found it to be inaccurate , illogical and inconsistent with our world .
There is no evidence to indicate god(s ) exist .
I recognize that religion is often used as a tool to control and oppress people and refuse to be part of it .
I experienced first - hand , the hypocrisy of those claiming to be spiritual leaders , which led me to realize religion is merely mythology and superstition .
The idea of an " all loving " god that threatens people with eternal suffering does n't make any sense .
There are as many different answers to this question as there are atheists , agnostics and freethinkers .
Ask one and find out for yourself .
Are atheists anti-religion ?
Some are .
Some are n't .
Atheism by definition does not incorporate any set of rules or advice on how people should think or behave .
Many people who lack supernatural beliefs tend to feel that institutions that pander to these superstitious ideals are counterproductive .
Other atheists are perfectly comfortable with other religion and philosophies .
Some types of Buddhism for example , are atheistic in nature and not at all anti-religion .
Are atheists more intelligent than theists ?
Generally speaking , based on all available studies , yes .
The most recent study published , March 8 , 2008 , by Richard Lynna , from University of Ulster in Ireland , John Harvey from Drove Cottages , UK and Helmuth Nyborg form University of Aarhus in Denmark showed a clear correlation between secular ideological positions and increasing intelligence in more than 137 nations .
[ 1 ]
Numerous studies have demonstrated the more intelligent the populace , the less likely they are to be religious .
Is n't atheism a belief too ?
Therefore it requires " faith ? "
No .
Atheism is not a belief .
It is a lack of belief .
It is no more a belief than " not collecting stamps " is a hobby or " bald " is a hair color .
But atheists say there is no god .
You can't prove God does n't exist .
What you are referring to is known as a strong atheist .
The vast majority of atheists do not go around saying they know for sure god does n't exist .
Most atheists are weak atheists which is a position that does n't go so far as to say anyone knows 100 % there is no god .
We simply lack belief that any god or gods exist .
This minority of " strong atheists " however , take things a step further and argue that there is no god .
While it is true this contention cannot be proven , there are justifiable reasons for holding this view .
Occam 's Razor dictates that it 's more likely that God does n't exist than he does .
Until there 's definitive evidence that a god or gods exist , one can reasonably presume they do n't , just as in the same way most of us are confident that Santa Claus does n't really exist .
When mainstream media talks about atheists , they often mischaracterize all atheists as being of the " strong atheist " variety , which is n't necessarily true .
Atheists bear no burden to prove God does n't exist .
Until believers can show that their god is more real than any other fictional character , it 's perfectly reasonable to presume that he does n't .
Why are atheists so arrogant ?
Compared to ?
Judeo- Christians ?
Are you serious ?
First let 's look at the definition of " arrogance " :
having or showing feelings of unwarranted importance out of overbearing pride
Who seems to have more pride ?
A christian or an atheist ?
Who goes around talking about heaven and hell ?
Who thinks everything on this planet was made for them by a special creator who hovers nearby meticulously concerned about their every whim ?
Have atheists injected their religious pride into everyday conversation from " Thank the Lord " to " God Bless You " ?
Do atheists walk around with symbolic jewelry showcasing the religion to which they subscribe ?
Religion is constantly , continuously promoted among many theists .
This is the epitome of pride : a constant advertisement for ones ' special interests .
Furthermore , Christianity and many other religions teach the idea that man is the chosen species and that god made the earth and the universe for us .
We are special .
However , when you examine history , it becomes obvious that man 's presence on this planet amounts to a " blink - of - the - eye " in the presence of time , and that more than 98 % of all life that has ever existed on Earth has become extinct , and many other creatures have spent a thousand times more time on this planet than man .
Earth is predominately covered in water , but man cannot live in water , yet the earth is a perfect creation for man ?
99.99999 % of the universe is inhospitable for life , much less human life , yet god created all that for us ?
What christianity teaches , that man is so overwhelmingly important , is the pinnacle of arrogance .
Everything we know about the universe does n't back up that claim .
For a typical theist to suggest non-believers are more arrogant is really hypocritical .
This notwithstanding , what most theists consider " arrogance " is either a tone - of - voice they get preoccupied with as a Red Herring or usually self - confidence ..
the same kind of self - confidence they claim to have in their " faith . "
Somehow , this gets labeled as " arrogance " when it involves a subject upon which they disagree .
How can you lack belief in God when every society in human history has believed in a creator ?
First , this is n't true .
There have been societies discovered that do not have beliefs in spirits or gods [ 2 ] .
Second , the idea of a " creator " implies the monotheistic Judeo / Christian / Muslim god , and ignores the many other societies who believed in multiple gods , animal spirits and other paranormal claims that most Judeo - Christians would easily dismiss .
The only consistency throughout human history that might be relative , is that humans have sought to make up stories to explain unanswered questions .
Besides this your claim employs the Argument from popularity fallacy : just because at one time , a majority of people believed the Earth was flat or the sun revolved around the Earth , does not make it true .
How can you dismiss / disrespect holy scripture like the Bible ?
The Bible is a collection of various writings over thousands of years , by mostly unknown authors , covering a chaotic and often inconsistent array of subjects , assembled by various political committees over the course of another thousand years .
As an ancient artifact , it is interesting .
As a guide book of moral behavior , it is severely lacking .
As a collection of scrolls , it yields information on old myths , history and traditions .
As a tome to be interpreted in any serious or literal manner , indicating " truth " about our world ( beyond the recurring theme of how man can be inhumane towards man ) it is appalling .
The irony is , most religious people , while respecting their own scripture , have no problems dismissing a contradicting religion 's scripture .
As atheists , we simply dismiss the seriousness of one more set of scripture than you .
And there 's no evidence whatsoever that any of the supernatural claims in the Bible are legitimate .
There 's actually no reliable evidence Jesus ever existed .
Why do you hate God ?
Atheists do n't " hate God . "
We lack a belief that God even exists , so it would be foolish to spend any energy loving or hating something that does n't exist .
It 's a non-issue .
How do you feel about the pink unicorn in my back yard ?
How dare you be ambivalent !
You must hate unicorns !
Why do n't you capitalize the " G " in god ?
When atheists refer to a hypothetical " god " or " gods " , it is not as a proper noun , which implies a specific , named entity .
It 's only when referring specifically to the Christian deity named " God " that it 's appropriate to capitalize .
Are atheists Satanists ?
That 's ridiculous .
If we do n't believe in God or the Bible , why would we believe Satan or any of the other characters exist ?
In fact , people who believe in satan are actually more of a satanist than an atheist .
If you do n't believe in a god or gods , what do you believe in ?
Atheists have a wide variety of beliefs .
Atheism is not a world view .
It does not dictate how one should live his life or what rules to follow ; what is and is n't moral behavior ; who to worship or on what day he can purchase alcoholic beverages .
There are people who are atheist who practice Buddhism ; there are atheists who are secular humanists , etc .
A philosophy such as Humanism is a world view that is compatible with atheism .
Every atheist will likely answer this question differently .
If you are n't afraid of god 's judgment , what is there to keep you from being a sociopath ?
Our rationale for acting good and honorable is based on the fact that we are a social species and we live together in groups .
Doing something that hurts our fellow man increases the likelihood that we ourselves will be hurt .
So the Golden Rule , or treating others the way you 'd like to be treated , makes sense .
We do n't need such common sense notions handed to us from a supernatural source .
Besides , if you do something horrible to another person , it 's more likely you 'll deal with judgment from society first and foremost .
God only supposedly comes into play after you 're dead and atheists do n't waste time entertaining " What Ifs " of that nature .
Religious people get their morals from scripture .
Where does an atheist get his moral guidelines ?
In truth , all people get more of their moral guidelines from society and culture , specifically the laws which govern our society .
Scripture is not that reliable a source for moral guidelines .
The bible promotes everything from slavery to rape and genocide .
Those activities we all consider immoral and are against the [ secular ] law in most communities .
Many atheists believe that morality is subjective , not absolute as taught by many religions .
Different cultures have different views of the morality of various activities .
Even in America , for more than a hundred years , we accepted slavery as a moral thing to do ; women were not allowed to vote until fairly recently .
What is and is n't moral in a society tends to change over time .
Do you believe man came from a monkey ?
No .
But both man and monkeys evolved from common ancestors .
A monkey did n't suddenly give birth to a man -- this is another ignorant , annoying mischaracterization of atheists that theists promote .
See
The fact of evolution .
If man originated from primates , why are primates still here ?
You 're assuming that evolution is a one - way process .
It is not .
The development of a new species or feature , does not necessarily make the earlier one obsolete .
If that argument made sense then there should only be one animal on the planet , right ?
If most Americans came from Europe , why are there still Europeans ?
If dogs came from wolves , why are there still wolves ?
Do you believe that life just " happened by chance ? "
Once life is established , evolution describes it , and the two parts of evolution are natural selection ( which is not random at all ) and heredity ( which does have some randomness ) .
Things would n't evolve without randomness , but it 's a lie to say that is the whole story .
As for the initial appearance of a life form on our planet , this is a relatively young field of study and there are no solid answers yet , but scientists are finding out more and more each day .
Scientists are currently working on creating life forms from chemical compositions .
[ 3 ]
It is expected that breakthroughs will be made in the next ten years confirming that life can come from non-life . [ 4 ]
Is lightning random ?
It might seem like it , but if certain conditions exist , lightning will appear .
It 's not " by chance " and there is no " intelligent agent " at work making lightning .
In one sense , very little ( if anything ) is actually random .
The universe is a big and complicated place , and we might call something " random " if we do n't have enough information to predict it .
That does n't mean anything is actually random , though .
How can you not see how perfect this world is for humans ?
Obviously we are created by an intelligent designer .
Oh really ?
This perfect world is 4/5 ths water , but humans can't live in water .
Our universe is 99.9999999 % non-life - sustaining but it is perfect for us ?
The human body works too perfectly ?
What about cancer , wisdom teeth , the prostate , tonsils , or men with nonfunctional breasts ?
There 's plenty of evidence of remnants from evolution and the " intelligent design " of our bodies and our universe is anything but perfect .
Why do atheists care about what other people believe ?
What difference should it make if I believe in god ?
First and foremost , religion is an integral part of society .
It is necessary for everybody to be familiar with religion , which is a cultural component of society among other things .
If theists kept their beliefs private , there would be no need for this discussion .
Atheists are not interested in telling people what they can and cannot believe .
But atheists are concerned about religious beliefs and principals being mandated , promoted and subsidized by government and society .
As taxpayers , atheists care about whether or not their money is funding religion .
Religion has been a major factor in oppression of women and minorities , curtailing scientific progress , engaging in war , and much more .
If it was merely a personal belief that did n't become influential in public policy , there would be no need for you to even know atheists exist .
See
Why atheists care about religion for more details .
Some say gays are the last minority discriminated against .
No .
It is atheists .
Why make a big stink out of little religious " molehills ? "
Legally , all of these little molehills are what have allowed the mountain to be built .
Legislative prayer before senate sessions and at presidential inaugurations have been used to excuse government funded nativity scenes , " In God We Trust " as the national motto ( how is this not a violation of the Endorsement test , btw ? ) , and " Under God " in the pledge of allegiance , as well as the National Day of Prayer .
And vice - versa to the nth degree .
The Establishment Clause has been thrown out in these cases without any actual judicial scrutiny merely because certain acts have become part of the " fabric of our culture " .
Instead , the courts have devolved into using a holistic “ I ’ll know it when I see it ” gut - check system when ruling on such violations .
And generally , it always boils down to this flawed " Any more than ... " syllogism :
IF legislative prayer is constitutional ( clearly it must be because nobody 's complained about it even though they get death threats when they try ) ... AND " under God " is not any more a violation than legislative prayer ...
THEREFORE " under God " is constitutional .
Every time one violation of the Establishment Clause comes up in court , the court simply cites a similar violation as precedent for excusing other conflations between church and state .
Read cases like Lynch v. Donnelly or Marsh v. Chambers , or Justice O’Connnor ’s formulation of the legal construction of “ Ceremonial Deism ” in the Newdow v Elk Grove cases .
What you ’ll find is the court has perpetually been bending over backwards to accommodate religious entanglement , allowing new molehills to pop up on the argument that nobody managed to declare previous molehills illegal in time .
For example , the courts have recognized that the statute that created “ under God ” in 1952 was illegal , but because we went fifty - some years without doing anything about it , it gets grandfathered in as part of the “ fabric of our culture . ”
Furthermore , because “ under God ” is now legal , any similar violation of the Establishment Clause can cite “ under God ” in order to justify its own legality .
The sad part is that this can be done pre-emptively .
For example , in Lynch v. Donnelly , which occurred sometime between the signing of the 1952 “ under God ” statute , and the Newdow case when “ under God ” was contested , the government - sponsored nativity scene was actually found to be legal partly because it was no worse a violation than “ under God ” in the pledge or “ in God we trust ” as our national motto .
Mountains out of mole hills ?
I believe the snowball metaphor is more appropriate .
All right , but why do you have to be such dicks about it ?
Name me one minority that ever got equal recognition by merely shutting up , sitting down , playing nice , and trying to talk with the few supposedly open - minded representatives of the hateful majority that marginalized them .
Of course I ’m angry , and if you ’re holding that against me , well … fuck you .
What minority that ever tried to get equal rights in this country was n’t called “ uppity ” , or “ pompous ” , or “ radical ” , or “ militant ” ?
Likewise , when in the history of civil rights has the majority not used the same excuse to deny rights to the minority , citing the same tired argument of “ Oh , if only they ’d be more agreeable in their protests , they might actually make progress … ” ?
It happens every single time .
The dominant religious majority in America is n't going to be talked into pulling its head out of its ass , and it should not be our responsibility to gently coax it out for them .
Offering the olive branch and trying to play nice carries a significant risk for us .
It means waiting in silence for years while the religious majority makes up their mind as to whether to accept the peace offering or not , and judging by their past behavior , chances are they wo n't .
What does atheism promote ?
What does it stand for ?
Atheism is not a world view .
It does n't make rules to live by .
It 's simply a word to describe the state of lacking belief in gods and similar supernatural mythology and claims .
As such , it does n't stand for anything .
Atheists are not compelled to promote anything .
At most , atheism suggests that critical thinking and rationality is of much higher priority than fear and superstition .
Why not believe in god ?
What does an atheist have to lose if he 's wrong ?
This is called Pascal 's Wager .
It 's a fallacy .
If there really was a god what is there to lose by believing ?
When you start down that slippery slope , the first question is , " Which god ? "
You can't believe in them all , because some apparently will condemn you for believing in their competition .
And what if god's true test is to see who has the strength to deny he exists ?
This is a no-win situation and Pascal 's Wager is a fool 's bet .
See the next question , " Why would you risk going to hell and suffering eternal damnation ? "
Why would you risk going to hell and suffering eternal damnation ?
Because we 're that sure that all the deity stories we 've heard are silly or untrue .
You have exactly one story 's punishment in mind , even though there are hundreds of gods that men have followed throughout history .
We do n't think yours is any more believable than the others .
When you think about why you 're not worried about the consequences of disbelieving in some of those , you 'll understand why other people are not worried about yours .
Why are atheists so closed - minded about believing in God ?
It 's exactly the opposite .
If you show us evidence that God actually exists , we 'll change our position .
But that evidence has to be something more substantive than your " personal experience " and quotes from a 2000 + year old storybook written by a collection of unknown people about events that happened decades or millennia earlier .
That 's not convincing .
Ironically , it is religious people who are closed - minded .
If Zeus came down from the heavens on a flaming chariot in front of a Christian church , chances are even in the face of obvious proof of Zeus ' existence , most Christians would still continue to believe in Jesus .
That 's why they call it " faith " = belief in absence of evidence = closed - mindedness .
Maybe your problem is you do n't know enough about my god ?
Maybe you should read my holy book !
Ironically , your average atheist is probably much more knowledgeable about religion and scripture than your average theist .
Most atheists are very familiar with the bible , because a thorough examination of such scripture was likely a key component in their dismissal of the religion as being irrational .
If you do n't believe this , go into any atheist forum online and start asking questions about scripture .
You 'll find that most atheists know ten times more about scripture , dogma , history , philosophy and science than their religious counterparts .
If you do n't believe in god , what is the meaning of life ?
Who says there has to be a meaning of life ?
Maybe there is ; maybe there is n't .
But arbitrarily making one up that is n't based on any rational evidence seems hollow and un-satisfying to an atheist .
Aside from that , just like with theists , it 's up to each individual to determine what gives his / her life meaning .
Is n't atheism selfish ?
What does selfishness have to do with believing or not believing in gods ?
You can find plenty of selfish god-fearing people in real life as well as in scripture .
Do atheists celebrate holidays like Christmas and Easter ?
It varies from person - to - person , but most do .
After all , these holidays are not Christian in origin anyway .
Most are derived from earlier pagan solstice and fertility celebrations .
In any case , atheists can differentiate between the cultural / ritualistic aspect of these celebrations and any specific paranormal belief associated with it .
Is there an atheist bible ?
No , just as there is no handbook on how to live your life for people who do n't believe in a tooth fairy .
We generally do n't think that bronze - age books have more than a passing applicability to 21st century life .
Do n't kill , steal , perjure -- all good -- but those ideas predate the Christian Bible , too .
Much of those are common sense , and you ignore that much of the Christian Bible is spent forbidding people to eat shrimp , forbidding letting a witch live , and forbidding working on particular days of the week -- none of which we miss very much , thanks .
Is n't Richard Dawkins worshiped by atheists ?
No .
He 's just a popular person in the community .
He does have a lot of respect , but to suggest he is an " atheist god " is foolish and ignorant .
In fact , many atheists do not like Dawkins and actively argue against his approach .
[ Citation suggested ]
Everybody serves somebody .
Who or what do atheists worship ?
You 're wrong that " everybody serves somebody . "
We 're not willing to grant that postulate , so the question does n't have a good answer , and it certainly does n't apply to all atheists .
The best answer you 're likely to get from any particular object of high - regard is " Some do .
Some do n't . "
That said , atheists more than other groups seem to hold observation of the universe through their senses , and the resulting compilation of rules of existence -- called " logic " -- as one of the most important facets of their lives .
Everyone uses logic every waking moment , but atheists are especially unlikely to subordinate it to wishes .
That 's not " worship " , though by most people 's definition .
The irony is , religious people also depend upon the validity and legitimacy of logic and rationality all the time too .
When you board an airplane , you 're not expecting god to keep it aloft -- you expect secular science to have done its homework .
When you go to the doctor , you hope to be treated by someone who is prescribing treatment that has been tested and proven to work based on the laws of secular logic and evidence .
If you do n't think so , next time you get sick , skip the hospital and go to church instead .
You claim to be atheist , but I know many atheists who have come to know and accept God .
Have you ever known someone who stopped believing in Santa or the Tooth Fairy and then later on , changed their mind and started to believe again ?
Because that 's how we feel about religion .
Many theists like to claim they used to be " atheists " ( it 's part of their shtick ) - maybe in the most shallow sense , but we suspect they were simply confused and did n't know what they believed , which is different from understanding what god is supposed to be and consciously rejecting the likelihood of his existence .
Do atheists believe that when you die , that 's it ?
Atheism does n't dictate any particular beliefs , so what happens when we die is a theory that each individual will think about and address personally .
Many atheists do not believe in any type of afterlife , that is true .
But others simply feel they do n't know , and do n't spend any time worrying about it because it seems pointless .
Who would n't want to live forever ?
Who would n't want to have some essence or " soul " that continues after our death , but we cannot pretend there is actual evidence for this when there is n't .
Many atheists believe that one way to live forever ( figuratively ) is through having children and passing your values on that way .
If you do n't answer to God , who do you answer to ?
This is a complicated question that probably varies from atheist - to - atheist .
But many of us consider ourselves Humanists and as such we have to answer to each other , our community , et. al .
Theists have to answer to their fellow men as well , but they have an extra , convenient excuse to pull ( " It 's God 's will " ) when they can't explain something or it does n't jive with what people expect .
We like to think our motivations are more consistent and honorable because we do n't use superstition as an excuse to explain our behavior .
Was n't Hitler , Stalin and others atheist ?
Was their atheism responsible for their atrocities ?
First , Hitler was Roman Catholic .
Many claims like Hitler , Stalin and Pol Pot were atheists are not accurate .
Second , the idea that a person 's non-theist stance is responsible for their behavior is about as realistic as suggesting since both Hitler and Stalin had mustaches , it 's the mustache that is responsible for genocide .
Einstein and Darwin believed in God , and many other famous scientists
This is another fallacy .
Contrary to what theists claim by taking his quotes way out of context , Einstein was not a Christian , and not even a Deist .
He might have been Pantheist but it was more a symbolic thing than any substantive belief in a creator deity .
He made it quite clear in later letters .
The same thing goes for Darwin , whose supposed deathbed conversion to Christianity is a lie .
That notwithstanding , yes , there are some prominent scientists who are theists .
However , the overwhelming majority of the world 's most respected scientists are atheist .
[ 5 ]
And you can't find for example , any prominent evolutionary biologists who believe in creation .
Have you heard this evidence for the existence of god ?
Probably .
This FAQ is n't going to address various claims made that supposedly " prove God exists " .
Instead , check the Top ten arguments for the existence of God page , which probably has what you 're about to say , with detailed responses .

Ga. District Loses Accreditation ; First in Decades " Fatally flawed " schools become the third to lose accreditation in four decades .
Aug. 28 , 2008  --
The embattled Clayton County school district has become the third U.S. district in 40 years to lose accreditation , according to a county commissioner .
Commission Chairman Eldrin Bell 's office confirmed the loss an hour before the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools was expected to announce the news .
The 50,000 - student district has scheduled a news conference for 4 p.m. Thursday .
SACS gave the district until Sept. 1 to address nine mandates outlined in a scathing February report that called the school board " dysfunctional " and " fatally flawed . "
Clayton County has turned over more than 2,500 pages of evidence to SACS to prove it 's fixing the problems .
A team from SACS visited the district last week and made recommendations on whether the district has done enough to keep accreditation .
After writing about Anheuser - Busch , Fannie Mae , and GM over the past week , something occurred to me .
Well , many things occurred to me , but this time , something apart from skipping the country until things get better stuck out in my mind .
It was this : During the past week , several key American icons –the suburban house , the SUV , the ubiquitous can of Bud–have fundamentally changed in some way .
Each of these products communicated an intimate brand or notion .
Fannie and Freddie , our friendly down - home lending institutions .
The Hummer , which could instantly transform you from monarch to wretch , depending on whether you were a driver or a bystander .
The ubiquitous can of Bud , reliably available at any sporting event , bar , or house party .
Witness the havoc a single week has wrought on these pet icons :
Icon
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac :
We call these lending institutions by their first names , Fannie and Freddie .
Franklin D. Roosevelt , affectionately known as FDR , created Fannie to get the United States through an incredible economic trough called the Great Depression .
Since then , the dynamic duo has been serving up enough low - interest loans to allow Everyman to buy a house , even a big one , with barely any cash on hand .
Fannie and Freddie ’s love were pivotal in building the middle class .
Havoc
Fannie and Freddie , with names reminiscent of overweight , beaming grandparents who still refer to the world in terms of the 1950s , both just narrowly avoided dropping dead .
A physician named Ben Bernanke has them on life support .
Icon
Anheuser - Busch : AB ’s most recognized brand is Budweiser .
As in Bud .
As in , here ’s your bottled buddy , ready to take the edge off after a long day .
Immigrant Eberhard Anheuser brought the brewery to its feet in 1860 in St. Louis .
Since , a successions of Augusts and Adolphuses ( Adolphi ? ) have held Bud ’s hand through a massive expansion .
Havoc
Bud , the all - American beer buddy , is staring at his tennis shoes and weeping BHA - infused tears in a large boardroom in Europe , wondering what they ’re going to do with him next .
Icon
GM , otherwise known as General Motors , proud home of offspring like Jimmy , Hummer , Yukon , and Tahoe .
These built - tough thrones with wheels have names like a pack of sled dogs and eat most terrain alive .
Hummer , the one with the largest nutsack , can drive through shallow lakes .
Havoc
GM just admitted that at $ 4 / gallon , the Sport Ute is a goner .
Hummer , Tahoe , and their buddies are making big , sad headlight eyes in a distribution garage with the word “ Mexico ” spray - painted on it .
Meanwhile , young people around America are looking at diminutive Go-Kart style gas - savers , confounded as to how Toyota Scion could possibly express their rebellious , hardcore natures .
If the American Dream looked like a big , handsome guy leaning against his silver Hummer , sipping a Bud while his immaculate four - bedroom suburban house towers behind him , the American Dream is finished .
During the past 20 years or so , we have based our identities and experiences around certain iconic products .
Those products have changed , on a basic level .
As AB , Fannie and Freddie , and GM warp their identities , they make our version of the American Dream unattainable : it will no longer be possible to buy an All - American Bud .
Fannie and Freddie wo n’t be offering easy home loans anymore .
The Hummer is going ix -nay .
An entire middle - class identity has , in the period of about a week , indicated its time is up .
We need a dream–and some iconic products –to replace it .

" Basically , your personality has been so badly constructed , the only thing to do is knock it down and start again . "
That , 18 years ago , was my first introduction to therapy .
I had left a teaching job in Wales and arrived in London to pursue my dream of being a full - time writer .
I knew just two people , both actors , and we shared three rooms in a bedsit in Archway .

Analyse this : Jaci Stephens as she was when she started therapy
I was , and had been for some years , very depressed following the breakdown of a long - term relationship .
Now I had no job , few friends and £ 17 a week to live on in the country 's most expensive city .
The Tavistock Clinic had been suggested as the ideal place to go to find out exactly what kind of therapeutic treatment might suit my condition .
It was after three interview sessions that I received the scathing assessment of my personality .
I thought I was basically OK .
I enjoyed a happy childhood and had no doubt about the path I wanted to take ; but I hated living with depression and , although many believe that depression aids creativity , it suffocated mine .
The Tavistock reckoned that full - time analysis was the answer , and so off I went , five days a week , to begin the reconstruction programme .
As I was effectively unemployed , they charged me just £ 1 a session ; the four buses it took me to get there and back meant going without meals , but I thought it would be worth it .
The therapy room was dominated by a couch , on which I had to lie facing away from the analyst - the position in which Sigmund Freud required his patients to be .
The only power you can exercise is to listen to the scraping of the analyst 's pen and come up with interesting things you hope will encourage it to go faster .
When it stops , you feel you 've lost your audience .
For weeks I had to lie there and talk about a dream in which I lost a suitcase .
Suitcases featured in many of my dreams , not least because I was always travelling and I lived in fear of leaving one behind .
To my mind , there was no message there ; just anxiety .
And yet the American psychiatrist I was seeing became obsessed with my ' baggage ' .

And now ...

She also , true to traditional psychoanalytical form , became obsessed with the fact that on a Friday I resented the idea that I would n't see her over the weekend , and on a Monday was resentful that she had been away .
To be honest , I never gave her a second thought .
The idea that this might be lurking in my unconscious I thought totally irrelevant at a time when I was spending weekends visiting my dying father .
But it was my small bladder that finally made me quit .
The journey to the analyst was so long that I was always desperate for the loo when I got there .
One day I arrived to find it occupied .
If I waited for the person to come out , I reasoned , I would be late for the session and would be told I was trying to avoid what we were talking about the day before ; if I go into the session , I will have to leave halfway through and will be told I am avoiding what we are talking about today .
So I hit upon plan C , went in , explained the situation and asked if there was another loo I could use .
" I wonder , " said the analyst later , " if your wanting to use a different lavatory is because you want to invade my privacy in the way you feel I 'm invading yours " .
That was the end .
It was too ridiculous for words .
Next , I went to see a therapist in Hendon , in North - West London , who would n't shut up about her own life .
Then a counsellor in North London .
One day I rang the Samaritans , but they did n't answer .
My depression did not go away , despite my having spent six months in five - days - a - week analysis , and another six months trying out different options .
But I continued to work , swimming against the emotional tide and persuading myself that this is what all struggling artists had done since the beginning of time .

Jaci enjoys an al fresco lunch with Louis Walsh , at Cookes Rest in Dublin
When I heard of Neuro Linguistic Programming ( NLP ) seven years ago , I did n't have a good word to say about talking treatments that purported to help people in emotional difficulty .
Despite having made a success of being a writer and broadcaster in London , feelings of failure and often overwhelming depression were still never far away .
Like many
Welsh people , I suffered a huge lack of confidence ; I genuinely believe that insecurity is rooted in history , but it manifests itself quite dramatically in personal form .
Inside , I was still that little person from Cardiff who would never feel deserving of sitting alongside people I perceived to be my superiors .
I come from a background where my grandfather crossed the road and doffed his cap if he saw the vicar approaching .
One evening , after I had drunk too much , a friend who had heard my expressions of suicidal despair once too often , said : " Go on , then , do it , if that 's what you really want .
Or you could dial this number and see Martin Weaver . "
The friend went on to explain how , some years previously , he'd hit rock bottom following a disastrous relationship - and yet by the time I got to know him , he was one of the funniest , vibrant , brightest and most successful people I 'd met .
After explaining the basic principles of NLP - to communicate better with others and manage thoughts , moods and behaviours more effectively - I decided to give it a go .
It turned out Martin was a chap from West London who charged £ 50 an hour , which was not enough to put me off calling .
He asked why I wanted to come to him and I said : " I 'm not happy . "
There .
I 'd said it .
Nobody before had ever asked me why I wanted to see a therapist ; I had just told them what my symptoms were , they accepted them , and doled out whatever treatment they thought appropriate .
When I was 16 , the doctor put me on Valium for migraine and depression .
As a student , it was anti-depressants and sleeping tablets .
One analyst thought a couple of decades more treatment would solve everything , and on it went .
Martin , however , said that he would know within 20 minutes if NLP was the right treatment for me , and when I finally went , those 20 minutes were the most nerve - racking of my life .
What if I was n't good enough for it ?
What if Martin did n't like me ?
What if my personality was unravelling even more than it had been when I first visited the Tavistock years before ?
But Martin 's therapy room made me feel comfortable at once : there was an armchair , water , and a box of tissues that I would need in the coming weeks .
And always , outside the window , Chiswick 's greenery and always , bizarrely ( or maybe I imagined this ) , the sun shining through .
One of the first things I remember saying to Martin is : " Happiness is difficult for me . "
He asked me to tell him why I thought that was so .
" Well , it just is , " I responded .
Although , as a writer , I consider myself articulate , now I found having to explain myself extremely difficult .
Everything I said seemed to make logical sense to me - happiness is difficult , depression is central to creativity , I need to live in four places - London , Cardiff , Paris , Spain .
I called one home , one an office , one a holiday home , and one a drunken purchase after too many champagnes on the BMI flight from Cardiff to Malaga .
They were all bolt - holes , escapes .
But when all that was repeated in the mouth of someone else , they sounded like the words of an idiot .
That is not how Martin repeated them back to me , though , and his gentle , bemused manner enabled me to laugh at much of what I had thought were immovable problems .
Finding the right therapist is , of course , crucial to the success of treatment , as is finding the right therapy .
What I particularly liked about NLP was the way it made me think in relation to the world and other people : the premise is that you cannot change others and their behaviour , only your response .
I began to realise that so much distress in my life was related to constant feelings of being unable to control the way life unfolded around me , and NLP offered solutions .
As I continued to see Martin and understand more about how I related to those around me , it was rather like looking through a kaleidoscope and , with one twist , seeing all the pieces fall into a new pattern .
It works with both big and small issues .
In one session , I was expressing irritation at my mother in restaurants , always fishing about in her purse for £ 8.50 for her lasagne , when I am perfectly able to treat her .
" So let her pay for her lasagne , " said Martin .
Easy .
I told my mother , who is a therapist , about this .
She has a great sense of humour and said : " Pay for my own lasagne ?
Some of these therapists are rubbish . "
The bigger issues were harder .
For 30 years , I carried around the weight of a failed relationship which I had always said " ruined my life " .
What I learned quickly in my sessions with Martin was that " it " had not " ruined " me , but that I had taken an active part in allowing it to .
This was the most difficult aspect of my treatment , and I blamed myself for having surrendered so much time and energy to a part of my life that was unchangeable .
But what I could change was my response to it .
Painful as this was , there was a Damascus - like moment when Martin asked me to imagine what it would be like to be free of the anger , and so much else besides .
My God : to be free of it .
What would it feel like to be that person ?
But so much of me was it .
Was n't it ?
Had n't these feelings shaped my character ?
Was n't my past who I was ?
Would I be able to cope in the outside world without it ?
Learning to feel forgiveness , both towards others and myself , was central to my experience of NLP .
At Martin 's sessions , I loathed being made to stand up and walk to another " spot " in the room in order to see a situation from another 's point of view ; I felt stupid .
But it was one if the most valuable exercises I did .
Now , when I am frustrated or angry with someone , in my head I walk to their spot and consider their feeling and their motivation for doing what they are doing .
That way , it is possible to empathise with someone else 's fear , anger or loneliness , and to understand that in the end , we are all just human .
Seeing Martin was the best £ 550 I have ever spent .
The things I learned with him I can apply to all areas of my life , always asking myself the question that Martin used to ask of me :
What 's the real issue here ?
The real issue is rarely what you think it is , and exploring the heart of it makes for a life of astonishing clarity and contentment .
Recently , I returned to Martin , not because I was depressed , but because I was still living a chaotic existence between four places and wanted to streamline my life .
We spoke mainly about identity ; and Wales , where I was born , featured heavily .
I became irritated as he talked about the possibility of going back there to redefine my relationship with a place that I often love , but often dislike .
Where did this new irritation come from ?
I suspect it was because what I thought I wanted , and what was actually right for me , were entirely different .
Martin was relentless in pursuit of this issue being addressed .
What I wanted was for him to tell me to chuck in my job , move to Paris and live writing novels in a garret .
What I did was follow his advice and re-explore my relationship with Wales , buy a gorgeous house there and leave Paris and London .
Since settling back in Cardiff , in a house that I love , I have met many wonderful people and have never been happier .
Whoever said happiness was difficult ?
The means of coaching myself to react more positively to the world that Martin put in place were also instrumental in a major breakthrough a few weeks ago .
Realising that I was using alcohol as a buffer against stress , I applied his techniques in a bid to stop for good .
I applied his logic and asked myself what life as an alcohol - free person would feel like .
I wrote a list of all the benefits not drinking would bring me : there were about 20 .
The reason not to give up was one : it 's boring not to drink .
I could hear what Martin would say : " Tell me why it 's boring not to drink . "
I would have no answer to that .
Recently , my work situation changed dramatically , and I know that without NLP I would have handled the situation very differently .
In the past , I would have been angry , and that anger would have incapacitated me .
But what I did this time was to preserve what would have been wasted energy and pursue other avenues ; I took on different work and am enjoying new challenges , finally getting on with the books I always promised to write .
There are people who say Neuro Linguistic Programming is just positive thinking .
It 's the " just " that makes me laugh , because being positive is a great state to be in .
Since we first met , I have sent many people to Martin , all of whom have had their lives changed as a result .
Other therapies do different things for different people , and I have changed my view that all therapy is a load of hogwash and a waste of time that could be better spent swilling down one 's problems with a few pints of lager .
But what I , and those of my friends who have benefited from Neuro Linguistic Programming , perceive , is that many people spend too long in time - consuming therapies and are no happier as a result .
NLP is not a quick fix or a sticking plaster over a wound ; for me , it provides a framework for living without each day being a minefield of emotional trials .
And for someone who , seven years ago , did n't want to be alive , that is some achievement .
A thought after reading Tyler Cowen ’s latest : the issue of health care economics seems to make libertarians act like robots on bad science - fiction TV shows .
You know , the ones that , faced with information that does n’t fit with the assumptions in their programming , say “ Does not compute !
Does not compute ! ” and collapse .
The basic facts on health care are clear : government - run insurance is more efficient than private insurance ; more generally , the United States , with the most privatized health care in the advanced world , has a wildly inefficient system that costs far more than anyone else ’s , yet delivers no better and arguably worse medical care than European systems .
But all of this runs so counter to libertarian assumptions about the superiority of individual choice and market mechanisms that they just ca n’t take it on board .
So we have bald assertions that Europeans receive much less care than Americans , even though the data clearly show that it just ai n’t so .
And we have assertions that mean - testing Medicare is the answer to our problems .
I could say a lot more about this , but maybe the key point is this : we do n’t have a Medicare crisis , we have a health care crisis .
Private insurance is collapsing as we speak .
Means - testing Medicare , aside from many other problems , would just push older Americans into a failing private system — a system that , by the way , has never worked for the elderly , for whom adverse selection issues are especially acute .
If we ’re serious about controlling Medicare costs , Peter Orszag and his staff at CBO have had a lot to say about this .
Means - testing is n’t the answer ; setting priorities for care is .
Defcon will once again be one - upping the sophistication of the conference attendee badges .
Wired has just published a preview of this year ’s badge .
The core is a Freescale Flexis MC9S08JM60 processor .
The badge has an IR transmitter and receiver on the front plus eight status LEDs .
On the back ( pictured below ) , there is a mode select button , CR123A battery , Data Matrix barcode , and an SD card slot .
You can add a USB port to the badge and upload code to it using the built in USB bootloader .
All the dev tools needed will be included on the conference CD or you can download the IDE in advance .
The low barrier to entry should lead to some interesting hacks .
In previous years , you needed a special dongle to program the hardware .
There is no indication as to what the badge does out of the box .
Releasing the badge early is a first for Defcon and the one pictured is n’t the attendee color , but we ’re sure someone will still come up with a clone .
Now comes the fun part :
What do you think the best use of this badge will be ?
Would Defcon be so cavalier as to equip everyone in the conference with a TV - B - Gone ?
I think our favorite possibility is if someone finds a security hole and manages to write an IR based worm to take over all the badges .
Defcon 14 introduced the first electronic badge which blinked in different patterns .
Defcon 15 had a 95 LED scrolling marquee .
[ Joe Grand ] will be posting more specific Defcon 16 badge details to his site after the opening ceremony .

Tens of thousands of Britons are being covertly tracked without their consent in a technology experiment which has installed scanners at secret locations in offices , campuses , streets and pubs to pinpoint people ’s whereabouts .
The scanners , the first 10 of which were installed in Bath three years ago , are capturing Bluetooth radio signals transmitted from devices such as mobile phones , laptops and digital cameras , and using the data to follow unwitting targets without their permission .
The data is being used in a project called Cityware to study how people move around cities .
But pedestrians are not being told that the devices they carry around in their pockets and handbags could be providing a permanent record of their journeys , which is then stored on a central database .
The Bath University researchers behind the project claim their scanners do not have access to the identity of the people tracked .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Eamonn O’Neill , Cityware ’s director , said : “ The objective is not to track individuals , whether by Bluetooth or any other means .
We are interested in the aggregate behaviour of city dwellers as a whole .
The notion that any agency would seriously consider Bluetooth scanning as a surveillance technique is ludicrous . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
But privacy experts disagree , pointing out that Bluetooth signals are assigned code names that can , to varying degrees , indicate a person ’s identity .
Many people use pseudonyms , nicknames , initials , or abbreviations to identify their Bluetooth signals .
Cityware ’s scanners are also picking up signals that are listed using people ’s full name , email address and telephone numbers .
Contacted about the Cityware project , the office of the information commissioner said in a statement that the public should “ think carefully ” before switching on their Bluetooth signals .
A spokesman said the government watchdog would “ monitor ” the experiment .
“ This is yet another example of moronic use of technology , ” said Simon Davies , director of Privacy International , an independent campaigning group defending personal privacy .
“ For Bath University to assert that there are n’t privacy implications demonstrates an astonishing disregard for consumer rights .
If the technology is as safe as they claim , then all the technical specifications should be published and people should be informed when they are being tracked . ”
He added : “ This technology could well become the CCTV of the mobile industry .
It would not take much adjustment to make this system a ubiquitous surveillance infrastructure over which we have no control . ”
Although initially confined to Bath , Cityware has spread across the planet after the software was made freely available on the internet sites Facebook and Second Life .
Thousands of people downloaded the software to equip their home and office computers with Cityware scanners .

Comment on this article
In support of the still - to - be - finished proposal for allowing most HTML 5 elements to become hyperlinks , I ’ve written a quick proof - of - concept demo for your perusal .
Basically , it ’s a page with some JavaScript that captures the whole document tree , looks for any elements with an href attribute , and then sprinkles some events on those elements in order to make them act like hyperlinks .
There ’s also some CSS that applies old - school link presentation to said elements ( blue and underlined , baby ! ) .
I ’m using href because it was the easiest thing to do .
I ’m sure I could have written a more elegant script ( and yes , I know , your favorite JS framework would done it in half the lines and seventeen times the page weight ) and I suspect there are some things I ’m missing .
I ’ll be interested to hear what those may be .
Meanwhile , if you want to try out your own arbitrary - element linking , grab a copy of the demo and edit the markup to your heart ’s content .
Or you could suck out the JS and apply it to your own test pages .
Your call .
The demo works fine in Firefox 2 , Camino 1.5 , Safari 2 , and Opera 9.2 .
I did n’t test it in anything else .
It may well fail spectacularly in every other browser known to man and dog .
That ’s not really an issue , though .
The goal here is to have a working demonstration , not a universal solution .
( The latter may come later . )
It ’s a handy way to show people how browsers should behave in an arbitrary - link world .
The one thing that did n’t go right is the status - bar URL handling when hovering over a linked element ( other than an a element ) that descends from another linked element .
For some reason the descendant ’s URL never shows up in the status bar .
I ’m sure there ’s an easy fix .
I regard this as a minor issue .
[ Update 7/23 : this has been fixed thanks to Allwyn Fernandez . ]
The biggest thing that ’s missing is simulating “ visited ” styles on non- a elements ; in this case , turning them purple .
That would require mining the history and dynamically adding classes and , well , all kinds of stuff .
I ’m sure it ’s possible .
I ’m also sure that I do n’t have the time right now to figure out how to do it well .
Besides , ship early , ship often , right ?
As I said before , I ’m very interested to know what people think of the demonstrated behavior and how it might be improved .
And hey , if anyone wants to contribute improvements to the JS , I ’ll do my best to keep up .
One more step toward a concrete proposal …
Johnny Depp , Colin Farrell & Jude Law Donate Earnings To Heath Ledger ’s Daughter
News was released back in Feburary , after the sudden and tragic death of Heath Ledger , that Johnny Depp , Colin Farrell and Jude Law would all three be stepping in to fill in for Heath in the movie he was filming at the time , ‘ The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus ’ .
Now all three actors have donated their earnings from new movie to Heath ’s daughter Matilda .
They wanted to give their money to Heath ’s two - year - old child with actress Michelle Williams to ensure she has a secure future .
The movie ’s director Terry Gilliam said :
“ The three actors were totally heroic coming in .
This does n’t happen very often – where there ’s a tragedy like this , and very famous , very successful actors suddenly say , ‘ OK , we ’ll do whatever it takes to help . ’
They came , they did the work , they allowed the movie to be finished , they did n’t take money – the money goes to Heath ’s daughter .
That ’s extraordinary !
I am so glad these guys are so humble .
That ’s why they make a great addition to the film .
It will be bittersweet seeing this movie knowing he was filming it only days before he died .
This picture still hurts to see because as we all know he did die a couple of days after this picture was taken .
My thoughts will always be with Heath . ”
How amazing are these guys ?!
So sweet .
Johnny , Colin and Jude will all play Heath ’s character Tony as he is transported into three separate dimensions , which he accesses via a paranormal mirror belonging to a travelling theatre troupe .

A proposed change to copyright law could change the way Canadians share media .
It could also have a negative impact on the education system , said English professor Laura Murray .
Bill C - 61 , first read to the House of Commons by Federal Industry Minister Jim Prentice on June 12 , outlines the provisions for copying media and fills in the grey areas not covered by existing copyright laws .
Under current copyrighting laws , Canadians are n’t allowed to copy newspapers , books , periodicals , photographs , videocassettes and music .
Under Bill C - 61 , users would be allowed one copy of each item per individual media device such as an iPod and would also be permitted to record television and radio programs for later use .
An anti-circumvention clause in the bill would make it illegal to break digital locks on copyrighted material , nullifying the new allowances for most digital media .
Murray , also the author of the book Copyright : A Citizens Guide said , If passed , the bill could have a serious effect on Canadian universities .
“ Decoding is being criminalized when there are a lot of legitimate purposes for it , especially regarding education , ” she said .
But , Murray said the bill would make it illegal to get around digital locks , which are designed to prevent the reformatting and copying of contents found on DVDs , cell phones and other digital devices .
“ The bill , if passed , would give the owner the ability to lock up material many different ways . ”
Murray said Bill C - 61 would also eliminate the university ’s ability to take advantage of fair dealing , which allows students to download online journal articles and broadcast journalists the right to show clips from movies and newsreels without the permission of the copyright owner .
The determination of what is considered “ fair ” is left to courts on a case by case basis .
“ Everyone needs to understand fair dealing so that they know what they ’re losing .
This whole idea that users have rights is foreign to many people , ” she said .
“ Fair dealing will be virtually impossible if the owners decide to block it out .
To me , they ’re giving up on the principle , ‘ some things are free . ’
That ’s wrong , and we should n’t have to apologize for it . ”
Under the current Copyright
Act , the public is able to legally quote from digital sources for the purposes of private study , research criticism , review and news reporting .
“ We [ the University ] certainly hope it does n’t pass … the public should be as familiar with the concept of fair dealing as they are familiar with the term copyright , ” Murray said .
“ At a university we need fair dealing in order to do research , it will mean less audio visual material will be used in the classroom and will provide barriers to students who want to use digital materials in the classroom . ”
Film studies professor Blaine Allan said he ’s been educating himself about the effect Bill C - 61 could have on the film department .
“ We regularly , for the sake of convenience , make copies of digital materials to show clips from movies and other film mediums , ” he said .
Allan said if Bill C - 61 is passed , he might have to bend the law in order to continue to teach his courses effectively and efficiently .
“ What we may have to do strictly , legally speaking is use the actual item which would be technically cumbersome and distracting , ” he said .
“ If we were adhering to the letter of the law we would not have the ability to use the materials that we would normally . ”
Should the bill pass , Allan said his teaching would be severely restricted .
“ It is preventing us from doing what we do in a way that we see as being productive and beneficial enacting an unfair constraint , ” he said .
“ We have a lot of great tools in our hands , it would be a same for us to not be able to use them . ”
The Film Studies Association of Canada ( FSAC ) has issued its own statement regarding the new proposed copyright reform legislation .
In it , FSAC expresses its concerns about Bill C - 61 limiting their rights as scholars and educators .
In the document , the FSAC calls out for “ a truly balanced copyright act , which would protect the rights of creator and copyright holders and the legitimate rights of users of copyright material . ”
Outside the classroom , Bill C - 61 could have serious implications for those who upload or download files from peer - to - peer networks .
People caught downloading material such as mp3s or videos will be subjected to fines of $ 500 per incident .
But , if a defendant testifies they were unaware they infringed on copyright the fine could be reduced to $ 200 .
Current Canadian copyright law allows for the legal downloading of sound recordings while the downloading of movies is deemed copyright infringement and is criminalized .
Uploading a file onto a network like YouTube could result in a lawsuit of $ 20,000 per file .
In her first year at Queen ’s , Ayan Ga’al , ArtSci ’ 11 , discovered DC ++ , a free peer - to - peer file sharing network popular among students living in residence .
“ Everyday I downloaded something whether it be a movie or a song .
It ’s good because it makes downloading easy , ” she said .
“ DC is an amazing tool because it allows you to download movies , music and lecture notes all in one place . ”
Ga’al said she was shocked to hear her money - saving activity could potentially have legal implications but said she wo n’t change her downloading habits anytime soon .
“ I ’d probably take my chances … although I would probably try to incorporate iTunes into my everyday life , ” he said .
Ga’al said downloading music and movies is so ingrained into the fabric of Canadian society , it would be difficult for people to stop the practice altogether , despite the government ’s efforts to impose a financial deterrent .
“ It ’s so much a part of what we do , ” she said .
“ It ’s not about , ‘ did you get this new CD ? ’
It ’s ‘ did you download this new song ? ’
Everybody downloads . ”
Scientists at the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton , are set to explore the world 's deepest undersea volcanoes and find out what lives in a ' lost world ' five kilometres beneath the Caribbean .
The team of researchers led by Dr Jon Copley has been awarded £ 462,000 by the Natural Environment Research Council to explore the Cayman Trough , which lies between Jamaica and the Cayman Islands .
This rift in the Caribbean seafloor plunges to a depth of more than 5000 metres below sea level .
It contains the world 's deepest chain of undersea volcanoes , which have yet to be explored .
The researchers are planning two expeditions over the next three years using the UK 's newest research ship , RRS James Cook .
From the ship , the team will send the UK's remotely - operated vehicle Isis and a new British robot submarine called Autosub6000 into the abyss .
The team will look for new geological features and new species of marine life in the rift on the seafloor .
Geologist Dr Bramley Murton will use a whale - friendly sonar system to map the undersea volcanoes in unprecedented detail to understand their formation .
At the same time , oceanographer Dr Kate Stansfield will study the deep ocean currents in the Cayman Trough for the first time and geochemist Dr Doug Connelly will hunt for volcanic vents on the ocean floor .
These volcanic vents are home to exotic deep - sea creatures that will be studied by marine biologists Dr Jon Copley and Professor Paul Tyler .
" The Cayman Trough may be a ' lost world ' that will give us the missing piece in a global puzzle of deep - sea life , " says Dr Copley , a lecturer with the University of Southampton ’s School of Ocean and Earth Science .
Volcanic vents in the Atlantic are home to swarms of blind shrimp and beds of unusual mussels .
But similar deep - sea vents in the eastern Pacific are inhabited by bizarre metre- long tubeworms .
The researchers hope to find out whether creatures living in the Cayman Trough are related to those in the Pacific or the Atlantic – or completely different to both .
Before North and South America joined three million years ago , there was a deep water passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic .
This means that the undersea volcanoes of the Cayman Trough could harbour a ' missing link ' between deep - sea life in the two oceans .
Finding out just what lives in the rift will help scientists understand patterns of marine life around the world .
" The deep ocean is the largest ecosystem on our planet , so we need to understand its patterns of life , " says Dr Copley .
" Deep - sea exploration has also given us new cancer treatments and better fibre - optic cables for the internet , both thanks to deep - sea creatures . "
Working at depths of more than five kilometres will take the UK 's deep - diving vehicles close to their limits .
Isis is the UK ’s deepest diving remotely - operated vehicle ( ROV ) reaching depths of 6,500 metres .
The team will control Isis from their research ship to film the ocean floor and collect samples with its robotic arms .
Autosub6000 , a new unmanned undersea vehicle built in Southampton , can dive to 6000 metres deep .
Autosub6000 is an autonomous underwater vehicle ( AUV ) – a robot submarine that can carry out missions on its own , without being remote - controlled .
The team will launch Autosub6000 from their ship to survey the area and hunt for volcanic vents on the ocean floor .
" These undersea volcanoes lie within British seabed territory recognised by the United Nations , " says Dr Copley .
" We now have the technology to explore them . "
The public will be able to follow the progress of the expeditions through web pages updated from the ship .
The team will also invite a school teacher to join them and share the scientific adventure with classrooms around the world .
In quotes : Berlusconi in his own words
Berlusconi's loose tongue has often got him into trouble
The outgoing Italian Prime Minister , Silvio Berlusconi , is well known for his blunt language - a tendency to make what one of his predecessors , Massimo D'Alema , described as " planetary gaffes " .
Here is a selection of Berlusconi clangers :
At a rally during the 2006 election campaign : " Read The Black Book of Communism and you will discover that in the China of Mao , they did not eat children , but had them boiled to fertilise the fields . "
On left - wing voters at a conference of retailers during the 2006 campaign : " I trust the intelligence of the Italian people too much to think that there are so many pricks around who would vote against their own best interests . "
At the launch of the 2006 campaign : " I am the Jesus Christ of politics .
I am a patient victim , I put up with everyone , I sacrifice myself for everyone . "
Promising to put family values at the centre of his campaign : " I will try to meet your expectations , and I promise from now on , two - and - a - half months of absolute sexual abstinence , until [ election day on ] 9 April . "
To German MEP Martin Schulz , at start of Italy 's EU presidency in July 2003 : " I know that in Italy there is a man producing a film on Nazi concentration camps - I shall put you forward for the role of Kapo ( guard chosen from among the prisoners ) - you would be perfect . "
During the controversy raging over the above remark : " I 'll try to soften it and become boring , maybe even very boring , but I am not sure I will be able to do it . "
To a German newspaper : " In Italy I am almost seen as German for my workaholism .
Also I am from Milan , the city where people work the hardest .
Work , work , work - I am almost German . "
At the Brussels summit , at the end of Italy 's EU presidency , in December 2003 : " Let 's talk about football and women . "
( Turning to four - times - married German Chancellor , Gerhard Schroeder . )
" Gerhard , why do n't you start ? "
On Italian secretaries ( comments made at the New York stock exchange ) : " Italy is now a great country to invest in ... today we have fewer communists and those who are still there deny having been one .
Another reason to invest in Italy is that we have beautiful secretaries ... superb girls . "
On Mussolini : " Mussolini never killed anyone .
Mussolini used to send people on vacation in internal exile . "
In the wake of 11 September : " We must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation , a system that has guaranteed well - being , respect for human rights and - in contrast with Islamic countries - respect for religious and political rights , a system that has as its value understanding of diversity and tolerance ...
" The West will continue to conquer peoples , even if it means a confrontation with another civilisation , Islam , firmly entrenched where it was 1,400 years ago . "
His response to worldwide condemnation of the above speech : " They have tried to hang me on an isolated word , taken out of context from my whole speech . "
" I did not say anything against the Islamic civilisation ...
It 's the work of some people in the Italian leftist press who wanted to tarnish my image and destroy my long - standing relations with Arabs and Muslims . "
On Italian justice : " Eighty - five per cent of the Italian press is left - wing and among the judges it is even worse ...
There is a cancer in Italy that we have to treat : the politicisation of the magistracy . "
On judges pursuing former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti on charges relating to the Mafia : " Those judges are doubly mad !
In the first place , because they are politically mad , and in the second place because they are mad anyway .
" If they do that job it is because they are anthropologically different from the rest of the human race . "
On his trial , now suspended , in which he denies charges of bribing judges to prevent the sale of a state - owned food company to a rival : " I believed and still believe that citizen Berlusconi should be praised for having prevented the state 's wealth from being looted ...
I was expecting a Gold Medal for Civil Worthiness for ensuring the state earned 2,000bn [ lire ] . "
On himself : " The best political leader in Europe and in the world . "
" There is no - one on the world stage who can compete with me . "
" Out of love for Italy , I felt I had to save it from the left . "
" The right man in the right job . "
" I do n't need to go into office for the power .
I have houses all over the world , stupendous boats ... beautiful airplanes , a beautiful wife , a beautiful family ... I am making a sacrifice . "
A joke about Aids told by Mr Berlusconi : " An Aids patient asks his doctor whether the sand treatment prescribed him will do any good .
' No ' , the doctor replies , ' but you will get accustomed to living under the earth ' . "
His response to critics who said the joke was offensive : " They have lost their minds ; they really have come to the end of the line , indeed they have gone beyond it .
I would advise them , too , to undergo sand treatment ... "
On his alleged conflict of interest as prime minister and one of Italy 's biggest tycoons , with major media holdings : " If I , taking care of everyone 's interests , also take care of my own , you can't talk about a conflict of interest . "
On a proposal to base an EU food standards agency in Finland , rather than the Italian city of Parma : " Parma is synonymous with good cuisine .
The Finns do n't even know what prosciutto is .
I cannot accept this . "
On history : " The founders of Rome were Romulus and Remulus ... "

News reports , " One of al Qaeda 's top chemical and biological weapons experts was killed in an air strike by a CIA pilotless drone in a remote Pakistani border region . "
Unfortunately two years ago ABC also reported Abu Khabab al - Masri was killed in Pakistan .
One of al Qaeda 's top chemical and biological weapons experts was killed in an air strike by a CIA pilotless drone in a remote Pakistani border region , senior Pakistani intelligence officials told CBS News Tuesday morning .
Intelligence officials investigating the early Monday missile attack confirmed that Midhat Mursi al - Sayid Umar , also known as Abu Khabab al - Masri was one of six men killed and his remains had been positively identified .
" We now have a positive ID on the body .
I can confirm to you that Al - Masri has been killed , " a Pakistani intelligence official told CBS News on the condition of anonymity .
Earlier reports claimed that the six men killed included three Arabs , while the other three were believed to be Afghans or Pakistanis .
I guess we can look forward to him respawning and being killed in another two years ?

Smart Pointers - What ,
Why , Which ?
To look and feel like pointers , smart pointers need to have the same interface that pointers do : they need to support pointer operations like dereferencing ( operator *) and indirection ( operator -> ) .
An object that looks and feels like something else is called a proxy object , or just proxy .
The proxy pattern and its many uses are described in the books Design Patterns and Pattern Oriented Software Architecture .
To be smarter than regular pointers , smart pointers need to do things that regular pointers do n't .
What could these things be ?
Probably the most common bugs in C++ ( and C ) are related to pointers and memory management : dangling pointers , memory leaks , allocation failures and other joys .
Having a smart pointer take care of these things can save a lot of aspirin ...
The simplest example of a smart pointer is auto_ptr , which is included in the standard C++ library .
You can find it in the header < memory > , or take a look at Scott Meyers ' auto_ptr implementation .
Here is part of auto_ptr 's implementation , to illustrate what it does :
template < class T > class auto_ptr {
T* ptr ; public : explicit auto_ptr( T* p = 0 ) : ptr( p ) {} ~ auto_ptr ( ) { delete ptr;} T& operator *( ) { return * ptr;} T* operator ->( ) { return ptr;} // ... } ;
For the user of auto_ptr , this means that instead of writing :
void foo ( ) { MyClass* p( new MyClass ) ; p->DoSomething ( ) ; delete p ; }
void foo ( ) { auto_ptr < MyClass > p( new MyClass ) ; p->DoSomething ( ) ; }
What does this buy you ?
See the next section .
Automatic initialization .
Another nice thing is that you do n't need to initialize the auto_ptr to NULL , since the default constructor does that for you .
This is one less thing for the programmer to forget .
Dangling pointers .
A common pitfall of regular pointers is the dangling pointer : a pointer that points to an object that is already deleted .
The following code illustrates this situation :
MyClass* p( new MyClass ) ; MyClass * q = p ; delete p ; p->DoSomething ( ) ; //
Watch out !
p is now dangling !
p = NULL ; // p is no longer dangling q-> DoSomething ( ) ; //
Ouch !
q is still dangling !
template < class T > auto_ptr <T>& auto_ptr<T>::operator=(auto_ptr<T>& rhs ) { if ( this != &rhs ) { delete ptr ; ptr = rhs.ptr ; rhs.ptr = NULL ; } return * this ; }
Create a new copy of the object pointed by p , and have q point to this copy .
This strategy is implemented in copied_ptr.h .
of the object pointed by p , and have q point to this copy .
This strategy is implemented in copied_ptr.h .
Ownership transfer :
Let both p and q point to the same object , but transfer the responsibility for cleaning up ( " ownership " ) from p to q .
This strategy is implemented in owned_ptr.h .
: Let both p and q point to the same object , but transfer the responsibility for cleaning up ( " ownership " ) from p to q .
This strategy is implemented in owned_ptr.h .
Reference counting : Maintain a count of the smart pointers that point to the same object , and delete the object when this count becomes zero .
So the statement q = p causes the count of the object pointed by p to increase by one .
This strategy is implemented in counted_ptr.h.
Scott Meyers offers another reference counting implementation in his book More Effective C++.

So the statement q = p causes the count of the object pointed by p to increase by one .
This strategy is implemented in counted_ptr.h.
Scott Meyers offers another reference counting implementation in his book More Effective C++.
Reference linking :
The same as reference counting , only instead of a count , maintain a circular doubly linked list of all smart pointers that point to the same object .
This strategy is implemented in linked_ptr.h .
: The same as reference counting , only instead of a count , maintain a circular doubly linked list of all smart pointers that point to the same object .
This strategy is implemented in linked_ptr.h .
Copy on write :
Use reference counting or linking as long as the pointed object is not modified .
When it is about to be modified , copy it and modify the copy .
This strategy is implemented in cow_ptr.h .
void foo ( ) { MyClass* p( new MyClass ) ; p->DoSomething ( ) ; delete p ; }
If we use a smart pointer , however , p will be cleaned up whenever it gets out of scope , whether it was during the normal path of execution or during the stack unwinding caused by throwing an exception .
But is n't it possible to write exception safe code with regular pointers ?
Sure , but it is so painful that I doubt anyone actually does this when there is an alternative .
Here is what you would do in this simple case :
void foo ( ) { MyClass * p ; try { p = new MyClass ; p-> DoSomething ( ) ; delete p ; } catch ( ... ) { delete p ; throw ; } }
A common strategy for using memory more efficiently is copy on write ( COW ) .
This means that the same object is shared by many COW pointers as long as it is only read and not modified .
When some part of the program tries to modify the object ( " write " ) , the COW pointer creates a new copy of the object and modifies this copy instead of the original object .
The standard string class is commonly implemented using COW semantics ( see the < string > header ) .
string s( " Hello " ) ; string t = s ; // t and s point to the same buffer of characters t += " there ! " ; // a new buffer is allocated for t before // appending " there ! " , so s is unchanged .
Optimized allocation schemes are possible when you can make some assumptions about the objects to be allocated or the operating environment .
For example , you may know that all the objects will have the same size , or that they will all live in a single thread .
Although it is possible to implement optimized allocation schemes using class - specific new and delete operators , smart pointers give you the freedom to choose whether to use the optimized scheme for each object , instead of having the scheme set for all objects of a class .
It is therefore possible to match the allocation scheme to different operating environments and applications , without modifying the code for the entire class .
class Base { /*...*/ } ; class Derived : public Base { /*...*/ } ; Base b; Derived d ; vector < Base > v ; v.push_back (b ) ; // OK v.push_back(d ) ; // error
vector < Base *> v ; v.push_back ( new Base ) ; // OK v.push_back ( new Derived ) ; // OK too // cleanup : for ( vector < Base *>:: iterator i = v.begin( ) ; i != v.end ( ) ; ++i ) delete *i ;
Smart pointers are a possible solution , as illustrated below .
( An alternative solution is a smart container , like the one implemented in pointainer .h. )
vector < linked_ptr < Base > > v ; v.push_back ( new Base ) ; // OK v.push_back ( new Derived ) ; // OK too // cleanup is automatic
Note : STL containers may copy and delete their elements behind the scenes ( for example , when they resize themselves ) .
Therefore , all copies of an element must be equivalent , or the wrong copy may be the one to survive all this copying and deleting .
This means that some smart pointers cannot be used within STL containers , specifically the standard auto_ptr and any ownership - transferring pointer .
For more info about this issue , see C++ Guru of the Week # 25 .
class MyClass { auto_ptr < int > p ; // ... } ; MyClass x ; // do some meaningful things with x MyClass y = x ; // x.p now has a NULL pointer
Note that using a reference counted or reference linked pointer means that if y changes the member , this change will also affect x !
Therefore , if you want to save memory , you should use a COW pointer and not a simple reference counted / linked pointer .
It is important to consider the characteristics of the specific garbage collection scheme used .
Specifically , reference counting / linking can leak in the case of circular references ( i.e. , when the pointed object itself contains a counted pointer , which points to an object that contains the original counted pointer ) .
Its advantage over other schemes is that it is both simple to implement and deterministic .
The deterministic behavior may be important in some real time systems , where you cannot allow the system to suddenly wait while the garbage collector performs its housekeeping duties .
Generally speaking , there are two ways to implement reference counting : intrusive and non-intrusive .
Intrusive means that the pointed object itself contains the count .
Therefore , you cannot use intrusive reference counting with 3 - rd party classes that do not already have this feature .
You can , however , derive a new class from the 3 - rd party class and add the count to it .
Non-intrusive reference counting requires an allocation of a count for each counted object .
The counted_ptr.h is an example of non-intrusive reference counting .
Reference linking does not require any changes to be made to the pointed objects , nor does it require any additional allocations .
A reference linked pointer takes a little more space than a reference counted pointer - just enough to store one or two more pointers .
Both reference counting and reference linking require using locks if the pointers are used by more than one thread of execution .
Using an owned pointer as the function argument is an explicit statement that the function is taking ownership of the pointer .
For this :
Use that : Local variables auto_ptr Class members Copied pointer STL Containers Garbage collected pointer ( e.g. reference counting / linking ) Explicit ownership transfer Owned pointer Big objects Copy on write
Feel free to use my own smart pointers in your code .
The Boost C++ libraries include some smart pointers , which are more rigorously tested and actively maintained .
Do try them first , if they are appropriate for your needs .
Most people want to succeed , but most also have moral qualms about doing whatever it takes .
People with unusually strong ambitions or weak qualms , however , should be willing to do much more , even murder .
And at the top of each walk of life we expect to find a disproportionate fraction not only of high ability folks , but also of high ambition and low qualm folks .
We thus naturally worry about finding the darkest forms of foul play at the top .
Literature is full of plausible - seeming scenarios where by leaders in government , business , and even the arts commit the most terrible crimes to get ahead .
But we tend to believe these stories more about leaders long ago or far away , and less about leaders in admirable walks of life , like religion , academia , or the arts .
Is this just wishful thinking , or is there more to it ?
An interesting concrete example is corporate assassins .
We hear of assassination of leaders in crime or politics , at least far away , but less often in business .
Given how little it seems to cost to have someone killed , why do n’t more corporations have their competitors ’ leaders knocked off ?

PIKESVILLE , Md.  If Senator John McCain ’s radical plan for remaking American health care is to work , he will have to find a way to cover people like Chaim Benamor , 52 , a self - employed renovator in this Baltimore suburb .
Mr. Benamor never found it necessary to buy insurance before having a mild heart attack last year and now , 13 years shy of Medicare , has little hope of doing so .
The heart attack left Mr. Benamor with a $ 17,000 hospital bill , $ 400 in monthly prescription costs and a desperate need for insurance .
After being rejected by a number of commercial carriers , he turned to the Maryland Health Insurance Plan , one of 35 state programs for high - risk applicants whom no private company is willing to insure .
He decided that the annual premium  $ 4,572 for a plan with heavy deductibles  was more than he could handle on an income of about $ 35,000 .
Yet his earnings were too high for him to qualify for state subsidies .
“ I ’d like to get it , but what do you pay first ? ” Mr. Benamor asked at his dining room table .
“ Do you pay the mortgage ?
Do you pay your child support ?
Do you pay your car insurance ?
Do you pay for your medicine ? ”
“ Help ! Doctor !
Somebody help me ! ”
I ran out of my office toward the sound of the woman ’s panicked voice .
She was in the hallway outside one of my examination rooms , holding a 1 - year - old child in her arms .
The child ’s body was stiff , her head tilted back , her arms and legs moving rhythmically .
Her eyes were open , but she was not looking at her mother or at anyone else .
She was having a generalized seizure .
Few things are as terrifying as a child having a seizure .
Even though I ’ve seen many seizing infants and children during my more than 25 years as a pediatrician , I have never gotten used to it .
The very word seizure hints at something suddenly taking hold of a person and changing his or her nature .
The Hmong people of the highlands of Laos describe a seizure as qaug dab peg — a phrase that translates as “ the spirit catches you and you fall down . ”
( The translation is the title of Anne Fadiman ’s fascinating 1997 book about cultural differences in medical care . )
The expression represents a belief in many cultures that the something taking hold of a person having a seizure is spiritual or divine .
Divine intervention was the furthest thing from my mind as I lifted the child out of her mother ’s arms and headed for the treatment room .
I needed to have her in a safe place , with access to oxygen and other therapies , and then assess what was happening and decide what to do about it .
I saw that she was still stiff and unresponsive and that her arms and legs were still making rhythmic movements , but thankfully she was breathing and her lips were pink .
I had some time .
A seizure is a symptom of something going on in the brain .
Any of us could potentially have one , if our brain happened to be subjected to a strong enough precipitating stimulus , such as trauma , infection , or a sudden drop in blood sugar .
With any of these stimuli , the complex and finely coordinated electrical activity of the brain ’s cortex suddenly degenerates into a storm , a widespread , rhythmic , but purposeless pattern of electrical activity .
Imagine for a moment a huge auditorium filled with people carrying on hundreds of individual quiet conversations .
Now imagine that , at the same split second , all those people suddenly begin shouting out a single meaningless sound in unison , over and over again , as if led by some maniacal cheerleader .
That ’s something like what happens in the brain during a seizure .
I reached the treatment room and placed the child on the examining table .
One of the nurses attached the leads of a cardiorespiratory monitor , noting that the girl felt quite warm .
“ Let ’s check her temperature and oxygen saturation , ” I said to the nurse , “ and bring the oxygen over in case we need it . ”
“ Do you think you ’re going to admit her ? ” the nurse asked me .
“ Not necessarily , ” I said .
If the child did have a fever and her seizure stopped within 15 minutes , and if her subsequent exam proved normal , this might be just a simple febrile seizure .
Common in children between about 6 months and 5 years of age , such seizures carry an excellent prognosis , requiring neither hospitalization nor medication .
“ Let ’s get an IV started just in case , and draw up some Ativan . ”
If the seizure persisted , I wanted to have medication ready .
At this point , however , I would simply watch and wait , hoping that , like most seizures in children , this one would stop fairly quickly .
But I noticed something worrisome :
The child ’s eyes were not staring straight ahead but were deviated to the right .
This was a subtle but significant clue , and I filed it in my mind as I continued the assessment .
I turned to the child ’s mother , who stood , pale and shaky , nearby .
“ Has she ever had anything like this before ? ” I asked her .
“ No , never , ” she answered .
“ When did she start getting sick ? ”
“ She started running a fever this morning .
That ’s why I made the appointment . ”
“ Did she have any other symptoms ?
Vomiting , rash , any sign of pain ? ”
“ No , ” the mother replied .
The nurse interrupted : “ Her temperature is 103.1 . ”
That was high , but not excessive for a 1 - year - old .
Again , young children often run very high fevers with minor viral illnesses .
I looked at the child once more .
In these situations , continued reevaluation is critical .
To my relief , in just minutes the seizure stopped .
The little girl was lying quietly on the table , still pink , still breathing .
I checked the oxygen monitor : 97 percent .
Good .
Now I could relax a bit , but I had to keep probing .
What had caused this little girl ’s seizure ?
Was it an indication of something that we needed to treat right away ?
Was she likely to start seizing again very soon ?
While many conditions can cause a seizure in a child , they fall into only a few common categories .
I mulled them over as I began to examine her again , and I ticked off the possibilities .
Highest on the list of causes is infection .
Fevers that trigger seizures are most often due to flu , cold , or ear infection , but they can also be due to meningitis .
Thanks to modern immunizations , this dreaded infection of the fluid and membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord is nowhere near as common as it once was .
I began to make a mental list of tests I would need for this child , and the first one was a lumbar puncture , or spinal tap , to sample her cerebrospinal fluid and rule out meningitis .
Another possible cause of a seizure is a mass inside the brain , such as a brain tumor .
I recalled that the child ’s eyes had been gazing to one side during her seizure , and now I noticed that , even though the seizure had stopped , she was holding her left arm and leg in an oddly stiff posture .
The subtle asymmetry of her eyes and extremities suggested to me that this child ’s seizure was focal .
Focal seizures may be triggered by something going wrong in a specific location in the brain .
The problem can sometimes turn out to be , among other things , a tumor .
An MRI scan went on the to - do list .
I was not going to send this child home tonight .
Some children ’s brains are simply prone to having seizures .
We say that such a child has a seizure disorder , which is also known as epilepsy .
We think there is some area of scar tissue or other irregularity in the brain ’s cortex that acts as an “ irritable focus ” ; it can suddenly trigger a seizure , frequently with no provocation at all .
This irritable focus often shows up on an electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , a recording of the brain ’s spontaneous electrical activity .
Fortunately , some medications can decrease the frequency of seizures in people with epilepsy .
The drugs have some side effects , but most patients can live healthy and active lives .
However , the focal nature of the seizure I had just witnessed had me very worried that this little girl might have something worse inside her brain .
I telephoned a pediatric colleague and ar­ranged for the child to be transported to the hospital .
I checked the reports in the computer as they came in over the next couple of days .
I was pleasantly surprised to find that her spinal fluid was normal , her MRI did not show a tumor or any other abnormality , and her EEG showed perfectly normal brain activity with no sign of a seizure focus .
The pediatric neurologist decided that she did not have epilepsy and did not need to be treated with anticonvulsant medication .
She is home now , and doing wonderfully .
With any luck she ’ll never have another episode like this one .
So why did she have a seizure ?
We ca n’t explain it , other than to chalk it up to the mystery of a child ’s brain .
In this case , I was delighted to have been wrong .

Although the unfolding drama in the Caucasus has been a tragedy for its innocent victims , the response by America ’s political and media elites has been an entertaining and delusional farce .
To recap events , the government of the former Soviet Republic of Georgia launched a surprise invasion of South Ossetia ( an autonomous republic within Georgia that has been functionally independent since the break - up of the Soviet Union ) .
On the night of August 8 , the Georgian military — armed and trained by America and Israel — stormed through South Ossetia and overran the region ’s putative capital city ( leaving it a smoldering ruin ) .
Thousands of Ossetian refugees poured northward to Russia , bringing harrowing tales of Georgian brutality .
As the Georgian army swept through the countryside , they encountered groups of Russian peacekeepers , who had been stationed there years ago to monitor a previous ceasefire .
Several of those Russian soldiers were killed by the advancing Georgian forces .
As anyone with a remote understanding of Russian history ( and human nature ) should have been able to predict , the Russians reacted rather badly .
Before the Georgians could consolidate their " victory , " the Russians unleashed a devastating counterattack .
All in all , the Russian operation was a fairly impressive combined arms campaign that involved tactical air support , armor , mechanized infantry , and naval assets .
The Georgian air force was destroyed on the ground , and the Georgian navy was sunk or neutralized .
Russian forces quickly retook all of South Ossetia and seized critical chokepoints along Georgia ’s highway system , effectively cutting the nation into three parts .
The smoke had barely cleared when the Bush Administration , the neoconservative pundits , and our lapdog media started crying foul .
Russian leader Vladimir Putin was , inevitably , likened to Adolf Hitler .
Georgia was portrayed as an innocent victim of unprovoked aggression .
The Ossetian victims were quickly relegated to the Orwellian memory hole .
Although I am not a fan of Vladimir Putin ( he is certainly not a libertarian ) , it ’s hard to garner much sympathy for the Georgians .
The Russian counteroffensive merely gave the Georgians a stiff dose of precisely the same medicine they were planning to give to the Ossetians .
All in all , it was a humanitarian tragedy , but hardly a heartrending tale of Georgian victimhood .
But America long ago ceased to analyze events with anything remotely resembling an objective moral standard .
Nowadays , the only yardsticks our imperial elites understand are power and self - interest .
Over the past seven years , the Bush Administration strove to " contain " Russia by establishing Georgia as a regional proxy .
This was quickly followed by the now - familiar horror - show of Washington special interest groups .
The petroleum lobby wanted to control a vital pipeline that transports Caspian oil to the Mediterranean .
The military coveted Georgian territory for " lily - pad " bases .
The arms industry saw Georgia as a lucrative market for its new geegaws and gizmos .
It was a wonderful little playground , and everything was going swimmingly until Putin came along and kicked over the apple cart .
But from all the whining in the media , you ’d think it was the Russians who actually started the war .
The most telling example I ’ve seen of neoconservative bellyaching was published by Leon Aron ( a Russia scholar at the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute ) in the August 13 edition of USA Today .
Most of his article consists of ad hominem attacks on Vladimir Putin and petty ethnic slurs against the Russian people , but the real meat of the piece involves Aron ’s description of a newfound menace he calls " Putinism . "
" Putinism " is , he claims , a dangerous crypto - fascist ideology that is engulfing contemporary Russia .
In the article , Aron lists the main tenets of " Putinism , " and , in the process , reveals more about himself and the American Enterprise Institute than he does anything about Russia or its leaders .
There are , according to Aron , five major characteristics of " Putinism " :
The intensely personal system of power in which the " national leader " rather than democratic institutions rule .
The state propaganda themes of loss and imperial nostalgia .
The idea of the besieged fortress Russia surrounded by cunning , ruthless , and plotting enemies on every side .
Spy mania
The labeling of political opposition as the " fifth column " traitors .
To the wearied libertarian ear , this newly discovered ideology should sound eerily familiar .
In truth , each and every one of these principles has already been embraced — and even glorified — by the very neoconservatives who now so viciously denounce Putin .
Take the first tenet , for example .
The intensely personal system of power in which the " national leader " rather than democratic institutions rule .
Have n’t the neocons been claiming that our president reigns supreme in times of war , and that he is free to discard the constitution ’s limitations on his power as he sees fit ?
Have n’t they supported policies that allow the president to finger anyone as a " terrorist sympathizer " — a designation that permits our government to imprison suspects without access to a lawyer or a court ?
( Or , even worse , to " rendition " detainees to overseas dungeons for a healthy dose of " enhanced interrogation techniques " ? )
As for the part about " state propaganda , " did n’t the Pentagon get caught paying pundits to plant pro-war op - ed articles in American newspapers ?
Have n’t the neocons been glorifying war as a necessary and desirable strategy for American " benevolent world hegemony " ?
As for the part about " spy mania " and fomenting paranoia , can anyone rival the neocons in that department ?
It was the Bushites — not Vladimir Putin — who gutted the Fourth Amendment with a massive telephone and email wiretapping program — all executed without court - approved warrants .
And what about the endless stories of grandmothers and handicapped people being roughed - up and strip - searched at airports because we are allegedly " surrounded by cunning , ruthless , and plotting enemies on every side " ?
And what about the Putinesque strategy of " labeling political opposition as traitors . "
I vividly recall , during the run-up to the Iraq invasion , that anyone who disagreed with the administration ’s war plans was promptly smeared and driven from public life by packs of slobbering neoconservative pit bulls .
( Has anyone heard from General Shinseki lately ? )
And let ’s not forget some of the other memorable moments on the Bush II highlight reel .
Did Vladimir Putin suggest to his cronies that they should paint Russian warplanes with UN colors and buzz Georgian cities ( thus providing a convenient casus belli if the Georgians should shoot one of them down ) ?
Did Vladimir Putin sow fear among his people with stories of an imminent attack by fictitious , chemical - spraying drones ?
Given recent history , the rest of the world must be watching Washington ’s anti-Russian hissy fit with slack - jawed disbelief .
Although the reptilian nature of our ruling class long ago ceased to amaze me , there is one question that still piques my curiosity :
When our elites write articles like this one in USA Today , are they aware of their hypocrisy ?
Are they totally deaf to the screams of their own irony , or are they coldly cognizant of their actions ?
To put it another way , when the doors are closed and the cameras are turned off , do the neocon pundits kick back in the paneled AEI smoking room , light up a few cigars , and laugh at how stupid they think we all are ?
Or does some massive wall in their psyche prevent them from gaining true insight into their own nature ?
Either way , I agree with Leon Aron about precisely one thing : Putinism — as he defines it — IS a dangerous and destabilizing ideology .
But he need n’t go all the way to Moscow to find it .

There are two types of businesses .
Those that do SEO and get free traffic from Google and Bing , and those who do n’t and wonder why they ’re shrinking a little more year after year .
The fact is that search engine real estate is a massively valuable asset , and Google is doing everything it can to sell as many ads as possible without losing leads .
Remember , they ’re an advertising company before anything else .
It ’s in their best interest to make sure companies like The Portland SEO company can’t “ game the system . ”
One man ’s gaming , is another man ’s game of choice .
The fact is that we at Your Portland SEO Company believe in giving the little guy a chance .
If you look at the progression of rankings over the last 8 years , more and more traffic is going to massive brands and big ad spenders .
I ’m not alleging conspiracy , I ’m just saying you have to fight with every asset you have .
Unless you ’re already a Fortune 100 , then please by all means waste your cash on TV , Radio , and Display Ads .
The people that pedal in the drivel of “ SEO is dead ” are either terrible at execution , have been burned before , or do n’t understand it ’s no longer as simple as handing over money for links .
That ’s the reason why we take a multidisciplinary approach that puts your customers first and the algorithm second .
Once upon a time there was a master narrative , and a neater little theory - of - everything you never did see .
In its 19th century heyday it rationalized the having of the haves and commanded the deference of the have - nots ; it spoke from the pulpit , the newspaper and the professor 's chair .
Its name was market , and to slight it in even the smallest way was to take your professional life into your hands .
In 1895 , the economist Edward Bemis found this out when he was dismissed from John D. Rockefeller 's University of Chicago thanks ...
If you have been around the religious blogosphere for awhile , you have most likely heard of Jeff Sharlet .
An author and journalist , he helped found two seminal web sites full of insightful commentary on faith in today ’s world ( Killing the Buddha and The Revealer ) , co-wrote a book about religious subcultures in America ( which included a trip to a Pagan festival ) , and filed dispatches on the intersections of religion and power for such publications as Rolling Stone Harpers , and Mother Jones .
His most recent book is “ The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power ” , an expose of elite fundamentalism ’s avant - garde .
I was lucky enough to conduct a short e-mail interview with Jeff about his new book , what Pagans have to fear from The Family , and what we can do about it .
Some members of modern Pagan faiths have long warned of a theocratic Christian cabal bent on taking over America , often with the usual suspects of conservative Christianity playing a part .
These fears have often been debunked , but your book “ The Family ” seems to in part vindicate those voices , albeit not in the ways they imagined .
Who are “ The Family ” , and are they really trying to take over the government ?
They ’re not trying to take over government ; they ’ve been a part of government for almost seventy years .
The Family is a network of conservative Christian elites in government , military , and business bound together by what The Family ’s founder , Abraham Vereide , called simply “ The Idea . ” The Idea came to Vereide one night in April , 1935 .
God , he ’d later say , revealed to him that Christianity ’s emphasis on the poor , the suffering , the weak , the down and out , was all wrong .
God wanted Vereide to minister not to the poor , but the powerful .
He called them the “ up and out ” — corporate executives , politicians .
The Idea was that if you could win the hearts of these “ key men , ” they , in turn , would dispense blessings to the masses .
It was , in effect , trickle down religion , and it ’s been the creed of religious conservative elites ever since , the justification for their war on organized labor and their support for foreign dictators , from Papa Doc Duvalier to Suharto to the thugs supported through the Silk Road Act , sponsored by Family politicians Senator Sam Brownback and Rep. Joe Pitts .
Domestically ,
The Family have long been at the heart of the Christianist assault on the First Amendment ’s Establishment Clause – “ Congress shall make no laws respecting the establishment of religion ” – which is the guarantee of the Free Exercise Clause that makes America free ( in theory , at least ) for Pagan .
In 1953 , The Family established the National Prayer Breakfast ; in 1954 , Family politicians led the fight for “ Under God ” in the pledge and “ In God We Trust ” on our currency .
More recently , Representative Tony Hall , a conservative Democrat from Ohio , made the National Day of Prayer a fixed , permanent affair , with White House observance orchestrated by Shirley Dobson – wife of Christian Right leader Jim Dobson .
Faith - based initiatives was first theorized by Family politicians such as Ed Meese in the 1980s ; the legislation that opened the door for it , the 1996 Charitable Choice Provision , came from the offices of two Family politicians , John Ashcroft and Dan Coats .
Historic members have included men such as Strom Thurmond , William Rehnquist , and Senator Homer “ Snort ” Capehart , inventor of the jukebox ( good ) and defender of Nazis ( not so good ) .
( There have never been a lot of women involved . )
Which is all to say that the question we need to ask about fundamentalists is not , “ What are they going to do ? ” but “ What have they already done ? ” Fundamentalism is not a cabal or a conspiracy ; it ’s an ideology , and for nearly 70 years it has led America away from democracy and toward empire .
The theology of The Family seems quite different from the usual Christian conservatives and fire - breathing fundamentalists we often see covered in the news ( though some of them are members or associates of The Family as well ) .
Can you expand on what they believe , and what “ Jesus Plus Nothing ” means to them ?
I first heard the phrase “ Jesus plus nothing ” at a spiritual counseling session The Family ’s longtime leader , Doug Coe , was giving Representative Tod Tiahrt , a Kansas Republican .
Tiahrt was going on about the usual Christian Right concerns – abortion , queers , and Muslims .
Coe waved it all off .
He agreed with Tiahrt across the board , but he saw that list as too limited .
What , he asked , does Jesus have to teach us about Social Security ?
About building roads ?
The Family ’s vision of “ Jesus plus nothing ” leads them to seek a government conformed at every level , in every department , every office , to the will of their totalizing Jesus .
There ’s a sense in which this is a weirdly bureaucratic Christ .
He does n’t stand on street corners and shout about revelation ; he whispers his message in the ears of his “ New Chosen , ” as some Family members call themselves .
And the message is almost always the same : “ privatize . ”
For seventy years ,
The Family has been dedicated to deregulating markets in order to free up the “ invisible hand ” of God .
I was intrigued by the notion of The Family performing “ spiritual assassinations ” on political leaders ( making them “ die in spirit ” to Jesus ) , getting close enough to perform their “ hit ” through innocuous - seeming events like the National Prayer Breakfast ( which they organize ) .
Who are some high - profile “ hits ” we may have heard of ?
Just to be clear – they ’re not killing anybody .
You ’re referring to Chapter Eight , “ Vietnamization , ” in which I write about The Family ’s admiration for the guerilla warfare tactics of the Vietcong .
In 1966 – the same year Family leader Doug Coe announced that The Family was going “ underground , ” erasing its public profile – another Family leader , Clif Robinson , met with the U.S. ambassador to Laos , William Sullivan – strategist of the “ secret ” – and illegal – air war against that country .
Robinson reported back to American Family leadership on what he learned .
“ He said the strategy of the VC was the same as International Christian Leadership ’s , ” gushed Robinson , “ except applied physically and militarily .
They spend hours , days , weeks , what ever time is necessary setting up for the LEADERS and then either by ambush , assassination , or other intrigue , they do away with them — not the people , the leaders .
He said to kill 32 top level people ” — as the Vietcong had done the previous month — “ was tantamount to immobilizing thousands . ”
The lesson was that the Fellowship should understand itself as a guerrilla force on the spiritual battlefield .
They wanted their “ victims ” to “ die to self ” – that is , to commit themselves totally to Jesus plus nothing .
One of their greatest “ hits ” was Chuck Colson , the Watergate felon .
In his mega - selling memoir , “ Born Again , ” Colson writes of being recruited into The Family , which he describes as “ a veritable underground of Christ ’s men all through government , ” through Doug Coe and the CEO of missile manufacturer Raytheon .
Colson would later declare that through The Family ’s religion , he was able to accomp
lish much of what he had once hoped to do politically .
“ Dying to self ” paradoxically gave him a supreme sense of self - righteousness , a confidence – and a political network – through which he ’s built up one of the most powerful Christian Right organizations in the world .
Some journalists and bloggers focused quite a bit of attention on the fact that Hillary Clinton is a “ friend ” of The Family .
That through her , The Family would have access and influence .
Should we have been worried if Clinton won the Democratic Presidential nomination ?
How deep are her ties to the family , and are they already looking to become “ friends ” with Obama ?
The Family ’s faith is a religion of the status quo .
We should n’t be worried about what MIGHT happen ; we should be worried about what has happened .
If you look around the world as it is and think , “ A - Ok ! ” , then you ’ve no problem with The Family .
If you look at Washington and see a healthy , happy democracy , then you ’ve no problem with The Family .
But if you ’re disturbed by a government that ’s more responsive to corporations than to people , by a two - party system in which both sides vote for a war the public did n’t want , by a politics of private influence and quiet deals , then yes , we should have been worried about The Family ’s influence in a Clinton administration .
We should also be worried about its potential influence in an Obama administration .
The Family has endured for 70 years , longer than any other major Christian Right organization , not through doctrinal purity but by compromise with the powers that be .
Power is their bottom line .
When Hillary had it , they wanted in .
As she writes in her memoir , “ Living History , ” she joined a Family prayer group comprised of conservative politicians ’ wives in 1993 .
She calls Doug Coe – a man who claims that Hitler , Stalin , and Mao understood the New Testament better than almost any other leaders in the 20th century – “ a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide . ”
And she used The Family to tack right , teaming up with men such as Senator Sam Brownback and former Senator Rick Santorum on legislation that subtly redefined human rights as Christian issues .
This is not to say Hillary is a stealth fundamentalist .
She is what she appears to be – a centrist Democrat .
To be honest , I voted for her in the NY primary , because of her health plan .
I ’m glad Obama won ; but I ’m worried about his willingness to discard principles in pursuit of a false unity .
The most troubling example of that is his plan to actually expand faith - based initiatives .
Of course , he adds that organizations wo n’t be allowed to discriminate .
But anyone who ’s reported on faith - based initiatives firsthand will tell you that such regulations are impossible to enforce .
Some Obama supporters say he ’s just doing what he has to do to win .
That ’s exactly the way elite fundamentalists want it – to “ win , ” you have to play by their rules .
I do n’t think that ’s true .
I ’m hoping that ultimately , Obama does n’t , either .
You talk about the differences and similarities between the “ populist ” and “ elitist ” branches of American fundamentalism ( together forming a “ popular front ” ) .
With The Family typifying an elitist manifestation , and evangelical mega-churches like Colorado ’s New Life Church ( formerly headed by disgraced pastor Ted Haggard ) typifying the “ populist ” branch .
I was struck by how New Life actively worked to drive out Pagan Witches and other undesirables from their city .
Is driving out the “ Witches ” ( the religious “ other ” ) a shared goal between the populist and elitist branches ?
Or simply the consequence of fundamentalist Christianity coming into power ?
Some populist fundamentalists have actually criticized The Family for their willingness to make peace with and conference with those whom they lump under the label of “ New Agers . ”
That was years ago , when Family leaders , like many conservative evangelicals , saw the wide array of beliefs they lumped under “ New Age ” as a threat to Christianity .
They do n’t , anymore – not because they ’ve made their peace with those beliefs but because they do n’t think those followers of those beliefs have much power .
Ultimately , the inner circle of The Family considers all non-monotheistic beliefs “ demonic . ”
At their C Street House for congressmen , they used to have a prayer calendar listing spiritual war targets for the day – Tibetan Buddhism , Hinduism , Wicca , etc .
In an interview with Alternet you described The Family as “ ultimately something worse ” than fascism .
Since “ fascism ” is usually considered the ultimate manifestation of political evil , on the right and left , what makes this group worse ?
The fact that it ’s far more effective .
Fascism , properly understood , was a relatively short - lived European ideology .
There have been other examples of it since , but by far the most powerful ideology since 1945 has been not fascism , but empire .
One church historian says of The Family that they ’re not right - wing and certainly not left - wing , but “ empire - wing . ”
Fascism may be a purer evil , but empire is a more pervasive one , and ultimately more dangerous because it ’s able to call on the loyalties of well - intentioned people who ’d never go near fascism .
But if you ’re a Vietnamese kid napalmed in 1968 , or an Iraqi kid with your hands blown off in 2008 , empire is every bit as bad as fascism .
Or , for that matter , if you ’re a Bangladeshi or a Chinese sweat shop worker or an Afghani forced to grow and process heroin to survive , the economic ramifications of empire are as bad as the explicit political repression of fascism .
And for decades , what traditional fascism has cropped up around the world – in Central America , in some African nations , for instance – has been made possible only through the support of empire .
On point you make in the book is that secular America keeps trying to announce the death of fundamentalism , of conservative Christian power , but that these frequent declarations are rarely real .
That the “ defeats ” are merely part of a natural ebb and flow of fundamentalism in America .
Instead of shrinking , conservative “ muscular ” Christianity grows ever stronger and is very much a part of the American fabric .
Is the much - touted recent “ evangelical crack - up ” just another natural ebb ?
Will we see audacious power - grabs by fundamentalist forces in the near future ?
We see audacious power - grabs right now !
For instance , Rwanda has recently become the first official “ Purpose - Driven Nation , ” remade in the image of evangelical pastor Rick Warren ’s bestselling “ Purpose Driven Life ” with the support of U.S. dollars and faith - based initiatives .
Closer to home , the Justice Department is supporting a program called “ Fugitive Safe Surrender , ” in which U.S. Marshals go into a low - income community and for four days move the entire legal apparatus into a megachurch , encouraging anyone with legal problems to sort them out under the sign of the cross .
I attended one in Akron ; church greeters talked to you about Jesus in the parking lot , then you walked through a metal detector , then you met a sheriff with a gun and a pastor with a Bible .
Take your pick .
And this program has Democratic support !
Chuck Schumer ’s gone on record saying it ’s great , because it gets potential criminals off the street and allows poor people who’d be screwed by the justice system to have the help of the church .
“ Church - court ” – that ’s audacious .
There ’s no “ evangelical crack - up , ” no matter how much the New York Times may wish it so .
Rather , there ’s an evangelical transformation – and an expansion .
Evangelicals are addressing issues liberals thought they owned , such as poverty and AIDS .
That does n’t make evangelical conservatives less conservative ; it makes their agenda more far - reaching , for better or worse .
Some of the old lions of the Christian Right are dead or are dying .
The new generation is softer - toned in style .
But conservative evange
licalism has been a huge part of American life for 200 years .
It ’s not going away just because Jerry Falwell went to heaven .
Or wherever .
So how do those opposed to what The Family is trying to do fight back ?
What is this groups Achilles heel ?
Is there anything anyone can do to minimize their influence on America and the world ?
Of course !
The first step is what we ’re doing right here : talking about these issues , educating ourselves .
The Family prospers when the public does n’t pay attention .
One of my favorite examples of a public fighting back occurred in 2004 in Norway .
After I first wrote about The Family for Harper ’s , some Norwegian journalists noticed that their new , socially conservative prime minister was jetting around the world to prayer breakfasts on the public dime .
So they came to America and investigated .
They discovered that this social conservative movement had strong ties with The Family , that their ambassador was taking policy meetings with John Ashcroft at The Family ’s headquarters .
So they put it on the front page of the paper , for two weeks .
A mini Norwegian Watergate .
And that government got the boot .
That expose was n’t the only factor , but it was one of them .
When Doug Coe showed up in Norway this spring to talk with the king of Norway , the papers responded again , with a banner headline and a picture of Coe : “ Hitler - admirer received by King . ”
THAT ’S public accountability .
Let ’s try it in America !
Let ’s tell Obama that we respect his desire to include people of faith – all faiths and no faith – in the public square , but we want him to recognize that not everybody is operating in good faith .
Let ’s pay attention to our local representatives .
In 2004 , a Democratic challenger to Rep. Frank Wolf , a longtime Family associate and conservative Republican from Northern Virginia , publicized Wolf ’s Family ties .
The Washington Post immediately editorialized that such a connection was impossible – and THEN sent a reporter to prove it so .
So we need to hold the media accountable , too .
We need them to ask smarter – and tougher – questions about religion .
When we encounter monotheist politicians – that is , those who consider only monotheism legitimate – we need to give them loud refreshers in the history of the Founders , who were quite clear that they meant the First Amendment to extend to everyone , regardless of their beliefs .
I ’m not a Pagan , but I ’d also love to see some Pagan candidates for office .
We ’ll all benefit from that .
Even if Pagans do n’t win major offices – and they wo n’t , at least for awhile – their very presence in the public square helps everybody think about what pluralism means , what democracy means .
Democracy is n’t something we HAVE , it ’s something we make .
The Family does n’t like it .
They call it “ the din of the vox populi . ”
The din of the voice of the people .
So we know what we need to do :
Let ’s make some noise .
3 ) Anti-drug Canadian rap
2 ) Rachel Leigh Cook Breaks
Shit
1 ) Shallow End
Probably the most famous of all anti-drug PSAs , this ad has a tone of gruff condescension that always felt a little unearned .
After making what is at best a muddled metaphor , the voiceover guy says " any questions " in a way that implies that if you do have questions , he 's going to punch you in the mouth .
Well , actually , since you 're asking , we do have a question :
What the fuck do you have against fried eggs , man ?
I mean , they 're certainly better than the salmonella - laced raw eggs that our brain presumably was before we fried it in the delicious sizzling butter ( read : drugs ) .
Thinking about this ad while stoned actually clued us in to the vast PSA conspiracy against America 's Chicken Farmers .
Think about it , there are PSAs for all sorts of cattle byproducts : milk , cheese , beef .
Those " Pork : The Other White Meat " spots play like campaign ads in some sort of meat - election that pork is running in against chicken .
In fact , the only time chickens or chicken byproducts are overtly mentioned in a PSA , its either as an insult from a hulking drug dealer , or as a metaphor for junky brains like in this one .
As Snow proved with his breakout 1993 hit " Informer , " even if they 're talking about drugs , Canadians should never rap .
Apparently , whoever is spitting hot fire about brain blisters and trouble with the law in this commercial did n't get the memo .
This ad - an odd mixture of those Barney music videos and an acid freak out - is based on the premise that kids might get confused between the sorts of drugs that are prescribed by doctors and the kind that you get on the street .
Which brings us to an important question : are there Canadian drug dealers out there posing as doctors to get little kids to try drugs ?
Because if so , we 've heard of some hardcore shit in Jay - Z songs , but apparently our drug dealers do n't have shit on their Canadian brethren .
To tell you the truth , we never saw this ad growing up , but if we had it would have made us want to move to Canada .
With the American anti-drug ads all you get is death , pregnancy and gay turtles .
In Canada , you get some cool dude talking jive about how there might be trouble with the law , but right after he says it the kids are partying up with mustachioed cops and smiling parents .
The chorus says it all : " drugs , drugs , drugs ! "
We 're pretty sure they took that from a Doors song .
There 's a school of thought within the genre of anti-drug PSAs that if they just act really , really angry at you , you 'll somehow be less likely to use drugs .
This ad represents the pinnacle of that approach ( and also , with apologies tofans , the pinnacle of Rachel Leigh Cook 's career ) .
Beginning with the iconic this - is - your - brain - on - drugs egg , Ms. Cook informs you that this is what happens when you snort heroin and smashes the egg with a frying pan .
She then rails against the furniture in this once - pristine kitchen , which by the end is very much in need of " getting clean .
"
Not that we 're big on the H scene , but is n't snorting like the fifth most popular way of taking heroin ?
Is n't an anti-heroin snorting ad a little like the DUI commercials focusing on Zima related DUIs ?
Afteralready taught us that snorting heroin would put you in a coma and that shooting up made you win dance contests , should n't this commercial have come out a little stronger against heroin across the board , and not just the least popular of the many ways of taking it ?
At least they appear to have learned a lesson from beer commercials - the surest way of getting guys to think a product is n't cool is by getting a tightly clothed actress with a great rack to jump around in your commercial .
Oh , wait " Another one of the strategies for keeping kids clean is to threaten them with nightmare scenarios that have nothing to do with drugs , and then imply that there is some sort of causal connection between the scenario and drug use .
This method is especially popular in the latest wave of anti-marijuana ads in which teenage girls somehow become pregnant from smoking a joint .
However the strategy got its start with this classic , in which some girl whose high enough to be wearing a one piece bathing suit at the public pool , dives head - first off a high - dive followed by the bone chilling reveal that - gasp - the pool is empty .
This was actually their second option for scaring kids away from drugs , but the first idea of going door to door , engaging kids in conversations about drugs and then having someone run up from behind and scream BOO , proved too expensive .
Actually this ad had a profound affect on us .
We remember being extra careful to double - and triple - check that there was water in the pool before jumping off the diving board .
Especially when we were stoned .
Brides - to - be arrived on Tuesday to find the shop shut down Angry brides - to - be have turned up at a Hampshire bridal shop to find it closed down and no sign of their outfits or thousands of pounds of their money .
Arvella Brides , in High Street , Lyndhurst , closed on Tuesday .
Couples have been turning up to find the shop abandoned and the windows white - washed with paint .
The owner of the store was unavailable for comment but one supplier , Charlotte Balbier , said she was told liquidators were due to arrive on Wednesday .
Liz Bright , of Copythorne , said her daughter , who is getting married in two weeks , was at her " wits end " .
I 'm gutted , I do n't know whether to laugh or cry

Bride - to - be
She said the family had ordered six men's suits and ties from the shop and had already been let down by their caterers .
" I just could n't tell her that this is what 's happened now , it 's just so upsetting . "
She said they had paid between £ 700 and £ 800 upfront but said no one from the shop had tried to contact them .
Emily Stokes , of Totton , who is getting married in three weeks , paid £ 1,500 on bridesmaids dresses and suits .
She said she tried to contact the shop all of last week .
Miss Stokes added : " I 'm gutted , I do n't know whether to laugh or cry . "
Stuart Waterman and Emma Shawyer , who are getting married on 15 August , paid £ 800 for a wedding dress .
Customers say they were not warned about the closure
While trying to arrange a fitting last week they were told the shop owner Lisa Clarkson was ill .
By Tuesday they found the shop closed down and reported it to Trading Standards .
When the BBC called at Mrs Clarkson 's home , there was no answer .
Clarissa Percy from Wickham is to marry fiancé Chris on 5 July and was due to pick up her dress on Wednesday having paid for 75 % of it .
Her mother Rosemarie has found another designer who can order the same style of dress and they have been inundated with offers from people willing to help with alterations .
" I feel very sorry for all the other brides that are going through this right now , " she said .
" My emotions were just shock . "
Rosemarie and Clarissa Percy were due to pick up the dress on Wednesday Wedding dress designer Charlotte Balbier said a number of brides had contacted her and another designer , Amanda Wyatt , about the whereabouts of their dresses .
She said the shop owed four or five designers money .
" It 's a lot of money " she said .
" We reckon we 've got the most orders - more than 30 outstanding and they 're the ones we know about .
" I 've had someone contact me today who put an order in that I did n't know about .
" My main concern is that if anyone ordered a Charlotte Balbier dress , that they will get to wear one on their wedding day . "
Hazel Paloma Blanca , another designer and supplier , said she was owed about £ 15,000 and had not been paid since February .
She said she had no way of contacting the brides - to - be .
Both designers urged people who had ordered outfits to get in touch with them .

What are these ?
Via Sociological Images .
That 's why you should become scientists , kids !
( Because engineers do n't have sex .
You want me to spell it out for you ? )
I really should just leave it at that , but the sprawling , multifaceted stupidity of this public service announcement -- apparently having sex , like smoking the wacky weed , kills brain cells and will cripple your SAT scores , or something -- is difficult to let pass without comment .
The immaturity of our cultural attitudes toward sex is flat - out embarrassing .
There are real concerns that adolescents should be taught about -- disease and the risk of unwanted pregnancy being the obvious ones .
But they should also be taught that , as long as you are careful about such things , there is nothing wrong with having sex .
Done correctly , it can be fun !
Sure , there can be emotional trauma , awkward moments , broken hearts , impetuous late - night phone calls that you wish you could take back the next day .
But these are downsides associated with life , not with sex per se .
But as a society , we 're too uptight and hypocritical to say these things .
Instead , we get stuff like abstinence - only sex ed , with predictable results .
And adolescence , which is n't going to be an easy time of life for most people no matter how much sensible advice they are given , becomes just that much more agonizing and uncertain .
Except for engineers , of course !
They have it figured out .
Extending templates
( Originally posted here by Simon Willison on 6th August 2008 )
Django's template inheritance mechanism allows templates to extend other templates and replace named blocks within them .
See here for a full explanation : ​http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates/#template-inheritance
This feature becomes even more powerful when coupled with Django 's template path concept , as discussed by Jeff Croft in this article : ​http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2008/aug/05/default-templates-django/
A frequently requested feature is the ability to provide an over - ride template that also extends itself .
Consider the following :
# In settings.py TEMPLATE_DIRS = ('/var/templates/default ' , '/var/templates/mysite ') #
In default / homepage .html BIG COMPLEX TEMPLATE HERE { % block stylesheets % }< link rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " href=" styles.css " >{ % endblock %} MORE BIG COMPLEX TEMPLATE HERE # In mysite/homepage.html { % extends " homepage.html " %} { % block stylesheets % } < link rel= " stylesheet " type =" text/css " href=" mysite-styles.css " >{ % endblock %}
In other words , we want mysite / homepage .
html to reuse default / homepage .
html almost entirely , only replacing the stylesheets named block .
The above wo n't work - Django will throw confusing errors .
It turns out it IS possible to get this to work , if you 're willing to do some devious tricks with your TEMPLATE_DIRS setting .
Consider the following :
# In settings.py TEMPLATE_DIRS = ('/var/templates/default ' , '/var/templates/mysite ' , '/ var/templates ' ) # In mysite / homepage.html { % extends " default/homepage.html " %} { % block stylesheets % } < link rel= " stylesheet " type =" text/css " href=" mysite-styles.css " >{ % endblock %}
This will do what we want it to do .
The trick is very simple - we add a new directory right at the end of TEMPLATE_DIRS which is the parent of all of the other directories .
This has the effect of making every template file within our system uniquely addressable .
Most of the time we will use the normal paths , but in the special case of wanting to extend a template with an over - riding version of itself we can reference its parent 's full , unambiguous template path in the extends tag .
An alternative approach without using the parent directory trick : ​http://github.com/stephenmcd/django-overextends

The offending article
The state of the Norwegian beer scene never ceases to amaze me , and given that I 'm a native Norwegian , I thought international readers might enjoy a look at what goes on here .
If nothing else , it might have some entertainment value .
The occasion for this blog entry is a beer test , initially published by a Norwegian magazine about cottages ( as in summer houses , mountain retreats , etc ) .
This magazine is owned by the media conglomerate Schibsted , which also publishes the main Norwegian daily , and so the test has now made its way onto the site of said daily .
So the unwary reader could be forgiven for assuming that it was published by the most prestigious newspaper in Norway .
The premise of the test is that the reviewer has found that the Norwegian Wine Monopoly sells not just wine , but also beer , in " exciting " bottles .
And so he has picked from six beers from " recognized beer nations like England , Belgium , Japan , and Norway " .
Norway is a recognized beer nation ?
Really ?
But let us put this down to an excess of national patriotism , and not quibble about the presence of Japan in the list , because , as we will find , there is more than enough else to complain about .
The reviewer then notes , apparently with some surprise , that the beer needs special treatment .
For example , it has to be served at the right temperature .
And some of it needs to stand still before serving to let the sediments settle .
Already at this point certain reservations about the competence of the reviewer arise in the mind of readers with some basic knowledge of beer , but at least the reviewer has found this out before starting the test .
It 's when we get to the beer reviews themselves that the article really gets interesting .
For each beer some basic data is given ( ABV , price , food pairings ) , a little background about it , the review , and a score from 1 - 6 ( with 6 as the best ) .
Hoegaarden Wit
Let 's start with the last beer : Hoegaarden Wit .
As any beer enthusiast knows , this is a very highly esteemed world classic .
In fact , this is the beer which revived the style , so that all the wit beers currently brewed were inspired by this single beer .
A simplified estimate based on the RateBeer database tells me there must be at least 1000 such beers .
Nothing in the article indicates that the reviewer has any awareness of any of these facts .
In fact , the reviewer is shocked on discovering that the beer is cloudy , and compares it to " a dodgy urine sample " .
That wit beers are supposed to be cloudy is something he appears to be blithely unaware of .
He goes on to say that it " does n't smell as bad , but is very bitter " .
( The reviewer uses two different words in Norwegian , but they both mean bitter . )
That 's it .
That 's the entire review .
What the reviewer has to say about aroma and taste can be boiled down to two simple assertions : " does n't smell bad " , " is bitter " .
Unfortunately for the reviewer , this is one of the least bitter beers you can find .
This , in fact , is why it tends to be quite popular among women , and why it 's often recommended as a starter beer for people who want to try something other than pilsener .
And in fact the beer is less bitter than the average pilsener .
The reviewer then gives the beer the lowest score : 1 . On RateBeer , out of 1961 reviewers , only 6 reviewers give it less than 1 on a scale from 5.0 to 0.5 .
In fact , RateBeer places 88 % of the registered 70,000 beers below this one based on these 1961 ratings .
So the reviewer 's low opinion does not appear to be very widely shared , to put it mildly .
Leffe Brune
Wort beer
This is the main Belgian - style brand of the huge brewing conglomerate that just bought Budweiser .
In order words , this is not a minor beer in terms of sales , and while it's by no means considered one of the best Belgian - style beers , it 's certainly considered one of the easiest to drink , and a good place to start to explore this part of the beer world .
Our reviewer thinks this " smells little " .
Actually , Leffe Brune has quite a lot of aroma .
However , our reviewer tells us that he 's kept these beers in the fridge for a half a day before pouring them .
So maybe it was too cold ?
Or maybe the reviewer just does n't have much of a sense of smell ?
This last theory sounds rather plausible , as he goes on to write that the beer has " an unidentifiable taste " .
Apart from noting that the beer is dark ( big surprise , given the name ) , that 's the entire substance of the review .
Another oddity is that he compares the colour to that of wort beer ( basically unfermented beer ) , which is an extremely obscure beer type .
Is wort beer the only dark type of beer the reviewer is familiar with ?
So this time around we got " smells little " , " is dark " , and " unidentifiable taste " .
The first of these is wrong , the second stated in the name of the beer , and the third is a statement about the ignorance of the reviewer , and not a statement about the beer .
He then proceeds to give it a 1 .
Out of 678 RateBeer reviewers , none have given this beer less than 1 .
Asahi Super Dry
This is rather an odd beer to include on the list of six beers to review , since it 's the only pale lager .
This is Asahi 's main export brand , and best described as a clean - tasting pale lager with a bare minimum of spiciness and maltiness in the taste .
It 's not entirely tasteless , but definitely a very bland beer .
Checking RateBeer again , picking the first reviews that show up ( and only the ones from people with more than 10 ratings ) , I get " boring " ( #1 ) , " inoffensive " ( # 2 ) , " crisp " ( # 3 ) , " plain " ( # 4 ) , " nice " ( # 5 ) , and so on .
Our reviewer offers that it " smells like pilsener " ( by which he means pale lager ) .
Which is an astute observation , given that a pale lager is exactly what this is .
It also " looks like a pilsener " .
Again , nobody could deny it .
However , as nobody could fail to make precisely this observation , it is not a terribly interesting statement .
" Nice head . "
Sure .
" Tastes almost nothing . "
And here we have a first : the reviewer has made a statement which is both correct and non-obvious !
He then adds " and is really parching dry .
Like paper .
Yes , like drinking paper from the copy machine . "
Right .
While the beer certainly has a slight crisp driness , describing it as " parching dry " is just wildly inaccurate .
It 's not much drier than the average Norwegian pale lager .
( We 'll pass over how you drink paper , whether paper really is almost entirely tasteless , and other such difficult questions . )
So , to summarize again , we are offered " smells like pale lager " , " looks like pale lager " , " nice head " , " tastes almost nothing " , and " parching dry " .
So out of 5 statements , three are blindingly obvious , one is wrong , and one is ( wonder of wonders ! ) correct .
He hands out a score of 1 again .
This time , out of 699 RateBeer reviewers , 21 agree with him .
So while he 's still in a very small minority , at least this time the minority has members other than himself .
Chimay Bleu
Dark beer
Again , with the unerring precision of a sleepwalker , our reviewer has picked another world classic for review .
This time a beer that really is brewed by monks , and one which for many years has been considered one of the high points of Belgian brewing .
In fact , this beer is powerful enough to age , and some places they will sell you vintage bottles dating back to the early 80s .
Our reviewer observes that the beer is " nearly black " .
In fact , it 's not entirely opaque black , and you can see dark brown light through it if you know how to do it .
So not bad for this reviewer .
" Smells little " .
This time , the blame cannot be put on the fridge , as at 9 % alcohol with top- fermentation and spices this beer has a powerful aroma .
This statement is just flat wrong .
" The taste is nauseating . "
Well .
I suppose this beer can be rather overpowering for those who find even Hoegaarden too dry , but even so this is not a very useful piece of information .
It makes the reviewer nauseous .
Ok , but why ?
Is it the sweetness ?
Is it the alcohol ?
Is it the shock on being exposed to a beer that really , definitively tastes rather a lot ?
Hard to say , and the reviewer offers little in the way of hints .
He winds up by describing the beer as " filling " .
That is , it 's like a dish that makes you feel full even when you have eaten little of it .
So , to summarize : " nearly black " , " smells little " , " taste is nauseating " , and " filling " .
That 's one right ( if rather obvious ) , one wrong , and two statements that are mostly about the reviewer .
And what score does the reviewer assign to this beer , which based on 2112 RateBeer reviews is better than 99 % of the beers in the world , and which Michael Jackson gave four stars out of four ?
That 's right .
He gives it a 1 .
The other reviews
Our reviewer also covered Små Vesen Kvernknurr ( 1 ) , Nøgne Ø Amber Ale ( 3 ) , and Samuel Smith Imperial Stout ( 4 ) , without doing much better .
His reviews can be summarized as follows : Kvernknurr , " fresh aroma " , " filling " ; Nøgne Ø Amber , " tastes caramel " , " filling " ; Samuel Smith Imperial Stout , " pleasant aroma " , " tastes of malts " , " filling " .
So again most statements are either nonsensical , wrong , or uninformative .
The " fresh aroma " and " tastes of malts " , which while certainly not wrong , are still rather low on informational content , are as good as it gets .
Conclusion
Lagerboy
Overall , the reviewer scores very low indeed on precision and informational content .
The beer he does best on is Asahi Super Dry , which does tend to confirm the suspicion that he is unused to anything besides industrial pale lager .
It seems fair to conclude that the reviewer has very little knowledge of beer beyond the industrial pale lager that is what Norwegians mostly drink .
However , he has at least seen a wort beer ( which , had he tasted it , he would almost certainly have considered very " filling " indeed ) .
In fact , it does n't seem too much of a stretch to conclude that he has found the experience of drinking beers with more than a minimum of taste to be something of a shock .
We can also conclude that the reviewer is more or less unable to describe the taste of beer .
He can only find one or two words to describe each beer , and he often gets these words wrong .
In fact , it 's hard to avoid the impression that he has n't really tried to describe these beers .
Phrases like " dodgy urine sample " and " copy paper " rather suggest that the purpose here has more been to ridicule these beers than to review them in any serious way .
And this is what I find the most galling about this review .
In Norway there is exactly one newspaper which writes about beer from the point of view of taste , and this is a small regional newspaper .
In all other newspapers , beer is fizzy yellow stuff which should be as cheap as possible , and if there is anything beyond that to say about it it will be the mergers of huge industrial breweries or , at best , interesting pubs covered in travel articles .
Not long ago , for example , Aftenposten .
no had an article about where to find the cheapest beer in New York .
New York has fantastic selection of beer pubs , with selections beyond the wildest dreams of the citizens of nearly all European cities .
But in Norwegian newspapers the focus is on finding cheap Budweiser , or at best Pabst Blue Ribbon .
Who would write an article about where to find the cheapest wine in Paris ?
Of course , the paper version of Aftenposten does carry a weekly column about wine , which to me seems competently written , and certainly far more serious than this so - called " test " .
This is more than a little odd for a country with millennia of beer tradition , and no wine production , but there you are .
The idea has stuck in the minds of most Norwegians that wine is culture and refinement , while beer is cheap alcohol , and when confronted with beers which really are more than just cheap alcohol , the best our journalists can offer is " looks like a dodgy urine sample " .
A bit of “ hijabi propaganda ” ( via email , from an unknown source ) lets us know what happens to women who wear the hijab compared to those who do not :
The text reads :
“ You wo n’t be able to stop them ( i.e. guys ) , but you can protect yourself .
He who created you knows what ’s best for you ! ”
Wow … an ad that degrades both men and women .
These men will apparently jump you , rape you or attack you if you do not wear the head covering …
If you do wear it , though , everything will be fine …
Unless you decide not to go through with your arranged marriage .
In that case , other men wo n’t attack you .
Just your family .
( Incidentally , the Chicago Tribune story omitted any reference to “ Islam ” or “ Muslim ” when describing the horrific practice , using the euphemistic word “ cultural ” instead . )

Does anyone know why nobody was charged with violating the IIPA , the law in question , which states specifically that one can only be charged under the statute if someone knowingly outs a covert agent ?
Libby was never charged with this , and neither were Rove or Armitage ( the guy who actually outed Plame ) .
During the Libby trial , it came out that individuals George Tenet 's CIA were the ones who told Libby and Rove and Armitage ( and seemingly a whole host of people ) that Plame was Wilson 's wife , but without telling them she was covert .
Which is why Fitzgerald could n't charge anybody with violating the IIPA .
It was the CIA and Wilson himself ( who opened his big mouth leaking his story to Nick Kristoff and Walter Pincus , then writing that ridiculous op - ed ) who outed Plame ( inadvertantly ) , not anyone else .

At last !
If Karl did any of his Seigelman discussions on that RNC laptop , look for any claim of Executive Privilege to be challenged by the fact that Karl kept that laptop in implicit acknowledgement of and obedience to the Hatch Act , which forbids party business being done on the people 's time - which would be time done serving the Executive Branch .
That laptop was for RNC biz , which cannot be protected as Executive Branch confidentiality .
The challenge to that argument never happened in the Wilson matter ; now , if the president dares argue Rove 's protection again , the House can set a very necessary precedent that Political Director can't serve a party , on a party laptop , at a party e-mail address , on the people 's time in the White house and claim Executive Privilege for that service .

Wondering who those 28 percenters are ?
SteveIL and a couple of other fringe folks would seem to be just about all they 've got left .
But to answer some of SteveIL 's long - ago discredited wingnut talking points :
Does anyone know why nobody was charged with violating the IIPA , the law in question , which states specifically that one can only be charged under the statute if someone knowingly outs a covert agent ?
Yes .
According to the prosecutor on the case , Patrick Fitzgerald , he was unable to get the information he needed in order to bring such an indictment because I. Scooter Libby " kicked sand in the umpire 's face " by obstructing justice and lying to federal investigators so they could n't get to the truth of the matter .
Libby was never charged with this , and neither were Rove or Armitage ( the guy who actually outed Plame ) .
Actually , he was one of several , including Rove and Libby etc. who did so .
But as to why he was never charged , see above .
Or go read the facts of the case itself ( not the version you read at Townhall.com )
During the Libby trial , it came out that individuals George Tenet 's CIA were the ones who told Libby and Rove and Armitage ( and seemingly a whole host of people ) that Plame was Wilson 's wife , but without telling them she was covert .
Which is why Fitzgerald could n't charge anybody with violating the IIPA .
Completely unsubstantiated nonsense .
Of course , I 'll be happy to give you the benefit of the doubt , and not ( yet ) charge you with posting knowing disinfo here ( a bannable offense ) , as long as you can offer the evidence to back up your claim above .
We 'll all be looking forward to it .
It was the CIA and Wilson himself ( who opened his big mouth leaking his story to Nick Kristoff and Walter Pincus , then writing that ridiculous op - ed ) who outed Plame ( inadvertantly ) , not anyone else .
Once again , we await your evidence .
If you can't offer it , or otherwise fail to retract the above , I 'll then have to presume you 're posting knowing disinformation .
So please deliver the goods .
I 'd hate for you to lose your posting privileges here .
Thank you .

Maybe there is hope for justice after all , though I put no faith in Fitzgerald .
Imho , he is a fake .
He only charged one guy ?
He used a baseball analogy to explain why he failed ?
Now what " ridiculous op - ed " is SteveIl talking about ?
The only famous one by Wilson I know of was when he pointed out that Shrub 's State of the Union Address was full of lies about wmd's .
The thing I hate worst about our country is there is little emphasis on history .
And I 'm not talking about way back history , but even a few years ago .
Why is n't there more talk about the White House Iraq Group ?
Does that become old news ?

Scooter Libby " kicked sand in the umpire 's face " by obstructing justice and lying to federal investigators so they could n't get to the truth of the matter .
Considering how many people testified , and how long this investigation has gone on , the fact that nobody was charged with violating the IIPA can hardly be laid only at the feet of Libby 's perjury and obstruction of justice .
If that was the case , do n't you think Libby would have been so charged ?
Also , that would also indicate that Libby was the only administration official outside the CIA to know Plame was covert , since neither Rove or Armitage were charged with anything , least of all violating the IIPA .
Therefore , the only possible conclusion someone , including Fitzgerald , can come up with is that only the CIA knew Plame was covert .
Now , if you have evidence to the contrary , evidence that was never used by Fitzgerald , I 'd be happy to see it .
In response to my saying :
It was the CIA and Wilson himself ( who opened his big mouth leaking his story to Nick Kristoff and Walter Pincus , then writing that ridiculous op - ed ) who outed Plame ( inadvertantly ) , not anyone else .
you said :

If you can't offer it , or otherwise fail to retract the above , I 'll then have to presume you 're posting knowing disinformation .
Here :
Critics have argued for years that if Plame was concerned about her CIA cover , she should not have let Wilson discuss his mission to Niger publicly nor write about it in the New York Times .
She touches on this only briefly in the book , saying neither of them ever considered the possibility it would jeopardize her cover .
Now , I would n't call this evidence of a crime , since I do n't believe any of the parties involved violated the IIPA .
But it was Wilson and the CIA who allowed for the possibility of finding out how Wilson was chosen to be sent to Niger , and possibly exposing Plame as a covert CIA agent .
As far as Wilson leaking his trip to Niger to Kristoff and Pincus within two months of writing his own op - ed in the New York Times , those are already known facts .
What this ended up being was a stupid mistake on the part of the Wilson 's and the CIA to allow Joe Wilson to open his big mouth about the trip .
That mistake was compounded by the administration 's attempts to sweep Plame 's outing under the rug , and the Democrat 's politicizing the outing by sweeping the CIA's , and the Wilsons ' , culpability in all this .

Thanks for the laugh Patriot .
Let me know when you 're going to start paying me on my new job ( and I am expensive ) .
Seriously , I took a gander at the CIA Leak Case tag for this blog .
What I found was fascinating ; on a 3/16/2007 post here at BRAD BLOG ( link : https://bradblog.com/?p=4283), there is a chart that was used during Valerie Plame 's testimony before Waxman 's committee .
There are five black lines leading from the top set of boxes leading one way to various individuals at the White House and the State Dept .
( although one name is missing , then - Sec. of State Powell , who found out from Armitage I believe ) .
Two of those individuals , Harlow and Grenier , are ( or were ) in the CIA .
They told Libby and Martin (? ) about Plame .
Again , to be convicted of violating the IIPA , one has to knowingly out a covert agent .
Since nobody was charged with this ( for the reasons I explained earlier ) , did anybody find out if either of these Plame colleagues knew she was covert ?
And if so , why were n't they charged with leaking classified information , and possibly of violating the IIPA ?
After all , only the CIA would know if Plame was covert unless someone in the CIA passed that information on as well , which did n't seem to be the case .
Either that , or the various members of the CIA were lying to save their asses and to keep from being charged .
Here 's something else interesting .
In the top set of boxes is a black one marked " Unknown " , and this has one - way arrows pointing to Cheney and Rove , but no one - way arrow to Libby .
Nobody seems to know who this is ( maybe they do now ) , whether this person was in the CIA , or whether this person knew Plame was covert .
Whether Cheney told Libby of this contact does n't seem to be known ; but , it obviously could n't have been that big a deal to Fitzgerald since , again , nobody was charged with violating the IIPA .
But I do have a question ; why did n't Waxman actually want to find out why the George Tenet - led CIA failed to protect the identity of one of their covert agents ?
Is n't this ... you know ... oversight ?
( And yes , the question could also be asked of his Republican predecessor . )

SteveIL does n't want the reader to learn more about the White House Iraq Group , imho .

The big story has always been about war crimes .
Joe Wilson outed George Bush for his lying State of the Union address .

What I Didn't Find in Africa by Joseph C. Wilson 4th
It is the one I was referring to .
It 's also something else which I 'll get to later .
The timeline for this is already available .
Feb .
2002 - Cheney wants CIA to investigate British report of Saddam attempting to buy uranium from Niger ; Through Plame , CIA sends former ambassador Wilson Mar .
2002 - Wilson reports to the CIA ; CIA report states that former Nigerien Prime Minister said that an Iraqi contingent was sent by Saddam in 1999 to " expand commercial interests " between the two countries ; CIA report states that Nigerien PM believed this was about Saddam attempting to purchase uranium ; CIA report states Nigerien PM let matter drop due to sanctions on Iraq Oct.
2002 - Bush gets AUMF against Iraq ; report of sale of uranium to Iraq , but documentation is questionable , and is not used in subsequent policy decisions ( it was proven to be a forgery in Mar. 2003 ) Jan.
2003 - Bush issues SOTU with the 16 words , " The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . "
May 2003 - Wilson , right around the time he donates and joins Kerry campaign , leaks his trip to New York Times reporter Nick Kristoff June 2003 - Wilson leaks his trip to Washington Post reporter Walter Pincus ; Pincus reports that Wilson ( the anonymous source ) told the CIA any documentation of an Iraqi purchase of uranium from Niger was fraudulent , and Pincus article falsely claims the 16 words were based on this data ( they were n't ) July 2003 - Wilson writes his op -ed Jul .
2004 - British government issues Butler report noting the attempted purchase of uranium by Iraq in 1999 ; Senate Intelligence Committee issues { Ed Note : Warning , this is a link to a HUGE pdf that could ruin your day if you have a slow computer or a slow connection .
-- 99} Pre -War Intelligence report ; CIA report ( from Mar. 2002 ) indicating attempted Iraqi " commercial relations " in 1999 ( on page 43 , page 55 of PDF file ) , which refutes Wilson 's assertions of prior year ; Wilson also testified that wife helped with getting him sent to Niger Mar .
2007 - Valerie
Plame testifies to Waxman committee ; states she had nothing to do with sending Wilson to Niger Bush did n't lie regarding those 16 words , and every report that has come out has proven it .
The one document or set of documents showing a uranium sale to Iraq was already questionable long before the 16 words were put into the SOTU , and were never used by administration officials ( it was proven a forgery afterwards ) .
The CIA and British Intelligence both cite an attempted purchase of uranium by Iraq , as noted by the former Nigerien PM .
So what we have here is that Joe Wilson lied through his teeth for a year until he testified under oath .
And then reiterated his lies after that .
There 's enough evidence to charge Plame with perjury for lying to Congress over her role in Wilson going to Niger .
Joe Wilson did n't out George Bush .
Wilson outed himself , then , along with the CIA , outed his covert agent wife .
The administration was accused of criminal actions , and had every right to defend itself against those charges , and to find out how Wilson was involved in this .
Again , the CIA knew she was covert and did nothing to stop Wilson from opening his big mouth and putting Plame 's covert status at risk .
Add this , as I mentioned above :
Critics have argued for years that if Plame was concerned about her CIA cover , she should not have let Wilson discuss his mission to Niger publicly nor write about it in the New York Times .
She touches on this only briefly in the book , saying neither of them ever considered the possibility it would jeopardize her cover .
This has to be one of the dumbest things a covert CIA operative could possibly say .
She 's covert and her husband makes scurrilous public charges against the administration ; what the hell did they think the administration was going to do ?
And as things turned out , it was n't the administration who lied about this ( although they did handle this whole thing badly ) .
No , those who lied were the Wilsons .
The CIA and the Bush Administration are the same .
George Sr. used to run the CIA .
Prescott Bush did business with Nazis .
And this has what to do with anything ?
By the way , Ted Kennedy 's daddy Joe , Sr. ( the bootlegger ) loved the Nazis and was a rampant anti-Semite .
So there .
Nyah .

This is to be expected since it is their JOB to monitor the ' net on a moment to moment basis to attempt to stifle the truth .
I 'm not gonna call out Steve as paid disinfo .
But there is truth about how they do often get the first post in .
I am not an expert on the Plamegate details .
It would not surprise me if Plame and Wilson are not good guys .
Plame was a CIA agent .
That is an immediate red flag .
Joe Wilson was buddies with Scowcroft , Bush Sr. types as regards to foreign policy , going by memory of a New Yorker article I read years ago .
But the main thrust of this blog post is the question of whether Karl Rove might be going to jail .
I would actually take SteveIL at face value if he at all could relate his posts to this overall theme .
I am the king of going off - topic , so I wo n't say more on that .
But I do think it strange that SteveIL has avoided making comment on the White House Iraq Group or on how Rove might be busted for racketeering {?} , concerning Don Siegelman ending up in prison .
So imho , if SteveIL is correct about some things here , it would suggest that Plamegate was a scripted , limited hangout to divert people 's attention away from understanding that war crimes have taken place .
I would have checked into this a bit , but since he does n't seem to be posting anything to do with Rove 's crimes , I withdraw myself from any debate with him .

Rove 's been a target for years , yet nothing , not even the inkling of a charge ( other than the false assertion by Jason Leopold a couple of years ago ) being brought against Rove .
Even this Siegelman thing is so far - fetched as to be nothing more than ludicrous , especially since the only " evidence " against Rove is some alleged " Republican " remembering that she thought she heard Rove 's name mentioned ( this was all that came out of her testimony last year ; everything she 's said since seems to be made up ) .
Then there 's the whole U.S. Attorneys thing .
The only thing that could be said about that is that Gonzales was stupid in trying to make the resignations seem to be not politically motivated , and made it worse by fumbling around ( none were fired , all served their four - year terms ) .
All Gonzales needed to do when asked why any of these attorneys were not going to be in those jobs anymore was to show a copy of subsection ( c ) of Sec. 541 of Title 28 of the U.S.
Code , which simply states :
Each United States attorney is subject to removal by the President .
It does n't say why , it does n't say a reason is needed , none of that .
All it says is that a U.S. Attorney can be removed by the President .
If Gonzales had stuck to that , he would n't have created the mess he did .
Whether Rove did this or that is completely immaterial and has nothing to do with any kind of criminal act .
I 'm not a Rove fan by any means .
But this assertion that he is a criminal , even before he 's been charged with anything , and doing so for years , is utterly pathetic .
The law states that he must be proven guilty of a crime , and is innocent before that .
That is the American way .
I can understand badmouthing him for political reasons , but he 's now out of politics ; so all this looks like is cheap theatrics by the likes of Conyers , Olbermann , etc .
That is unless somebody believes it a crime to have helped get Bush elected President ( and yes , he was legally elected ; no , I do n't want to get into it here ) .

I 've been buried in more important things that have kept me from keeping up with this thread and the extraordinary disinformation that 's been posted here by SteveIL .
When I have time to review it in full , I 'll respond and / or remove the comments which are clearly knowing disinformation at this point .
Almost every single one of SteveIL 's points have either been debunked or were out and out nonsense to begin with .
Given his knowledge of the case , I 'll have to presume he's also aware of the fact that he 's repeating debunked garbage .
Anyway , I do n't have time for troll - stomping for the moment , but will try to get back here when I can .
For the moment , he 's now on Moderate for violation of commenting rules at BRAD BLOG ( posting knowing disinformation ) .

Then why is it that Dick Cheney 's handwritten notes talk about " Wilson 's wife works for the n.p. bureau " ( non-proliferation bureau )
They knew what she did ... why is this being missed ?
It 's in the court documentation .

Voters Say Yes to Decriminalizing Marijuana : 7NEWS / Suffolk University Poll BOSTON th Of the three questions on the Massachusetts ballot this November , only one question -- # 2 the decriminalization of marijuana -- appears all but certain to pass , according to a poll analysis released today by 7NEWS / Suffolk University .
Seventy - two percent favored the proposed law , which would replace the criminal penalties for possession of up to one ounce of marijuana to a civil penalty of forfeiture of the marijuana and a fine of $ 100 .
Twenty - two percent opposed the proposed law .
" The public may be signaling that pursuing small - time marijuana users is a waste of taxpayer resources , " said David Paleologos , director of the Political Research Center at Suffolk University .
" This issue suggests that there is a Libertarian streak in the thinking of Massachusetts voters . "
Question # 1 , which would reduce and ultimately eliminate the state income tax , was opposed 50 percent to 36 percent , with 15 percent undecided .
" Voters considering the no-tax scenario seem to be aware of their New Hampshire neighbors  contending with high property taxes to fund programs , " said Paleologos .
" They appear reluctant to eliminate the income tax and risk paying more with some other tax . "
Question # 3 , which would , beginning in 2010 , prohibit any type of dog racing in Massachusetts that entailed wagering on the speed or ability of the dog , won support from 50 percent , while 37 percent opposed , and 13 percent were undecided .
On the national front , if John McCain were to select former Gov. Mitt Romney as his running mate , it could be the kiss of death for McCain in Massachusetts .
When asked if voters would be more or less likely to vote for the Republican ticket if Romney were the vice presidential candidate , 33 percent said more likely , while 41 percent said less likely , and 24 percent indicated no difference .
Romneys presence on the ticket moved voters positively in Western Massachusetts , while voters in every other region of the state said they would be less likely to vote for McCain .
The 7NEWS / Suffolk University poll was conducted Thursday , July 31 , 2008 , through Sunday , August 3 , 2008 .

The marketing team for that new Batman movie – we think it 's called The Dark Knight ?
– are having a hell of a time getting word out about their scrappy little art house film .
So last night , in an act of sad desperation , they fired up the Bat Signal and shined it onto the Woolworth building to try and spark some degree of excitement .
Unfortunately for them ,
The Dark Knight opens the same weekend as the hotly anticipated Space Chimps , so , you know , good luck , Nolan !
Brooklyn Heights blog caught a glimpse of the signal from Brooklyn ; and today the Times reports that optimistic theater owners will be screening the movie all night long when it opens .
Tuesday , 26 Aug , 2008 Science
According to the project chief , Lyn Evans of the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) , a number of tests cleared way for the beginning in September of an experiment which scientists hope would show how the universe was created after the Big Bang .
Evans stated that the tests in the underground Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) machine went smoothly , without any problems .
" We look forward to a resounding success when we make our first attempt to send a beam all the way round the LHC , " said Evans , the head of a multinational team of scientists that worked on the development of the LHC , which runs deep under the territories of France and Switzerland .
On September scientists plan to send a full particle beam around the LHC pipe in one direction .
This will be a prelude before researchers send the beams in both directions to see them collide .
Scientists from CERN and other laboratories around the world will monitor the collision of the two particle clusters on their computers .
They will look for a special particle that caused the appearance of life .
Scientists hope that by recreating the Big Bang they will be able to understand how our universe expanded .
The experiment will also show the way stars and planets came together out of primordial chaos that followed .
Previously , scientists at the United States failed to track the particle that made life possible .
However , scientists consider that the LHC , which they say is a great step forward in the field of technology , will make the difference .
The particle , which scientists hope to find , was named the " Higgs boson " .
The name comes from a Scottish physicist Peter Higgs who was the first to suggest about 50 years ago that such particle must exist .
Scientists believe that the boson is an unexplained factor that holds matter together .
Higgs , a 79 - year - old Edinburgh University professor considers that the particle will show up very quickly shortly after the beams collide in the LHC .
After visiting CERN he said : " If it does n't , I shall be very , very puzzled . "

Here ’s a sneak peek at what happens in the shower .
The magical cleaning agent in your bar of hygiene is likely cow fat or oil from , say , coconut .
At the manufacturing plant , a chemical process removes the valuable glycerin in the fats and oils to be used in other products .
The leftovers are mixed with sodium hydroxide and then blasted dry to form soap pellets , which are then mixed with the colorants , fragrances and other ingredients that allow a humble soap to go by the name of Carribean Breeze or Lilac Meadow .
While the production of soap — or anything , really — has environmental repercussions all its own , the pretty smells in our personal care products are , perhaps , the issue most worth examining here .
Many of the chemicals producing fine aromas have been linked to not - so - fine human ailments or tested on animals , and their disposal — down your shower drain in a sudsy stream — fills our water system with chemicals that do not readily biodegrade ( or breakdown ) .
Now , how about a shave ?
Razor production involves a lot of steel — made from our friend iron ore , a finite natural resource , through a process officially known as Carbon Emissions Nightmare .
Modern - day razors also owe a lot to the stinky plastics industry , as most are either entirely disposable or come with the nifty replaceable blade cartridge .
An estimated 2 billion disposable razors wind up in U.S. landfills in each year .
Do n’t forget the packaging ( the thick plastic encasing a new Venus Quad - Blade Mach 3000 is more accurately described as a booby trap ) .
You ’ve got the plastic bag around the disposable razors , the plastic tray holding razor cartridges , the various spots of cardboard .
A group called the Dogwood Alliance is fighting for companies such as Procter & Gamble , Unilever and Revlon to reduce excessive paper packaging .

Update : thx to Steve Hodson of WinExtra , a pic of the issue in the wild :
Rogue prefers his steak medium - well .
But when it comes to sniffing out a rare plant , this dog performs work that ’s very well done , indeed .
The 4 - year - old Belgian sheepdog is part of a Nature Conservancy collaborative project to test the efficacy of using dogs to sniff out the threatened Kincaid ’s lupine .
The plant is host to the endangered Fender ’s blue butterfly , found only in Oregon ’s Willamette Valley .
Watch a video of Rogue in action !
Using detector dogs for such inventory work is new territory :
No one ’s tried it before .
But since dogs use their remarkable sense of smell to uncover illegal drugs or locate missing persons , why not use them to help find and protect endangered plants and animals ?
Rogue ’s reward for finding the correct plant ?
That steak .
( Or sometimes mackerel . )
Can Dogs Do a Better Job Than People ?
The project was the idea of Greg Fitzpatrick , steward for The Nature Conservancy in Oregon .
The Conservancy has been working for more than a decade to improve habitat for the Fender ’s blue in Willamette Valley , where less than 2 percent of historic upland prairie and oak habitat remain .
But Fitzpatrick found that surveying for Kincaid ’s lupine was often arduous work over difficult terrain .
And humans can only survey when the lupine is in bloom and easily identifiable ; using dogs could potentially double the field season for locating lupine .
Fitzpatrick pitched his idea to ecologist Dave Vesely of the Oregon Wildlife Institute .
( Vesely previously used Rogue for native turtle work . )
He contacted Alice Whitelaw , co-founder of the Working Dogs for Conservation Foundation in Montana , and the team decided to give it a try :
In the summer of 2007 they worked to test and prove that dogs can distinguish plants from other species within a plant community ( which is more technically difficult than , say , locating drugs in a suitcase or scat on a wooded trail ) .
( which is more technically difficult than , say , locating drugs in a suitcase or scat on a wooded trail ) .
This year , three dogs worked in eight locations skirting Corvallis — running over a mile of transects and putting their accuracy to the test .
Of the 364 plots , the dogs made only six errors .
.
The dogs even surprised their handlers one day when they refused to alert on lupine at a new site .
It turns out the lupine was a different species , and it was the handlers who had made a mistake .
Rogue Puts His Nose to the Ground
On a recent morning , Rogue , Vesely and Fitzpatrick waded through yellow , knee - high prairie .
When ready , Vesely hollered : “ Search ! ”
And Rogue did .
Nose to the ground , he purposefully wove through the grass , stopped , then sat .
He anxiously waited beside a leafy plant that turned out to be lupine — his black ears visible through the tangle of grasses .
( See a video of Rogue in action ! )
“ Good boy ! ” Vesely exclaimed , tossing a cube of steak .
“ Dogs , in most cases , are more accurate and are quicker than people are , ” explains Whitelaw .
Her detection dogs work around the globe to support projects on bears , wolves , cheetahs , snakes , invasive plants and more .
“ [ The lupine work ] is huge , in terms of the dog ’s ability to discern species and how that can be used for conservation , ” she adds .
The team is still scrutinizing its research and producing a paper about their findings .
But so far , they ’re pretty excited about the possibilities .
More refined regional mapping of Kincaid ’s lupine could promote the butterfly ’s recovery and delisting — and contribute to larger habitat goals and wildlife impacts .
“ We ’re really , really pleased with our dogs , ” says Vesely .
Can Dogs Help Even More ?
Although it ’s not yet clear how long it will take a working dog to comb an area for lupine , this much is certain : they can do it .
According to Whitelaw , they can also know up to a dozen targets at a time , which prompts questions like :
Can dogs be trained to identify lupine with Fender ’s blue butterfly eggs on it and a Kincaid ’s lupine without the eggs ?
( It ’s tedious for humans to find the tiny eggs on the underside of lupine leaves . )
on it and a Kincaid ’s lupine without the eggs ?
( It ’s tedious for humans to find the tiny eggs on the underside of lupine leaves . )
And can dogs sniff out other native or invasive species ?
Meanwhile , Whitelaw continues to lavish praise on project partners and working dogs , Fitzpatrick is stunned his idea has come full circle , and Vesely is intent on compiling the data and fishing for more funding to continue the project .
The research is currently funded by a grant from the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund and is supported by the Conservancy , U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , Greenbelt Land Trust and others .
“ There ’s nothing more fun than being out working with these dogs in the morning , when the birds are singing , and you know you ’re doing good conservation work , ” says Vesely .
“ I just love it . ”

Were there any obstacles that would keep her from increasing sales ?
Maybe .
Pat was doing all her business in New York City , and it looked as though she might have saturated the market there .
In that case , she might have to think about expanding geographically .
I checked out the other common sources of cash - flow difficulties .
Was she having a collection problem ?
No , her accounts receivable had remained pretty steady as a percentage of sales .
Was she spending too much on overhead ?
The numbers did n't seem to be out of line .
So I zeroed in on her inventory , which was huge .
It included all the Olympics and millennium merchandise she had n't been able to sell .
What about the artwork she 'd done , commissioned and not commissioned ?
She said she had the paintings in her home .
She was saving them for her children .
How many paintings ?
About 100 , she said .
And were her children well off ?
Oh , yes , she said .
They were all married and doing nicely .
" Well , Pat , " I said , " I know things seem bleak to you , but you have two hidden assets here .
First , there are the paintings .
What are your kids going to do with 100 paintings , anyway ?
You can leave them 2 paintings each and sell the rest .
Even if you get $ 5,000 apiece for them -- and they 're worth much more -- you 're talking about a lot of money .
" Not only that , but you can probably sell the paintings tax free .
You have a huge tax loss coming to you on the inventory you can't sell .
You can also think about donating the merchandise to charity and taking a tax deduction .
A cup is a cup .
Somebody can use it . "
In the end , however , I may have helped Pat most just by reassuring her that her business concept was sound , thereby giving her the confidence she needed to start taking chances again .
When she set up her exhibit at the next big trade show , she did n't put her New York City items out front , as she had in the past .
Instead , she featured a new line of merchandise with African American themes , which she 'd created in hopes of finding a new market .
She also decided to offer her Olympics and millennium merchandise at a discount and see what happened .
The show was a great success .
She sold much of the discounted inventory and did even better with the African American items , landing her first big accounts from other parts of the country .
It still may take a while for Pat to put her mistakes completely behind her , but at least she 's not stuck anymore .
She 's looking forward again , focusing more on where she 's going than on where she 's been .
And me ?
I have the satisfaction of knowing I helped in some way .
That 's my compensation , as I 'm sure it is for other business mentors .
But there 's one thing I ask of the people I advise .
Someday I hope they 'll do the same for someone else .

Obama selects Biden to reassure the US ruling elite
By Patrick Martin
25 August 2008
The selection of Senator Joseph Biden as the vice - presidential candidate of the Democratic Party underscores the fraudulent character of the Democratic primary campaign and the undemocratic character of the entire two - party electoral system .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , the supposed protagonist of “ change , ” has picked as his running - mate a fixture of the Washington establishment , a six - term US senator who is a proven defender of American imperialism and the interests of big business .
The rollout of the Biden selection over three days of escalating media attention , culminating in the text - message announcement early Saturday and a kickoff rally in Springfield , Illinois , is a metaphor for the entire Obama campaign .
His presidential candidacy represents not an insurgency from below , but an effort to manipulate mass sentiments , using Internet technology and slick marketing techniques , aided by a compliant media , to produce a political result that is utterly conventional and in keeping with the requirements of the US ruling elite .
Long gone are the days when the selection of a vice - presidential candidate by one of the two major big business parties involved a complex balancing act between various institutional forces .
In the Democratic Party , this would have involved consultations with trade union officials , civil rights organizations , congressional leaders and the heads of particularly powerful state and urban political machines .
Today , neither party has any substantial popular base .
In both parties there is only one true “ constituency ” : the financial aristocracy that dominates economic and political life and controls the mass media , and whose interests determine government policy , both foreign and domestic .
The selection of Biden , the senator from a small state with only three electoral votes , whose own presidential bids have failed miserably for lack of popular support , underscores the immense chasm separating the entire political establishment from the broad mass of the American people .
Obama has selected Biden to provide reassurance that , whatever populist rhetoric may be employed for electoral purposes in the fall campaign , the wealth and privileges of the ruling elite and the geo-strategic aims of US imperialism will be the single - minded concerns of a Democratic administration .
An establishment figure
Biden has been a leading figure in the political establishment for three decades .
He was first elected to the US Senate from Delaware in 1972 , when Richard Nixon was president and Obama was 11 years old , and he has held that position through seven administrations .
He has headed two of the most important Senate committees : Judiciary , which vets nominations to judicial positions , including the Supreme Court , and Foreign Relations , which Biden chaired in 2001 - 2002 and again since the Democrats regained control of the Senate in the 2006 election .
Biden ran for president 20 years ago and again this year .
In the 1990s , with Bill Clinton in the White House , Biden was one of the principal proponents of US intervention in the former Yugoslavia , a role that he describes in his campaign autobiography , published last year , as his proudest achievement in foreign policy .
In the mid-1990s he called for the US to arm the Bosnian Muslim regime against Serbia , and then advocated a direct US attack on Serbia during the 1999 Kosovo crisis , joining with a like - minded Republican senator to introduce the McCain - Biden Kosovo Resolution , authorizing Clinton to use “ all necessary force ” against Serbia .
This legislative proposal provided a model for a 2002 congressional resolution authorizing Bush to wage war against Iraq , which Biden co-authored with Republican Senator Richard Lugar .
The Bush administration opposed the Biden - Lugar resolution , because it was limited to ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction , and successfully pressured the Democratic - controlled Senate to adopt a broader war resolution , for which Biden voted .
On domestic policy , Biden is a conventional liberal whose roots go back to the Cold War era .
He combines occasional populist bromides about concern for the poor and downtrodden with close relations with the trade union bureaucracy and unquestioning defense of the profit system .
Like every other senator , he has “ looked after ” the interests of those big corporations with major operations in his state , including the Delaware - based MBNA , the largest independent issuer of credit cards until it was acquired in 2005 by Bank of America .
In this capacity , Biden was one of the most fervent Democratic supporters of the reactionary 2005 legislation overhauling the consumer bankruptcy laws , making it much more difficult for working class and middle - class families to escape debt burdens exacerbated by the corrupt and misleading marketing tactics employed by companies like MBNA .
The 2005 law has compounded the problems of distressed homeowners seeking to avoid foreclosure .
Biden defended the bankruptcy bill during the Senate debate and voted for the legislation along with the overwhelming majority of Republicans , including John McCain .
Obama opposed the bill , and has attacked it repeatedly during the 2008 campaign as a punitive measure against working families .
Employees of MBNA were the biggest single financial supporters of Biden ’s campaigns over the past two decades .
In 2003 , MBNA hired the senator ’s son , Hunter Biden , fresh out of law school , quickly promoting him to the position of executive vice president .
( While his father is not wealthy by US Senate standards , Hunter Biden has since become a hedge fund multi-millionaire ) .
Biden has occasionally taken positions slightly more liberal than those of Obama , most recently voting against the bill ( which Obama supported ) authorizing a massive expansion of government surveillance of telephone calls and email , and providing legal immunity to the giant telecom firms that collaborated with such illegal spying over the past seven years .
But he is a fervent supporter of the USA Patriot Act , defending it during the recent Democratic primary campaign against criticism by some of his opponents .
Biden and the war in Iraq
Senator Obama prevailed over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic nomination contest in large part because she had voted in October 2002 to authorize the Iraq war , while Obama , not then a US Senator , verbally opposed the decision to go to war .
This difference in political biographies was utilized by Obama ’s campaign to make an appeal to antiwar sentiment , although Obama ’s record once he arrived in the Senate in January 2005 was indistinguishable from Clinton’s .
Biden ’s record on Iraq makes his selection as the vice - presidential candidate all the more cynical , since he was an enthusiastic supporter of the war far longer than most Senate Democrats .
He advocated measures to drastically increase the scale of the violence in order to win the war , including the dispatch of 100,000 additional US troops and the breakup of Iraq into separate Sunni , Shia and Kurdish statelets — on the model of the former Yugoslavia — which would presumably be more easy to control .
In the run-up to the launching of the unprovoked US aggression in March 2003 , Biden echoed Bush administration propaganda .
At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee just after Secretary of State Colin Powell ’s notorious appearance before the United Nations Security Council in February 2003 , Biden gushed , “ I am proud to be associated with you .
I think you did better than anyone could have because of your standing , your reputation and your integrity ... ”
Every major element of Powell ’s indictment of Iraq has since proven to be false .
Once the Bush administration ’s lies about weapons of mass destruction and Iraqi connections to Al Qaeda and the 9/11 attacks had been exposed , Biden began to express increasing alarm over the failure of the Bush administration to find an adequate rationale for maintaining public support for the war .
He bemoaned the Bush administration ’s failure to sell the war effectively to the American people .
In a speech to the Brookings Institution in June 2005 , he declared , “ I want to see the president of the United States succeed in Iraq ...
His success is America ’s success , and his failure is America ’s failure . ”
Biden was particularly critical of the rosy forecasts of imminent success in Iraq being issued by the Pentagon and White House , which were at odds with the reality on the ground .
“ This disconnect , I believe , is fueling cynicism that is undermining the single most important weapon we need to give our troops to be able to do their job , and that is the unyielding support of the American people .
That support is waning . ”
Only after public opinion turned decisively against the war did Biden shift from advocating escalation to a limited pullout of US troops .
A Washington Post column in late 2005 — which noted the convergence of views of the longtime senator from Delaware and the newly elected senator from Illinois , Barack Obama — described Biden as “ an early and consistent supporter of the US intervention against Saddam Hussein . ”
Once the Democrats regained control of Congress in the November 2006 , Biden became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , where he played a major role in the capitulation by the congressional Democrats to the Bush “ surge ” policy .
Millions of antiwar voters had cast ballots for the Democrats seeking an end to the war , but the White House escalated the war instead , and the Democrats postured impotently and then went along .
The Democratic - controlled Congress meekly submitted after Bush vetoed modest restrictions on the conduct of the war , and in May 2007 passed full funding for military operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
When several Democratic senators voted against the funding bill as a protest — including Clinton and Obama — Biden denounced them for undermining the safety of the troops .
Two weeks after this critical vote , Biden denounced antiwar critics of the Democratic Congress , claiming , “ We ’re busting our neck every single day ” trying to end the war .
There could be no end to the war , he said , until a significant number of Republican senators defected , to provide the two - thirds majority needed to override a Bush veto , or until a Democratic president was in the White House .
“ We ’re funding the safety of those troops there till we can get 67 votes , ” he declared .
By then , the Democratic presidential contest was well under way , and Biden , despite winning little support and no delegates , played an important political role .
As the World Socialist Web Site noted following a candidates ’ debate in August 2007 , “ Biden has carved out a niche as the Democratic presidential candidate most willing to publicly rebuke antiwar sentiment . ”
In the course of the debate , Biden attacked those who suggested that by threatening a quick withdrawal , the US government could compel Iraqi politicians to establish a stable government in Baghdad .
He denounced illusions “ that there is any possibility in the lifetime of anyone here of having the Iraqis get together , have a unity government in Baghdad that pulls the country together .
That will not happen ....
It will not happen in the lifetime of anyone here . ”
In other words , the US occupation would have to continue indefinitely .
There have been numerous suggestions from Democratic Party officials and the media over the past few days that , given Biden ’s reputation for verbal confrontation , his selection signals a more aggressive attitude from the Obama campaign .
On his record , however , it is quite likely that Biden will be deployed as an “ attack dog ” against antiwar critics of the Obama campaign .
This fact makes all the more despicable the fawning embrace of Biden by purportedly “ antiwar ” publications like the Nation .
John Nichols , Washington editor of the left - liberal magazine , wrote that the choice of Biden was an “ acceptable , perhaps even satisfying conclusion to the great veep search , ” which could tip the polls back in Obama ’s direction .
Commenting on the Springfield rally Saturday , Nichols gushed , “ When Biden went after John McCain , with a vigor and , yes , a venom that has been missing from Obama ’s stump speaking , it was a tonic for the troops who have been waiting for a campaign that is more prepared to throw punches than take them . ”
This response only confirms a fundamental truth about the political crisis facing working people in the United States : it is impossible to conduct a serious struggle against American imperialism , and its program of social reaction and war , without first breaking free of the straitjacket of the Democratic Party .
Working people have no stake in the outcome of the Obama - McCain contest , which will determine , for the American ruling elite , who will be their commander - in - chief over the next four years .
The task facing the working class is to break with the two - party system and build an independent political movement based on a socialist and internationalist program .

38 . The Google Test
. By Eugene McDonnell .
First published in Vector , 21 , 1 , ( Autumn 2004 ) , 116-122 .
Highway 101 in the San Francisco bay area is a busy commuter highway , with employees commuting to work at the headquarters of such companies as Adobe , Apple , Applied Materials , Cisco , eBay , Genentech , Google , Hewlett Packard , Informatics , Intuit , Oracle , Silicon Graphics , Sun Microsystems , Yahoo , and hundreds more high - tech companies .
These commuters recently drove past a large poster paid for by Google , reading :
{ first 10 - digit prime found in consecutive digits of e}.com
Google apparently trusted that some among those passing the poster would understand it , and of these some might be intrigued enough by it to see if they could find that prime , and perhaps some of them might use it to go to the resulting web address .
Those who did go the whole route would then find themselves with this message :
Congratulations .
You have made it to level 2 .
Go to www.linux.org and enter Bobsyouruncle as the login and the answer to this equation as the password .

Those who find the value of F ( 5 ) , and go to the site shown , would get this message from Google Labs :
Congratulations .
Nice work .
Well done .
Mazel tov .
You 've made it to Google Labs and we are glad you are here .
One thing we learned while building Google is that it 's easier to find what you 're looking for if it comes looking for you .
What we 're looking for are the best engineers in the world .
And here you are .
As you can imagine , we get many , many resumes every day , so we developed this little process to increase the signal to noise ratio .
We apologize for taking so much of your time just to ask you to consider working with us .
We hope you 'll feel it was worthwhile when you look at some of the interesting projects we 're developing right now .
You 'll find links to more information about our efforts below , but before you get immersed in machine learning and genetic algorithms , please send your resume to us at problem-solver@google.com .
We 're tackling a lot of engineering challenges that may not actually be solvable .
If they are , they 'll change a lot of things .
If they 're not , well , it will be fun to try anyway .
We could use your big , magnificent brain to help us find out .
You now have all you need to know to dazzle Google with your magnificent brain .
I have n't spoiled it for you , so you can legitimately do it on your own .
I will , however , give you a similar puzzle , in two parts , and will solve it for you .
It uses the digits of pi .
Problem 1 : Finding 10 - digit primes
The first problem is to find among the digits of pi a ten - digit sequence that , when evaluated in base ten , is a prime number , and is the eighth such .
Your first problem , then , is to obtain the first few hundred or so digits of pi .
We 're in luck !
The great Indian mathematician Ramanujan used the theory of complex multiplication of elliptic curves to give a number of beautiful formulas for pi's digits , and a variation of this technique was discovered by the ingenious Chudnovsky brothers , from New York City by way of Kiev .
A J function for their method is :
bigpi =: 3 : 0 a=. 545140134x b=. 640320x ^ 3 c=. 13591409 x d=. 6541681608 x n=. i. > : x : y s=. (! 6 *n ) * c + a * n e=. (! 3 * n ) * ( (! n ) ^ 3 ) * b^n m=. { : e f=. d * - / ( s * m ) % e k=. ( a * m ) * <. @ % : b * 10 x ^ 28 * y k <. @ % f )
Given an integer argument n it finds 1+14 * n places of pi .
To solve the problem you should use a hundred or so digits , so 15 would give about the right number .
q = : bigpi 15
To work with the individual digits it is convenient to work with the character form of q .
w = : " : q # w 211
Here are the first 210 digits :
7 30 $ w 314159265358979323846264338327 950288419716939937510582097494 459230781640628620899862803482 534211706798214808651328230664 709384460955058223172535940812 848111745028410270193852110555 964462294895493038196442881097
We need these ten at a time :
t =: 10 [ \ w $ t 202 10 5 {. t 3141592653 1415926535 4159265358 1592653589 5926535897
To determine which of these are prime we have to convert each row into a number .
p = : " . t $p 202 5 {. x : p 3141592653 1415926535 4159265358 1592653589 5926535897
Some of these may have had leading zeros , so that they are effectively 9 - digits long .
We remove them -- some of these may be prime , but they do n't qualify as ten - digit primes .
pa = : ( p > 999999999 ) # p $ pa 183
A convenient way to determine whether a number is prime is to count how many prime factors it has ; if it has just one , the number is prime .
We can think of using J's prime factors primitive q : to obtain the factors of the numbers in p , but will find that this is not always possible ; many of the numbers are outside its domain .
q : 2004 2 2 3 167 # q : 2004 4 q : 2003 2003 # q : 2003 1
So 2003 is prime , and 2004 is n't .
Here is an is prime function ip :
ip =: 13 : ' 1 = # q : y ' ip 2003 1 ip 2004 0 ip 2000000000 0 ip 2100000000 0 NB . in J602a this no longer produces an error********************* ip 2200000000 |domain error : ip | ip 2.2e9 2200000000 = * / 11 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1
At this writing , the q : function will yield a domain error for many integers with ten or more digits , even when it is obvious the number is n't prime .
To circumvent this , we can use J's adverse conjunction , defined as " The result of u : : v is that of u , provided that u completes without error ; otherwise the result is the result of v . "
We can write a special is prime function sip to return _1 as result if otherwise a domain error would be reported :
sip = : ip :: _1 : sip 2200000000 NB .
This also produces 0 in J602a _1
We use sip on pa to let us know which are known composites ( 0 ) , which are known primes ( 1 ) , and which are not determined yet ( _1 ) .
pb = : sip " 0 pa ~. pb _1 0 1 # /. ~ pb NB . how many of each 159 23 1
We can remove the known composites , leaving us with just the known primes and the suspects .
pc = : ( pb ~ : 0 ) # pa $ pc 160
Now comes the hard part : determining which of these are prime without the use of q : .
A number is composite if it has two or more prime factors .
Twenty - five is composite since it has the two factors 5 and 5 .
The larger number 9999399973 is also composite , with the two factors 99991 and 100003 .
A prime number z has only one prime factor , namely z .
A composite number w must have one or more prime factors less than its square root r.
It can only have one prime factor s larger than its square root r.
It It may be that all of its prime factors are less than r.
In any case , to find whether a number is prime or not it suffices to see whether any of the primes less than its square root divides it , that is , gives a residue of zero with n .
Thus , if we have a list pf of all of the primes less than r we will be able to determine whether a number n is composite by seeing if it has a residue of zero for any of pf .
If it does n't then we know that n is a prime .
We know that the numbers we are interested in will have values from 1000000000 to 9999999999 , inclusive .
The square root of the largest number we may find is thus less than 100000 , so it suffices that pf contain just the primes less than 100000 .
We can find these easily by using the function inverse to p : , that is , p : ^ : _1 .
p : ^ : _1 [ 100000 9592 p : 9592 100003 p : < : 9592 99991 pf = : p : i. 9592 { : pf 99991
We need a function that finds the residues of a number with respect to each prime in pf , and gives 0 if the number is composite and 1 if it is not , that is , if it is prime .
nc =: 13 : ' -. 0 e. pf | y'"0
This reads " not 0 in pf residues of y " .
We apply it to pc :
pd = : nc pc
How many 10 - digit primes have we found ?
+/pd 9
More than enough to solve the puzzle .
Which are they ?
] pe =: I. pd 2 33 36 43 73 108 128 135 149
And what are they ?
pg = : x : pc { ~ pe , . x : pg NB .
all that is needed here is , . x : pc because of improvements in J602a 5926535897 4197169399 1693993751 7510582097 4825342117 5822317253 2841027019 8521105559 8954930381
Just for fun , locate these in the digits of pi :
7 30 $ w
3141 __ 5926535897 __ 9323846264338327
950288 __ 419716939937510582097 __ 494

964462294 __ 8954930381 __ 96442881097
Three of them overlap .
We want the eighth , 8521105559 .
Problem 2 : Finding the sixth in a series
You are given five 10 - digit numbers from the digits of pi , and must find the sixth .
Here are the numbers :
4338327950 2795028841 6939937510 3993751058 2110555964
Here they are , embedded in pi :

95028841 971 693993751058 2097494

964 462294895493038196442881097
The first and second overlap , as do the third and fourth .
I 'll give two hints , the second vacuous :
Hint 1 : Primarily , the sixth number has three doublets and overlaps the fifth .
Hint 2 : Alternately , something for nothing .
If these hints still are n't enough to let you determine the sixth number , you can mail me at eemcd@mac.com , and I 'll give you the answer -- but you 'll still have to find out why it is .

I can not think of a way to replace the 2 em - dash symbols in the text , nor how to make bold ( or alternatively , underline ) characters in ... code .
For the em - dashes I have used double dashes .
For double colons I have put the u and v directly next to the two colons , without spaces .
Also the domain error for ip 22000000000 no longer exists in j602a , so the verb sip and some of the tricky stuff based on it has become moot .
Solutions to Problems
See : Doc/ Articles / AnswersToAPWJ
Solution offered by IanClark
The sixth number is 5596446229 .
The series consists of those 10 - digit numbers divisible by 11 excluding those divisible by 3 or by a prime - cubed .
Initially this seemed such an implausible criterion to me , until I considered how Gene might have thought out the problem in the first place .
So I 'd better retrace my steps as follows :
Method :
1. Compute pa as in the body of the paper : the series of successive 10 - digit numbers in pi ( Note that numbers with leading zeros must be eliminated from pa . )
2. Look for a common factor in the given list , in case it 's as simple as that .
The only one is 11 .
So form a list p11 of those pa divisible by 11 .
There 's only 17 of them and it begins to look very much like the given series .
Tabulate them against their prime factors :
p11 , . q : p11 = : x : ( 0=11|pa ) # pa 4338327950 2 5 5 11 11 11 19 47 73 2795028841 11 283 311 2887 0 0 0 0 0 6939937510 2 5 11 29 2175529 0 0 0 0 3993751058 2 11 139 1306001 0 0 0 0 0 4062862089 3 3 11 13 103 30649 0 0 0 8998628034 2 3 11 6323 21563 0 0 0 0 9986280348 2 2 3 11 79 957641 0 0 0 1706798214 2 3 3 11 23 131 2861 0 0 6798214808 2 2 2 7 11 79 139697 0 0 7982148086 2 11 11 11 47 63799 0 0 0 4709384460 2 2 3 3 5 11 19 125183 0 9385211055 3 5 11 73 733 1063 0 0 0 2110555964 2 2 11 3823 12547 0 0 0 0 5596446229 11 83 277 22129 0 0 0 0 0 2294895493 11 443 470941 0 0 0 0 0 0 9549303819 3 11 43 47 131 1093 0 0 0 8196442881 3 11 41 6057977 0 0 0 0 0
Note : there was a typo in the original article : Problem 2 : Finding the fifth in a series ( not " sixth " ) .
I conjecture that Gene originally posed a much simpler problem , based on this series , viz . to find 4062862089 , but decided it was too simple .
He changed the body of the article for a six - long list but not the heading .
3 . Form a list p113 of those p11 NOT divisible by 3 ( there 's only 9 of them ) and tabulate them against their prime factors as before :
p113 , . q : p113 = : x : ( 0 < 3|p11 ) # p11 4338327950 2 5 5 11 11 11 19 47 73 2795028841 11 283 311 2887 0 0 0 0 0 6939937510 2 5 11 29 2175529 0 0 0 0 3993751058 2 11 139 1306001 0 0 0 0 0 6798214808 2 2 2 7 11 79 139697 0 0 7982148086 2 11 11 11 47 63799 0 0 0 2110555964 2 2 11 3823 12547 0 0 0 0 5596446229 11 83 277 22129 0 0 0 0 0 2294895493 11 443 470941 0 0 0 0 0 0
... still too simple !
So set the reader the task of eliminating 6798214808 and 7982148086 as well .
The only criterion I can see to use is the presence of primes - cubed , but to apply this in such a way as not to eliminate the first number : 4338327950 .
I mean sensible criterion , because you can always insert logic to eliminate individual numbers explicitly .
But maybe there 's something simpler ...?
( A criterion as a J phrase would be nice . )
Simpler possibility - sum of even digits = sum of odd digits ( suggested by the word ' alternate ' & the divisibility by 11 ) :
d= : ( 10#10 ) # : pa NB. individual digits even= : -. odd= : 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 NB .
' alternately , something for nothing ' , . x : 10 #.

I really , really like Ewart 's solution !
I 'm gratified that the prime factor 11 I spotted common to the list was not a complete red herring .
But I was hung up on factorisation as being at the heart of the matter , because it had worked suggestively for 11 .
I had wondered whether the " Something for Nothing " referred to replacing 0s with non-zero digits .
Eugene draws attention to " doublets " so the properties of the digits themselves was somehow tied in with it all .
But I came nowhere near Ewart 's idea of summing alternate digits .
Well done , Ewart !
I 'm going to publish the first expression in Edn 2 , because although longer it is more revealing to a novice .

Penrose Tilings and Quasicrystals
Eric Hwang

For many years , it was believed that a set of tiles that tiled only non-periodically could not exist .
In 1961 , Hao Wang tried to find different ways to tile various unit squares called Wang dominoes , whose edges were colored differently .
Wang tried to see if any set of Wang dominoes would tile so that adjacent edges shared the same color , and thought that any set of tiles that could tile the plane could do so periodically .
Robert Berger showed in 1964 that Wang ’s conjecture was false , and found a set of 20,000 Wang dominoes that tiled only non-periodically .
He was later able to reduce this number to 104 , and Donald Knuth found a set of 92 Wang dominoes that tiled non-periodically .
How does this relate to the non-periodic tiling of polygons ?
It is easy to convert Wang dominoes into polygons that tile only non-periodically by putting edges and slots in the sides , similar to a jigsaw puzzle .
Raphael Robinson and Robert Ammann found different sets of six tiles that force non-periodic tiling , and although it has not been proven , it is strongly believed that this is the smallest number of square shaped tiles that will force non-periodic tiling .
At the University of Oxford , Roger Penrose investigated sets of tiles that were not square in shape that would force non-periodic tiling .
He found a set of six tiles in 1973 ( Figure 1 ) , and in 1974 found a set of four tiles .
Soon after that he found a set of two tiles that would force non-periodic tiling .
Penrose tiles can be pairs of several different shapes , though the two most interesting , and most often studied by John Horton Conway , are those depicted in Figure 2b , known as “ darts ” and “ kites . ”
The darts and kites can be obtained from a rhombus with degree measures of 72° and 108° by dividing the long diagonal into two segments in the golden ratio f = ( 1+√5 ) /2 = 1.618 … then joining the dividing point to the obtuse corners as shown in Figure 2a .
Both rhombuses are composed of two golden triangles , the first having sides with ratios of 1 : f:f , and the other having sides with ratios of 1:1 : f .
The ratio of the areas of the kite and dart is the golden ratio as well .
The area of a kite is proportional to the product of its diagonals and one of the diagonals of the kite has equal length to one of the dart ’s diagonals .
So the areas are proportional to the other diagonal , which we set to be the golden ratio when constructing the kite and dart .
The other common polygons used in Penrose tilings are Penrose rhombs , which are also composed of golden triangles .
One rhomb has degree measures of 72 and 108 , while the other has degree measures of 36 and 144 .
Since both sets can be derived from golden triangles , it makes sense that a kite and dart tiling can be translated into a rhomb tiling , and vice versa ( Figure 3 ) .
The darts and kites and Penrose rhombs can be constructed using a straightedge and compass as follows .
First , construct a regular pentagon .
To do this , take a circle with center O and a given diameter with one endpoint labeled P 0 ( see Figure 4 ) .
Construct the perpendicular bisector of the diameter that intersects the circle at point B. Next , bisect segment OB , and call the midpoint D. Draw DP 0 .
Next , construct the bisector of ∠ODP 0 , which intersects the diameter at point N. Next , construct the perpendicular to the diameter through N which intersects the circle at point P 1 .
P 0 and P 1 are two of the pentagon ’s five vertices .
Now , if all of the vertices are connected in all possible ways , the Pythagorean Pentagram ( Figure 5 ) is obtained .
The kites and darts and the Penrose rhombs can both be constructed from the Pythagorean Pentagram .

BibTeX Entry Book description Note :
The print version of the book is still based on Seaside 2.8 but will be updated soon .
Seaside is a Web development framework implemented in Smalltalk .
It allows the easy creation of powerful Web applications using high level abstractions on the application components and on the underlying hypertext transfer protocol .
In doing so , it builds upon the strengths of the Smalltalk object - oriented programming language and transcends many of the common practices needed in other , less dynamic languages .
This book explains the major concepts of Seaside in a clear and intuitive style .
A working example of a ToDo List application is developed to illustrate the framework 's important concepts that build upon each other in an orderly progression .
Besides the notions of users , tasks , components , forms and deployment , additional topics such as persistence , Ajax and Magritte are also discussed .

( Update : oh dear I is on
( Update 2 : Cogito Ergo Bibo on Wonkette points out the fantastically sinister Alpha Hath Arisen . )
With the revelation of Alaskan governor Sarah Palin as McCain 's running mate , comparisons have been made to past VP candidates , successful and unsuccessful , not least Nixon 's 1968 pick of Spiro Agnew -- a first - term governor with a unique background but rumblings of scandal .
But neither that nor Agnew 's eventual resignation in disgrace should be what we remember him for .
Not when our Vice President 's name could be anagrammed into Grow A Penis .
In the interest of science , and to determine what Sarah Palin brings to the national conversation , let 's see what the Internet Anagram Server can tell us about our new overlord President Palin . -
Fairly flattering , actually .
Palin is ready to give the Democrats tetanus . -
This sounds more appropriate to McCain , but OK .- Palin wants to negotiate with terrorists .
Add her middle name of Heath , and the possibilities expand : - Palin hides her stash in her hat while traveling .-
Be you Martian or Mexican , Palin will mess you up .- McCain says Hi.-
Okay , that one 's just mean .

Without using her middle name , we still can come up with some doozies .
Unflattering descriptive phrases such as " A Plain Rash " and ' Is Anal Harp ' , not to mention ones that would suit her running mate better ( " An Alpha Sir " and ' Liar Has Nap ' - yeah , I know someone already posted that one ! )
But how about this fashion comment : " An Alps Hair " ?

From : ( Anonymous ) Date : September 25th , 2008 03:01 pm ( UTC ) Has McCain Thrown the Election ?
( Link ) John McCain , to the chagrin of his party , threw a gutterball when he selected that ridiculous creature from Alaska as his running mate .
The Senator from Arizona who - for better or worse - can't tell a Baptist from a snake - handler , does n't know what he has on his hands .
Mayor Palin belongs to the " Dominionist " movement , a cult whose " support " for Israel is highly suspect ( the Jews must be gathered in Israel for the Coming of Christ , who will then " perfect " them as Christians ) .
We 'd likewise be interested in her position vis-a - vis the infamous 13th forgery known as " Revelation 2:9 . "
McCain 's obvious ignorance of these matters has alienated a sizable portion of both the Orthodox and Reform Jewish communities .
He had a clear opportunity to nominate the young congressman from Richmond , Eric Cantor , but chose instead to align himself with the sketchy Governor from Alaska , a lady who once tried to ban the teen classic " I Capture the Castle " from her local library .
McCain 's choice was n't simply an insult to Jews , but to thoughtful Gentiles as well .
Let 's hope that he realizes his error before it 's too late .
Cordially ,

The UN Security Council imposed the no-fly zone over Libya on March 17 , along with ordering " all necessary measures " to protect civilians from Muammar Gaddafi 's attacks on rebel - held towns .
The 28 NATO ambassadors met on Sunday to decide on further military plans in Libya .
The United States transfers command for a no - fly zone over Libya to NATO , while coalition forces will continue to protect civilian population from attacks by Gaddafi forces .
The military operation in Libya , codenamed Odyssey Dawn , has been conducted so far jointly by 13 states , including the United States , Britain and France .
NATO members decided on Thursday to assume responsibility for the enforcement of a no - fly zone in Libya , but could not agree on taking full command of all military operations in the country .
Meanwhile , leaders of the 27 European Union states on Thursday issued a statement saying the EU stood ready to assist in building a new Libya " in cooperation with the United Nations , the Arab League , the African Union and others . "

Sectarianism , bigotry , and its horrible descendant , fanaticism , have long possessed this beautiful earth .
They have filled the earth with violence , drenched it often and often with human blood , destroyed civilization , and sent whole nations to despair .
Had it not been for these horrible demons , human society would be far more advanced than it is now .
Swami Vivekananda ( 1893 )
With the invasion of India by Mahmud Ghazni about 1000 A.D. , began the Muslim invasions into the Indian subcontinent and they lasted for several centuries .
The Muslim invasions continued even when the Muslims were ruling India , like the invasion of the Mongols during the reign of the Khiljis or the invasion of the Mughals in the early sixteenth Century when the Lodis were ruling Delhi .
The last notable invasion of the Muslims from outside was the invasion of Nadir Shah in 1739 , during which he unleashed a great horror on the native population .
During these seven hundred years of Muslim invasions and their conquest and rule of India , the Hindus were the greatest sufferers .
It is difficult to estimate the number of Hindus who lost their lives during these campaigns , the number of Hindus who died because of the religious persecution perpetrated on the native population by the Muslim rulers , and the number of Hindus who were forcibly converted to Islam .
According to Prof. K.S. Lal , the author of the Growth of Muslim population in India , the Hindu population decreased by 80 million between 1000 AD , the year Mahmud Ghazni invaded India and 1525 AD , a year before the battle of Panipat .
One can safely add another 20 million Hindus to this list to account for the number that were killed during the Mughal rule or the rule of the Muslim rulers in the Deccan plateau .
By all known accounts of world history , as pointed out by Koenard Elst in his book the Negationism in India , destruction of about 100 million Hindus is perhaps the biggest holocaust in the whole world history .
Europe never forgot or forgave the atrocities of the Nazi rule under Hitler .
We hardly come across any positive reference to either Hitler or his army in the present day text books on European History .
No one talks there of the qualities of Hitler as a great commander or an inspiring leader of German people whom he could mould and influence with his hypnotic speeches .
No films are made showing Hitler as a romantic hero singing songs and his mistress as a heroine shedding copious tears over her lover !
The European consciousness is filled with the evil deeds perpetrated by his regime , thanks to the untiring work of their politicians , journalists , historians and film producers , so much so that the very thought of seeing any virtue in either Hitler or Nazis is abhorrent to the consciousness of the present day Europeans .
Europe and America produced at least a few thousand films highlighting the human misery caused by Hitler and his army .
The films expose the horrors of Nazi regime and reinforce the beliefs and attitude of the present day generation towards the evils of the Nazi dictatorship .
In contrast look at India .
There is hardly any awareness among the Indians of today of what happened to their ancestors in the past , because a great majority of historians are reluctant to touch this sensitive subject .
It is not difficult for the Indian historians to gather information on the kind of atrocities perpetrated against the people of medieval India , to work out the estimated number people killed in the reign of each ruler , to create vivid pictures of what happened during such battles as the battle of Tallikota when Hampi , the capital of Vijayanagara empire was systematically destroyed for weeks .
Nadir Shah made a mountain of the skulls of the Hindus he killed in Delhi alone .
Babur raised towers of Hindu skulls at Khanua when he defeated Rana Sanga in 1527 and later he repeated the same horrors after capturing the fort of Chanderi .
Akbar ordered a general massacre of 30000 Rajputs after he captured Chithor in 1568 .
The Bahamani Sultans had an annual agenda of killing a minimum of 100000 Hindus every year .
The history of medieval India is full of such instances .
The Rajput ceremony of Jauhar ( holocaust ) , 1567 , illustration from ' Hutchinsons History of the Nations '
And against this background , look at the films we have produced so far in a country which boasts of the largest film industry in the world , with no dearth of talent and workmanship !
We have films like Mugal - e - Azam , Anarkali , or Taj Mahal which romanticize the Mughal rulers , depicting them as great heroes of noble virtues oozing with kindness and love for the humanity !
The heroes of Anarkali and Taj Mahal were next to Aurangazeb in their persecution of Hindus and Sikhs .
But people are made to see them as romantic heroes and remember songs from these movies with great nostalgia !
One may say why dwell upon unpleasant facts .
True , but can we develop the character of a nation without facing the realities of life , however unpleasant they may be ?
Can we develop the maturity of thought that comes with the sense of suffering and the sense of responsibility ?
The purpose of knowing these facts is not to heap vengeance , but to strengthen our national character , to avoid the weaknesses that were responsible for the plight of our ancestors .
The Muslims of present day India are also part of this character building because they must know that their ancestors also suffered , that as far as the past is concerned all Indians were in the same boat and that there were no victors and no losers in that great human tragedy .
Knowing thus , perhaps they would develop proper wisdom and understanding and right attitude towards other communities .
Finally , in what context do we talk of Hitler and Nazis in India ?
The answer is even more disturbing .
Any one who speaks for Hindus is a Hitler or is in the process of becoming one and any group which speaks for Hindus are Nazis or are in the process of becoming Nazis !
I do too , but I did n't want to post the same one 's as they did n't show the tray as well .
There should n't be any doubt that the window tray was not being held up by her or myself .
Due to the curved sides of the WAW the tray was barely attached .

Astronomers have spotted an icy object near Neptune that they say hails from the distant Oort Cloud , the distant reservoir of asteroids that encircles the solar system out beyond the orbit of Pluto .
The object , at least 30 miles wide , is on the return leg of a 22,500 - year journey around the sun , astronomers announced today [ SPACE.com ] .
The new object is about 60 miles in diameter .
" It 's basically a comet , but it never gets close enough to the Sun to develop a long , bright tail of evaporated gas and dust , " [ lead researcher Andrew ]
Becker said in a statement [ Reuters ] .
Researchers say the newly discovered voyager , which is currently going by the unromantic name 2006 SQ372 , is the first object ever sighted from the inner Oort Cloud , a region that astronomers know very little about .
Studying the comet as it makes its way through the solar system could give astronomers new insight into the Oort Cloud 's composition , says co-discoverer Nathan Kaib :
“ Comets like SQ372 have the potential to tell us what the entire Oort Cloud looks like , which will test theoretical models of the cloud 's formation as well as provide clues about the environment that the solar system first formed in ” [ Science News ] .
Researchers believe that the cloud 's contents once lurked near Jupiter and the other gas giants back in the solar system 's distant past , but were knocked away through gravitational encounters with the planets .
Researchers found the comet in data gathered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that scanned the same stretch of sky in the autumns of 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 ; the discovery was announced at an international symposium covering research involving the Sloan Survey .
Other objects from the inner
Oort cloud are likely to be found soon , as powerful new survey telescopes are built .
" I would expect them to discover thousands of such objects , and with a data set so large , we could do a pretty good job in finding out what the inner Oort cloud looks like , " [ New Scientist ] ,
says Kaib .

All the 33 - year - old illegal immigrant wanted was a beer .
After nearly a decade in this country , the Irish national knew to steer clear of police and federal agents .
But he was stunned this month when a bartender at the Orpheum refused to serve him because his passport lacked a US Customs stamp .
The man grabbed his passport and fled , abandoning a $ 60 orchestra seat at a Ray Davies concert and igniting a debate over a new policy that one of the country 's largest concessionaires imposed at the Orpheum and at another popular live - music venue in Boston .
Officials at the Boston Culinary Group said they started checking for customs stamps last year to ensure that passports are authentic , not to enforce immigration law .
But critics of the policy say that the stamp is no guarantee of validity and that checking for it is frightening to immigrants .
" I said , ' Who are you , immigration ? " the man , a construction worker who spoke on a condition of anonymity because he fears deportation , said he asked the bartender .
" It was a shock . "
Daniel F. Pokaski - chairman of Boston 's Licensing Board , which issues alcohol licenses - said he had never heard of local bartenders checking for a customs stamp before serving a customer .
" I would n't recommend it if , in fact , it does have the side effect of denying illegal immigrants the right to have a cocktail , " he said .
" I just think you 're really taking a class of people , and based on the lack of a customs stamp you 're denying them service .
I 'm not sure if I 'm comfortable with that . "
State law lists a foreign passport from a US - recognized country as an acceptable identification to verify that someone is 21 , the legal age to drink .
Other acceptable identification include a Massachusetts driver 's license , a military card , a US passport , or a state liquor card , which shows someone is of legal age to drink .
The law does not mention a customs stamp , which shows the date of admission to the United States .
But state and city officials say the company can legally increase its requirements , as long as it does not discriminate based on race , ethnicity , or other protected classes .
Boston Culinary Group launched the passport policy in September at Orpheum and the Bank of America Pavilion because bartenders were confused by the array of foreign passports , said company president Joseph Armstrong .
Company officials decided that the customs stamp was a common denominator that could verify that the passports are authentic .
He said the company instituted the policy only at the two Boston halls because questions arose about passports and because alcohol is in high demand at concerts , making enforcement a major issue .
The company serves venues across the country , from the Tsongas Arena in Lowell to Dolphins Stadium in Miami .
“ This company has to answer to shareholders , to our regulator and to Congress , and those groups often demand completely contradictory things , ” Mr. Syron said in an interview .
Indeed , executives of both companies maintain that one of the reasons the firms hold so many bad loans is that Congress has leaned on them for years to buy mortgages from low - income borrowers to encourage affordable housing .
In 2004 , Freddie Mac warned regulators that affordable housing goals could force the company to buy riskier loans .
Others , however , dismiss that explanation .
“ Sure , it ’s hard to deal with the pressures of Congress and shareholders and regulators , ” said a former high - ranking Freddie Mac executive .
“ But that ’s why executives get paid so much .
It ’s not acceptable to blame those pressures for making bad choices . ”
In a statement , Freddie Mac said executives were unable to verify that Mr. Andrukonis ’s memorandum existed , and that the company ’s default and delinquency rates were substantially lower than other firms .
“ There is little to nothing that Freddie Mac could have done to prevent the losses that it is now incurring , ” wrote company spokesman , David R. Palombi .
Mr. Mudd said the companies were victims of circumstance .
“ You ’ve got the worst housing crisis in U.S. recorded history , and we ’re the largest housing finance company in the country , so when one goes down , the other goes with it , ” he said .
A Fannie Mae spokesman , Brian A. Faith , said that beginning in 2005 , executives “ sounded the alarm ” about riskier loans and began limiting their purchases .
The depths of Freddie Mac ’s problems are complicated by its long - planned , continuing search for a chief executive to replace Mr. Syron , who is expected to remain chairman .
Two people who were approached  Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express and Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock  said they did not want to be considered for the position .
Image Richard F. Syron , the chief executive of Freddie Mac , says he had to balance the demands of shareholders and Congress .

It is time again to check in to see how Make Money Online blogs are doing , and so I turn once again to the 45n5 .
com / top100 list to see where things are positioned and use my previously posted list from the end of March for comparison .
Check out Five Months Later : Top 50 Make Money Online Blogs Shuffle .
One thing I want to mention is how happy I am to still be rising in the ranks .
I did n’t think I would get into the top 15 , but I am currently sitting at number 13 , and I could n’t have done it without my friends and readers .
While many of the blogs I know and love are quickly dropping out of the top 50 , I ’ve been able to hold my ground , and even move up a notch or two , and that really excites me for the future .
More NEW Hotshots
Another round where there are many new blogs entering the top fifty list , and even more interesting than last time I did this , some of the ones in the top fifty , struck way up the list .
I ca n’t understand why there are so many newer sites rising so high so quickly , pushing other great brands from the top fifty in the niche .
Is it because those older sites are getting lazy , or are these new sites just “ that ” good ?
Maybe it is harder to maintain a rank , or continue growing a brand ?
I am not sure , but whatever it is , I find the huge leaps by unknowns and the huge drops by big brands very unnerving .
We have had a few minor Google PageRank updates since the last time I did this , but can it account for everything ?
Brands Off the List
Other than the top five blogs in the list , I feel like many of the sites that I read constantly have dropped out of the top fifty , some even dropping out of the top one hundred which makes me quite sad .
I feel like a lot of this has to do with the blog sales that have gone on in the last year , with people taking a one time cash in , and basically ruining the equity that has been built into their blogs .
Some of the biggest drops seemed to occur after the blogs were sold , continuing to prove the fact that blogs experience huge drops in traffic , links , and rankings as they get purchased by other companies and not integrated , or continued correctly .
The Alexa Rank Slide
Another thing I have noticed on many blogs , including my own is a huge drop in Alexa ranks .
And by drops , I of course mean an increase in that all of the blogs are moving further away from the top ranking of being number one , and sliding ever further downwards .
When Alexa first announced that it was going to be using more data points to come up with its rankings , I actually experienced a nice increase , and since then , I ’ve been sliding ever since , despite my traffic actually going up over the same period of time .
Since the 45n5.com / top100 list takes into account Alexa rankings , and not everyone seems to be dropping at the same rate , rankings are getting shuffled in interesting ways that have very little to do with traffic .
I definitely feel like it is worth devaluing Alexa rankings a little further in the current list .
Performancing
Performancing is the most interesting blog on this list , according to me , as it was a top five blog , and has now dropped down to the seventeenth spot .
The blog is a powerful , thought leader , with some great writers .
It has an insanely good Technorati rank , its Google PageRank is still penalized , but its Alexa is dropping like stone , thus severly effecting its position on the list .
Should it be ranked seventeenth ?
I do n’t think so , but that ’s just my personal opinion .

Inculcating a good dental habit in children is a good strategy of ensuring that they are able to take good care of their teeth even when they grow old .
Parents are encouraged to show their kids on how to brush their teeth twice daily or at least every time after taking a meal .
The parents should also take their kids to a pediatric dentist on regular basis for examination and detection of any problems .
However , in spite of all these strategies , some children require additional dental care .
There are specific dental procedures and techniques that are used to care for children ’s teeth .
These are as follows :
Regular cleaning - Apart from regular brushing of teeth , pediatrric dentist have special tools that can be used to thoroughly clean parts of teeth that cannot be reached through regular brushing dentist office Kesteven
This session offers the dentist a chance to teach children about the benefits of dental health .
Braces - This are devices that are used to align teeth properly on the jaw in case they are crooked .
Kids who have problems like underbites and overbites are provided with braces which can be used for months or years in accordance to the enormity of the problem .
In case your child has braces , it is important to avoid eating sugary foods .
Retainer - This devices are offered to children specifically to align their straighten their teeth .
The devices are individualized to meet the individual needs of each kid .
Retainers are normally used at night .
Sealants - Sealants are applied to kids ’ teeth to prevent plaque formation and occurrence of cavities later in their life .
The sealants are put on the tooth surface that is used for food chewing to prevent the entering of food parts and sugared liquids into the tooth .
The sealants are normally not seen or felt by the child .
In the event that the sealants lack enough protection and a cavity is formed , the dentist may recommend metal fillings .
Sealants should be applied soon after the teeth have erupted .
This typically is around 6 years .
This procedure is normally carried in the dentist ’s office .
X -ray - The x-rays performed at the dentist office are meant to give a picture on how your teeth look like .
Through the x-ray , the dentist is able to detect a teeth problem that was not felt in the first place .
Upon realizing that there is a problem developing , the dentist can treat it on time before it becomes a major one .
Fluoride treatments - We have many kinds of fluoride .
The form that is used for kids dental health is in liquid form .
The main purpose is to change the dental structure thus making teeth to resist any plaque formation .

How did the powerful gain power over the rest of us ?
In a time when the power and freedom of the average American is being eroded at terrific speed , many of us wonder how this could be happening .
What we may not realize it that the powerful have specific tools or principles to use to con the rest of us into surrendering our power to them .
One of the most effective principles used in the last several years with great success is the Hegelian Principle .
The principle is simple , consisting of only three steps toward a preconceived goal .
Once you are able to see how it works , you may want to analyze many of the events unfolding around you in terms of this principle .
As the principle is often used today , it can be explained as :- Perceive a problem that exists and build it up out of proportion to its actual importance , or create a problem or conflict where none existed before . -
Relentlessly place stories about this problem in the major media outlets .
Report on it daily until it becomes a steady drumbeat and a truism for the public who then begin clamoring for a solution to this problem . -
The best solutions are those that appeal to the emotions of the public and make them think something really good is being donethem , when in fact , something really bad is being donethem .
This solution is one that the public never knew it needed until the conditioning of Step Two was successfully completed .
A simple example of the Hegelian Principle at work was the food industries ' conning of the public to throw out their butter and run to buy margarine .
It goes like this : Step One : Food industry is geared up to provide food for soldiers during WWII .
When war ends , food industry needs to turn its capacity into something it can sell during peace time .
It wants to use cheap ingredients to make a high margin product and decides on the manufacture of margarine , but needs to find a way to get the public to buy it .
They decide on a scheme to turn the people against butter .
Step Two : Food companies spread propaganda convincing the populace that butter is deadly to their health .
Appeal to fear .
Get doctors and nutritionists to help in the spreading of propaganda .
Sponsor medical studies to " prove " that butter is deadly .
Convince housewives who had grown up healthy while eating butter that they are placing their families in jeopardy if they serve butter .
Step Three : Food companies rush in to save the American public from having to put butter on their tables .
They present margarine .
Women who want their families to love them stampede to buy margarine .
Voila !
One of the classic and most sinister examples of the Hegelian Principle involves the Nazi 's rise to power that quickly followed the burning of the German Parliament building , the Reichstag , on the night of February 27 , 1933 .
Step One : Adolf Hitler , the new Chancellor of Germany , has no intention of abiding by the rules of democracy that installed him into the Chancellor position .
He intends only to use those rules to legally establish himself as dictator as quickly as possible , and begin the Nazi revolution .
But opposition lurks in his path .
The Nazis , led by Joseph Goebbels , devise a scheme to burn down the Reichstag , the building where the elected officials of the republic meet to conduct the daily business of government , and blame it on the Communist opposition .
Step Two : Hitler acts as though he is enraged over the fire and speaks out that the German people have been too soft on the Communists , proclaiming that " every Communist official must be shot .
All friends of the Communists must be locked up .
And that goes for the Social Democrats and the Reichsbanner as well ! "
Hitler directs the newspaper 's coverage of the fire .
He and Goebbels put together papers full of lies about a Communist plot to violently seize power in Berlin .
The newspaper proclaimed that only Hitler and the Nazis could prevent a Communist takeover .
Step Three : Hitler demands an emergency decree to overcome the crisis .
There is little resistance , and the decree is signed " for the protection of the people and the State " .
According to the decree , " Restrictions on the personal liberty , on the right of free expression of opinion , including freedom of the press ; on the rights of assembly and association ; and violations of the privacy of postal , telegraphic and telephonic communications and warrants for house searches , orders for confiscations as well as restrictions on property , are also permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed . "
The Nazi dictatorship is established .
The Hegelian Principle was first described by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel , a 19th century German philosopher .
The principle defined a method used to produce a oneness of mind on any given issue or thought .
Since its conception , it has been used repeatedly and very successfully to gain power , status , money and control .
The original terms for the three steps were Thesis , Antithesis , and Synthesis .
Under Hegel 's theory , one type of government or society ( Thesis ) would give rise to another that was the opposite of this type of government or society ( Antithesis ) .
This would result in conflict between the two types since they were opposites .
After thesis and antithesis ideas battle each other for an extended time without either side winning , both sides become ready for change .
This change ( Synthesis ) is then brought about by the creation of a third type of government or society .
These three steps are easily seen in the example of the Nazi rise to power , in which the Democratic government battled the Communist form of government .
When the public was conditioned to ask for change , a new government system was installed .
The principle is often seen at work in the downhill slide of education toward the goal of ensuring children grow up unable to be intelligent participants in their democracy .
Step One -
The federal government wants to assert control over the educational system , previously the providence of the states .
As a way of doing this , the Elementary and Secondary Education Act ( ESEA ) is created as a tool to gain power by doling out money to the school districts if they would accept the strings attached .
Slowly but surely the pot of federal dollars that could be had is increased , while state support is undermined .
Under ESEA mandates , academic programs are replaced by social programs .
Step Two -
As academic programs are displaced , test scores drop , and juvenile problems increase as children become more and more illiterate , and parental and public outcry becomes louder .
Teachers are made the fall guys for the illiteracy of their students .
Attempts at fixing the problems involve the creation of ever more social programs , and fail to address the issue of children 's failure to learn .
Parents are blamed as schools make inroads into controlling the parent / child relationship by pitting parents against their own children over school issues .
Education reform is officially sanctioned as Bush announces himself the education president , proclaiming that " The people have been heard .
We must do something about our ailing education system .
" Step Three -
We are in step three now .
Progressive socialist education is upon us .
We are creating a generation of people incapable of thinking , reasoning , speaking and questioning .
The individual will soon be extinct , having been stripped of his uniqueness and become no more than a commodity to be valued accordingly .
With the loss of uniqueness goes the loss of independence and the ability to advocate for one 's self .
The new generation emerges as a willing participant in its own enslavement .

In a case that could tie the hands of companies trying to protect their customers from internet threats , a website owner with past ties to a notorious piece of spyware has filed a lawsuit claiming it is being unfairly maligned by warnings from McAfee that the site poses a risk to its customers .
7 Search.com filed the complaint in US District Court in Illinois .
It seeks unspecified monetary damages and an injunction ordering McAfee 's SiteAdvisor service to designate the site as safe .
SiteAdvisor , which warns users when they are about to visit a site that may pose security threats , currently displays a warning that reads : " Feedback from credible users suggests that downloads on this site may contain what some people would consider adware , spyware , or other potentially unwanted programs . "
7 Search.com insists there are no software downloads available whatsoever on its site and argues the warning amounts to a willful attempt to injure a legitimate business .
" Customers of 7 Search who have opened accounts with 7 Search.com have later terminated that business relationship as a result of seeing McAfee 's false , deceptive , confusing and / or misleading statements and representations about 7Search.com , " the complaint contends .
7 Search was the site that once upon a time offered the much reviled 7FaSST Search Toolbar , which according to analyses such as this was a purported browser accelerator program that in some cases used ActiveX to forcibly install itself on users '
PCs .
Once there , it logged detailed information about user 's browsing habits .
In its complaint , 7 Search says that " Since at least 2003 there have been no direct downloads available on the 7Search.com site . "
What the complaint does n't say is that people who own 7 Search.com have ties to browseraccelerator.com , a site that pushes a browser toolbar that " helps users improve their online experience dramatically by displaying within a browser everything an informed consumer needs to know about the web site being visited . "
Eric
Howes , director of malware research at security provider Sunbelt Software , installed the software on a virtual machine and quickly noticed the software was offering search results that mixed sponsored links from unsponsored links .
" What they 're trying to do is sneak adversing past the user without the user recognizing the search results ... are sponsored , paid - for results , " he said .
He also said the software by no means represented a high risk because it did n't appear to track individual users or forcibly install itself .
Still , he said : " We would probably target it because of the overwhelming presence of advertising . "
Indeed , two Sunbelt products , Viper and CounterSpy , block the installation of the program .
7Search.com 's owner also appears to have ties to validatedsearch.com , a site that competes with McAfee 's SiteAdvisor by providing third - party certification to end users that a given website is trustworthy .
The administrative contact for both sites , as well as browseraccelerator.com is listed as one Patrick Devereaux in Chicago , according to Whois search results .
The viability of lawsuits that take action against anti-malware providers for their warnings has been questioned by some legal experts .
They say a provision in the Communications Decency Act ( CDA ) expressly protects providers of " interactive computer services " who provide services that filter pornography or other potentially unwanted content .
" An anti-spyware vendor saying , ' Do n't go here , but go here instead ' is exactly the kind of filtering decision that the statute was designed to protect , " said Eric Goldman , a professor of law at Santa Clara University .
Indeed , a federal judge recently invoked the CDA in blocking a similar suit crudware maker Zango filed against anti-virus provider Kaspersky .
The decision is now on appeal .
Additionally , Goldman says free speech guarantees likely protect vendors as well .
We sure hope so .
The lawsuits ' outcome will have a profound impact on the protections anti-malware providers are permitted to offer at a time when threats on the internet are skyrocketing .
If they win , we all lose . ®
Update
A McAfee spokesman just issued the following company statement : " SiteAdvisor rates Web sites to make the Web safer to surf .

At times people disagree with our ratings .

NEW YORK  Brett Yormark 's business cards say CEO .
But his DNA calling card reads dealmaker , brand builder , storyteller .
Those DNA strands are a perfect match for this self - described " 24 - 7 " guy 's double - barreled job as CEO of both the New Jersey Nets basketball team and Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment .
" The Nets are my day job .
Brooklyn is my night job , " quips Yormark .
CORPORATE PULSE : Executive Suite index
Two jobs , same employer .
The reason for Yormark 's moonlighting involves a tale of two cities and two arenas .
The Nets are planning a move to Brooklyn , N.Y. , to a new $ 950 million arena , the Barclays Center , designed by a world - renowned architect .
They hope to be in by the start of the 2010 season .
But due to local opposition to the development plans , the groundbreaking for the arena has been delayed .
It 's scheduled for November .
Yormark , 41 , the NBA 's youngest CEO , has a delicate balancing act of filling seats and driving revenue at the Izod Center , the Net 's current home in East Rutherford , N.J. , while also wooing corporate sponsors from around the world and building a new fan base for an arena that does not yet exist .
He is driven to build emotional and financial bridges from New Jersey to Brooklyn .
" Whether it 's at the end of a game or that last sale needed to make the monthly budget , I want the ball .
That 's pretty much been my DNA , " says Yormark , a former high school hoops player and marketing whiz who made his name earlier this decade by revving up NASCAR 's racing brand by brokering a $ 750 million sponsorship deal with Nextel .
On a recent summer day , perched on the 38th floor of a Manhattan skyscraper squeezed between New Jersey to the west and Brooklyn to the east , Yormark , clad in an immaculately tailored grey pinstripe suit , is in the Barclays Center sales center wearing his Brooklyn hat .
He wastes no time launching into his sales pitch .
" We 're building a new Brooklyn , " he says .
He points to the showroom 's walls , which highlight Brooklyn - related factoids .
It 's where playwright Arthur Miller wrote All My Sons .
It 's also the birthplace of ex-Yankees manager Joe Torre and rap star Jay - Z , who is part of the investor group , headed by developer Bruce Ratner , that owns the Nets .
The walls are also graced with sketches of the Barclays Center done by architect Frank Gehry , perhaps best known for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao , Spain .
A video follows , which markets the Barclays Center as a visual landmark on par with top tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower .
Finally , Yormark shows off a replica of the new arena 's luxury suites , which command an average price of $ 300,000 a year .
The swanky suites feature a pool table , stainless steel refrigerator , wet bar , two 52 - inch TVs , and theater - seating for 16 .
The suite tour includes a panoramic view of the arena , replete with the sound of basketballs being dribbled .
" This is what it will truly look like from your seat , " he says .
It 's trademark Yormark .
Detailed .
Passionate .
On message .
" We sell hope and vision , " says Yormark .
" We are in the storytelling business .
When I talk to a sponsorship partner , I say , ' Do you want to be part of the next chapter ? '
If you can get people to imagine , you get them hooked . "
Let 's make a deal Yormark got Barclays , the London - based financial powerhouse , hooked .
In January 2007 , the bank signed a $ 400 million , 20 - year deal to put its name on the new arena .
It was the richest deal ever for arena naming rights .
And it all started with a " cold call " from Yormark , says Gerard LaRocca , chief administrative officer , Americas , for Barclays Capital .
Yormark had been zeroing in on a partner in need of a " game changer , " his parlance for a company that would benefit from taking a bold step to gain a toehold and instant name recognition in the financial capital of the world .
" I got Barclays to think about what it would feel like to own a landmark .
It was a call to action , " says Yormark .
" I thought they were calling about selling us season tickets or a suite , " recalls LaRocca .
" I was surprised the call was from the CEO .
Maybe that 's what prompted me to take the call .
Brett planted the seed .
He found us . "
Yormark stressed to Barclays that the new arena would one day be a landmark that every tourist visiting New York would go to see .
He used CEO - like buzzwords such as " best- in - class " and " street - to - seat hospitality . "
LaRocca acknowledges he envisioned all the press , buzz and fresh eyes on the new arena and the rebirth of sports entertainment in Brooklyn .
After 30 days of negotiating , LaRocca and Yormark announced the deal in January 2007 .
To this day , says LaRocca , " Yormark treats Barclays like he 's still courting us , not like a company that he already signed a deal with . "
An up - tempo game plan Yormark works long and fast , as if he's on a 24 - second shot clock 24 hours a day .
His work ethic is legendary .
Fortune magazine once called him " The Overtime Guy . "
His alarm goes off at 3:45 a.m .
He 's the first guy in the office , getting there by 5 a .m .
" I 'm the one who turns on the lights , " he says .
His secret to success is his " indefatigability , " says NBA Commissioner David Stern .
" He never quits .
He gets up earlier than everyone else and goes to bed later .
During all of his waking hours , he is selling , setting up appointments to sell some more or thinking of something else to sell . "
Yormark regularly zaps e-mails to employees in the wee hours of the morning to " set the tone " for the day .
In a recent e-mail sent out at 6:05 a.m. , he said he " needs everyone pushing at a higher gear " and that " success will require an extra effort . "
Yormark is often dubbed the guy who NASCAR - ized the Nets .
Since joining as CEO 3 ½ years ago , he has used NASCAR 's style of covering every inch of cars and uniforms with sponsors ' messages .
He has put Nets sponsors ' logos on everything from hallways to press releases to dining rooms .
Marc Ganis , president of Sportscorp , a sports business consultant , says Yormark is able to bridge established marketing programs with cutting - edge concepts that work .
" Very few people in the industry can move the needle meaningfully , " says Ganis .
" But he is one of those few . "
Yormark 's goal is to get fans closer to the team and sponsors closer to their customers .
He created a grass - roots season - ticket sales tool by holding backyard barbecues and cocktail parties at homes of existing season - ticket holders to bring together players and prospective ticket buyers .
He has a program that allows prospective season - ticket buyers to watch a Nets away game with ex-Nets stars Darryl Dawkins or Albert King in the coach 's screening room at the team 's practice facility .
He gave his blessing on a season ticket plan that costs fans less than $ 5 a game .
He created the first basketball offseason sponsor arrangement , as well as landing a presenting playoff sponsor for the Nets , even though they did n't make the playoffs last year .
Selling the Nets Two days after touting Brooklyn , Yormark is back in New Jersey , brandishing his Nets CEO business card .
He 's presenting a new deal to a current Nets sponsor .
It 's all about the details .
Charlie Mierswa , the Nets chief financial officer , pops out of his office and says he just got off the phone with season - ticket holders , trying to gauge their interest for the upcoming season .
Mierswa says Yormark has the team 's top executives doing the so - called little things needed for success .
" I do more than just keep the books , " says Mierswa .
The meeting with the sponsor , who asked not to be named due to ongoing negotiations , is not held in some drab conference room .
Instead , Yormark , who is known for selling " access , " has set up this meeting in the Nets locker room .
The jerseys — ( Vince ) Carter 15 , Yi ( Jianlian ) 9 , ( Devin ) Harris 34 — are hanging in their stalls .
Sneakers the size of canoes are visible .
Yormark greets the two executives with bear hugs and handshakes .
He updates them on the personnel changes the Nets experienced over the summer , touting newcomers such as China 's Yi Jianlian .
He tells them they plan to market but not exploit Yi , that they are trying to tap a new fan base : nearly 650,000 Chinese - Americans in the tri-state area .
He mentions that they have already hired a multi-cultural marketing agency , created a Chinese website and hired two Mandarin - speaking salespeople .
Armed with a slide - show presentation , Yormark presents an upgraded sponsorship deal at an Izod Center restaurant , promising personal touches , signage opportunities and VIP treatment .
" We 'll give you the best table in the house , " he says .
When the client says that it would prefer an even more intimate kid- free setting to entertain clients , Yormark quickly counters with an offer of a private room off the main one .
" We 'll rope it off , your clients will be able to have dinner with you at your club . "
He offers the sponsor access to the team during a weekend jaunt to Miami to see a game and travel back on the plane with the players .
Most important , he asks his clients , " Is there anything about last year 's experience that misfired for you ? "
Since taking over in January 2005 , the Nets sponsorship revenue is up 30 % , 100 new sponsors have signed up , and the team has averaged more than 2,000 new full - season tickets .
The art of the deal Sealing the deal is what it 's all about .
" The chase is what gets me up every morning , " he says .
The chase is also about thinking outside the box whenever possible .
When seeking out a beverage sponsor for the Barclays Center , Yormark did n't call Coca - Cola .
He called Jones Soda , a little - known Seattle brand .
Jones got a big - time entrée into the East Coast market .
And the Barclays Center got a company willing to help build its fledgling brand .
Jones has already created a customized soda label with the Barclays Center logo .
Yormark notes that with the Yankees , Mets , Jets and Giants all building new stadiums , he has to be aggressive .
He 's traveled as far as London and Italy for new sponsors for the Barclays Center .
" Everyone is fishing in the same pond for sponsors , " he says .
" My feeling is , ' Why do n't I create my own pond ? ' — and that is what I did . "
He 's off to China next .
Yormark recalls his initial deal with the Nets during his first go - round with the team in the late 1980s .
" On my first day , I sold one of the biggest ticket packages anyone had sold , " he says .
His sales pitch ?
If you want a pair of coveted front - row seats , you 'll also have to buy 50 cheap seats upstairs .
It worked .
Says Yormark : " The guy still sits in the front row , and I visit him every night and shake his hand and thank him for launching my career . "

Another meme from Russia – was very popular those days people were mixing faces to get some other popular face as a result .
Maybe someone would like it too .
As you can see , the McCain campaign is moving ahead with a new stab - in - the - back style attack on Obama over Iraq .
But as Team McCain is raising the volume on these slash - and - burn style attacks , it ’s time for some coverage of the guy who ’s McCain ’s brain on Iraq .
Remember , McCain ’s pitch on Iraq is that he was a critic of Bush , not a supporter , on the poor decisions and lies that got us into the current mess .
In the McCain paradigm , he starts fresh with the ‘ surge ’ .
That ’s where he takes ownership , as it were , of Iraq .
But look who ’s advising him on Iraq , who ’s crafting Iraq policy .
That would be Randy Scheunemann , McCain ’s top foreign policy advisor .
And he ’s the guy who today accused Barack Obama of wanting to lead America to defeat in Iraq for political gain .
Scheunemann was a core participant in the lobbying , plotting and organized campaigns of deception that led America to war in Iraq .
He was a close collaborator with Ahmad Chalabi through the 1990s .
He helped draft the Iraq Liberation Act , which created the new funding stream for Chalabi ’s Iraqi National Congress .
At the start of the Bush administration he signed on as Don Rumsfeld ’s ‘ consultant ’ on Iraq at the Pentagon .
And then when the administration started cranking up the machinery for the propaganda campaign in favor of war he went back on the outside to form and lead the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq , to lead the press and lobbying campaign to make sure the war got started on schedule .
Remember , US intelligence later found evidence that Chalabi , in addition to foisting a bunch of bogus intelligence and lying informers on the US and pocketing a lot of US taxpayer dollars , had provided highly classified US intelligence to Iran .
Scheunemann worked closely with Chalabi for years in his efforts to get the US into war with Iraq .
He was also a go - between between Chalabi and McCain .
Now that he ’s taking such a high - profile role on the Iraq issue in the 2008 , Scheunemann ’s history with Chalabi and the use of bogus intelligence to get the nation into war is unquestionably highly newsworthy .
That sighting came just two hours before helicopter police officers reported an encounter with a huge craft 80 miles away near Cardiff .
They claimed to have given chase to the " flying saucer - shaped " object after it almost collided with their aircraft near the Ministry of Defence base of St Athan .

Once again the Congress has spent time massaging the genitalia of the lobbyist–why not most of the lobbyist were in Congress–just away to pave the road when the present Congress decides to get involved .
The WSJ reported yesterday .
Congress has relaxed rules that would have required public disclosure of contributions and parties paid for by lobbyists , narrowing the scope of new ethics rules intended to draw back the veil on Washington ’s influence game .
New guidance released by Congress late Wednesday exempts lobbyists from reporting their financing of an array of political and charitable contributions , events and parties at political conventions .
The capital ’s lobbying community has been worried about the disclosure requirements because , for the first time , willful violations could carry up to a five - year jail term .
Lobbyists are required to file reports by July 30 .
Now , they wo n’t have to disclose as much .
Under the new guidelines , “ it ’s hard to envision any event at the conventions that would trigger disclosure , ” said Kenneth Gross , an attorney at Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom LLP who advises lobbyists on complying with ethics rules .
“ This relieves lobbyists from tracking and reporting much information about attending or paying for events involving public officials , that would have been required before . ”
So once again the Lobbyist win—
Let the perks fly !

On an afternoon media call Obama advisor Richard Clarke went after John McCain ’s judgment on Iraq and Afghanistan .
He called the Republican quick draw McCain and said that he was reckless , trigger happy , and discredited .
“ When I look at all this it is a little surprising and amazing to me .
If you just take the name John McCain off and describe him and what he said , and if I do n’t tell you it ’s John McCain and if you look at what he said consistently over the last 8 or 9 years and most of us would impartially say that person who I just described in terms of their views was reckless , trigger happy , was discredited was part of the group that got us into the war , ” Clarke said .
Clarke said that McCain wanted a war with Iraq before 9/11 , ” He was before 9/11 calling for doing something militarily about Iraq .
Right after 9/11 when the issue was still up in the air when the Bush administration had not yet decided what to do about Iraq .
He was part of the group that was pushing the Bush administration hard to go to war in Iraq , even though Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 … They were pushing for Ahmed Chalabi to be put in charge of Iraq , even though the CIA was telling anybody would listen that Ahmed Chalabi was a trickster . ”

He also said that McCain was wrong on Afghanistan , “ The fact of the matter is his judgment which is clearly documented on the record about what to do in Iraq was wrong , and it was wrong when he said that we would have a fairly easy victory in Iraq , and linked to that he was wrong about Afghanistan .
He says today that Obama is opposed to the surge that will succeed in Afghanistan .
Excuse me .
It was Obama who suggested that we put more troops into Afghanistan , and he did that on August 7th not of this year , but of last year , and McCain did n’t come around to that view until rather recently .
In fact , McCain had the exact opposite view .
He said in 2003 , “ Nobody in Afghanistan threatens the United States . ”
Is that the judgment of a foreign policy expert ?
Is that the record of somebody who has good judgment on these issues ? ”
Clarke characterized McCain as somebody who is always looking to react with military force , “ I think he has consistently been quick draw McCain .
On every issue his first instinct is to rattle sabers and look for a military solution .
That ’s just not somebody who should be questioning anybody ’s judgment on national security in my view . ”
It is sad that the American people trust an old guy who has his plane shot down four decades ago despite the fact that he has a record of terrible decision making on foreign policy .
The image of McCain as a foreign policy expert has been entirely self created .
McCain is no more a foreign policy expert than George W. Bush , but elections are about image , and McCain presents the image of a foreign policy expert .
The Obama campaign has the option of either bursting that bubble , or adding their own expert to the ticket to negate McCain ’s advantage , and I would not be surprised if they ended up doing both .

We know wind turbines kill birds .
Now a University of Calgary study shows they kill bats in even higher numbers .
And not from collisions but from a sudden drop in air pressure known as barotrauma .
Ninety percent of the bats examined post mortem showed signs of internal hemorrhaging consistent with barotrauma from the turbine blades .
Only about half showed any evidence of direct contact with the blades .
Because they echolocate , bats seldom collide with manmade structures .
But an atmospheric - pressure drop at wind - turbine blades is undetectable .
And because they ’re mammals , they die more than birds from barotrauma .
Their balloon - like lungs have two - way airflow and flexible sacs surrounded by capillaries .
When external pressures drop , the sacs overexpand and burst the capillaries .
Bird lungs are more rigid with a one - way circular airflow and withstand pressure drops better .
Bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities and the majority of bats killed are migratory species that roost in trees — including hoary bats , eastern red bats , and silver - haired bats .
Little is known about their population sizes .
But wind turbines could devastate them .
. .
Simple solution .
Do n’t run the turbines at night .
And for the sake of birds - of - prey , do n’t run them during peak migrations .

When McCain said during the debate that Ronald Reagan refused to negotiate with the Soviets until Gorbachev has instituted reforms , McCain had the facts and the truth exactly backwards .
Shortly after the attempted assassination of Reagan — shortly after he assumed office — Reagan wrote a personal plea to Leonid Brezhnev calling for a new era of reconciliation and hoping for diplomatic negotiations to achieve it .
I am linking here a story from Time magazine that includes the first draft of the letter Reagan wrote to Brezhnev , in his own handwriting , with his plea for negotiations .
John McCain simply does not know what he is talking about .
In fact , not only did Reagan write to Brezhnev in his own handwriting , not only did Reagan send a final version of the letter that was released in 1990 , Reagan said , famously , that he wanted diplomacy to improve relations but Soviet leaders kept dying on him before he could achieve it .

Man Dies After Taking 23 Shots in 30 Mins. Eric Morris , 26 , collapsed after drinking 23 shots in a half hour , police say .
June 27 , 2008  --
A Florida man died Tuesday after taking more than two dozen shots of cherry vodka within a half hour , according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff 's office .
" We have witnesses that have described the victim as taking anywhere from 23 to 25 shots in 30 minutes , " Hillsborough County Sheriff 's spokesman J.D. Callaway told ABCNEWS.com .
Eric Morris , 26 , was allegedly taking part in a drinking game with another patron at an adult nightclub , Angels Show Bar , in Seffner , Fla. , just hours before he died , according to police .
" Apparently [ other bar patrons ] were describing the shots as ' cherry bombs , ' " said Callaway , referring to a shot of liquor that is typically made by combining cherry - flavored vodka with Red Bull , a popular energy drink .
While Morris ' drinking buddy , who police declined to identify , stopped playing the game after a few shots , Morris kept going .
" Witnesses told us that the bartender kept setting up glasses of shots for [ Morris ] and then for whatever reason decided at shot glass 24 or 25 that she was n't going to serve him anymore , " Callaway said .
The manager at Angels Show Bar reached by ABCNEWS.com declined to comment until a full autopsy had been performed .
Moments after being refused more alcohol , Morris staggered away from the bar where he had been drinking and collapsed , according to police .
After failed attempts to resuscitate the 6 - foot - 4 , 210 pound man , patrons called 911 and Morris was transported to a local hospital where he died at around 7 p.m. , just two hours after police estimate the partying began .
Callaway told ABCNEWS.com that Morris had at one time been employed by the bar as a bouncer , a job his sister , Jacqui Morris , told a local newspaper was his way of getting back on his feet after a rough couple of months .
Morris had spent seven months in jail on theft and burglary charges , according to the Florida Department of Corrections records obtained by ABCNEWS.com .
Jacqui Morris told the St. Petersburg
Times that she thinks her brother kept taking shots to prove his endurance — a quality coveted in their family , she said .
" It 's just because we had to be tough , " Jacqui Morris , 27 , told the newspaper .
" We were raised to be tough . "
And while police say there is no legal limit to how much liquor a bar can serve a patron , Morris ' sister is certain he was overserved .
" They should have cut him off after the first five , " she said .
Eric Morris ' adoptive mother , Vicki Morris , told ABCNEWS.com that her son , who she adopted when he was 10 , was a " very sweet boy . "
" He was a great kid , " she said , in tears .

The object is lit up by a long - dead quasar A new class of cosmic object has been found by a Dutch schoolteacher , through a project which allows the public to take part in astronomy research online .
Hanny Van Arkel , 25 , came across the strange gaseous blob while using the Galaxy Zoo website to help classify galaxies in telescope images .
Astronomers subsequently confirmed that the object was one - of - a- kind .
The work has been submitted to the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
The object quickly became known as " Hanny's Voorwerp " - Voorwerp being the Dutch word for " object " .
The Voorwerp is a massive ' light echo ' produced as the light strikes the gas
Dr Chris Lintott , University of Oxford Researchers think this green blob got its energy from light emitted by a quasar ( a powerful radiation source powered by a supermassive black hole ) that has since gone dim .
They think the quasar was hosted in a nearby spiral galaxy called IC 2497 .
It was so bright that , if the quasar was still active , it would be visible from Earth with binoculars .
However , because of the distance between the galaxy and the Voorwerp , light from the quasar would have taken tens of thousands of years to reach the gaseous blob .
This is why the Voorwerp is still bright despite the quasar having now shut off .
" The quasar itself is no longer visible to us , but its light continues to travel through space and the Voorwerp is a massive ' light echo ' produced as the light strikes the gas , " Dr Chris Lintott , from Oxford University , explained .
Unique object Smaller light echos have been noted around exploding stars , or supernovas , but never on this scale .
Dr Lintott said the object was the only one of its type known to astronomers , though other Voorwerpen could still be awaiting identification .
He added that the object had been catalogued before , but its significance had only been recognised when it was brought to the attention of Galaxy Zoo team members by Ms Van Arkel .
Ms Van Arkel was an astronomy novice before taking part in Galaxy Zoo Ms Van Arkel , from Heerlen , near Maastricht , told BBC News she had no background in astronomy .
She said her interest in music had led her to the book Bang !
The Complete History of the Universe , co-written by Queen guitarist Brian May with BBC Sky at Night presenters Chris Lintott and Sir Patrick Moore .
This in turn had encouraged her to get involved in the Galaxy Zoo project , which has just been given three more years of funding .
After failing to match the object to any galaxy types described in the Galaxy Zoo classification tutorial , she e-mailed the site 's webmaster .
This alerted team members who subsequently examined the images themselves .
Death of a quasar
This prompted observations of the Voorwerp by scientists using the Isaac Newton Group of telescopes in La Palma , Spain , and the Swift space telescope .
Dr Lintott said team members had booked follow - up observations of the Voorwerp with the Hubble Space Telescope .
But they will have to wait for the orbiting observatory to be upgraded during a space shuttle servicing mission currently scheduled for October .
High - resolution imaging of the object could reveal whether the quasar darkened quickly or over a longer period of time .
Team members would also like to look at the object at infrared wavelengths .
It is unclear why black holes turn off , but the phenomenon was previously known from studying populations of active galaxies .
However , Dr Lintott said this could be the first time astronomers have been able to pinpoint one that was once active and has since shut down , using the light echo from a long - dead quasar .
As for what the Voorwerp itself is , the possibilities include a galaxy that has not produced any stars bright enough to be viewed from Earth .
But astronomers are stumped about the hole in its middle .
It could have been made when a jet of particles , travelling at near light - speed from the nucleus of IC 2497 , punched through the gaseous blob .
But this remains highly speculative .
The green colour of the Voorwerp is caused by ionised oxygen .
During the last year , 50 million classifications of galaxies have been submitted on one million objects at galaxyzoo.org by more than 150,000 amateur astronomers from all over the world .
The next stage of the project will ask volunteers for more detailed classifications , making it easier to identify more unusual objects such as Hanny 's Voorwerp .

American Red Cross spokesman Peter Teahan says the charity is expecting to house 500,000 people in shelters , as Hurricane Gustav heads for the US coast .
A Southern California man who already served federal time for hacking into Lexis - Nexis has begun a state prison term for allegedly using his skills to try and extort phone sex from an internet celebrity .
Jeffrey Robert Weinberg , 23 , pleaded no contest to a single count of computer intrusion in May , and was sentenced to two years in prison .
He was transferred to California 's Tehachapi state prison on Thursday .
Cyberstalking victim Amor Hilton , the teenage hostess of the Stickam show Bare Naked .
Image : Hilton 's MySpace profileWeinberg was arrested by LAPD detectives in Southern California in January , following a weeks - long police investigation aided by victim Amor Hilton – a teenage MySpace user who had a popular video streaming show on Stickam.com .
According a blog post by Hilton prior to Weinberg 's arrest , she found herself locked out of her MySpace account on December 28 , the same day she began receiving harassing phone calls from a hacker calling himself " V.I.P. " – a handle used by Weinberg in the past .
The calls continued over the course of several days , and often took a threatening tone , she says .
During that time , the hacker allegedly disconnected Hilton 's cellphone account , and took over her account on Stickam .
He allegedly demanded phone sex and nude photos from Hilton .
Hilton reported the harassment to the police , and recorded one of the phone calls .
Weinberg was arrested after Hilton matched his mug shot to a photo the hacker had sent her .
A charge of attempted extortion , and four other charges , were dropped in the plea deal .
But when his state prison term ends , Weinberg is expected to be transferred to federal custody for a hearing on whether he violated the conditions of his supervised release .
Weinberg was sentenced ( .pdf ) to 10 months in prison in December 2006 for hacking the Lexis - Nexis owned consumer database Accurint , and was released last November to begin three years of federal supervised release .
Under the conditions of his supervision , he had to submit to random inspections of his computer hard drive , and was forbidden from possessing or using encryption software , among other restrictions .
Committing a new crime is also considered a violation .
" What happens is , after he does his two years state prison , which starts from the time I arrested him in January , then he has to go … face the judge for his violation of federal probation , " says LAPD Detective Eric Jones .
" They wo n't do that until he 's just about ready to get out of federal prison . "

TBILISI ( Reuters ) - Russia announced it would begin withdrawing forces from Georgia on Monday after a war that dealt a humiliating blow to the Black Sea state and raised fears for energy supplies to Europe .
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , whose failed invasion of the pro-Russian breakaway region of South Ossetia triggered a Russian backlash that shocked the West , called for international monitoring of the pullout .
“ I think the world should watch , ” he told a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Tbilisi .
Merkel said the world would indeed be watching for Russia to withdraw quickly under the terms of a six - point peace plan brokered by France .
The United States , which has warned Moscow its military actions in the former Soviet republic could seriously damage relations with the West , urged Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to withdraw troops quickly .
“ This time I hope he means it , ” U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” .
“ The word of the Russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if Russia can be trusted . ”
Moscow has given no firm deadline for its complete withdrawal .
A statement from the Kremlin read : “ From tomorrow ( Monday ) , Russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce Russian peacekeepers after the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia . ”
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Russia must withdraw “ without delay ” , adding that he would call European Union leaders to an extraordinary summit on the crisis if the peace deal were not respected “ rapidly and totally ” .
LOOTING
Underlining continued high tension , Russia ’s Defence Ministry said Georgia was planning a “ major provocative act ” in the city of Gori , captured by Russian forces on Tuesday as they fanned out from the disputed region into the Georgian heartland .
It said Georgia was forming bands of mercenaries who would be given Russian uniforms and told to loot and pillage .
Georgia issued a swift denial .
“ Such a provocation would only be staged by the Russian side , with the aim of keeping Russian military units in the conflict zone , ” the Georgian Interior Ministry said in a statement .
A United Nations aid convoy which entered Gori on Sunday reported evidence of large - scale looting .
“ While the buildings did not appear to be very damaged , there are clear signs of massive looting of both shops and private accommodations , ” the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said .
Russian troops remained in position around Gori , which commands the approaches to South Ossetia and the main east - west highway and should be central to covering a Russian withdrawal .

Major - General Vyacheslav Borisov , now a familiar figure touring the area of his command around Gori in a Georgian four - wheel drive , could not say when he would be moving out .
“ We were the first in , so we ’ll be the last out , ” Borisov told Reuters at the roadside near Gori .
There was no sign of shooting and troops appeared relaxed .

NATO MEMBERSHIP
A Georgian official accused Russian forces of destroying Georgian television and radio transmitters in the Gori region and installing their own .
Each side has accused the other of attempted genocide .
Russia says some 1,600 people were killed in the initial Georgian shelling of the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali while Georgia accuses Russian and irregular forces of leveling Georgian villages around Tskhinvali .
The 10 - day confrontation killed around 200 Georgians , dealt a crushing blow to the country ’s military , damaged its economy , disrupted road and rail links and drew criticism in the West of Saakashvili ’s handling of the crisis .
The Russian action rattled the West , which transports oil and gas from the Caspian region through pipelines across Georgian territory , a route favored because it bypasses Russia .
Some saw dark portents in Russia launching its first invasion of a former Soviet state .
Russia argued it was justified in intervening to protect South Ossetians , but Moscow also suffered losses , both human and economic .
The campaign sent Russian stocks tumbling to their lowest in nearly two years and worried foreign investors .
Russia has made clear it sees no prospect in the foreseeable future of South Ossetia being reintegrated into Georgia .
Talks are under way to establish international agreement on a peacekeeping force , which seems likely , whatever Georgia ’s objections , to include a large Russian contingent .
Merkel , in remarks likely to irk the Kremlin , reiterated the prospect of NATO membership for Georgia , which as a Soviet republic housed Moscow ’s frontline radar and missile defenses .
“ In December we will have a first evaluation of the situation and we are on a clear path in the direction of NATO membership , ” she said .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told CNN Georgian NATO membership was “ very much still on the table ” .
PC piracy has always been a hot - button topic .
Most recently , it was Crytek CEO Cevat Yurli who said his game Crysis had a 20 - 1 ratio of pirated versus purchased copies .
For Yurli , the answer to the issue of piracy is to abandon PC exclusivity altogether .
BioWare believes they have a different answer .
That answer would be to actively engage the consumer in the game and provide content to continue to serve the consumer .
Multiplayer recently had a talk with BioWare co-CEO Ray Muzyka about the rampancy of PC piracy and how to avoid it if at all possible .
To this , Muzyka stated :
We think it ’s a good thing to encourage players to make them want to buy a PC title .
That ’s ultimately the best , most successful path to prevent piracy is to have players that want your games , want to believe in them and think they ’re high - quality and realize they ’re going to get a lot of value out of them as platforms for long time afterwards .
Unfortunately , this may not be as rosy as it all seems .
had some hiccups with the copy protection , as it went from bad to still bad when EA postulated quite loudly to consumers about what exactly to do with the title .
Also , content costs money just like games do .
While I would love to sit back and say that this would fix the issue , I wonder what exactly DLC or quality is going to do to fix this matter .
Muzyka ’s comments are a welcome addition to the dialogue , but I ’m afraid it will fall on deaf ears .
Murdoch plans six new Indian regional TV channels
MUMBAI ( AFP )  Media mogul Rupert Murdoch on Monday announced plans to launch six new regional television channels in India , where the media is expanding at a frenetic pace .
Murdoch has a strong television presence in Asia 's third - largest economy through leading broadcaster Star , a wholly owned subsidiary of the tycoon 's News Corp .
" The investments will be in the region of 100 million dollars and we will launch in the next 12 months , " Murdoch told reporters in India 's business capital , declining to give further financial details .
Murdoch , who is on a four - day India visit , earlier met Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and government officials in New Delhi .
He was in Mumbai to meet business and media figures .
The chief executive of Australian - based News Corp said he had no immediate plans to invest in India 's print media .
Star operates 14 TV channels in India offering entertainment , sports and news programming .
" We do n't see ourselves taking a stake in print because they are not available and because we do n't want to take just a 26 percent stake , " Murdoch said .
India 's government caps foreign ownership in Indian print media at 26 percent .
In India , financial daily Mint , part of the Hindustan Times media group , has a tie - up with the Wall Street Journal , which is owned by Murdoch .
The media in India has been expanding at an exponential rate with new television channels , magazines and newspapers debuting almost monthly .
Driving the media boom in the country of more than one billion people is an economy that has grown by at least nine percent for the past three years , pushing up incomes and creating a surge in advertising .
Blizzard Confirms Unannounced Fourth Game , Next - Gen MMO Not Diablo 3
" There is still one unknown project , " Blizzard executive VP Rob Pardo revealed to OnlineWelten during the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational .
" We have another development team . "
Pardo affirmed that Blizzard 's recent job listings for an " unannounced next - gen MMO " were not related to Diablo III .
The company had previously stated that the project was not a World of Warcraft expansion either .
Fans have long speculated that Blizzard may follow the ultra-successful World of Warcraft with a World of StarCraft MMO .
The three - faction scenario and multi- world setting would seem to lend itself well to the MMO format .
Others believe that the project could be a new franchise , as Blizzard has not created a new property since StarCraft 's release in 1998 .
" The idea of a new franchise is very intriguing to employees of the company , " said Blizzard chief operating officer Paul Sams to Gamasutra in a recent interview .
" Are we ever going to release a new one ?
I would absolutely say we will at some point .
I just do n't know when that day will be quite yet . "
And as for a release date on any of the three known titles ?
" We ship the games when they 're ready , " Pardo commented .
" You guys know this . "
An Angolan Catholic bishop and 50 African pilgrims heading for Australia have discovered too late that Adelaide is not a suburb of Sydney .

They have each paid $ 3800 to fly to Sydney , believing their onward journey to Adelaide would be a formality .
Over the past few months we ’ve noticed quite a bit of interest in geothermal heating and cooling amongst our site visitors , and in particular in geothermal heat pumps .
We ’ve also had many questions from people about exactly what they are and how / if they should consider them as an eco- friendly heating / cooling option .
If this describes you , then read on – these systems ARE incredibly promising technologies to heat and cool your home , but they ’re also more complicated than your typical AC or furnace unit .
We ’ll try to help clear the air !
We get into quite a bit of detail below , but before you get into that here ’s a very quick summary of geothermal heat pumps :
Geothermal ( or ground source ) heat pumps can be incredibly efficient , delivering 3 - 6 x as much energy for heating and cooling as you use to power the equipment ;
They are in some ways a renewable energy system , since they use the heat contained in the earth to provide heating / cooling ;
They do require extensive installation work , including excavation or drilling to install subsurface pipes ; and
They are more expensive than traditional heating / cooling equipment , but the payback period is less than five years almost everywhere in the country due to their greater efficiency .
What is a Heat Pump ?
First things first , though : what exactly is a heat pump ?
Well , just like it sounds , a heat pump moves heat from one place to another rather than creating heat or cooling by burning a fuel ( like a furnace or boiler ) .
They do this by taking advantage of the fact that liquid refrigerants absorb huge amounts of heat when they turn into gas via evaporation , and release that same heat when they are condensed back into liquids .
The most common kind of heat pump , called an air - source heat pump , uses the energy in outdoor air to heat and cool .
To cool a warm space , a heat pump evaporates the liquid refrigerant in copper coils indoors and condenses it ( via a compressor ) in similar coils outdoors .
To heat a cold room , a valve is activated that reverses the process : the gaseous refrigerant is condensed indoors where it gives off heat , and it evaporates in the outdoor coils , picking up heat from outdoors in the process .
Air conditioners and refrigerators use the same exact process to deliver their cooling performance .
Why are they such great heating and cooling options ?
For one , heat pumps can be incredibly efficient : because they move rather than create heat , they can often deliver 3 - 4 x more energy into your home than you use to power the heat pump ( high efficiency air conditioners have the same benefit ) .
Unlike air conditioners , heat pumps also provide both heating and cooling , meaning you do n’t need two separate systems that only get used for half the year .
With all of these benefits , you might expect to see air source heat pumps everywhere , so what ’s the catch ?
Well , because they are more complicated than typical air conditioners and furnaces , they ’re a bit more expensive up front .
And , they work best in relatively moderate and humid climates : the greater the difference between the indoor and outdoor temperatures , the harder they have to work .
Once outdoor temperatures drop below 40 degrees or so , heat pumps are no longer efficient as heaters and you need some kind of auxiliary heating .
In very hot climates with low heating needs , air source heat pumps are no more efficient than air conditioners but are more expensive .
The Joys of Geothermal
Fortunately , there ’s a great way around these limitations on traditional air source heat pumps .
In even the most extreme climate regions , the temperature several feet underground is between 45 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit .
Enter the geothermal heat pump ( also called GeoExchange heat pumps and ground source heat pumps ) .
These heat pumps circulate a fluid through piping buried in the ground , discharging heat to the ground in summer and pulling it from the ground in winter .
The heat pump coils are in contact with this fluid rather than the outside air as in a standard heat pump , thereby avoiding the huge temperature swings of our atmosphere .
Geothermal heat pumps can be incredibly efficient , delivering from 3 - 6 x the amount of energy used to power the pump ’s compressor and fans / pumps .
There are several options for installing a ground source heat pump .
The choice of which one makes sense in your area involves many factors , such as how much land you have available , what the underground conditions are like , and the skill / experience of installers in your area .
As you scan these options you might think “ wow , these must be expensive ! ” , but due to the incredible energy efficiency of these systems payback periods can often be less than five years .
Installation Options
The most cost - effective option for residential applications is called closed loop horizontal installation .
In this type of installation , plastic pipe is laid in horizontal trenches at least four feet deep .
The pipes can be installed straight or in loops resembling a big Slinkly – this requires deeper but shorter trenches , which can help in smaller yards .
For a typical home , you might have to install 1,000 – 2,000 feet of tubing / piping , so this is n’t a small project !
A second option is called the closed loop vertical system , in which u-shaped sections of pipe are installed in borings drilled 150 + feet deep .
These systems are more expensive because of the drilling costs , but they can be used in tighter places or where the soil is very rocky or difficult to dig in .
Vertical systems have been employed in areas as densely populated as New York City .
A final common option is referred to as an open loop system .
Here the heat exchange is done via groundwater withdrawn from a well rather than through a closed loop of piping .
Heat is transferred from the water to the building via the heat pump , and then the water is reinjected into the groundwater aquifer via a second well some distance away .
This can be the easiest approach from a technical standpoint ( and can work in dense urban areas as well ) , but it can introduce some permitting hassles in areas where groundwater is used for drinking or is tightly regulated .
There are some other options ( such as using a lake or pond as your heat source ) , but the three above are the most common options in most residential situations .
There are also some interesting innovations in the technology of the heat pump equipment itself ( such as using the waste heat for hot water , hooking the heat pump up to in - floor radiant heating systems , and other higher - tech approaches ) , but we ’ll cover those in a separate posting .
Geothermal Heat Pumps Near You
Clearly , finding a contractor skilled in this type of system is critical !
We have a directory of geothermal heat pump installers around the country here .
If you do n’t find any in your area , then check out the installer lists provided by some of the top heat pump manufacturers :
Oh , one more thing to note .
A geothermal heat pump is NOT the same as geothermal heating , where you heat your house directly using hot water pulled from deep underground .
There are n’t that many parts of the country with the necessary underground geothermal energy to do this ( primarily in the West ) , and even in these places almost all systems are commercial - scale operations .
So if you ’re thinking of harnessing the earth ’s energy for your heating / cooling needs , most likely a geothermal heat pump is the way to go !
Predator and Prey Become Best Mates in China
Who says that a predator and prey cannot be best mates ?
For about 4 months now , ZhengZhou ’s North Gate birds market in China has housed an interesting duo .
Initially meant to be food for the young eagle , the rabbit was tossed into a Chinese professional eagle trainer ’s cage , but the eagle was too young and ended up befriending the rabbit instead of eating it .
The two get along great and the rabbit will even clean the eagle ’s feathers from time to time , which the eagle seems to appreciate .
That ’s one lucky rabbit …

Microsoft should " put more emphasis on the Windows operating system , " Blizzard Entertainment COO Paul Sams recently told Gamasutra .
" Their gaming focus is very much on the [ Xbox ] 360 .
And that makes sense , cause they 're a hardware manufacturer as well as a software developer , " Sams pointed out .
Sams ' words follow closely on the heels of comments made by Blizzard president Rob Pardo , who spoke out about this topic at the recent Game Developers Conference in Paris : " They have their own game system now , so I do n't think it 's really in their best interest to support [ PC gaming ] . "
Both Sams and Pardo make an excellent point :
How can ( and more importantly , why would )
Microsoft devote enough resources and manpower to promote gaming on the PC when they are directly competing with the platform via the Xbox 360 ?

To make good on his offer to help Chicago combat violence , Gov. Blagojevich envisions putting speed cameras on interstates across Illinois — and using the revenue to form an “ elite tactical team ” that would operate in Chicago and other cities .
The idea is in its infancy , with no budget and no timetable .
But the governor also is providing Chicago with immediate assistance , said Lucio Guerrero , a spokesman for the governor .
About 50 Illinois State Police employees have been assigned to work with Chicago Police on everything from tracking down illegal gun buyers to hunting for criminals on Chicago ’s expressways , Guerrero said .

ESTEEMED Vladimir Vladimirovich !
As director of the operational task - force of the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation , I present my compliments to you personally at the conclusion of the initial military - political phase of Operation “ Return ” .
The penetration by this service and its sister organisations of decision - making structures in the enemy camp has long given us advance warning of European Union and NATO plans , and a substantial ability to influence them .
Even we , however , did not expect such torpor and weakness from the enemy .
We see empty words but no readiness for serious resistance .
Indeed , some western commentators and politicians have praised our actions as justified , including in some cases those who have received no payment or other inducements .
We can proceed confidently .
As we underline the disadvantages of bad relations and highlight the advantages of good ones , our main ally is the electoral cycle .
Voters , politicians and other decision - makers will become increasingly aware that if they resist us , they will pay a heavy price ; but if they cooperate , they will benefit .

His Georgian adventure
We will extend the intimidation , harassment and expropriation of British , American , Polish and Czech companies active in our domestic market and as energy customers , while at the same time offering further preferential treatment to those from countries that are politically friendly , especially France , Italy and Germany .
Are big European companies willing to sacrifice billions of euros in lost exports or higher energy costs by indulging their politicians ' desire to grandstand and moralise ?
We think not .
We should visibly intensify our activity in non-western financial centres , chiefly Dubai , Mumbai and Shanghai , to show western capital markets , particularly London and New York , the loss of business that they face by their governments ' intransigent behaviour .
Similarly , the next American president will face a stark choice between the imminent prospect of a nuclear - armed Iran or the wasting asset of involvement in a Europe that does not wish to defend itself .
The electoral cycle in the enemy camp in coming months should deliver great victories to our side : by the year - end we expect Ukraine and Lithuania to abandon the enemy camp .
But plans for further escalation are ready as needed .
In Crimea , Islamic extremists , guided by our colleagues in Teheran and Damascus , can attack Russian passport - holders .
The Ukrainian authorities , partly due to their own incompetence and partly thanks to our disruptive activities , will be unable to stop these atrocities .
Our agents in the local population can therefore set up armed self - defence militias .
These will clash with the Ukrainian police and army .
Our forces can then intervene as peacekeepers , recreating the scenario that has played out so successfully in Georgia .
In the Baltic , provocations will be by nationalist hooligan gangs , supposedly acting as patriots , demanding ethnic cleansing of all Russian - speakers from Estonia and Latvia .

Dear friends and supporters ,
I 've compiled the following chronology of the assaults made against me and my work since 1993 , because of my relentless pursuing of the truth about crimes against aboriginal and poor people in Canada .
I hope you 'll not only circulate and cite this Chronology to others , but will support the call being made to Amnesty International to adopt me as a Prisoner of Conscience , and will support me in other ways so that the evidence and truth will not be buried .
with my thanks ,

Scientists are not sure when this extinction crisis began — it could have started 10,000 years ago , or during the industrial revolution , or this century .
But we are definitely seeing an extinction " spasm " right now , say the Berkeley scientists , especially among our clammy , froggy friends .
This extinction is unlike the five that came before it , according to the paper 's authors from UC Berkeley , because it has nothing to do with any asteroid impact , or volcanic surge , or great sea cooling .
Instead , it may have almost everything to do with us .
Amphibians made it through last time , when the dinosaurs disappeared .
But with new , people - driven pressures on biodiversity , the survivors are now some of the most vulnerable .
Companies throughout the food chain are changing the way they do business in response to soaring grain costs , and consumers are likely to bear the brunt in the form of rising food prices .
Farmers are making the broadest cuts to their livestock herds in decades , meaning meat at the supermarket will likely cost more in coming years .
Middlemen are trying to shorten the duration of supply contracts to 90 days from one year so they can pass on higher costs more quickly .
And food brands are shrinking the contents of their packages , ...
Yesterday , while I was chatting with my girlfriend , she says , out of the blue , “ So what ’s your favorite superhero ? ” I had no idea what for .
It turns out she was reading an online Cosmo article called What His Favorite Superhero Reveals .
After she forwarded me a link , I browsed the article and came to the conclusion that the writer , Christie Griffin , was writing an article that was way out of her league .
It was a very amateurish understanding of pop psychology and a very tenuous grasp on superheroes .
Not that I blame her .
I ’m guessing she drew the short straw , while her co-workers got to write “ 8 Ways to Make A Man Notice Your Facelift ” or “ 12 Secrets to a Newer You . ”
I can imagine her boss trying to cheer her up .
“ This article ’s going to be boffo !
Superheroes are the hot thing !
You ’re going to make this magazine Megabucks !
MEGABUCKS ! ”
So , yeah , it ’s a puff piece .
But I ’m going to help out Christie with her mission anyways : to educate female readers the mysteries of their man based on their favorite heroes !
Who he worships : Superman
What it reveals :
Your man is not really into superheroes in the first place .
He was totally caught off guard by your question .
He probably just waved his hand and just half - heartedly said , “ Um… Superman , ” did n’t he ?
Anyway , that ’s not a bad sign .
He ’s probably into far more manly things than some adolescent power fantasy .
It probably means he ’s handy around the house .
Either that or he spends his days with a cold one in his hands and watching college football all day .
Who he worships : Batman
What it reveals :
This is a tricky one .
If your man is into the Adam West 60 ’s Batman , chances are your man is a funny , if corny , guy .
He probably lies to collect kitsch antiques and Transformers and other junk .
Be careful : his house is likely to be messy and stinking of modeling paint .
If your man is into the post - Dark Knight Returns Batman , he ’s probably a bit of a metrosexual .
Batman is like the James Bond of the superhero set : sauve , mysterious , and into the color black .
Ms. Griffin is on the spot at this analysis by the way : Batman fans usually are loners .
But are n’t most superhero fans ?
Who he worships : Spider - Man
What it reveals :
Your man is likely to be a generally pleasant guy .
He admires Spider - Man because of his somewhat carefree attitude .
Spidey is always pulling some crazy stunts , like swinging from building to building and rattling off snarky one - liners .
Your man is also the kind to settle down .
Untle recently , the Peter Parker - Mary Jane dynamic was the most stable marriage in all of comic books .
( Damn you , Joe Quesada ! )
He ’s friendly , down to earth , and ready to watch a chick - flick DVD with you even though you know that he really does n’t care for Steel Magnolias .
Who he worships : Iron Man
What it reveals :
The guy ’s all about the bling - bling , baby .
He fitted his car with gold spinners even though he does n’t have the money , did n’t he ?
Probably drives an Escalade , too .
This guy is boisterous and is n’t shy about flashing off his gaudy jewelry .
When you ride in his car , he ’s got the bass cranked up to the max .
There ’s also a good chance that your man is really Ghostface Killah .
Score !
Who he worships : Aquaman
What it reveals :
Your man is a liar .
No one loves Aquaman .
Who he worships : Sandman / Morpheus
What it reveals :
Your man likes to be nonconformist , so he mentions a character that barely qualifies to be a superhero .
Also , he ’s a sensitive soul .
He likes to read a lot of dark fantasy written by Michael Moorcock or H.P. Lovercraft .
He is a huge fan of indie music .
He might have a DeviantArt account somewhere .
Also , he ’s probably under 25 .
You might want to know this is you ’re uncertain of his age , since his face is coated with foundation and all .
Who he worships : Green Arrow
What it reveals : Green Arrow is a minor DC character , so it shows that your man has an appreciation for the underdog .
Arrow is also very opinionated on several matters , including social and political .
While your man might strike others as brash , he ’s really very idealistic and has strong beliefs .
Be patient with him when he rails against either the liberal media or America ’s growing imperialism .
Who he worships : Wolverine
What it reveals :
You ’d think you should be afraid of a guy who likes Logan , but you should n’t .
Frankly , Logan ’s been portrayed as a grumpy guy with a heart of gold as of late .
Your man is a bit standoffish , and he may be a little coarse sometimes , but that what you love about him .
You know that smoldering under that gruff exterior , he ’s a loyal man and an excellent lover .
Hey , I just realized Wolverine is comicdom ’s Mr. Darcy !
How about that .
Who he worships : Rob Liefeld ’s Bloodwulf
What it reveals :
Your boyfriend is a serial killer .
Get away from him AS SOON AS POSSIBLE .
In a new sign of increasing inequality in the U.S. , the richest 1 % of Americans in 2006 garnered the highest share of the nation 's adjusted gross income for two decades , and possibly the highest since 1929 , according to Internal Revenue Service data .
Meanwhile , the average tax rate of the wealthiest 1 % fell to its lowest level in at least 18 years .
The group 's share of the tax burden has risen , though not as quickly as its share of income .

The family of a 46 - year - old Mesa woman is suing Sheriff Joe Arpaio over the head - on collision that caused her death last June .
Nanuma Lavulavu was killed when Maricopa County Sheriff 's Deputy Robin Kinnett lost control of his SUV and crashed into her car .
As the lawsuit alleges , " The head - on collision and the death of Nanuma Lavulavu were the direct and proximate result of the negligence , carelessness , and recklessness of Defendant Kinnett . "
Kind of interesting in light of the fact that Sheriff Joe never even reprimanded the deputy for his actions .
And , go figure , illegal immigration is involved .
Here 's the background : Kinnett had been tailing another person at the time , an illegal immigrant who was driving drunk and , apparently , intentionally rammed Kinnett 's car , setting off the tragic chain of events .
Thanks to an incendiary column by the Arizona Republic 's Laurie Roberts , the incident was immediately portrayed as a frightening example of undocumented Mexicans running amok .
( The Republic 's archives do n't go back far enough to read Roberts ' piece , but it 's been reprinted in its entirety here . )
The problem is , as I pointed out in a column of my own last July , the case was much more complicated than Roberts ' portrayal .
The sheriff 's own report , in fact , made it clear that Deputy Kinnett showed alarmingly bad judgment :
After he was rammed by the Mexican driver he was tailing , Kinnett did n't pull over or call for help .
Instead , he did a quick u-turn and re-entered a busy intersection , speeding through three lanes of traffic .
It was only then that the Mexican driver struck Kinnett a second time -- at which point , according to the report , Deputy Kinnett last control of his vehicle and slammed into oncoming traffic , killing Lavulavu .
And , of course , only then did Deputy Kinnett get around to calling 911 .
By then it was too late for Lavulavu .
Roberts blamed the entire incident on the Mexican , Guadalupe Perez - Bojorquez .
Lavulavu , she wrote , joins " a long , sad parade of people killed because our government can't or wo n't do what it takes to get control of the border . "
Not really .
In fact , you could easily argue that Lavulavu joins a long , sad parade of people killed because Sheriff Joe can't or wo n't get control of his own department .
The East Valley Tribune recently ran a fascinating five - part series detailing Arpaio 's dicey techniques for busting immigrants .
Among other revelations :
When deputies want to stop a suspected illegal on the road , they " pressure " the illegal -- in the newspaper 's words -- into making a driving mistake .
Here 's an example from part one of the Tribune series :
" Detective Jesus J. Cosme pressed hard on the gas pedal so that only a couple of feet separated his sport utility vehicle from the van he was tailing .
The navy blue Chrysler was n’t speeding .
Or weaving .
Its tail lights worked and the Oregon license plate was clearly displayed .
Driving through Wickenburg on U.S. 93 one evening in early January , Cosme said he was certain illegal immigrants filled the van .
" But the human smuggling detective could not yet prove it .
So Cosme pressured the driver .
" He raced up behind the van in his unmarked silver Jeep Commander , waiting for a mistake , for any probable cause to make a stop ...
" Cosme would ultimately use an alleged moving violation as his probable cause on that January evening .
But first he needed to make sure the blue van was indeed what he was after .
" Abruptly , the detective swerved into the left lane and , coming frighteningly close to the vehicle , used his front beams like search lights on the van ’s windows , illuminating a crowd of human shadows .
The detective switched on his dashboard ’s emergency lights .
The sheriff ’s office had caught another load vehicle . "
Coming " frighteningly close " to the vehicle ?
Or , as the Trib reporters write , " pressuring " the driver ?
Makes me wonder what really started the road - rage incident between Deputy Kinnett and the illegal Mexican driver last June .
And it also suggests , I think , why Deputy Kinnett never was punished or reprimanded for his lousy driving , much less killing an innocent woman :
If it nets an illegal arrest , the sheriff is apparently just fine with dubious tactics .
The Lavulavu family 's lawyer , H. Michael Wright , did n't return my call for comment .
But it will be interesting to see what happens with this suit in Superior Court .
” I did consider using a tranquiliser gun but we would have had to wait and there was no time it would have taken us 90 minutes to get hold of them and there were already two people injured .
A front page article " In Nuclear Net ’s Undoing , a Web of Shadowy Deals " in last Monday 's New York Times by David Sanger and William Broad details the destruction of evidence by the US government in a case involving the nuclear black market .
The article highlights again that the New York Times continues to engage in ' Judy Miller reporting ' by warmongering and acting as a mouthpiece for the government .
This is the third article in a multi-part series .
This article will focus on the NY Times ' appalling reliance on government - friendly sources , the lack of any actual investigative reporting , the lack of supporting evidence , and the absence of any dissenting views .
( The first piece of the series focused on the players in the AQ Khan / BSA Tahir nuclear smuggling ring , the second article focused on the countries involved . )
TBILISI ( Reuters ) - Georgia and its Western allies waited on Tuesday to hear if Russian President Dmitry Medvedev would recognize Georgia ’s separatist regions as independent , a move Washington has warned would be unacceptable .
In a sign of the fragility of the ceasefire declared after Russian troops marched into the pro-Western state , Georgian and separatist forces were in a tense standoff over a disputed village on the fringes of breakaway South Ossetia .
The two houses of Russia ’s parliament adopted non-binding resolutions on Monday urging Medvedev to recognize the independence of South Ossetia and the second Georgian separatist region of Abkhazia .
But the Kremlin leader issued no response to the unanimous votes in parliament .
U.S. President George W. Bush said he was deeply concerned by the parliamentary votes .
He urged Russia ’s leaders not to recognize the regions , which broke with Tbilisi after the collapse of the Soviet Union , as independent .
Senior officials of the world ’s leading industrial nations , the Group of Seven , also expressed alarm at the move .
Georgia and Russia fought a brief war over South Ossetia earlier this month after Tbilisi sent in troops to try to retake the province by force .
Russia struck back with a massive Russian counter - attack by land , sea and air .
Russia has pulled out the bulk of its forces , but it has alarmed the West by stationing some troops deep inside Georgia ’s heartland on what it has called a peacekeeping mission .
The West says the troops give Moscow a stranglehold over vital ports and transport links and are a breach of a ceasefire deal .
Georgia hosts a Western - backed oil pipeline which supplies about one percent of the world ’s crude .
BLACK SEA MANOEUVRES
The United States is Tbilisi ’s staunchest big-power ally and on Tuesday U.S. navy vessels were bound for Georgia bringing relief supplies -- a deployment that has irked Moscow .
Russia media reported that the ‘ Moskva ’ missile cruiser , which earlier this month took part in the attack on Georgia , put into the Black Sea again for what the navy described as a routine training exercise .
The White House announced that U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney would visit Georgia early next month as part of a European trip .
Cheney has in the past been an outspoken Kremlin critic , accusing Russia of blackmailing its neighbors .

Georgian and South Ossetia forces were facing off late on Monday in the village of Mosabruni on the edge of the breakaway region , though there was no fighting .
Georgian police said the village was not part of separatist - controlled territory , but the separatists accused Tbilisi of grabbing the village unlawfully .
The atmosphere was “ very tense ” , Kakha Lomaia , Secretary of Georgia ’s National Security Council , told Reuters .

KOSOVO PARALLEL
Russian lawmakers said Medvedev should recognize the two regions because they had a stronger claim to independence than Kosovo from Serbia and could no longer live within a state that sent in soldiers to try to restore its control .
Under Russian law , it is the prerogative of the president and not parliament to recognize foreign states .
Diplomats say the Kremlin may stop short of granting recognition , in part because it fears encouraging separatist sentiment in its own restive regions .
But they say Medvedev could instead use the threat of recognition as a bargaining chip .
The Russian troop pullback has in places revealed a trail of destruction where Russian forces have been destroying military infrastructure .
They say that was necessary to prevent Tbilisi from committing new acts of aggression .
A Reuters reporter at the Senaki military base near the Black Sea coast , which was occupied by Russian troops , saw deep craters in the runway , ransacked buildings and the blackened wrecks of T - 72 tanks and armored personnel carriers .
The base , the country ’s first built to NATO standards , was only completed a few months ago and was intended as the showpiece of Georgia ’s bid to join the alliance .
It ’s easy to get caught up in the pattern of thinking too much about what you do n’t want .
This includes noticing what you already have in your life but do n’t like .
If you think often about what you do n’t want , it ’s a safe bet you ’ll make a mess of your life .
Thinking about what you do n’t want is a trap .
Such thoughts can keep you stuck for a very long time .
You can seriously blow years — even decades — of your life in the following vicious cycle :
Look around and observe what you ’re experiencing .
Notice that you do n’t like certain aspects of your life .
Feel fear , worry , sadness , disappointment , and / or other negative emotions .
Think about what it would take to change what you dislike .
Notice that it will probably take a huge amount of time and effort to change — and with no guarantee of success .
Consider that you might even make things worse .
Feel frustrated , trapped , and / or depressed .
Do something that makes you feel better .
Watch TV . Eat. Drink .
Surf the web .
Check email .
Maybe do all of the above .
Feel some relief and comfort now that you ’ve distracted and / or drugged yourself .
Allow some time to pass , and eventually repeat from step one .
Do you ever run this pattern or something similar ?
There are many variations on the above , but you ’ll probably recognize patterns like this running in your life right now .
When do you run this kind of pattern ?
With your relationships ( or lack thereof ) ?
With your job / career ?
With your finances ?
With your living situation ?
With your physical body ?
Here ’s a specific example of how you might run this pattern on your finances :
Observe something that triggers negative thoughts about your finances .
It could be a bank statement , a bill , a blog post about money , the sorry contents of your wallet , or the prices at the gas station .
The stimulus could also be internal , perhaps triggered by a random thought about your money situation .
Notice that your finances are n’t where you want them to be .
You do n’t have enough cash , your income is too low , your expenses are too high , or you ’re too deep in debt .
Maybe it ’s all of the above .
Worry about your financial situation .
Be upset that things are n’t working .
Worry that your situation may worsen .
Consider what you ’d have to do to earn more money , pay off your debt , and / or reduce your expenses .
Notice that it will take a lot of hard work and some unpleasant changes to get your finances where you want them to be , and there ’s a good chance you ’ll fail anyway .
Feel frustrated , stressed , and overwhelmed .
Conclude that this is too much to deal with right now .
Spend a few hours web surfing to comfort yourself .
Watch a movie .
Eat some food that makes you feel better , even though it may not be the healthiest choice for you .
Feel some temporary relief from your troubles .
Ahhhh …
Go to bed , wake up the next morning , and run the same script again .
We can summarize the general pattern like this :
Think about what you do n’t want ->
Feel bad ->
Comfort yourself
This pattern is very , very common .
It ’s also highly addictive .
But it ’s not very intelligent .
The reason this pattern is n’t intelligent is that it never cures the underlying problem .
You only treat the symptoms .
You address the negative emotions by comforting yourself for a while , but the problem remains .
The negative emotions will surely return to haunt you again and again .
Whenever you notice that you ’re comforting yourself as a way of dealing with negative emotions and the problems that gave rise to them , recognize that you ’re guaranteeing that your problems will continue to bug you .
Once you get stuck in this pattern for a sufficient length of time , it ’s hard to quit .
You ’ll probably just keep running it over and over , perhaps every day for years to come .
Breaking the pattern
So how can we break this destructive chain ?
It ’s hard ( but not impossible ) to catch yourself thinking about what you do n’t want and then to consciously shift your thoughts to something more positive .
Usually this approach fails though .
It ’s hard to choose positive thoughts while you ’re stuck in the pattern of thinking negative thoughts .
It ’s even harder to break out of the pattern when you ’re already feeling bad .
By that point you ’ll feel an overwhelming urge to comfort yourself , and you wo n’t be motivated to do anything else .
It appears that the easiest place to break the pattern is after you ’ve comforted yourself .
Now you ’re feeling temporarily relieved .
You ’re more relaxed and not as stressed as you were earlier .
You ’re a bit more conscious too .
You may be a bit tired , but you can muster a small amount of motivation to do something different here .
Is this the time to start making changes ?
No , not yet .
If you try to solve your problems with action at this point , you ’ll probably just start the pattern over again .
You ’ll begin to notice how bad your situation is and how much work it will take to fix it , and then you ’ll start feeling bad again .
That approach keeps you stuck in the loop .
It can work in some cases , but it usually requires a ton of self - discipline , and you ’re very likely to fail .
A better approach is to take your feelings of relief and extend them into feeling excited .
I ’ll explain how to do this .
Think about what you want until you ’re genuinely excited
Once you ’re feeling relieved and comforted , even if you ’ve had to drug yourself with food , wine , and mindless entertainment to reach this point , you ’re in a reasonably good place to start thinking about what you want instead of what you do n’t want .
Do n’t worry about action just yet .
That will come later .
Just start thinking about what you want .
Dwell on it .
Obsess over it .
Imagine how you want things to be .
Imagine everything in your life working out beautifully .
Do n’t worry about practicality .
Just fantasize .
But fantasize in a specific way .
Sit on your couch ( or a chair or park bench if people came and took your couch away ) , and imagine that what you want is actually becoming real .
Put yourself in the frame of mind that it ’s already happening .
A realistic way to do this is to set aside 20 minutes every evening before going to bed just to dream .
Do this sitting up so you do n’t fall asleep .
Close your eyes or stare off into space , and think about what you want to experience in each part of your life .
Whatever you think about is fine , as long as it feels good to you .
Imagine your ideal physical body .
Think about your ideal relationships .
Picture your ideal career .
Imagine having your finances just the way you want them .
Imagine living where and how you want to live .
Be specific , and picture as much detail as you can .
Do n’t worry about getting the details perfect — just imagine details that seem attractive to you .
Make sure these imaginings are fully associated .
This means that you imagine seeing each scene through your own eyes .
Generally you should avoid using a third - person perspective , although you can try it if you want to imagine things from a different angle .
Usually the first - person perspective will create stronger emotions .
You do n’t have to say or affirm anything .
But it ’s crucial that you feel the feelings .
If you feel neutral , you ’re not there yet .
How would you honestly feel if you were experiencing all of these wonderful things right now ?
If you ’d feel totally neutral to have them right now , it ’s safe to say you do n’t really want them .
Do n’t project your dreams into some distant future .
Imagine that whatever you want is happening right now this very moment .
Imagine that it ’s 100 % real .
If it takes you 10 or more minutes just to get a clear picture of some small part of your life getting better , then so be it .
Put in the time .
Deliberately thinking about what you want is a very important activity .
This kind of visualization is an outstanding use of your time .
If you think about what you want , and you imagine it as real , but you get very little emotional surge from it , then drop it for a while , and imagine something else .
Go bigger .
Go bolder .
Go sexier .
Involve other people .
Involve the whole planet if that ’s what it takes to stir your emotions .
It ’s your imagination .
You do n’t need anyone ’s approval to choose the thoughts that feel good to you .
Do n’t spend much time thinking about what makes you feel relieved and comfortable .
Think about what excites you .
Imagine scenes that make you ooze with passion .
If you have a hard time getting excited , then keep imagining different things .
There ’s no time limit .
When you fantasize about having sex , notice how it affects your body .
You should have a similar physiological ( downright lusty ) response when thinking about what you really , truly desire .
If your body does n’t respond , drop the visualization you ’re doing , and think about something else .
Explore your imagination to figure out what you really want .
You may be surprised .
Again , do n’t worry about practicality .
It does n’t matter if you can actually have all the good things you ’re visualizing .
You can fantasize about having superpowers if you want , as long as you can get yourself to imagine yourself there right now in the present moment , feeling the feelings intensely .
The most important part is to get yourself feeling really , really good , and that ’s fairly easy to accomplish if you spend some time thinking deeply about what you truly want and imagining it as real .
Bare minimum , do this exercise for 20 minutes at a time every day for a week .
That ’s seven days , not just five days .
If you skip a day , start over from day one .
When I do this for 20 minutes straight , I find it hard to stop .
I usually end up going for about 45 minutes at a time .
When I first started doing this , it would take me 10 minutes or longer to find a thought that really excited me .
Now I can usually get there within 30 seconds or less .
You might assume that sexual thoughts are a good place to start .
I do n’t recommend that because sexual thoughts can become too addictive and circular .
They can cause you to feel a need to take care of yourself if you get too aroused , but in this case you want to retain the excitement instead of dissipating it .
You want to be sure to cover all parts of your life .
Search for thoughts that excite your whole being , not just your lower chakras .
They may still have a strong sex energy component to them , but there will be other components too , such as a feeling of heart - centeredness and the desire for creative self - expression .
When does action happen ?
Within a few days of beginning this daily exercise , you ’ll notice a shift in your focus , even while you ’re engaged in other activities .
You ’ll notice that you spend even more time thinking about what you want and less time worrying about what you do n’t want .
Distracting and comforting yourself wo n’t seem as attractive as the excitement you build when thinking about what you want .
Activities that used to comfort you will begin to seem dull and boring .
Pretty soon fresh , creative ideas will be popping into your mind .
Some of these will be partial solutions to your various problems .
Other ideas will lead you down a different path .
These ideas will often be more practical and realistic than your grand visualizations .
Allow yourself to ponder these ideas , but do n’t force yourself to act on them .
Over time your excitement will build .
Some of those new ideas will inspire and motivate you to get moving .
You ’ll find yourself wanting to write some of them down , or perhaps you ’ll feel an urge to journal about them further .
Maybe you ’ll feel like doing a little brainstorming to expand these ideas .
Feel free to do whatever feels good to you , but do n’t force action .
It will come eventually .
As your good feelings and excitement continue to build , you ’ll reach the point where you practically have to hold yourself back from taking action .
It will feel unnatural and uncomfortable not to act .
But until that happens , just continue the pattern of thinking about what you want for at least 20 minutes every day .
If it takes a few weeks to get to the point where you ’re positively compelled to act , that ’s fine .
That ’s still superior to running the self - destructive loop for several more years .
The positive cycle basically looks like this :
Think about what you want ->
Feel excited and motivated ->
Take inspired action and get results
Usually when I start thinking about something new that I want ( as described above ) , I feel compelled to act within the first few days .
It ’s hard to last a week without desperately wanting to dive in and do something about it , assuming I think about it every day .
This kind of action is inspired .
Although you may feel a desire to work hard at some point , it wo n’t feel like hard work .
There may be a lot of activity , but it will feel like play .
Imagine going to Disneyland ( or your favorite amusement park ) for a day .
You ’ll probably take a lot of action while you ’re there .
You may walk for miles , stand in lines , go on rides , buy food , etc .
Do you consider that hard work ?
Probably not .
When you ’re enjoying inspired action , it feels the same as spending a day at Disneyland .
You glide from one activity to the next with a feeling of positive anticipation .
At the end of the day you may be tired from all the activity , but you would n’t consider it a work day .
It ’s too fun to think of it as work .
This is how I feel when I get inspired by an idea .
I may take a lot of action on the implementation side , but it does n’t feel like work .
I ’m too excited and motivated to stop and think about the difficulty .
I ’m just soaking up the positive anticipation of the next step in the process .
For example , Sunday afternoon I did an hour - long meditation .
While I was in a fairly deep state , I asked my “ spirit guides ” for a good topic for my next article .
One of them ( the one I call my “ wisdom guide ” ) suggested I write something about “ blessings ” or “ feeling blessed . ”
I sensed that her intent was for me to write about how to shift our thinking towards what we want and away from what we do n’t want .
It was n’t a topic I was originally planning to write about this week , but the idea felt good to me .
While I was doing some physical tasks around the house , I thought about the article idea .
I imagined how the final result might help people make positive changes and be happier .
It felt good to imagine that .
I started to get excited about writing on this topic , even though I had no idea how I ’d write it or what I would say .
I sat down at my computer and put on some Celtic music .
Then I just started writing .
No outline .
I just started with the first line and kept typing until I got to the end .
I did n’t know where it would lead or how it would end .
About three hours later I was done .
I enjoyed writing this article .
It did n’t feel like work at all .
It was a smooth and easy flow of ideas .
Feeling blessed
When you develop the daily habit of kicking back and thinking about what you want , it soon becomes self - perpetuating .
Your inspired actions lead to results that make you feel even better .
This creates momentum that makes it hard not to think about all the great things that are coming up .
For example , when your income keeps going up , it ’s hard not to imagine how much more you ’ll be earning a year from now .
Positive action and positive feelings reinforce each other .
Sure you ’ll have some setbacks and failures now and then , but this pattern works much better than the comfort pattern in the long run .
When you ’re enjoying this upward spiral , you feel blessed .
You feel like the universe is conspiring to make you happier and happier .
It does n’t matter where you ’re starting from .
It really does n’t .
Your current reality can be a total wasteland , and you can still take time out of each day to think about what you want .
Many years ago when I was broke and deep in debt , and my monthly expenses were 10 x higher than my income ( not a good situation ) , I used to walk to the beach and look out at the ocean .
I ’d say to myself , “ At least this is free ! ”
That was something I did to comfort myself and to let go of some of the stress .
But while I was there , I began to imagine how my life might someday be better .
No more mountain of debt .
No more mailbox stuffed with letters from creditors .
No more feeling like I ’d screwed up .
At the time it seemed like pure fantasy to imagine what I wanted .
But at least that kind of fantasizing made me feel good .
It was better than comfort and relief .
It was more exciting .
Unfortunately , I made a mistake in doing my visualizations back then .
I projected all those dreams into the future .
I could n’t imagine them becoming fully real because they were too far beyond my present reality .
So I pushed them out into some distant future time .
Although it may have seemed sensible , it was still a mistake because it dampened my positive emotions .
I could n’t get as excited about something in the distant future .
Taking action remained a daily struggle , and I remained stuck in the trap of comforting myself to handle the stress .
It was only when I stopped pushing those positive thoughts into the future that my financial situation began to change for the better in a big way .
I started imagining things getting better right now instead of months or years down the road .
That put me into a more motivated frame of mind .
It was n’t the thought of having more money that excited me .
I was more excited by the thought of having the freedom to make a meaningful contribution to the world .
I did n’t really care about money at all — I just needed to be in a situation where money was n’t an obstacle .
My best visualizations usually did n’t involve money .
I felt more inspired by creating and sharing things than by acquiring stuff .
I still feel this way today .
Imagining myself having millions of dollars bores me .
I just do n’t see the point .
My emotions respond , “ We do n’t care . ”
But when I think about expressing and sharing ideas with other people , that actually gets me excited .
When I think about bringing people together , that excites me too .
Your values may be very different than mine , and that ’s fine .
The point is that you may need to release some socially conditioned notions to get to the real truth .
Do n’t fall into the trap of obsessing over what society has taught you that you should want , such as lots of money , a cool car , or a model ’s physique .
You need to go deeper to figure out what you really want .
And then you must accept that you want it , even if you think other people would consider you foolish for wanting it .
If you really , truly want it , let that be enough .
Initially I found it very difficult to get myself to imagine having what I wanted in the present moment .
My logical mind rejected the notion because it was clear that I was n’t anywhere close to having what I wanted .
But I found a nice little trick that helped a lot .
I imagined that I ’d shifted to an alternate reality where there was another me who was experiencing exactly what I wanted right now .
I just had to tune my thoughts to the right frequency to feel what he was feeling .
My logical mind was okay with that ; it ’s funny that it could accept the idea of alternate dimensions , even though it could n’t quite accept the idea of having what I wanted right this instant .
The benefits I ’ve received from deliberately cultivating the habit of thinking about what I want are downright disgusting .
I feel very blessed .
I get very inspired by thoughts of helping people grow .
I love encouraging people to live a little more consciously .
I like challenging people to consider different perspectives .
I know that many people think such pursuits are lame , naive , or pointless .
I do n’t care .
This path inspires me .
The more I think about it , the better I feel .
It would n’t matter if the whole world disagreed with me .
I know that I ’ve discovered something that means a lot to me .
And that ’s enough .
It took many years , but I figured out that all I really need to be happy is to maintain the habit of thinking about what I want .
I just need to carve a little time out of each day to think about what feels amazingly good to me .
The emotional energy this creates is so strong that 20 minutes a day soon overpowers thoughts of stress , frustration , worry , or overwhelm .
Please give this process a try .
Do it for at least seven days in a row , 20 minutes minimum each time .
After you ’ve run your relief / comfort ritual at the end of your day , take 20 more minutes to run this excitement ritual .
Allow yourself to feel blessed every single day , even if you have to mentally visit an alternate dimension to get yourself to accept it as real .
The presence of some of the people on that list of famous sufferers strikes me as downright alarming .
You could possibly paint a fresco or write a satire while enduring a gout attack , but running a country or conducting a war is a very different and very scary matter .
Persistent gout can lead to a profoundly uncharitable attitude toward your fellow man .
The line “ Exterminate all the brutes ! ” was written by that famous gout sufferer Joseph Conrad .
Conrad , according to the biographies , picked up something called “ malarial gout ” while in the Belgian Congo , some years before he wrote “ Heart of Darkness . ”
It lodged in his hands as well as his feet , including the wrist of his writing hand , which must have been a particular torture .
Conrad ’s fiction makes no mention of gout .
I confess I have n’t read every word of every Conrad novel , but this information comes from the magisterial volume “ Gout : The Patrician Malady , ” by Roy Porter and G. S. Rousseau , and that ’s good enough for me .
Conrad saved the topic for his letters , where he regularly unburdened himself .
In a 1905 letter to Sir Sidney Colvin , he wrote , “ There comes a point when disease like bad weather at sea becomes in sailor parlance , unmanageable ; there were four days when I had to lie on my back as helpless as a waterlogged and dismasted hulk . ”
The notion that his vision of “ The horror !
The horror ! ” might be a personal response to gout pain is certainly reductive , but far from inconceivable .
Perhaps Conrad avoided mentioning gout in his novels because it ’s so frequently seen as a comic plot device .
The fictional gout sufferer has historically been , and continues to be , a figure of fun rather than tragedy .
Falstaff rails against it in “ Henry IV , Part 2 ” : “ A pox of this gout ! ” he says .
Sir Leicester Dedlock in Dickens ’s “ Bleak House ” is a laughable old aristo who regards gout as a painful but necessary , indeed a noble , part of his family inheritance .
Gout pops up throughout P. G. Wodehouse as a nasty and disabling condition , but not something to be taken at all seriously .
More recently , in an episode of the animated sitcom “ King of the Hill , ” young Bobby develops gout after becoming addicted to chicken liver sandwiches .
The gout - afflicted in fiction invariably fail to see the funny side of their ailment .
Laughter , we can safely say , is not the best medicine .
The nearest I can come to a tragic , fictional association with gout is in George Eliot ’s “ Middlemarch , ” where Tertius Lydgate , a doctor who once had ambitions to make great scientific discoveries , ends up trapped in an unhappy marriage , treating the gout of rich old men and even writing a treatise on the subject .
The implication is that it ’s humiliating enough to suffer from gout , but it ’s much more humiliating to treat it in others  more yet to write about it .
I ’m not claiming a tragic destiny for myself any more than I ’m suggesting that gout is proof of my genius .
Rather , I ’m hoping that one day soon gout will become more accepted and maybe even fashionable , like attention deficit disorder or sex addiction .
No doubt it would help if some contemporary , irredeemably hip young writer were to come out of the gout closet .
The problem is that literary hipness is such a fragile flower that it ’s hard to imagine anyone whose reputation could withstand such a revelation .
Perhaps it ’s time for a literateuse to hobble up to the plate .
Gout is rare in women , but far from unknown , and studies show it ’s on the increase .
One explanation is that more women are now keeping up with the guys , eating red meat and boozing to excess .
( And I can encounter these women where ? )
Perhaps in the near future some cool young women writers will fess up to gout , and we can look forward to such titles as “ A Gout of One ’s Own , ” “ Gout and Prejudice , ” “ Gout and the City ” and the one I think just ca n’t miss , “ Gouty Bitch . ”

As gasoline prices rise along with global temperatures , the nuclear energy bandwagon is gaining momentum , and welcoming aboard Americans of all political stripes .
In the past month alone , President Bush , preparing for climate change talks at the G8 summit , urged the world to “ waken up to the beauty of nuclear power “ , while Republican presidential candidate Sen .
John McCain , in one of his June speeches on energy policy , called for the construction of 45 new U.S. nuclear power plants by 2030 , 100 over the longer term .
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama and Al Gore have both confirmed that they see nuclear power as a necessary part of the nation ’s future “ energy mix ” — a view also shared by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a growing number of congressional Democrats , as well as a handful of environmentalists who support the nuclear option as an imperfect but unavoidable alternative to global warming and response to peak oil .
This lesser - evil argument appears to be swaying public opinion :
While most polls show Americans about evenly divided on building more nuclear plants , 61 percent say they would support “ increased use of nuclear power as a source of energy in order to prevent global warming . ”
There are even signs of the arrival of “ nuke chic ” — most appealing , perhaps , among those too young to remember when the threat of nuclear annihilation was the planet ’s inconvenient truth .
A 2005 Wired magazine article promoting “ clean , green atomic energy ” described nuclear power opponents as “ the granola crowd , ” and asked , “ Would n’t it be a blast to barrel down the freeway in a hydrogen Hummer with a clean conscience as your copilot ? ”
And in 2006 Elle magazine included nuclear energy in its list of the top ten “ cool , new things . ”
Big energy companies , of course , are only too happy to ride the nuclear juggernaut , especially when it is fueled by substantial government subsidies .
In a country that has n’t broken ground on a new nuclear plant since the 1979 near - meltdown at Three Mile Island , on June 30 the US government ’s Energy Information Administration listed 19 license applications to build commercial nuclear reactors under review or anticipated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
The number is expected to exceed 30 by the end of next year .
The NRC has hired 400 new staff to deal with the flood of applications , and “ streamlined ” the process for siting , licensing , and constructing new nuclear plants .
And as the United States once again goes nuclear , it looks for inspiration to the longstanding poster child for atomic energy : France .
Suddenly , the French are very à la mode among nuclear - friendly politicians .
Just five years ago , John McCain was berating France for its opposition to the Iraq War .
( In February 2003 , he told CBS News that the French “ remind me of an aging movie actress in the 1940s who ’s still trying to dine out on her looks but does n’t have the face for it ….
You can not be a great nation unless you have a great purpose . ” )
But his February 2008 visit to France was described by Time as “ McCain ’s Paris Romance . ”
It is n’t just the rise of Sarkozy l’Américain that ’s wringing praise from former munchers of freedom fries .
It ’s the nukes .
“ The French are able to generate 80 percent of their electricity with nuclear power , ” McCain said after the trip .
“ There ’s no reason why America should n’t . ” South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham , who accompanied McCain to France , declared : “ Surely we can be as bold as the French .
They know what they ’re doing .
They have a very mature nuclear program . ”
Even George W. Bush has pointed to France as a model for our energy future .
But events this month show that life as a nuclear - powered nation is far from la vie en rose .
In mid July , the French Nuclear Safety Authority ( ASN ) announced a leak from a cracked pipe at a nuclear fuel plant in the southeastern Drôme region .
It said the leak was small and had not contaminated groundwater .
Such was not the case , however , on July 7 , when about 75 kilograms ( 165 pounds ) of untreated liquid uranium were spilled at the Tricastin nuclear plant in the Vaucluse , north of Avignon .
As the French began to repair to the countryside for their storied six - week summer vacations , those in this corner of Provence were being told not to drink the water — or swim or fish in it .
One swimmer at a local lake told the Guardian that people had been ordered out of the water “ as if there had been sharks in it . ”
The incident was given a low rating in terms of risk , but the French nuclear watchdog group CRIIRAD ( Commission for Independent Research and Information on Radioactivity ) reported that the amount of radioactivity released into the environment was 100 times higher than the site ’s limit for an entire year .
The Tricastin facility was temporarily shut down , the water ban remains in effect , and the French government has begun testing the water around all 59 of its nuclear plants .
Such dramatic events were bound to make headlines , and even had some media predicting a chill in France ’s long love affair with l’énergie nucléaire , which it embraced during the energy crisis of the 1970s and never let go of .
But in fact , the idea of France as a model of safe , affordable nuclear energy is largely a myth , and the current situation hardly an aberration .
Incidences of radioactive contamination are common in France , which has had no more success than any other country in solving the intractable problem of radioactive waste .
At the Tricastin site , for example , about 770 tons of nuclear waste have been buried for the past 30 years , and four smaller incidents took place in 2007 alone , according to CRIIRAD .
Nuclear contamination even threatens the twin sacraments of French life , wine and cheese .
In May 2006 , Greenpeace reported that low - level radioactive waste from a nuclear dumpsite had been found in the groundwater near the Champagne vineyards of eastern France .
A report released earlier the same month on contamination from an older nuclear waste facility in La Hague , Normandy showed radioactivity more than seven times the European safety limit in local underground aquifers , which are used by farmers for their dairy cattle in a region renowned for its Brie and Camembert .
The La Hague facility is particularly important to current debates over the future of nuclear power .
It is the world ’s largest nuclear fuel “ reprocessing ” plant , where spent nuclear fuel is broken down and parts of it recovered for use in new fuel .
Reprocessing is widely
touted as a solution to the problem of managing the high - level radioactive waste from spent fuel rods , which remains dangerous for about 240,000 years ( Depleted uranium , the byproduct of the enrichment process , is even more robustly radioactive , with a half - life of 4.5 billion years . ) .
The problem is that reprocessing yields nearly pure plutonium , a substance even more deadly and more volatile — and far more easily utilized by terrorists .
In 2003 , Greenpeace staged an event for the media in the middle of a town in Burgundy , in which it intercepted trucks carrying what was supposed to be a top - secret shipment of reprocessed plutonium from La Hague .
High - level waste is shipped overland to La Hague from all over Europe , and the plant itself , which stores large amounts of highly radioactive nuclear material awaiting reprocessing or transport , would be an especially devastating target for a terrorist attack .
( Surface - to - air missiles were briefly stationed around La Hague following 9/11 . )
Even under ordinary conditions , La Hague — like its more notorious British counterpart , Sellafield — releases low - level radioactive waste into the air and sea .
Several studies have found elevated levels of childhood leukemia around the Normandy site .
Such is the world that American nuclear proponents apparently have in mind : a landscape dotted with nuclear plants , traversed by trucks carrying nuclear fuel and waste .
And France is more than ready to export all of this .
Areva — the French state - owned nuclear giant responsible for the waste sites in Normandy and Champagne , as well the two plants that had leaks this month — is positioned to take full advantage of the US nuclear revival .
This is much in keeping with the strategy of President Nicolas Sarkozy , who has made it clear that he wants France to become an ever - bigger exporter of both nuclear - generated electricity and nuclear technology .
Since his election , he has signed cooperation agreements on civilian nuclear energy with Algeria , Jordan , Libya , Morocco , Tunisia , and the United Arab Emirates .
In a speech given just days before the Provence nuclear spill , Sarkozy said : “ More than ever , nuclear is an industry for the future and an indispensable energy source … .
We can be electricity exporters when we have neither oil nor gas .
This is an historic chance for development . ”
The head of French Greenpeace ’s nuclear campaign recently accused Sarkozy of behaving “ like a traveling salesman for Areva . ”
This year alone , Areva has won several major contracts to supply fuel to current US nuclear facilities , and signed on to build a $ 2 billion uranium enrichment plant in Idaho .
( Sen. Larry Craig ( R - Id . ) subsequently flew over for what he called a “ nuclear tour de France . ” )
In addition , Areva , which also has US contracts for nuclear waste disposal and reprocessing , is already participating in George Bush ’s 2006 Global Nuclear Energy Partnership ( GNEP ) , a potentially disastrous plan that includes building fuel reprocessing facilities similar to La Hague at sites in the United States .
As in France , reprocessing is promoted as a panacea for high - level nuclear waste , which still has no long - term US disposal site .
( The other increasingly popular approach is to simply pass the buck to future generation by advocating “ interim storage . ” )
Areva has also formed a partnership with Baltimore - based Constellation Energy to build new nuclear power plants in the United States .
Their joint company , UniStar , has already filed a licensing application for a plant at Calvert Cliffs , on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland , projected to open in 2015 ; it is expected to file soon for another at Nine Mile Point in upstate New York .
The new US plants are slated to be the country ’s first EPRs ( Evolutionary Power Reactors ) , a design developed by Areva and promoted as a new generation of safer , more cost - effective reactors .
But the first prototype EPR , being built by Areva in Finland , is two years behind schedule and at least $ 1 billion over budget , and construction of the second , in Normandy , has been plagued by a series of defects .
Plans for Areva ’s US plants are moving forward nonetheless , with help from US taxpayers and friends in high places .
Dick Cheney ’s 2001 Energy Task
Force gave a big push to nuclear energy , and the new energy legislation that followed in 2005 contained $ 12 billion in subsidies to the nuclear industry — even more than it gave to the oil and gas or coal companies .
A 2007 investigation by MSNBC showed a major jump in Areva ’s lobbying expenditures and campaign contributions while the bill was under consideration , as well as close connections with three key players : then - Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham became chairman of Areva ’s US subsidiary when he left the Bush Administration in 2006 .
The task force ’s Executive Director , Andrew Lundquist , also served briefly on Areva ’s US board .
And a former Areva lobbyist , Alex Flint , helped shepherd the energy bill through Congress while serving a stint as staff director on the Senate Energy Committee , which was then chaired by Pete Domenici ( R - N.M . ) .
Nuclear power ’s biggest booster in Congress , Domenici , is also the only American who has received the French Nuclear Energy Society ’s highest award .
Areva ’s new American partner , Constellation Energy , had also been invited to meet with Cheney ’s task force , and the two companies announced their joint venture less than six weeks after the passage of the 2005 energy bill with its whopping nuclear subsidies .
Announcing that they had begun to procure the materials to construct the first plants , Constellation ’s Michael Wallace acknowledged : “ The Bush Administration and Congress have made this commitment possible by developing , passing and carrying out the Energy Policy Act of 2005 . ”
In other words , despite the host of assurances about safety and cost - effectiveness , the nuclear industry could n’t survive for a moment in the free - market without handouts from American taxpayers — some of which , in the case of the government - owned Areva , will go into the French treasury .
The libertarian Cato Institute , attacking the 2005 energy bill , called nuclear power “ purely … a creature of government , ” saying it was still viewed by private investors as “ the pariah of the energy industry . ”
Such obstacles are n’t likely to derail America ’s rush toward nuclear power , nor are the cautionary tales currently playing out in Normandy and Provence .
Legislation passed in 2007 included additional subsidies for the industry , increasing government loan guarantees for new nuclear reactor construction and uranium enrichment to more than $ 20 billion .
While an attempt by John McCain to embed still more nuclear subsidies into a climate change bill failed last year , that battle is n’t over yet .
And with McCain , a major nuclear cheerleader , and Barack Obama a cautious supporter with large campaign contributions from the industry , the future does n’t look promising for nuclear energy opponents .
Already , the United States has nearly twice as many nuclear plants than France — 104 , compared with their 59 .
But it ’s a matter of proportion :
The US is more than 15 times the size of France , and has about 5 times its population .
The US gets only about 20 percent of our electricity from nuclear energy , and if we wanted to , we could still learn to live without it ; we have n’t yet reached the tipping point .
The City of Light , by comparison , would n’t survive a single night without nuclear power .
Ironically , as Americans are drinking the nuclear Kool - Aid , there are signs that the French may be losing their appetite for the fare in the atomic café .
Anti-nuclear protests seem to be on the rise in France , against both new nuclear plants and the high - risk transportation of radioactive fuel and waste .
A recent European Commission study found that two - thirds of the French want to decrease the share of their energy that comes from nuclear power .
And last year , following the so - called Grenelle de l’Environnement — a series of discussions among government , industry , unions , and nonprofit groups that yielded a set of environmental goals — Nicolas Sarkozy announced that France would aim to decrease its reliance on nuclear - generated electricity — to no more than 60 percent .
Distributed bug tracking
Did you know ...?

It is fair to say that distributed source code management systems are taking over the world .
There are plenty of centralized systems still in use , but it is a rare project which would choose to adopt a centralized SCM in 2008 .
Developers have gotten too used to the idea that they can carry the entire history of their project on their laptop , make their changes , and merge with others at their leisure .
But , while any developer can now commit changes to a project while strapped into a seat in a tin can flying over the Pacific Ocean , that developer generally cannot simultaneously work with the project 's bug database .
Committing changes and making bug tracker changes are activities which often go together , but bug tracking systems remain strongly in the centralized mode .
Our ocean - hopping developer can commit a dozen fixes , but updating the related bug entries must wait until the plane has landed and network connectivity has been found .
There are a number of projects out there which are trying to change this situation through the creation of distributed bug tracking systems .
These developments are all in a relatively early state , but their potential - and limitations - can be seen .
One of the leading projects in this area is Bugs Everywhere , which has recently moved to a new home with Chris Ball as its new maintainer .
Bugs Everywhere , like the other systems investigated by your editor , tries to work with an underlying distributed source code management system to manage the creation and tracking of bug entries .
In particular , Bugs Everywhere creates a new directory ( called .be ) in the top level of the project 's directory .
Bugs are stored as directories full of text files within that directory , and the whole collection is managed with the underlying SCM .
The advantages to an approach like this are clear .
The bug database can now be downloaded along with the project 's code itself .
It can be branched along with the code ; if a particular branch contains a fix for a bug , it can also contain the updated bug tracker entry .
That , in turn , ensures that the current bug tracking information will be merged upstream at exactly the same time as the fix itself .
Contemporary projects are characterized by large numbers of repositories and branches , each of which can contain a different set of bugs and fixes ; distributing the bug database into these repositories can only help to keep the code and its bug information consistent everywhere .
There are also some disadvantages to this scheme , at least in its current form .
Changes to bug entries do n't become real until they are committed into the SCM .
If a bug is fixed , committing the fix and the bug tracker update at the same time makes sense ; in cases where one is trying to add comments to a bug as part of an ongoing conversation the required commit is just more work to do .
That fact that , in git at least , one must explicitly add any new files created by the bug tracker ( which have names like 12968ab9-5344-4f08-9985-ef31153e504f/comments/97f56c43-4cf2-4569-9ef4-3e8 f2d9eb1 fe/body ) does not help the situation .
Beyond that , tracking bugs this way creates two independent sets of metadata - the bug information itself , and whatever the developer added when committing changes .
There is currently no way of tying those two metadata streams together .
Then , there is the issue of merging .
Bugs Everywhere appears to reflect some thought about this problem ; most changes involve the creation of new , ( seemingly ) randomly - named files which will not create conflicts at merge time .
It did not take long , however , for your editor to prove that changing the severity of a bug in two branches and merging the result creates a conflict which can only be resolved by hand - editing the bug tracker 's files .
Said files are plain text , but that is less comforting than one might think .
[ PULL QUOTE :
All of this can make distributed bug tracking look like a source of more work for developers , which is not the path to world domination .
END QUOTE ]
All of this can make distributed bug tracking look like a source of more work for developers , which is not the path to world domination .
What is needed , it seems , is a combination of more advanced tools and better integration with the underlying SCM .
Bugs Everywhere , by trying to work with any SCM , risks not being easily usable with any of them .
A project which is trying for closer integration is ticgit , which , as one might expect , is based on git .
Ticgit takes a different approach , in that there are no files added to the project 's source tree , at least not directly ; instead , ticgit adds a new branch to the SCM and stores the bug information there .
That allows the bug database to travel with the source ( as long as one is careful to push or pull the ticgit branch ! ) while keeping the associated files out of the way .
Ticgit operations work on the git object database directory , so there is no need for separate commit operations .
On the other hand , this approach loses the ability to have a separate view of the bug database in each branch ; the connection between bug fixes and bug tracker changes has been made weaker .
This is something which can be fixed , and it would appear ( from comments in the source ) that dealing with branches is on the author 's agenda .
Ticgit clearly has potential , but even closer integration would be worthwhile .
Would n't it be nice if a git commit command would also , in a single operation , update the associated entry in the bug database ?
Interested developers could view a commit which is alleged to fix a bug without the need for anybody to copy commit IDs back and forth .
Reverting a bugfix commit could automatically reopen the bug .
And so on .
In the long run , it is hard to see how a truly integrated , distributed bug tracker can be implemented independently of the source code management system .
There are some other development projects in this area , including :
Scmbug is a relatively advanced project which aims " to solve the integration problem once and for all . "
It is not truly a distributed bug tracker , though ; it depends on hooks into the SCM which talk to a central server .
Regardless , this project has done a significant amount of thinking about how bug trackers and source code management systems should work together .
DisTract is a distributed bug tracker which works through a web interface .
To that end , it uses a bunch of Firefox - specific JavaScript code to run local programs , written in Haskell , which manipulate bug entries stored in a Monotone repository .
Your editor confesses that he did not pull together all of the pieces needed to make this tool work .
DITrack is a set of Python scripts for manipulating bug information within a Subversion repository .
It is meant to be distributed ( and , eventually , " backend - agnostic " ) , but its use of Subversion limits how distributed it can be for now .
Ditz is a set of Ruby scripts for manipulating bug information within a source code management system ; it has no knowledge of the SCM itself .
As can be seen , there is no shortage of work being done in this area , though few of these projects have achieved a high level of usability .
Only Scmbug has been widely deployed so far .
A few of these projects have the potential to change the way development is done , though , once various integration and user interface issues are addressed .
There is one remaining problem , though , which has not been touched upon yet .
A bug tracker serves as a sort of to - do list for developers , but there is more to it than that .
It is also a focal point for a conversation between developers and users .
Most users are unlikely to be impressed by a message like " set up a git repository and run these commands to file or comment on a bug . "
There is , in other words , value in a central system with a web interface which makes the issue tracking system accessible to a wider community .
Any distributed bug tracking system which does not facilitate this wider conversation will , in the end , not be successful .
Creating a distributed tracker which also works well for users could be the biggest challenge of them all .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the San Francisco Democrat who last year became the first woman in U.S. history to be elected speaker , is on a book tour .
“ Know Your Power : A Message to America ’s Daughters , ” charts her journey from stay - at - home mom to politician and urges young women to reach their potential .
But in pushing the book , Pelosi is likely to run into a gauntlet of outraged voters who want to know why she will not allow impeachment proceedings against President Bush .
The speaker kicked off her book tour on ABC ’s “ The View . ” Asked by Joy Behar why she wo n’t impeach Bush , Pelosi said :
If somebody had a crime that the president had committed , that would be a different story … [ You ca n’t impeach ] unless you have the goods that this president committed these crimes .
We suspect Pelosi ’s real argument against impeachment is that it would anger moderates whose votes are needed in November to keep Democrats in power , folks who might be annoyed that Congress is spending its time , money and energy on impeaching a president whose term is almost over instead of addressing core problems like gas prices , the war in Iraq and home foreclosures .
Still , a progressive blog called democrats.com is daring readers to intersect her while she ’s out on book tour .
Giving readers a list of the speaker ’s book tour appearances , democrats.com is urging “ progressive ” citizens and journalists to “ pin her down ” on why she thinks none of the 35 articles of impeachment offered by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) constitute a crime .
In fact , democrats.com is holding a citizen journalism contest .
The reward : up to $ 1,000 .
The task : get Pelosi to give “ a direct and substantive answer to this question ” and record it on video or audio tape for playback on democrats.com . ”

A WEALTHY businessman committed suicide by tying a steel rope to a fence , wrapping it round his neck then speeding off in his car .
The car containing the decapitated body of Tadeusz Szewczek sped off down the street as his head bounced towards his home where his horrified wife was watching .
Police are baffled as to why the 48 - year - old , from the village of Jakubow in eastern Poland , wanted to kill himself in such a grisly way .
They said he waited for his wife to come home before taking his own life .
His wife Malgorzata had gone out about two hours before the suicide .
Szewczek 's 75 - year - old mother Marta said : " I think something went wrong with his marriage recently .
" It seems to me that might be why he killed himself . "
Malgorzata is being treated for shock .
Mrs Huseyin , who has been a PCSO since March 2007 , said : " I was absolutely gobsmacked when I realised the police had come to search my house .
When I saw the squad car I thought it was colleagues just popping in for a cup of tea .
It must be tough to be one of the Don Wildmon - type Christians .
The Muslims are trying to convert you to their God , who ’s actually the same God .
The Atheists keep telling you that you are descended from monkeys .
And you ’re afraid that you will become gay if a homosexual moves into your neighborhood .
That ’s probably why you go to the OneNewsNow Web site to get your news .

Of course , I ’m sure that ’s got nothing on sprinter Tyson Gay waking up to discover that his spot on the Olympic team was being instead taken by some guy named Tyson Homosexual .
And all because some homophobe religious bigots set the auto - replace function to change all uses of “ gay ” with “ homosexual . ”
Now the story has been fixed , and Tyson Gay is back on the U.S. Olympic team .

You 're on to something here Brad .
It appears that they found a potentially unstable person here to lay the blame on .
They harassed him into the ground , literally .
Link from Raw AUGUST
1-- The government biodefense researcher who committed suicide as federal prosecutors reportedly prepared to indict him in connection with the 2001 anthrax attacks was committed to a Maryland psychiatric hospital last month after making death threats against a counselor , according to court records .
Bruce Ivins , 62 , who died Tuesday of a drug overdose , had been scheduled to appear yesterday in a Frederick County court in connection with a protective order application filed by Jean Duley , program director of Comprehensive Counseling Associates .

That 's what his lawyer is saying ...
Today , Ivins 's attorney issued a statement saying the scientist was innocent and had fully cooperated with the FBI 's investigation for six years .
`` We assert his innocence in these killings , and would have established that at trial , '' said Paul Kemp , a partner at the Venable law firm in Rockville , Maryland .
`` The relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people , as has already been seen in this investigation .
In Dr. Ivins 's case , it led to his untimely death . ''

I think it should be quite obvious to anyone that is not a Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity listening Reich wing nut bag that this guy is a patsy .
He had zero motive , likely no access to the type of anthrax used not the technical skills required to make it .
The Neo -Fascist that have taken over this country in a coup d’état in 2000 have the motive , the means , and the total lack of morals & conscience to have done it .
The MSM is doing exactly what they have done with the Election fraud , the Iraq occupation and the false flag attack of 9/11 .
They are complicit in these cover ups , there is no way these people could be this blind & ignorant they have to be complicit .

The anthrax scare was created as an excuse to install mail surveillance .
60 - 70 % of the CIA and NSA budgets are paid to private contractors , some of them are corrupt .
When Hatfill would n't fall they pinned it on Ivins .
The harassment Ivins endured are classic CIA / NSA tactics to discredit , disgrace and destroy .
It reads like a bad remake of Arlington Road .

The anthrax came from a Rumsfeld - controlled DOD facility .
The Anthrax attacks were against the most prominent media talking heads , and against one member of the media who published photos of the Bush Twins drunk .
The Anthrax Attacks were also against Tom Daschle and other Democrats who opposed the invasion of Iraq and Warrantless Domestic Wire Tapping - and against the Mainstream Media to ensure their silent complicity .
Rumsfeld ordered it .
Dr. Philip Zack did it .
It was US DOD Anthrax .
The repeated lie that " we have n't been attacked here since 9/11 " is absurd .
The Anthrax attacks instilled at least as much fear in the American public as did 9/11 .
Rumsfeld and Cheney made it happen , all under the direction of the REAL PRESIDENT , GW's Father , Bush 41 . :
The anthrax lead RIGHT BACK to the same place the 9/11 funding eventually lead back to : the bowels of the US government .
It was PROVEN by the FBI that the anthrax originated from a secret army lab in Fort Dietrich maryland .
Funny how the White House was put on Cipro on 9/10 by the same guy ( Jerry Hauer ) who sent FBI agent John O’neil to die in the towers .
http://www.frankolsonpro...t-CodeNameArtichoke.html
The conspiracy originated at the top , in the White House , initiated by Donald Rumsfeld and Richard Cheney .
It had just been learned that the CIA allegedly drugged its employee Frank Olson with LSD before his supposed suicide .
Rumsfeld and Cheney , heads of the White House chiefs of staff , at the time recommended to President Gerald Ford that he apologize to the family in the name of the government , and to support retribution .
In order to prevent worse things from happening .
That 's the content of this White House memo : 49.21 " There ( is ... ) the possibility that it might be necessary to disclose highly classified national security information in connection with any court suit or legislative hearings . "
49.38 Ten days later , Ford hosted the Olson family and apologized .
This allowed him to remain silent about state secrets – and the true reasons for Frank Olson 's death .
49.52 Voice of Eric Olson
" What this means for me is that a national security homicide is not only a possibility , but really it is a necessity , when you have a certain number of ingredients together .
If you are doing top secret work that is immoral , arguably immoral , especially in the post - Nuremberg period , and arguably illegal , and at odds with the kind of high moral position you are trying to maintain in the world , then you have to have a mechanism of security which is going to include murder . "
50.26
The two politicians who collaborated in the conspiracy in 1975 , Rumsfeld and Cheney , are back in power .
As vice president and secretary of defense of the government of the United States .

Judy Miller was either a useful idiot or a spy , but either way , the results were the same .
She was clearly a tool of the Neocons / Zionists in the SELLING OF A WAR ( as if it were a product to be pitched ) .
The motive ?
This assumes there was a single motive .
Each of the actors involved had their own reasons for engaging in the conspiracy .
For those who benefitted financially from the 9/11 attacks and ALL that has followed , the primary motive was likely greed , with a secondary lust for power and control .
Who bought the stock of Invision airport bomb detection equipment prior to 9/11 ?
Who shorted American Airlines ?
What did Carlyle do to position itself in advance of the attacks ?
Follow the money .
Where is Chertoff ’s final report ( Operation Greenquest ) ?
The answer …Bush buried it .

Daschle : Congress Denied Bush War Powers in U.S. By Barton Gellman
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday , December 23 , 2005 ; Page A04
The Bush administration requested , and Congress rejected , war - making authority “ in the United States ” in negotiations over the joint resolution passed days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , according to an opinion article by former Senate majority leader Thomas A. Daschle ( D - S.D. ) in today ’s Washington Post .
Daschle ’s disclosure challenges a central legal argument offered by the White House in defense of the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretapping of U.S. citizens and permanent residents .
It suggests that Congress refused explicitly to grant authority that the Bush administration now asserts is implicit in the resolution .

For any remaining COINCIDENCE THEORISTS : Agency planned exercise on Sept. 11 built around a plane crashing into a building Bizarre coincidence ?
U.S. intelligence agency was planning an exercise involving aircraft crashing into buildings on 09-11-2001 John J. Lumpkin — Associated Press Wednesday September 11 , 2002
Bizarre coincidence ? : National Reconnaissance
Office scheduled an exercise involving aircraft crashing into buildings on 09-11-2001
In what the government describes as a bizarre coincidence , one U.S. intelligence agency was planning an exercise last Sept. 11 in which an errant aircraft would crash into one of its buildings .
But the cause was n’t terrorism — it was to be a simulated accident .
“ It was just an incredible coincidence that this happened to involve an aircraft crashing into our facility , ” Haubold said .
“ As soon as the real world events began , we canceled the exercise . ”
Adding to the coincidence , American Airlines Flight 77 — the Boeing 767 that was hijacked and crashed into the Pentagon — took off from Dulles at 8:10 a.m. on Sept. 11 , 50 minutes before the exercise was to begin .
It struck the Pentagon around 9:40 a.m. , killing 64 aboard the plane and 125 on the ground .
The National Reconnaissance Office operates many of the nation ’s spy satellites .
It draws its personnel from the military and the CIA .
After the Sept. 11 attacks , most of the 3,000 people who work at agency headquarters were sent home , save for some essential personnel , Haubold said .
An announcement for an upcoming homeland security conference in Chicago first noted the exercise .
In a promotion for speaker John Fulton , a CIA officer assigned as chief of NRO ’s strategic gaming division , the announcement says , “ On the morning of September 11th 2001 , Mr. Fulton and his team … were running a pre-planned simulation to explore the emergency response issues that would be created if a plane were to strike a building .
Little did they know that the scenario would come true in a dramatic way that day . ”

The anthrax came from a Rumsfeld - controlled DOD facility .

The Anthrax Attacks were also against Tom Daschle and other Democrats who opposed the invasion of Iraq and Warrantless Domestic Wire Tapping Los Angeles , Alta California - 2/26/2002 - ( ACN ) Jewish microbiologist Dr. Philip M. Zack may be behind the deadly anthrax contaminated letters that were mailed to NBC's Tom Brokaw , Senator Tom Daschle and others , according to FBI sources .
In a rapidly unravelling investigation by the FBI , it appears that the " Arab - hating - Jew " was behind a vile conspiracy to frame a
colleague who was born in Egypt and who worked , along with Dr. Zack , at the U.S. Army 's Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick , Md. Nexus : Anthrax , Zack , Gilead , Rumsfeld
On the 9/11 anthrax attacks , the mainstream media went from 24×7 anthrax hysteria to complete amnesia that the attacks ever occurred .
The amnesia began as soon as all the evidence for the source of the attacks began to point in the wrong direction .
It is , of course , absolutely verboten to mention the name of Philip Zack ever in discussing this glaringly obvious false flag op .
Rumsfeld served as Gilead ( Research ) 's chairman from 1997 until he joined the Bush administration in 2001 , and he still holds a Gilead stake valued at between $ 5 million and $ 25 million , according to federal financial disclosures filed by Rumsfeld .
The forms do n't reveal the exact number of shares Rumsfeld owns , but in the past six months fears of a pandemic and the ensuing scramble for Tamiflu have sent Gilead 's stock from $ 35 to $ 47 .
That 's made the Pentagon chief , already one of the wealthiest members of the Bush cabinet , at least $ 1 million richer .
Rumsfeld is n't the only political heavyweight benefiting from demand for Tamiflu , which is manufactured and marketed by Swiss pharma giant Roche .
( Gilead receives a royalty from Roche equaling about 10 % of sales . )
Former Secretary of State George Shultz , who is on Gilead 's board , has sold more than $ 7 million worth of Gilead since the beginning of 2005 .

There is no physical evidence that Ivins sent anthrax letters to anyone , but as his bio currently is being massaged to make it look as if he could have , in spite of the fact that he had the mental clarity to know that he could clear his name in court , he yet had to be offed to make it look like suicide , either that or driven to it thru relentless subtle harassment in the hope that he would , hence this is an op to protect Dr Philip Zack by having a scapegoat named after it has conveniently died , and then move to declare the case closed .
Another possibility , any psychosis Ivans was experiencing could have been chemically induced .
You do n't think that a government agency such as the FBI can't contaminate his water , or his food , or even the air he is breathing in his house with an appropriate drug that would induce dire feelings of depression ?
Shit , I 'm supposed to be taking a blood - pressure pill ( Monopril ) but mostly do n't because it make me feel so depressed !
Ya' think maybe that " The Community " does n't have specific drugs that produce the desire for suicide ?
Was Ivans taking any meds and where was he getting them ?
With the " Man " watching his every move 24/7 , the government 's spooks also knew when to change out those pills in his medicine chest to something more to their liking .
For a certainty , no legitimate autopsy will be performed on his carcass .
Actually this incident just seems to be a liberal variation of the Forrestal suicide back in ' 49 .
This poor guy never had a chance .

He is a revenge killer .
When he feels that he 's been slighted or has had - especially toward women - he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings , " Duley said .
She added that Ivins " has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic , homicidal killer .
I have that in evidence .
And through my working with him , I also believe that to be very true . "
So , therapist Jean Duly says Ivins tried to murder people as far back as 2000 , huh ?

“ Most people prefer to believe that their leaders are just and fair , even in the face of evidence to the contrary , because once a citizen acknowledges that the government under which he lives is lying and corrupt , the citizen has to choose what he or she will do about it .
To take action in the face of corrupt government entails risks of harm to life and loved ones .
To choose to do nothing is to surrender one ’s self - image of standing for principles .
Most people do not have the courage to face that choice .
Hence , most propaganda is not designed to fool the critical thinker but only to give moral cowards an excuse not to think at all . ”

Spell SAIC backwards ... CIA 's SAIC was commissioned by G. W. Bush in 2002 to construct a replica of a mobile WMD laboratory of the sort used by Saddam .
This mock up , supposedly destined to be used to train teams searching for WMDs in Iraq , was designed by Stephen Hatfill , the WMD expert now being harangued into isolation and thus silence by Bush 's FBI .
Last spring , the Bush administration handed SAIC some of the biggest defense contract plums to be had - a billion - dollar chunk of the NexGen business and an unbelievably porky 10 - year contract worth over $ 600 million . "
http://www.mail-archive....v.aol.com/msg107176.html
http://www.warprofiteers.com/article.php?id=7892
http://en.wikipedia.org/...nternational_Corporation
In January 1999 , new SAIC consultant Steven Hatfill and his collaborator , SAIC vice president Joseph Soukup , commissioned William C Patrick ( a retired leading figure in the old US bioweapons program ) to report on the possibilities of terrorist anthrax mailings in the United States .
( There had been a spate of hoax anthrax mailings in the previous two years . )
Barbara Hatch Rosenberg said that the report was commissioned " under a CIA contract to SAIC " .
However , SAIC said Hatfill and Soukup commissioned it internally — there was no outside client .
Patrick produced his 28 - page report in February 1999 .
Some subsequently saw it as a " blueprint " for the 2001 anthrax attacks .
The report suggested the maximum amount of anthrax powder --- 2.5 grams --- that could be put in an envelope without producing a suspicious bulge .
This was just a little more than the actual amounts --- 2 grams each --- in the letters sent to Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy .
But the report also suggested that a terrorist might produce a spore concentration of 50 billion spores per gram .
This was only one - twentieth the actual concentration --- 1 trillion spores per gram --- in the letters sent to the Senators

Raytheon is a darling of Carlyle Group .
Raytheon , maker of Patriot and Tomahawk missiles , watched its stock take off after the attacks .
Purchases of call options contracts on Raytheon stock increased sixfold on September 10 , 2001 .
The Raytheon option contracts made money , if shares were more than $ 25 each .
The price zoomed up nearly 37 percent to $ 34.04 during the first week after post 9/11 trading .
Parenthetically , Raytheon had also been hit with millions of dollars in fines for padding costs of equipment it sold to the US military .
Raytheon also has a hush - hush subsidiary , E - Systems , whose clients include the CIA and NSA , the latter about to make a hostile takeover of the other .
CLEARLY , Bets were placed in advance of 9/11 with foreknowledge of 9/11 .
This is n't just War Profiteering , this is TERROR PROFITEERING .
Raytheon had a DIRECT role in 9/11 .
http://www.rinf.com/colu...theon-connection-to-9-11
The A - 3 Skywarrior that hit the Pentagon was owned by Raytheon .
It was guided by Sysplan 's ( FTS ) technology .
http://www.rense.com/general70/safe.htm
I remember the first conversation I had with Karen Kwiatkowski , a retired Lieutenant Colonel who was in the Pentagon that day .
She is the lady that went public about the Office of Special Plans where they were falsifying the intelligence regarding Iraq .
She vividly remembers being downstairs and around the corner in about 10 minutes to help get people out and the FBI agents were at the CITGO station confiscating the video tapes of what hit the Pentagon .
Other eyewitnesses have stated that they smelled explosives such as cordite , not burning jet fuel .
Those were military witnesses that know that exploded ordnance smells like .
What little video evidence there is does show a white trail of smoke before the Pentagon explosion .
Jet fuel burns dark at sea level and jets do not leave white contrails at sea level .
What does leave a white trail of smoke at all elevations is the solid fuel of a rocket , Thiokol in most rockets being the type of solid fuel .

Big Dan # 37 ,
That 's why I was hmm-ing on my comment about Duley @ # 5 .
She just happens to have an article about herself posted four weeks before Mr. Ivins offs himself , go read the link up there ... What are the odds of that happening ? , was it a pre-emptive credibility boosting article ?
again , hmm ...

Dude here picks up on it : Ms. Jean Duley was / is ( ? ) a social worker for a company in Maryland that Dr. Ivins attended at least ONE group session with .
Now , every single comment in the news headlines about Dr. Ivins being a psychopath or wanting to kill people , every single one of them , comes from what they call “ court documents ” from Maryland .
And they ALL refer to the ONE handwritten document filed by Ms. Jean Duley , two days before Dr. Ivins reported suicide .
This is the entire case for Dr. Ivins being a homicidal maniac .
AND SHE ADMITS IN THE DOCUMENT THAT THE FBI HAS ALREADY BEEN IN CONTACT WITH HER !
Meaning , the FBI , the same agency that screwed up the Hatfill case so bad the government had to pay him 5.8 million tax - payer dollars less than a MONTH before all of this took place , that SAME FBI spoke to Ms. Jean Duley … and then she goes into court in the morning and files this report THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT ANYONE CAN USE TO INCRIMINATE DR .
IVINS !

Now we get this :
One media report said Duley was no longer employed at the mental health center where she treated Ivins .
Was she let go for nonprofessional behavior ?
Link From my link at # 5 , just a month ago she was : program director at Comprehensive Counseling Associates in Frederick .
Yuh , uh huh

Hence , most propaganda is not designed to fool the critical thinker but only to give moral cowards an excuse not to think at all .
Just like tactics to scare people , like the Harry & Louise propaganda from the 90's , target those with health care ... not the 50 million without it .
The 50 million without health care are ignored by all .
How do you stop universal health care ?
Put on a propaganda campaign to scare those with health care !

I just had an epiphany : So ... the reason given for the lackluster response to the events of September 11th , 2001 , is that there was a " drill " in place that simulated the actual terror event ?
Does n't that mean that OUR ADMINISTRATION FAILED UTTERLY TO PROTECT OUR NATION ?
This was n't a dry run ; there must have been practice drills leading up to this ... AND THEY FAILED !!!
Come on ... would n't uo FIRE these incompentents ?
Yet , many of them were PROMOTED .
As far as the Anthrax false - flag ... they can't place Dr. Bruce E. Ivins at the Urban Moving Systems facitily in Weehauken , NJ ... but they can place Lt. Col. Philip Zack ...

Mom :
So when we come to Sydney can we stay at yours ?
Mom : Hello ?
Me : Oh. Sure .
Well , actually there are a number of awesome hotels just a two minute walk from my house .
I ’ve just emailed you a bunch of links .
Have a look !
Am happy to book any of them for you .
But , yeah , of course you are welcome to stay at mine , if you really want to .
Me : Mom ?
Mom :
You were welcome to stay in my uterus for nine months , and then my house for 17 years .
But I understand , a week at your apartment might be a bit … much . :)
Me : Do n’t you passive - aggressive - smile - face - ME , woman .
Mom : Fuck off .
Love you – M .
A company called GreenCore Air has released an air conditioner than can be powered by a single 170 watt solar panel .
The GreenCore air conditioning unit can heat and cool a 600 square foot room .
It runs on DC power , so there is no need to put an AC inverter between the solar panel and the air conditioner .
This eliminates the power losses associated with converting AC to DC .
When the sun is not out the unit runs on the battery bank which is integrated within the unit .
There two version of the air conditioner : a fixed one , and a mobile one that is mounted on wheels .
GreenCore units are being tested by a McDonald ’s restaurant and the U.S. Navy .

Gäbe es im Brüsseler Europaparlament einen Wettbewerb für Zuverlässigkeit und penible Genauigkeit , dann hätte Ingeborg Grässle gute Aussichten auf den ersten Platz : Die schwäbische CDU - Parlamentarierin mit den Spezialgebieten Haushalt und Haushaltskontrolle ist dermaßen korrekt , dass es einigen ihrer Parteifreunde in Brüssel bereits auf die Nerven geht .
Umso mehr stört es die deutsche Europaabgeordnete , dass seit einer Woche alle 785 Europa - Abgeordneten unter Generalverdacht stehen : Ein interner Revisionsbericht der Parlamentsverwaltung belegt in einer Stichprobe 167 Vorfälle , in denen Europa - Abgeordnete kreativ bis kriminell mit der ihnen zustehenden Sekretariatszulage umgingen .
Diese kann bis zu 17.000 Euro pro Monat betragen .
Einige Parlamentarier bezahlten damit nicht existierende Mitarbeiter , andere verpflichteten ihre Assistenten , einen Teil ihres Gehalts an den Abgeordneten zu überweisen , andere beschäftigten Ehefrau oder Sohn , ohne dass diese im geringsten qualifiziert waren .
Deutsche Abgeordnete sollen von den Vorwürfen nicht betroffen sein , aber weil die Verwaltung die Namen unter Verschluss hält , wuchern Gerüchte und Schlagzeilen .
Haushaltsexpertin Ingeborg Grässle fordert die Einschaltung der EU - Betrugsbekämpfungsbehörde Olaf .
" Die Namen der Betrüger auf den Tisch und Olaf ins Haus - es sind Einzelfälle , aber es muss Schluss sein mit der Kriminalisierung der Abgeordneten . "
Dabei ist es auf den ersten Blick gar nicht so leicht , als Abgeordneter selber von der Sekretariatszulage zu profitieren .
Schließlich gibt es Geld für die Assistenten und für deren Reisekosten aus dieser Zulage nur gegen Nachweis .
Zudem geht das Geld nicht an den Europa - Abgeordneten , sondern an einen Dritten , etwa einen Steuerberater oder eine Firma , die es dann weiterleiten .
Nicht nur die Grünen - Abgeordnete Rebecca Harms wundert sich :
" Ohne Verträge und ohne auch Glaubwürdigkeit dieser Verträge kann gar kein Geld abgerufen werden . "
Doch bei einigen Europa - Abgeordneten ist die nötige kriminelle Energie anscheinend vorhanden .
Das belegt auch das neue Abgeordnetenstatut , das nächstes Jahr in Kraft treten soll .
Darin ist einiges so ausdrücklich verboten , dass man sicher sein kann , dass es öfter mal vorgekommen ist :
So darf künftig der Europaabgeordnete nicht zugleich auch hinter der Firma stehen , die die Sekretariatszulage beantragt und weiterleitet .
Rücküberweisungen von Mitarbeitern an Abgeordnete sind ebenso verboten wie die Beschäftigung eines Familienangehörigen als einzigem Mitarbeiter .
Die Sache zieht inzwischen Kreise , und so ist auch das alte Thema der Situation der Assistenten im Parlament wieder in die Diskussion geraten .
Die werden seit jeher von ihrem Europa - Abgeordneten so bezahlt , wie es diesem gefällt , nach dem Recht des jeweiligen Heimatstaates .
Kranken - und Rentenversicherung gehören nicht unbedingt dazu .
Claudia Bernhard arbeitet im Büro von Ingeborg Grässle und ist zufrieden : korrektes Gehalt , korrektes Arbeitsklima .
Dafür arbeitet die 24 - Jährige auch weit jenseits der üblichen Bürozeiten hart .
Andere Assistenten machen diesen Knochenjob für andere Europa - Abgeordnete schon für .000 Euro netto im Monat .
Die Gründe seien immer dieselben , sagt Claudia Bernhard :
" Weil das Umfeld interessant ist , mit den vielen Sprachen und Möglichkeiten gut ist , und weil man sich überlegt , dass das ein sehr gutes Sprungbrett ist , wenn man in den europäischen Institutionen arbeiten möchte . "
Die Assistentenvereinigung im Europäischen Parlament hat zuletzt eine anonyme Umfrage gemacht .
Dabei stellte sich unter anderem heraus , dass die Hälfte aller Abgeordnetenassistenten nicht in Belgien gemeldet ist , obwohl sie dort arbeiten - aus Angst , neben den Steuern im Heimatland auch in Belgien noch einmal bezahlen zu müssen .
Um endlich legale Verhältnisse zu schaffen , sollten Assistenten künftig von der Europaparlamentsverwaltung angestellt werden und nicht mehr von den Abgeordneten , erklärt Anna Haas , die Vizevorsitzende der Assistentenvereinigung :
" Wir fordern ein einheitliches Statut für Assistenten ; wichtig ist dabei , dass wir eine einheitliche faire und transparente Regelungen bekommen in den Bereichen Sozial , Kranken - und Rentenversicherung und Besteuerung der Arbeitnehmer . "

Code .
My Microsoft Background
Before I go into the specifics of the interview experience , I want to explain my background with Microsoft .
When I was just starting college , I got into an online community called DevHood .
It was a student - focused .
Net community where you could share tutorials , tips , code , and ask questions .
Loosely associated with this were monthly .
Net user group meetings on campus .
My friend Ammon was the Microsoft student ambassador leading these meetings .
By the time I ’d graduated I was one of the leaders on DevHood ( I ’ve since dropped a few places –the site is now mostly inactive ) , and a strong desire to some day work for Microsoft was born .
That desire has been occasionally reinforced by various MS events that I ’ve been to , people I ’ve spoken to , and blogs I ’ve read .
Around the time I graduated I made it into an “ interview ” situation with Microsoft in the career center .
I failed miserably .
It was the first - ever interview I ’d ever done with anybody , I did n’t prepare ( at all ) , I was nervous ( to the point of becoming very hot and sweating ) , and for some reason I thought I wanted to be a PM .
Yeah …. they never called me back .
But it was a learning experience .
My freshman year in college is also the year I moved from using Borland C++ to using Visual C++ 6 .
I was also an early adopter of .
Net and have generally been a fan of Microsoft .
( You could maybe call me a fanboy , but I do n’t think I ’m completely one - sided .
I consider myself pragmatic .
Apple is just as good in many things as Microsoft , but I am really annoyed at the press it gets and the Apple fanboys .
I think the biggest differences in OS X and Windows for most non-technical end -users are aesthetic .
- Ed : please see clarifying comments below )
The effect of Google
I interviewed with Google last year , a process which I documented .
Thank goodness –that experience really prepared me for this , though there were some big differences .
For one , I do n’t think I wanted the Google job .
It was fun , nice to do , gave me a good experience , but in he end I was n’t that disappointed .
Microsoft was different .
I wanted it and I prepared accordingly .
A month of e-mails and phone calls
It ’s been a few months since this process started , so some of the details of timing or exact discussions may be off , but the overall story is correct .
A few months ago , I was contacted by a staffing firm that works directly with Microsoft to fill positions in various teams .
I quickly responded , expressing my interest .
The staffing agent who initially contacted me referred me to her boss , who was an extremely nice lady who works out of her home .
She did initial questions like what kinds of things I ’m interested in , can I relocate , etc .
Mostly , she told me about the team that she is looking for : Live Search .
She also acted as the buffer between me and Microsoft .
She referred me to a Microsoft staffing person who also worked specifically with the Live Search group .
The Microsoft staffer talked to me first on the phone , about my projects , goals , Microsoft , the Live Search team , and how interested I was .
He then setup a phone screen with the development lead of the team I was interviewing for , which was to take place about a week later .
This phone call was postponed because of a meeting at Microsoft , and I actually did it a few days later than planned .
No big deal for me , though it was a little hectic because family was visiting and I did n’t want to discuss my interviewing with them at this point .
Phone Screen
I prepared for the phone screen by writing questions for the interviewer , preparing standard HR - type questions and answers , and figuring out what I wanted to say about myself ( overall ) , my interests , projects , current job , why I want to leave , why I want to work for Microsoft , and anything else I could think of .
I also researched the team a little ( I did n’t know which specific team it would be at this point , so this was mostly learning the major components of the Live Search group ) .
I did not practice writing much code at this point .
The actual phone screen was easier than I thought , up to the end .
We started with a little chit-chat , then he asked me about my current projects at GeoEye .
He did go into technical details , but not too much .
He asked me about my opinion on testing and other software engineering practices .
I discussed unit testing and the efforts I had made to impose best practices in my current team .
I was pretty emphatic in my description of software engineering practices , since I had seen such dramatic benefits in my work .
We had a pretty good discussion about this sort of stuff and I felt like I was being taken seriously because of my experience .
We also talked about working in teams .
After 30 minutes or so , he asked , almost apologetically , if I had time to do a coding exercise .
Of course , I said yes .
Oops .
I did n’t do so well .
With him on the phone , I e-mailed him my code at regular intervals .
I took about an hour to hack out a recursive solution to a problem which I had actually never solved before .
I think I panicked and not having immediate feedback I went down the wrong path for a while .
I also should have thought of the design of the problem in terms of data structures , rather than just think of a vague code solution and go for it .
I learned a lot from this exercise .
Even with that , he said , “ I ’m going to recommend you come in for an in - person interview .
The coding was a little weak , to be honest , but I think you have great potential . ”
He also specifically recommended reading Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley .
This book was on my to - read list , so I gave it priority and ordered it , along with Programming Interviews Exposed : Secrets to Landing Your Next Job .
Preparation
My preparation for this interview was intense .
I went through as many problems as I could think of .
With Programming Interviews Exposed , I read 2 - 3 chapters at a time , making sure I understood each problem and the answers thoroughly .
Then I went back and solved each problem on paper , without cheating and looking at the answers .
Most problems I could have done without reading the chapter beforehand , but a few were new to me so the book helped a lot .
It also helped show how many problems can be solved with creative application of basic CS principles .
It also has good advice for handling salary negotiation and other non-technical aspects of the process .
Programming Pearls was even more helpful for formulating a mental framework for solving problems .
I can not recommend it enough .
The material is much more deep than Programming Interviews Exposed and it will force you to think a lot more .
I read the entire book and did as many problems in each chapter as I could .
Most of them are thinking questions and not necessarily coding questions .
I also found and downloaded every list of programming questions I could find :
I did problems almost every night until I started to feel burned out .
I solved every problem on those lists , other than some of the database / hardware / irrelevant questions .
Whatever you do , do n’t give in to temptation to look at the answers until you ’re hurting with the effort of solving them .
Memorizing the answers is n’t enough –you really do need to understand them , whether you figure it out yourself or look them up .
On the plane trip out , I reread Programming Pearls and did the problems again , making sure I understood nuances that I had n’t noticed the first time around .
The Trip
About a week after my phone screen , I was contacted by a travel specialist who organized my trip .
I was asked to provide some basic information , such as 5 dates when I could interview .
I was nervous about this since I did n’t really want to ask for more days off from work , but I just went ahead and hoped it worked out .
Once the date was established ( nearly 3 weeks in the future ) , I was sent some documents on Microsoft ’s online careers site .
Logging in with my Live ID account , I filled out forms specifying my travel preferences , chose travel dates and times ( I picked early the morning before , a Sunday , and to leave the morning after the interview ) .
I also chose a rental car since I did n’t want to rely on a taxi .
Microsoft makes all of the arrangements for you once you fill out this form .
On July 27 , my wife took me to the airport for the direct flight to Seattle .
It was a 5 - hour trip , during which I re-read the entire Programming Pearls book .
I had an aisle seat .
At Seattle , I picked up the rental car from Avis–an SUVish Ford .
Redmond is about a 30 minute trip up the highway and thankfully it was easy to get there .
I had printed directions before I left home .
I did drive right by the hotel without realizing it , and had to circle around –they ’re a little back from the road , and the single sign was facing the opposite direction .
After I checked in , I went out almost immediately to find Microsoft .
It was right across the street .
I needed to find building 19 , which is about a 5 minute trip .
I then went to Azteca , a Mexican restaurant near the hotel .
It was good food –too much , but very good .
Microsoft pays for your food –keep your receipts .
When I checked into the hotel , they told me that I could get any food from the little shop or order in and Microsoft will pay for it .
I did n’t make as much use of it as I could have .
I did n’t want to binge on junk on the theory that a healthy body is a healthy mind .
After eating lunch , I went back to the hotel to study for the rest of the afternoon .
I went through the rest of the list of problems I had printed out .
I was so exhausted by the evening , being 3 hours behind my home time zone .
I had some chips and juice for dinner , and went to bed at 8 .
I knew it was early , but I thought I could sleep for 12 hours .
Nope .
I woke up at 3:30 am the next morning .
Oops .
I got up , read a bit , exercised until I was bored , took a long , long shower , ate a big breakfast , and reviewed a few other coding questions .
At 9:15 I gave up and left the room .
My appointment was with the staffing representative at 10:00 .
I was there at 9:20 .
One thing I noticed –lots and lots of diversity .
People from all over the world walking around .
I reviewed a few things some more and went into building 19 at 9:40 .
I got my name badge at reception and then sat down , eventually moving over to the Microsoft Surface that they had set up .
The Surface is an awesome piece of machinery .
There are a number of demo apps which are a ton of fun to play with .
There were games , a piano , and some graphical visualizations that all interacted with multiple fingers at a time .
They also have a number of PCs and an X - Box 360 , which had a couple of people playing Rock Band on it .
A little after 10 , my representative came out to meet me .
He said he only had 30 minutes to talk , but I think we talked for almost an hour .
We discussed fairly typical HR - type things .
He went over some numbers related to Microsoft , then leadership of the teams from Live Search on down to the team I would be interviewing for .
He discussed benefits , and then explained the day ’s events .
He gave me a piece of paper with an interview schedule that went through the 2 - 3 pm slot .
He said , “ I ca n’t tell you who comes after this .
If you do well , the last interviewer will take you to the next person .
If you do n’t do so well , they ’ll take you back here and we ’ll talk about it . ”
Yikes .
When we were done , he escorted me outside to a waiting Prius , part of their shuttle fleet that anyone can use to go among the various parts of the campus .
I was headed to building 88 .
The Day of Interviews
This is the part where I ’m sure I ’m going to disappoint some people because I ’m not going to tell you the specific problems they asked me .
I do n’t think that ’s fair , and there would n’t be much point anyway .
I may tell you a rough description just to give you an idea .
Each interview followed a similar pattern : discuss your work , tell me about [ software engineering topic ] and your experience with it , now let ’s do a coding problem .
Sometimes I did a problem quickly and they made the problem more complicated , or gave me a completely separate one .
I was not asked riddle - type questions .
I was not asked dumb , typical HR - type questions ( “ What ’s your biggest weakness ? ” ) .
Between every interview they will talk to each other and they will send e-mails to the other people in the interview loop .
Yes , they ’re talking about you behind your back .
And yes , they will tailor future questions to cover areas missed by previous interviewers , or to follow up on a weakness .
Also , not every interviewer is on the team you ’re interviewing for .
I liked this because it gave me an opportunity to learn more about other groups .
In the first interview , the coding problem was to generate a well - known data set .
I first considered how to generate the nth iteration of the dataset , but she quickly steered me to solving iterations 1 - n ( which is much easier ) .
I went over the algorithm in my head and out loud , before writing any code .
Then I wrote the simplest , naive code that I could think of .
I immediately saw some inefficiencies and worked to address them .
She prodded me slightly to the answer she was looking for ( I would have gotten there ) .
The first interviewer was also my lunch escort .
We went to a cafeteria in a nearby building .
I got a salad–not trusting my stomach for too much more .
The food is not free , but it seems pretty cheap ( coming from DC ) .
The drinks are free .
I got water .
During lunch , I spent most of the time asking her questions about what she does , working at Microsoft , and the Redmond area .
After lunch , she took me back to the lobby to wait for the next interview .
I took the opportunity to use the restroom and look at the art ( there is original art everywhere ) .
I liked the boat made from junk .
The interview after lunch was with the same person who gave me the phone screen –the dev lead for the team .
He asked me if I had looked at the project they work on , and as soon as I said I had , he asked me what I thought they could do better , or features to implement .
I was prepared with some intelligent things I noticed ( which luckily coincided with some of the things he had first noticed when he joined the team ) .
We talked for a bit about software engineering , testing , and task “ chunk ” size –i.e. , how big of a task am I comfortable accepting at a time .
This was an interesting topic which I had n’t really considered before , but after a little time understanding the question I used my experience to give an honest answer .
He gave me two coding problems .
Actually , before that he had asked me if I had ever done a certain problem and I answered that I had .
So he gave me another one –a geometry / graphics - related question ( not too deep ) .
I had seen the problem before when taking computer graphics in college , and I knew the form of the answer .
I just had to write specific code .
Then I had to explain as many test cases as I could for the function .
That problem did n’t take too long so he gave me another–a function to score a round in a certain game ( one that I had n’t played for a long , long time ) .
He explained the rules , I explained them back as I understood them , and then I verbally sketched an algorithm to solve it .
I wrote the naive code , fixed some algorithm mistakes and inefficiencies and I was done .
I think I did well on this .
Then he took me to my next interview , which was the dreaded 2 - 3 pm one .
The same pattern ensued .
This was a maze problem , and though I struggled a little solving it , I had immediately known that depth - first search was the way to tackle it , which was what he was looking for .
And …what happened next ?
Was I done ?
Do I get to continue until 5 pm or am I done ?
He took me to the next interview . 🙂
The next one might possibly have been my favorite .
The guy I talked to had a lot of patent cubes , so I asked him about those and what his previous projects were .
He then asked me a very interesting conceptual / coding problem about how to design a filter for the Live Search engine .
We talked through it , and I came to a decent solution , which I then had to code .
Definitely the most interesting problem of the day .
Then on to the next …it ’s 5 pm now .
They ’re offering me food , but I ’m politely declining because I just do n’t eat in high stress situations like this .
That might be bad , but it worked for me .
A little bit of talk about software engineering practices , working in a team , etc .
Then he gave me an array - summation problem .
I was very familiar with this problem and explained that I knew a naive way , but that it would n’t work in all cases ( i.e. , bad input ) .
He asked me to explain the problems , which I did .
It was more like a discussion .
He then gave me a tree - related problem , which I solved very quickly because I had practiced the exact problem before .
Then he made it harder .
He gave me a hint which at first confused me , but once I understood what he meant , I grasped the solution .
It ’s now 6 pm .
I was sure I ’d be done .
There are fewer people in the halls now .
The day is over .
He takes me to the next interview .
This is with the boss .
The dev lead ’s boss .
I ’m unsure of his exact title , but he was in charge of the team I was interviewing for and one other .
We talked for 45 minutes without a hint of coding .
This was a wide - ranging discussion about everything from MS benefits to housing to traffic to the future of the team , the impact of Yahoo , comparison to Google , and culture at Microsoft .
I gained a lot of insight and appreciation for what they ’re doing .
At one point he started talking salaries and benefits , and I got extremely excited and I had to fight to keep a smile off my face ( hey , I do n’t want to look like a dork too early ) .
I was thinking that they were definitely going to make me an offer .
Then he said other things which made me come back to reality .
Finally , jokingly , almost reluctantly , he said he may be obligated to give me a coding problem , so let ’s do a quick one .
Looking back , this should have been the easiest problem of the day , but I just got off track and missed the ( now , painfully - ) obvious solution .
It was a problem about finding the nearest object in a geographic region .
I cringed when he suggested the golden hint to me , and my thought was DUH .
Maybe it was too late and I was tired .
Finally , at about 7:30 pm I was done .
He called the shuttle dispatch and walked me out , where we chatted for a few minutes before I insisted he did n’t have to wait with me .
Aftermath
I drove to the hotel and called my wife .
I was elated .
I knew I had n’t been perfect , but I had just gone through a 9.5 hr interview .
That could n’t be bad .
I thought for sure I was going to get an offer .
I ordered some Thai food from a delivery service , which I ate starting at 9 pm .
I watched a little TV , then went to sleep .
I woke up at 4 am the next morning to head to the airport for an early flight home .
It had been a very long day .
The next day I talked to the staffing guy ( the one who had started my interview day ) about the experience .
He was very … confusing ?
not sure how to describe my interaction with him .
He told me that they were very happy with me and I did very well , and yet some of the feedback indicated slightly weaker coding than someone else they were interviewing .
He needed to hear back from the team about the other person before a final decision was made .
Needless to say , this was not what I wanted to hear .
I was pretty upset about it so my wife and I indulged in a little night out dinner to assuage the disappointment .
I was sure I was not going to get the offer .
Two days later , I was at work when I got an e-mail from him .
They are going to make me an offer !
I quickly left the room ( I share it with a co-worker ) and called my wife .
She was ecstatic .
I was ecstatic .
I was not expecting it , after the previous conversation .
Looking back ( and considering other conversations ) , I wonder if he was trying to gauge my dedication and desire for the job .
My other , more cynical , thought was that he was trying to prep me to take a lower salary or not negotiate as hard because I must have “ just squeaked by . ”
Maybe it ’s just to make victory all the more sweeter .
Most likely he was on the level , but I do wonder … it just seemed odd .
That night when he called , I was feeling pretty miserable because I think I was food poisoned that day –I was feeling horrible–vision was literally shaking–very scary .
But I kept it together and we talked benefits , salary , relocation , and the next steps .
We did the “ what - salary - do - you - want / what - is - your - offer ” dance , which I lost of course .
Does anyone get an offer without stating their expectations first ?
In any case , the formal offer was worked out over the next few days .
I was on vacation in Utah when I got it ( all electronic ) .
It was acceptable and I am now going to be a Microsoft employee in September !
Random Thoughts
I ’m going to go work on a team that is a direct competitor to Google , and they are a very significant challenge .
Microsoft has a lot to do to catch up to Google , but there is something exhilarating about working for the underdog .
Even once the technology is better than Google ’s , there is significant mind share that needs to be won .
We all have our work cut out for us .
This is completely subjective and I ’m biased , but I thought the people I interacted with at Microsoft were nicer than at Google .
Maybe it ’s because I did better , maybe it was my attitude , or maybe I was lucky with the people I spoke to .
When I drove up to the Microsoft campus the first day , it felt right .
There ’s a lot to do in the next month–prepare the move , finish up stuff at work , prepare to buy a house , gear myself up for a difficult , demanding , but rewarding job–it will be a lot of work , but hopefully fun at the same time .
Tips
My tips for the Google interview experience apply here .
In addition :
Be enthusiastic .
I got the distinct impression that they value this highly .
Demonstrate it with your projects , your interests , your conversation , and even your tone of voice .
That last is a hard one for me , especially over the phone .
I ’m enthusiastic , but I definitely have a hard time showing it verbally .
Practice , practice , practice .
Spend a lot of time practicing with pen and paper .
Write out every search algorithm by heart .
About half the problems they asked me are in the two books I recommended above .
But beware that they ’re going to expect you to go beyond those problems .
Consider these problems as refreshers in basic computer science , not a primer to help you get the job .
Know your computer science .
If you do n’t understand serious computer science , memorizing answers to lists of problems is n’t going to help you .
Understand recursive and iterative solutions to common problems .
Know data structures , big- O , and common algorithms .
Know what methods and data structures can be used to solve which problems .
You probably wo n’t be asked about advanced data structures or techniques –you just need to understand the basic ones really well .
Know the team .
Research as much as you can .
In my case , I knew what the project was and I could actually use it and come up with suggestions .
This may not always be possible .
If not , learn about the larger organization that you can get information for .
Have lots of intelligent questions .
Many questions I asked to most people .
Here is a sample : Favorite thing about working at Microsoft , Least favorite thing ;
My specific role .
How big the team will be grown , impact of external events , comparison to competitors , strategy , where will the team be in the future , what ’s your commute like , work - life balance , what do you work on ( since not everybody you talk to is on the same project ) , what is your specific role , what other projects have you worked on at / outside of Microsoft , why did you move to this team , and lots more .
The important thing is to be genuinely interested .
If you are , then coming up with questions on the fly is easy , and you will have a natural discussion rather than reading a script .
I moved from “ script ” to “ natural ” through the day as I became more comfortable .
You must know what you ’re talking about .
This allows you to have nice conversations instead of feeling like you ’re being quizzed .
You ’ll feel more like a peer , and hopefully so will they .
You ’ll already belong .
Also , you ca n’t fake this so do n’t try .
The interviewers at Microsoft seemed much more willing to give me instant feedback than Google was .
I could ask them what they thought of my code and they gave me honest feedback .
I appreciated this .
The book I read on the way home was The Neutronium Alchemist by Peter F. Hamilton .
It ’s the sequel to The Reality Dysfunction .
Highly recommended for sci - fi fans .
Redmond , here I come .

Jeanette Winterson on why art now matters more than ever
An American lady travelling to Paris in 1913 - the kind of American lady who will still be travelling to Paris in 2013 - asked Ezra Pound what he thought art was for .
Pound replied : " Ask me what a rose bush is for . "
Europe was on the edge of war .
Do rose bushes matter in a war ?
What can art do for us now , in the likelihood of another war ?
I know there is a sneaking feeling , even among art lovers , that art is a luxury .
While pictures , books , music and theatre are not quite handmade luggage or perfume , most people would not admit that art is essential .
The endless rows over funding centre on an insecurity about the role of art in society .
Nobody doubts that hospitals and schools must be paid for by all of us .
Mention art , and the answer seems to be that it should rely on the marketplace ; let those who want it pay for it .
Art is specialised , particular , elitist and probably bogus .
In Britain , a few old masters , Shakespeare and Dickens , Mozart and Puccini , are enough to feed the general interest in the arts .
Modern art has become a media circus ; a money - driven , prize - hungry extravaganza , dependent on marketing and spin , which may leave the public with a few extra names it recognises , but that makes everyone cynical about the product .
The word gives it away : product .
Art is being treated as a commodity .
We doubt that it is special .
Dead artists belong to the heritage industry .
Live artists belong to the PR industry .
It may be that capitalism will be as successful with art as it has been with religion , absorbing it to the point of neutrality .
Capitalism , for all its emphasis on the free market , hates competition - that is , any challenge to its system .
Anybody with a smattering of English history knows about the great conflicts between church and state .
We know that traditionally there have been been two powers : the material world and the invisible world .
God and Mammon .
Well , Mammon won the big battle , and there is no effective force in the west to challenge the dogma of capitalism .
The church at least paid lip service to a different value system to the one Margaret Thatcher hailed as " no alternative " .
Art is a different value system .
Like God , it fails us continually .
Like God , we have legitimate doubts about its existence but , like God , art leaves us with footprints of beauty .
We sense there is more to life than the material world can provide , and art is a clue , an intimation , at its best , a transformation .
We do n't need to believe in it , but we can experience it .
The experience suggests that the monolith of corporate culture is only a partial reality .
This is important information , and art provides it .
When you take time to read a book or listen to music or look at a picture , the first thing you are doing is turning your attention inwards .
The outside world , with all of its demands , has to wait .
As you withdraw your energy from the world , the artwork begins to reach you with energies of its own .
The creativity and concentration put into the making of the artwork begin to cross-current into you .
This is not simply about being recharged , as in a good night 's sleep or a holiday , it is about being charged at a completely different voltage .
When I read Seamus Heaney or Ted Hughes , I 'm not just reading a poet 's take on the world , I am entering into a different world - a world built from the beginning on other principles .
William Carlos Williams said : " It 's hard to get the news from poems , but men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there . "
Art 's counterculture , however diverse , holds in plain sight what the material world denies - love and imagination .
Art is made out of both : a passionate , reckless love of the work in its own right , as though nothing else exists , and an imaginative force that creates something new out of disparate material .
Art 's experiments are not funded by huge state programmes , venture capital , or junk bonds ; they are done when someone picks up a pen or a brush , or sits down at the piano , or takes a piece of clay and changes it for ever .
A money culture wants the figures , the bottom line , the sales , the response , it wants a return on its investment , it wants more money .
Art can offer no obvious return .
Its rate of exchange is energy for energy , intensity for intensity .
The time you spend on art is the time it spends with you ; there are no shortcuts , no crash courses , no fast tracks .
Only the experience .
Art can't change your life ; it is not a diet programme or the latest guru - it offers no quick fixes .
What art can do is prompt in us authentic desire .
By that I mean it can waken us to truths about ourselves and our lives ; truths that normally lie suffocated under the pressure of the 24 - hour emergency zone called real life .
Art can bring us back to consciousness , sometimes quietly , sometimes dramatically , but the responsibility to act on what we find is ours .
I know of a man , a Quaker , who volunteered as an ambulance driver in the second world war .
While other men had pictures of their sweethearts in their breast pockets , he carried a photo of a Queen Anne chair .
In his despair at where human folly had brought him and millions of others , he needed to remember the glory of the human spirit , as well as its loss .
Like Barbara Hepworth , he believed that art affirms and sustains life at its highest level .
He became an antique dealer because he wanted to be surrounded by what the Jews call " real presences " .
A real presence is one where spirit and body , or spirit and object , have never been separated .
It does n't matter whether we are talking a chair , a picture , a book or a human being ; what makes us feel alive is the living quality lodged there .
This quality is abundant in art .
It is the reason why art is timeless .
It is the reason why art does not date .
We do n't go to Shakespeare to find out about life in Elizabethan England ; we go to Shakespeare to find out about ourselves now .
Go and visit Antony Gormley 's Angel of the North and you will meet the same imaginative hugeness as in Chartres or Westminster Abbey .
The scale is different , the sensibility has changed , but the spirit is the same .
Mass production is about cloned objects .
Art is about individual vision .
Individuals can work together , as they must in theatre or opera , or where assistants work under a master , or they can work alone .
However it happens , art is never a factory or a production line .
Even Duchamp 's Readymades were a way of forcing us to concentrate on the thing in itself as it really is .
Capitalism does n't want you to concentrate - you might notice that much is amiss .
A blurred , out - of - focus consuming is what suits the marketplace best .
Somebody has to buy all that overproduction of useless dead objects .
In contrast , all art is live theatre .
The dialogue continues between object , maker , owner , viewer , listener , reader .
Roger Warner is 89 and he still talks to his furniture .
His daughter Deborah Warner makes the stage talk to us .
Art is a continuum , passed down from hand to hand , lost , rediscovered , found in objects as proof of a living spirit that defies the orthodoxy of materialism .
Yes , art becomes a collector 's item , or a rich man 's trophy .
Yes , art is traded for large sums of money , but this is not art 's purpose , nor its nature .
If money ceased to exist , art would continue .
If war flattened London tomorrow , someone would start to make an installation out of the rubble .
Why did the Taliban bullet down the Buddhas ?
Why did Hitler burn books ?
Why was Ulysses banned ?
Why did Franco refuse to show Guernica ?
Art is potent , confrontational , difficult .
It challenges what we are , and that is equally true of a Queen Anne chair , the Mona Lisa or Rachel Whiteread 's House .
We can muzzle the power of art in all sorts of ways - destroying or banning it is too obvious .
A favourite gag is to familiarise it so that we no longer see it ( Constable ) , or to sentimentalise it , so that we read it but do not allow it to read us ( Dickens ) .
Even better if we can just watch an adaptation on TV .
The Queen Anne chair may seem unthreatening compared with Rachel Whiteread , but before we console ourselves with its antiqueness ( ie expensive , dead ) , let 's take it into Ikea and watch some MDF look pale .
Do n't be fooled by the way capitalism co-opts art .
It pretends to do it for money , but underneath money is terror .
Terror that there might be a different way to live .
There is a different way , and it's not a William Morris utopia , or an Omega workshop niche ; it 's a celebration of the human spirit .
Art reminds us of all the possibilities we are persuaded to forget .
Peace or war , we need those alternatives .

NASA has tentatively set the final space shuttle mission for May 31 , 2010 , four months before the shuttle fleet is scheduled to retire .
NASA has 10 missions remaining for the fleet , which President George W. Bush ordered to retire by Sept. 30 , 2010 .
The schedule , announced late Monday and reported in the Houston Chronicle , includes five flights this year , five in 2009 and three in 2010 .
Some members of Congress want to add at least one more mission , to carry the $ 1.6 - billion US Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer to the space station .
The mission was one of about a dozen cancelled after Columbia broke apart upon re-entry in 2003 .
NASA told a Senate panel on June 23 that it anticipates losing 3,000 to 4,000 jobs at its launching site once the space shuttles stop flying in two more years , about half the cutback initially reported .
Although as many as 6,000 to 7,000 shuttle jobs will be eliminated at Kennedy Space Center , about 3,000 positions will open up in the new exploration program , said NASA administrator Michael Griffin .
Those jobs will be created to build and fly the new Ares rocket and Orion capsule to the international space station and , ultimately , to the moon .
It 's expected to be 2015 — five years after the last shuttle flight — before NASA 's new rocketship is ready to blast off with astronauts .
The United States will have to rely on Russians to get Americans to the space station during those five years .
It would have taken significantly more money to get the new rocketship ready earlier and narrow the five - year gap , Griffin said .
OK , so you ’re on a long road trip , you ’ve played the entire playlist in your ipod all the way through four times already and you never splurged for satellite radio .
What are you supposed to listen to ?
Well , if you ’re travelling in Japan ( see below for California update ) all you need to do is go for a jaunt down one of the “ melody roads ” .
A team from the Hokkaido Industrial Research Institute has built a number of musical roads in Japan that use your car ’s tires to produce music .
The patent - applied - for concept works by using grooves cut at very specific intervals in the road surface .
Just as travelling over small speed bumps or road markings can emit a rumbling tone throughout a vehicle , the melody road uses the spaces between to create musical notes .
Grooves are carved into the road between 6 and 12 mm apart – The closer the grooves are , the higher pitched the sound .
Apparently , the plan was to carve melodies into the roads that have some significance to the locality .
The system was the brainchild of Shizuo Shinoda , who accidentally scraped some markings into a road with a bulldozer before driving over them and realizing that he could produce a variety of tones by varying the spacing between the grooves .
There are three different melody roads in central and northern Japan – in Hokkaido , Wakayama and Gunma .
They all play different tunes , with one of them playing the melody of a Japanese pop song .
Here is a sample of what the melody road sounds like :
[ audio : http://www.noiseaddicts.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/melodyroad.mp3]
Roads are marked by colored musical notes painted on the surface of the road , which alert motorists of the impending musical interlude .
Unfortunately , you have to be going at a fairly slow speed ( 28 mph ) to get the effect at its optimum , and you need to keep the wondows closed to get the best sound .
Driving too fast will sound like the song is playing fast forward , while driving around 12 mph has a slow motion effect which can almost make you car sick .
See video here .
Update :
There USED to be a musical road in California – it was built by Honda as a publicity stunt .
Unfortunately , Lancaster , CA residents complained that it drove them crazy because they could hear it constantly ( the Lone Ranger theme ) , so they recently paved over it September 23 , 2008 .
Update ( Oct 7,2010 ) :
The Lancaster musical road still exist but now it is on Avenue G and 30th west just north of the freeway in the fast lane .
Here ’s a video of the original road .
The Pipeline War : Russian bear goes for West 's jugular
The war in Georgia escalated dangerously last night after Russian jets reportedly bombed a vital pipeline that supplies oil to the West .
After a day of heightening international tensions , Georgian leaders claimed that the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline , which transports oil from the Caspian Sea to Turkey , had been attacked .
But it is thought the bombs missed their target .
Their claims came after Russian jets struck deep into the territory of its tiny neighbour , killing civilians and ‘ completely devastating ’ the strategic Black Sea port of Poti , a staging post for oil and other energy supplies .
Reports last night also said that Russia had bombed the international airport in Tbilisi .
A bloodied woman lies injured in the ruins of an apartment block in Gori after another Russian air strike
Georgian economic development minister Ekaterina Sharashidzne said : ‘ This clearly shows that Russia has targeted not just Georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets as well . ’
The pipeline is 30 per cent owned by BP and supplies 1 per cent of the world ’s oil needs , pumping up to a million barrels of crude per day to Turkey .
It is crucial to the world ’s volatile energy market and the only oil and gas route that bypasses Russia ’s stranglehold on energy exports from the region .
As President Bush led the West in intensifying pressure on Russia to halt the bombing in Georgia last night , the two countries were edging closer to full - scale war over their conflicting claims for disputed territory .
Under attack : Georgian soldiers in the town of Gori sprint past a block of flats destroyed by a Russian bomber
Georgia ’s President Mikheil Saakashvili called for a ceasefire and accused Moscow of mounting an unprovoked invasion that put ‘ the entire post - Cold War order of Europe and the world at stake ’ .
But Moscow said that the conflict could not be resolved unless Georgia withdrew from its breakaway region of South Ossetia .
The alarming developments followed a second day of drama and bloodshed in the pro-Western country in which :
• Russian jets widened the offensive by bombing the central Georgian town of Gori – Joseph Stalin ’s birthplace – in an attack on military targets that Georgian authorities claimed killed 60 civilians , and attacked the port of Poti .
• Georgia claimed that Russian troops had opened a new front by moving into another disputed province , Abkhazia , which has also suffered from ethnic tensions .
• Georgia declared a state of war , recalled all its 2,000 troops from Iraq and ordered a mass call - up with reservists being sent to the war zone to ‘ defend the motherland ’ .
• Russia claimed that it had ‘ completely liberated ’ the capital of South Ossetia Tskhinvali – a claim denied by Georgia – after flying in elite troops in an operation Moscow said was intended to force Georgia into a ceasefire .
• Georgia claimed to have shot down 12 Russian combat aircraft – but Moscow confirmed that only two planes were missing .
• Georgia may pull its 35 - strong Olympic team out of the Beijing games because of the Russian military attacks , the country ’s National Olympic Committee said .
Anguish : A man cradles the body of a relative in the street after Russian planes bomb homes in Gori , killing five people
The forces of the two countries first clashed on Friday after Moscow sent hundreds of troops and armed convoys across the border into South Ossetia to repel a Georgian attack on rebels allied to Moscow .
Almost 40,000 refugees have already fled to Russia from the fighting , threatening a humanitarian catastrophe .
Tskhinvali was said to have been ‘ almost destroyed ’ in onslaughts by both sides .
Bodies lay in the streets and hospitals were overwhelmed with wounded .
Most of the 70,000 South Ossetians hold Russian passports and are allied to Moscow , while Georgia is an ally of the US and has applied to join Nato .
Russian bombers yesterday widened the offensive to force Georgian troops back from South Ossetia by bombing .
Devastation : Troops search a wrecked building for survivors
In his first Press conference since the conflict broke out early yesterday , President Saakashvili said : ‘ I call for an immediate ceasefire .
Russia has launched a full - scale military invasion of Georgia . ’
He reacted furiously to the air strikes on Gori and Poti , saying that it was comparable to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan .
He also alleged that Russian troops were opening up another front , adding : ‘ Hours ago Russia ’s Black Sea fleet started to move into Georgia ’s territory in Abkhazia .
Russian troops and heavy equipment are in upper Abkhazia . ’
He said Russia was conducting ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Ossetia and Abkhazia ’s Kodoro Gorge region .
Fleeing : A boy and a woman stare in terror at the carnage from a vehicle as they are evacuated from South Ossetia
The Georgian Parliament has approved a declaration for a ‘ state of war ’ for 15 days after at least 2,000 civilians were killed in fighting between Russia and the former Soviet satellite .
Overnight , two Russian planes were shot down and 12 of its soldiers were killed – along with more civilians who died during fighting in South Ossetia .
Russian fighter jets carried out up to five raids on mostly military targets around Gori – close to the conflict zone in South Ossetia – but at least one bomb is thought to have hit an apartment , killing five civilians , according to reports .
The Foreign Office upgraded its travel advice to urge against all but essential travel to Georgia .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband was under mounting pressure to consider breaking off his summer holiday to tackle the mounting crisis .
Mr Miliband , on holiday in Minorca , issued his first statement on the the affair late yesterday to call for a ceasefire ‘ and for peace talks to start as soon as possible ’ .
He also announced that he was sending Sir Brian Fall , the Foreign Office representative for the South Caucasus , to Georgia as part of an EU peace mission .
Defence Minister Des Browne said a delegation of EU , US and Nato officials was flying to the Georgian capital ‘ to broker a ceasefire ’ .
The move caps two days of faltering diplomatic activity , in which members of the United Nations Security Council have struggled to convene an emergency meeting .
Belgium ’s UN Ambassador Jan Grauls , who chairs the 15 - member council this month , had spoken to his Russian and American counterparts .
‘ Depending on how much progress is made in these bilaterals , we will decide whether we can call a full council meeting , ’ his spokesman said .
President Bush expressed alarm about the escalating conflict and called on Russia to respect Georgia ’s territorial integrity .
In Beijing , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was seen to approach President Bush in the Olympic stadium , where they were attending the opening ceremony .
The Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said he witnessed a heated discussion between the two leaders .
‘ The President and Mr Putin were in an animated conversation two seats in front of us and I imagine they had a few things on their agenda , ’ he said .
Mr Putin later accused Georgia of seeking ‘ bloody adventures ’ and trying to drag other countries into a military conflict in South Ossetia .
‘ Georgia ’s aspiration to join Nato ... is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures , ’ Mr Putin said during a meeting in the Russian city of Vladikavkaz , some of which was shown on TV .
Mr Putin defended Russia ’s incursion into South Ossetia and urged Georgia to halt ‘ aggression ’ against the breakaway region .
‘ From a legal point of view , Russia ’s actions in South Ossetia are totally legitimate , ’ said Putin , who flew to the city after attending the opening of the Olympics .
‘ We urge the Georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against South Ossetia , to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal rights and interests of other people . ’
Soon afterwards the US , Nato and the EU called for an immediate end to the fighting and the UN Security Council convened a tense emergency session to try to prevent all - out war .
Georgian forces say they have fought off attacks by Abkhazian separatists , backed by Russian air raids , in the Kodori Gorge region .
Russian forces invaded Abkhazia hours after taking control of most of South Ossetia , said President Saakashvili .
As the conflict escalated rapidly , Mr Saakashvili said his country had formally moved to a state of war and offered an immediate ceasefire .
He said Moscow had been planning the assault for months , accused Russia of actions similar to Stalin ’s invasion of Finland in 1939 and said ‘ the entire post - Cold War order of Europe and the world is at stake ’ .
Foreign journalists witnessed an air attack on the town of Gori early yesterday morning and the Georgian government claimed Russian bombers had ‘ completely devastated ’ the Black Sea port of Poti .
Russia has reportedly started to bomb civil and economic infrastructure , including the military base at Senaki .
Up to 11 Russian jets reportedly hit container tanks and a shipbuilding plant at Poti .
Moscow has announced it would send reinforcements into South Ossetia and President Dmitry Medvedev has pledged to ‘ force the Georgian side to peace ’ .
Colonel Igor Konashenkov , a Russian infantry officer , said units of the 58th army had arrived in Tskhinvali overnight and would seek to ‘ establish peace .
Additional ‘ special units ’ would arrive ‘ in the next few hours ’ .
Columns of Russian tanks plunged the two neighbours into war as they filed into South Ossetia yesterday , marking the Kremlin ’s first military assault on foreign soil since the Afghanistan intervention , which ended in 1989 .
South Ossetia won de-facto independence in a war that ended in 1992 but has been a source of tension ever since .
Russian peacekeepers have suffered 15 dead and 150 wounded , the peacekeeping forces were quoted as saying by Russian news agencies .
‘ Now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the Georgian army in the southern region of Tskhinvali , ’ a representative of the Russian force was quoted as saying by Interfax .
Lyudmila Ostayeva , 50 , who fled with her family to Dzhava , a village near the border with Russia , said : ‘ I saw bodies lying on the streets , around ruined buildings and in cars .
It ’s impossible to count them now . ’
The greatest mismatch in history of war
Georgia ’s war with Russia is a David and Goliath battle that , military experts say , the Black Sea state has no chance of winning .
The Georgians are outnumbered and outgunned in every department .
Russia has about 697,000 troops , while Georgia has only 19,500 full - time regulars .
And with Russia ’s 1,200 combat aircraft confronting Georgia ’s seven outmoded support planes , and 6,000 tanks against 100 ageing machines , there is no contest .
Matthew Clements , Eurasia editor for Jane ’s Defence journal , said last night : ‘ The Georgian military cannot withstand a full Russian assault .
' The Russians have total air superiority and their coordinated operation gives the Georgians no chance of resisting . ’

A card trick is considered the embryonic first step in the world of legerdemain .
Although sawing a person in half or defying the laws of gravity will get you the opening spot at Ballys , card tricks are the canvas clutch or blue blazer of the magic world : you can take them anywhere .
Whether you decide to dress it up or dress it down , a card trick is effective to show people something that they dont know and that is that is how everything begins .
As any good Buddhist will tell you , the destination is not important , its the journey .
This works as well within the elegant act of an effective card trick because how you get to the big finish is critical to your ultimate success .
If you didnt care , just wave a deck of cards in front of someone and tell them to think of a card but not to tell you .
So , as the mark finally settles on a card , you tell them the correct card and walk away .
Although it is impressive to run counter to all things logical , the trick basically fails because it is not dramatic enough because no one gets to play their assigned roles .
The conversation would be roughly like this :
The magician says ,  Think of a card but dont tell me . 
A deck of cards are waved passively in front of their non-gaping yaws .
The mark thinks of a card and lets the magician know with some sign that they have made their mental selection .
The magician says with minimal emotion ,  Is the card the ten of diamonds ? 
The mark wakes up and says ,  Why , yes it is !
How did you do that ?
 It s magic ,  says the magician while walking away .
The trick does all the heavy lifting but the magician fails to involve the audience with the concept of magic .
The end game is to impress the mark but there is so much more to do between the declaration and the money shot .
The tension has to build and the mark needs to fully appreciate the task of seeing things unseen .
If the mark is only bemused at the crescendo , it is the sole fault of the magician .
The trick needs romance and mystery ; not just some pedestrian pick a card patter .
The first part of any great card trick starts with always keeping the deck moving from one spot to another during the setup .
This accomplishes a key ingredient to successfully card tricks ; establishing and maintaining a nice momentum at all times during the act .
However , the desire to move for movements sake is not the same thing .
Although people do not want things to sit there like lumps ; they want to see things flying without detection and create new ideas out of old , ashy thoughts but with aplomb , not frenetic , amateurish mannerisms .
Secondly , when declaring knowledge of something that is technically magic , one cannot impart this knowledge half - heartedly .
The magician has to confidentially proclaim this talent without qualification and with an unabashed excitement that something new and wondrous is going to be offered .
The trick is the destination but the presentation and the set - up is the more worthwhile achievement .
People want tension created but only then they can enjoy the resolution of tension at the apex of your self - made crescendo when your trick finally completes .
A true magician friend once said to me in a Mahanoro bar that people hated lying but loved trickery .
 People know the card didnt disappear ,  said my friend .
 Even fools know things dont disappear , they are hidden for a period of time .
 So , why do you use the term disappear to explain something that it doesnt do ? 
 Because , my friend , anyone can hide something , if given enough time and opportunity .
Magicians are held to a higher standard of the definition .
Or , at least they are supposed to be held to that standard . 
 So ,  I asked seeking simple enlightenment , dont be afraid to accentuate the positive ? 
" That is pretty close , but I would say that it is easier to get people to pay attention when you make it sound interesting .
He showed me a few simple tricks that at first impression were very effective .
Knives appeared out of loafs of bread ; a cut napkin was pristinely uninjured and other types of table magic that left me intrigued and ashamed because I thought I knew my way around a dinner table .
I asked to see them again .
 No , you have already seen them ,  said my friend .
 To see them again is to diminish them .
These are elementary childs tricks and do not hold up well to adult scrutiny .
Just dig the table magic and move on .
I protested but he waved his hand at me .
 These are stupid , childlike tricks and if I show you how they work , you will be very disappointed .
 How do you know ? 
 Because , when I was a little boy , I was disappointed when I finally saw them repeated over and over again .
My brother showed me the tricks at the kitchen table and I kept asking him to repeat them until I figured out how they worked . 
 I felt great for about one minute ; then I was disappointed that the tricks were just clumsy sleight of hand and misdirection .
When he showed me how pushed his knife through the bread , I was embarrassed because it was so simple and I was so stupid .
The angle made it look like the blade was emerging from the bread but in actuality , he had just slid the knife up his sleeve and pushed it through . 
 And what happened next ?
Did he show you more solutions to the magic ? 
 I told him that I was sorry and stopped asking how things worked .
I knew that all I would feel is either sad or stupid .
But I really wanted it to be magical ; not a trick relying on my stupidity , lack of concentration or a lame combination of both . 
I decided to order another round and change the subject .
Card tricks have been around roughly ten minutes after the invention of the deck of playing cards and once the nomenclature and color palettes were determined , the first slight of hand was generated on the same afternoon .
The first deck of cards was created and one person is the room said to the other person is the room  I bet I can guess what card you have in your hand  and a new world opened up .
As a result , one of the first tools for the beginning magician is a deck of cards .
To make magic happen , you need to use common household items and allow , through your skills , the item to transcend time .
The orderly squads of four suits combined with their easily - understood ranks makes all card tricks more exciting but the beauty is not coming from the epiphany of recognition but from the adrenaline caused by circumventing both the general laws of physics as well as the space - time continuum .
Being the magician , even for this one trick , brings along with it a responsibility to guide the viewer through a series of simplifying assumptions .
The viewer must agree that the general premise is a challenge : to pick a card out of a shuffled unseen deck is statistically tricky and the magician technically has a one in fifty - two chance of getting it right .
However , if you proclaim that you can pick three cards out a deck , the odds move quickly up to one hundred and thirty - two thousand to one and that is not bad for a parlor trick .
Of course , one could actually beat those odds but to knowingly taunt statistics is like putting for par : you can do it every once in awhile but it is nt healthy to do it too many times without running risks up the metaphysical wazoo .
This card trick allows you ( the magician ) to pick three cards from a full deck ( or as many decks as you wish ) by calling out each card prior to the individual harvest .
You state with a confident air that you , and only you , can see into the future and through walls and calmly pick the three cards without regard to common sense or logical thought .
The first step is to procure a deck of cards that is the marks property as using your own deck will immediately raise suspicion .
Luckily most people do not have a deck of cards at the ready so encourage your audience to provide them at their convenience .
In the interim while the mark roots through several kitchen junk drawers , continue to make broad and bravado - filled proclamations that you will eventually amaze and astound them once they come around with the cards .
However , always beware anyone who pulls a deck out of their pocket but even in front of degenerative gamblers , it is a good bet that the trick works .
Allow the mark or marks to shuffle the deck to their collective hearts content .
You have to remain engaged enough to notice the shuffling but your attention to the act is nt essential .
As we all know , people are segmented into two categories : good shufflers and brutal , simpish shufflers .
As the distribution continues , encourage any other audience members to get into the game by shuffling a few times themselves .
In fact , as the magician , the more shuffling acts the better .
Once the deck is reorganized to the collective satisfaction of the mark , take the deck from the table and prepare to fan it across the surface .
As you pick up the deck , look straight ahead into the eyes of your audience and re-adjust the deck at the same time .
Your goal is to see the bottom card and for this demonstration ; lets assume it is the eight of hearts .
This provides the genesis of the tricks success : if you know the bottom card , you will be able to accomplish the trick .
If you were unsuccessful in learning the bottom card , you may hope for a reflection from the surface below or hand the deck to any audience member and ask them if they are satisfied with the state of the deck .
This allows you another chance to ascertain the bottom cards identity .
If you have failed to get the cards identity , you can still salvage a majority of the cards but it is moderately apparent to this writer that you are likely an idiot .
Let 's assume for the sake of not beating a dead magical horse and armed with the assumption that somehow you will eventually know the specific bottom card , the trick can continue .
The next phase needs the mastery of a critical skill : the ability to fan out a deck .
Luckily , this is a skill that anyone with a horizontal surface can eventually master given enough time and patience .
An elegant wave of your hand must present a balanced and concentric semi-circle with no card jutting out or appearing out of place : these fifty - two cards must be faced down , orderly and all organized with an easy elegance .
Finally mastering the fan , you have to remember to repeat your declaration that you are on the verge of initiating the worlds greatest card trick  while the marks gather around to experience your definition of wonderment .
After waiting for the crowd to re-focus on you , begin with describing the trick with a quiet confident .
At this moment , the crowd does not know what the worlds greatest trick involves so you need to educate them .
You allow the sound to mute and then look in the eyes of each person and declare ,  I will be selecting three cards out of the deck without ever seeing them . 
In and of itself , a declaration of that magnitude should get everyones attention .
The pause before moving into the trick allows the audience time to try to decipher or determine how you are going to do it .
By this time , you can remind them that the deck was likely shuffled within an inch of its inert life and momentarily pausing to seek any questions ( none should be forthcoming ) ; it is time for the show .
Feel free to repeat the mantra of  I will be selecting three cards out of the deck without ever seeing them  at anytime during the trick because it is effective in keeping folks engaged .
In fact , ask someone to write down the three cards so they have now an accountable record of accuracy that will scrutinize your actions .
However , fear not , because your trick transcends mere mortal scribblings .
The cards are now fanned and if there is a God , you had the time to identify the bottom card and we have agreed to use the eight of hearts as our generic identifier for instructional purposes .
It is time to take an inventory of what you know and the inventory is minimal : the bottom card is the eight of hearts and you have no idea the identity of the other fifty - one cards .
However , since most magicians are trick glass - half full sorts , the one card will be plenty .
When you have completed the fan , review the deck to make sure that any card you wish to pick up during the selection phase is easily grabbed and the bottom card ( eight of hearts ) must be also ready to go .
You cannot delay or fumble the card pick - ups because that will cause the audience to start thinking ; that is nt good .
Review the card fan and if you wish , pass your index finger over the semi-circle to double check that any card you decide to grab will come to you with no incident .
The next step is finally simple : declare the first card you will pick is the eight of hearts  and grab a card in the middle or first half of the fan .
It doesnt matter what the card is at this time but just grab it , look at it , subtly nod and place the card off to the side but ideally , in your shirt pocket or a hat .
Do not let anyone see it because it is magic time .
For our narrative , lets say the card is the ten of spades even though the audience is assuming it is the eight of hearts .
At this time , it doesnt matter because you said three cards and if asked or challenged , smile and say  the more cards , the more magic . 
Now , step three is to point at another card , located somewhere different that your first selection and not too close to the bottom ( or end ) card ( the real eight of hearts ) .
You now point at the second card and say ,  The ten of spades . 
Take the next card , subtlety nod and place the second card in the pocket or pile and resume your search .
For this example , lets assume the third card is the ace of diamonds and we are finally coming to the end of the trick .
You move down to the last card and let your finger meander around for awhile ; allow it to circumnavigate the fan and once an appropriate amount of time has passed , state that your next card is the ace of diamonds and quickly scoop up the original eight of hearts .
In laymans terms , you were piggybacking one card ahead but finishing with the only known card in the deck .
Since all three cards are in your pocket , you eliminate the curious individual who sees their selected order .
Keep the cards close and move them around a bit in your hand with homage to Judy Holliday .
Once satisfied , request the group to parrot back the three cards and each time they name the playing card : drop it on the surface and watch the mouths drop .
You will feel a rush of adrenaline and enjoy the warm feeling of success ; it doesnt last long .
Now , while you are flush with the confidence that only comes with a successful trick , there are several dogmatic standards of the post - trick world that need compliance .
The first is not to show the trick more than one more time : if you continually repeat the trick , the pattern of grabbing the bottom card as your last card will become obvious .
When asked to repeat the trick , allow some time to pass to allow your new street cred to gain some momentum .
Shooting your magical wad too early leaves you with nothing when they demand more .
The second rule was stated early on in this primer ; dont tell them how it works .
If someone insists , make every attempt to mitigate the curiosity because if you decide to tell one person , remember they are not bound by any magician code and will likely begin to blather the secrets of the trick to an audience that may be quite content in allowing things to remain magical .
One person will tell another person and it will all unravel before your eyes : your audience immediately evolved from happy person with some wonderment to a group of people that feel either stupid or momentarily superior .
The third rule is the toughest because rarely can we be superior to others and when you know something they dont know ; it is easy to drive a schism between the haves and have nots ( or in this case , the knows and the knows not ) .
The urge to let the audience know they are stupid but you have to preserve their dignity .
You have worked very hard to get them to trust you and you can throw it all away by turning on them when they are their most vulnerable .
Take a bow and leave the room : the show is over .

One of the biggest benefits to using ejabberd is the ease with which it is possible to extend the server ’s functionality .
After only a week of production operation , I ’ve already written and deployed four new modules at Chesspark .
Let ’s get our hands dirty , fire up an editor , and learn how to write a new ejabberd module .
Unlike most tutorials , the module created here is a real piece of code that we have running in production at Chesspark .
Getting Started
The code presented here is in Erlang , which is what ejabberd is written in .
If you are unfamiliar with Erlang , you will probably still be able to follow along just fine .
If you have a question about Erlang syntax or an Erlang function , the Erlang Web site has tutorials and reference documentation for your enlightenment .
Anders Conbere has written a series of excellent tutorials on writing ejabberd modules at his blog : building ejabberd , writing a generic module , writing an HTTP module , and writing an XMPP bot module .
I will assume that that you have read at least his tutorial on generic modules .
Finally , there is some incomplete documentation about developing ejabberd modules in the ejabberd wiki .
Stopping Storms With A Little mod_sunshine
During our ejabberd migration , we ran into a bug in our desktop client that caused it to send the same presence stanza over and over in an infinite loop .
While providing an updated build of the client solved the problem for many of our users , some users refused to upgrade .
Not only did this cause a lot of undue stress on our XMPP server , it also affected all of the broken client ’s user ’s online contacts .
These presence storms were silently degrading the service quality for nearly everyone .
We decided that the best solution would be to detect presence storms and disconnect the offending clients .
This required writing a fairly simple ejabberd module that I named mod_sunshine .
We ’ll recreate the same code here .
mod_sunshine ’s Humble Beginnings
Every ejabberd module implements the gen_mod behavior .
An Erlang behavior is just a set of functions that a module implementing the behavior is required to support .
The gen_mod behavior requires two functions : start / 2 and stop / 1 .
These functions are called when ejabberd starts and stops the module .
The skeleton of an ejabberd module appears below .
- module ( mod_sunshine ) . - behavior ( gen_mod ) . - export ( [ start / 2 , stop /1 ] ) .
start ( _Host , _ Opts ) -> ok. stop( _Host ) -> ok .
For those of you wondering , the preceding underscores on the function arguments signal to the Erlang compiler that these arguments are unused .
This code should be placed in a file called mod_sunshine.erl .
Assuming you have Erlang and ejabberd somewhere on your system , you can compile mod_sunshine .erl with this command : erlc - I / path/to/src_or_include -pz /path/to/src_or_ebin mod_sunshine.erl .
This module can be added to the server by adding a line like the one below to the server configuration .
You ’ll also need to place the module ’s . beam file in the ejabberd ebin directory alongside the rest of ejabberd ’s . beam files .
{mod_sunshine , [ ]}
Hooks , Hooks , and More Hooks
ejabberd modules extend functionality of the server by connecting themselves to hooks .
A hook is just a place in the code where ejabberd offers a connection point .
There are hooks for when a user sends a packet or receives a packet , for when sessions are created or removed , and for many other things .
A list of hooks can be found in the ejabberd events and hooks documentation .
Each hook in ejabberd is associated with a chain of functions to execute .
ejabberd modules will add functions to these chains , and when the hook is triggered , the chain of functions is executed .
Each function has a priority in the chain , and ejabberd will execute them in order .
Additionally , it is possible for a function to terminate the hook processing so that later functions in the chain do not get executed .
ejabberd modules typically add some functions to one or more of these hook chains and then wait around for them to be executed .
This is very similar to GUI code where one responds to input events , only instead of mouse clicks and keyboard presses , modules will respond to packets being sent or users coming online .
Just to make sure you fully understand the hook processing and the function chains , let ’s go through an example .
Passing Around Offline Messages
When a message comes into an ejabberd server for a user that is currently offline , ejabberd executes the chain of functions for the hook offline_message_hook .
The ejabberd session manager adds a default function to the offline_message_hook chain that bounces the incoming message with a service unavailable error .
This hook is added at the lowest priority so that it executes after anything else in the chain .
The mod_offline module , which comes with ejabberd , uses this same hook to add support for storing offline messages in a database .
These messages are then sent to a user when they next come online .
It does this by adding a function to the chain at a higher priority than the session manager ’s .
When a message gets sent to an offline user , this function executes first and stores the message in the database .
Since it would be silly to return an error now that the message has been stored , mod_offline ‘s function signals to the hook processor that no more functions should be run in this chain .
The session manager ’s default function will never be executed .
At Chesspark we generate a lot of messages that are meaningless if they are not delivered to someone while they are online .
We built a module that filters offline messages and discards those that are inappropriate for database storage .
This works by adding a function to the offline_message_hook chain at a very high priority .
This means that our function is the first function to receive the message sent to an offline user .
If the module determines the message is inappropriate for storage , we signal to the hook processor that it should not continue executing chain functions , silently dropping the message .
Otherwise , the module let ’s the rest of the chain execute normally , which means that mod_offline , which is next in the chain , will receive the message and store it .
Hooking Presence For mod_sunshine
Now that we know a lot about hooks and hook processing , it ’s time to put it to some use in mod_sunshine .
First , we have to know which hook to use .
Unfortunately , none of the documentation is very clear about which hooks are executed at what times .
I have found that experimentation is the only way to figure this out .
Use the name of the hooks to make a guess , and then use some logging statements to figure out if that hook gets run when you expect .
You can also search for the hook ’s name in the ejabberd source code to find out when it is executed and what is expected of the functions in the chain .
For mod_sunshine , the hook we are interested in is set_presence_hook .
This hook is processed whenever a connected user sends a presence stanza to the server .
It ’s common to add a function to the chain in start / 2 and remove the same function in stop / 1 , and that ’s what we ’ve done below .
Additionally , we must export the function we wish to add .
- module ( mod_sunshine ) . - behavior ( gen_mod ) .
- export ( [ start / 2 , stop/1 , on_presence / 4 ] ) .
start ( Host , _ Opts ) -> ejabberd_hooks:add(set_presence_hook , Host , ? MODULE , on_presence , 50 ) , ok . stop( Host ) -> ejabberd_hooks:delete(set_presence_hook , Host , ? MODULE , on_presence , 50 ) , ok .
on_presence ( _User , _ Server , _ Resource , _ Packet ) -> none .
A function in the set_presence_hook chain takes four parameters : the user , server , and resource of the person that sent the presence stanza as well as the actual presence stanza .
It is required to return none .
A Module That Does Nothing Is Hardly A Module At All
So far we have a module that does n’t almost nothing .
It adds a function to the set_presence_hook chain when it is loaded , removes the function from the chain when it is unloaded , and does absolutely nothing when the chain is executed .
It ’s time to get to the meat of the module .
First , mod_sunshine needs to know what a presence storm is .
We can define this as a user sending the same presence stanza count times in interval seconds .
Since we might not know what the optimal values are for count and interval , it is best to leave those as options to be defined in the ejabberd configuration file .
Next , the module needs to store its state somewhere so it can check if a user is sending a presence storm .
Since ejabberd passes no state to on_presence / 4 , we must keep track of this ourselves .
We ’ll do this with mnesia , one of Erlang ’s built in databases .
Finally , the module needs to disconnect any user who causes a presence storm .
Unfortunately , ejabberd does not seem to have an API or message for this out of the box , so we will have to add this ourselves to the internal ejabberd c2s module .
Intermission And Logging
It ’s time for a small break before we dive into the real code , so let ’s digress for a second and talk about logging .
It will probably happen in your Erlang programming career that something goes wrong and you ca n’t figure out what that something is .
A time honored tradition exists for exactly these situations – printing some information to a log file .
Should you need to do this , ejabberd has several macros for writing to its log file at different logging levels .
They are defined in ejabberd .hrl which you will have to include in the code to use them .
I usually prefer to use ?
INFO_MSG .
These functions take a string followed by a list of arguments .
Be sure to remember that you must pass an empty list if there are no arguments .
Here ’s mod_sunshine .erl from before with modifications to announce its startup and shutdown .
- module ( mod_sunshine ) . - behavior ( gen_mod ) . - include ( " ejabberd.hrl " ) .
- export ( [ start / 2 , stop/1 , on_presence / 4 ] ) .
start ( Host , _ Opts ) -> ? INFO_MSG ( " mod_sunshine starting " , [ ] ) , ejabberd_hooks:add(set_presence_hook , Host , ? MODULE , on_presence , 50 ) , ok . stop( Host ) -> ? INFO_MSG ( " mod_sunshine stopping " , [ ] ) , ejabberd_hooks:delete(set_presence_hook , Host , ? MODULE , on_presence , 50 ) , ok .
on_presence ( _User , _ Server , _ Resource , _ Packet ) -> none .
Ok , break time is over ; let ’s get back to the real stuff .
Dealing With Options
To pass options to mod_sunshine we have to change the ejabberd configuration file .
The line we used above should be modified to the one below .
{mod_sunshine , [ {count , 10} , {interval , 60} ] }
This will tell mod_sunshine that a presence storm is anyone sending 10 copies of the same presence stanza within 60 seconds .
Now we just need to get these options into the code .
Alert readers will notice that while start / 2 is passed the options in the Opts variable , the on_presence / 4 function does not receive these .
How are we to get the options ?
Thankfully , gen_mod has an API function to fetch the module options from the configuration – gen_mod:get_module_opt( Host , Module , Opt , Default ) .
This function needs the virtual host the options are defined for .
This just happens to be the contents of the Server variable in on_presence / 4 .
gen_mod:get_module_opt/4 also lets you define the default option values .
Adding options to mod_sunshine is now easy .
- module ( mod_sunshine ) . - behavior ( gen_mod ) . - include ( " ejabberd.hrl " ) .
- export ( [ start / 2 , stop/1 , on_presence / 4 ] ) .
start ( Host , _ Opts ) -> ? INFO_MSG ( " mod_sunshine starting " , [ ] ) , ejabberd_hooks:add(set_presence_hook , Host , ? MODULE , on_presence , 50 ) , ok . stop( Host ) -> ? INFO_MSG ( " mod_sunshine stopping " , [ ] ) , ejabberd_hooks:delete(set_presence_hook , Host , ? MODULE , on_presence , 50 ) , ok .
on_presence ( _User , Server , _ Resource , _ Packet ) -> % % get options StormCount = gen_mod:get_module_opt( Server , ?MODULE , count , 10 ) , TimeInterval = gen_mod:get_module_opt( Server , ? MODULE , interval , 60 ) , none .
Persisting State With Mnesia
Mnesia is easiest to use when paired with Erlang records .
For the Erlang beginners , Erlang records are like C structs .
They are normal Erlang tuples with named fields .
We ’ll need to create a record for mod_sunshine to store the user , packet , the time the packet was originally sent , and the number of times the packet has been sent .
Here ’s what that looks like .
- record ( sunshine , {usr , packet , start , count} ) .
The name of the record is sunshine .
Note that the first of the four fields is not a typo of ‘ user ’ .
It is an acronym for ‘ user , server , resource ’ and will store the full JID of the user sending presence .
Creating Mnesia Tables
Now that we have a record , we must create an Mnesia table to use them .
Each row of the Mnesia table will be in this format , and the key is the first item of the record , usr .
mnesia : create_table /2 does the job for us .
Mnesia can create various kinds of tables – disk tables , memory tables , and tables that allow duplicates .
By default it creates an in - memory , unsorted table that does not allow duplicate keys , and this happens to be exactly what we want .
The Mnesia man page has information on other table types if you are interested .
We ’ll create and clear this table in start / 2 .
start ( Host , _ Opts ) -> ? INFO_MSG ( " mod_sunshine starting " , [ ] ) , mnesia : create_table ( sunshine , [ {attributes , record_info ( fields , sunshine ) } ] ) , mnesia:clear_table ( sunshine ) , ejabberd_hooks:add(set_presence_hook , Host , ? MODULE , on_presence , 50 ) , ok .
The first argument to mnesia : create_table / 2 is the name of the table , which must be the same as the record name .
This is followed by a list of options , of which we only use attributes .
record_info( fields , sunshine ) is a built in function of Erlang that returns a list of the fields in the record sunshine .
Mnesia wo n’t destroy an existing table if you call create_table / 2 , so to make sure there is n’t any old data in there we use mnesia : clear_table / 1 .
Reading And Writing To The Database
Mnesia is a transactional database .
To read and write to it , one normally uses mnesia : transaction / 1 which takes a function to execute inside the transaction .
This can be slow , so often mnesia : dirty_read / 2 is used to skip transactions for reads , and we will use that here .
In order to keep the user , server , and resource key consistent , we must stringprep the username and server .
Among other things , this ensures that mixed case usernames get lower cased .
This is easy in ejabberd since it provides a library of functions for JID manipulation called jlib .
To use it , we include jlib.hrl in our module .
Once we have a consistent key , we look it up in the sunshine table .
There are three possibilities : no record is found , a record is found for the current packet , or a record is found for a different packet .
The skeleton for this is below .
on_presence ( User , Server , Resource , Packet ) -> % % get options StormCount = gen_mod:get_module_opt( Server , ?MODULE , count , 10 ) , TimeInterval = gen_mod:get_module_opt( Server , ? MODULE , interval , 60 ) , LUser = jlib : nodeprep ( User ) , LServer = jlib: nodeprep ( Server ) , case catch mnesia : dirty_read ( sunshine , { LUser , LServer , Resource} ) of [ ] -> % % no record for this key ok ; [ #sunshine{usr= {LUser , LServer , Resource} , packet =Packet , start=_TimeStart , count=_Count} ] -> % % record for this key and packet exists ok ; [ #sunshine{usr= { LUser , LServer , Resource} , packet=_OtherPacket , count=_OtherCount} ] -> % % a record for this key was found , but for another packet ok end , none .
Those new to Erlang are probably a little weirded out right now .
Erlang uses pattern matching extensively .
First we read from the database , and attempt to match the pattern of the result against each section of the case statement .
If a variable in the pattern already contains a value , it must match the value in the result .
If a variable in the pattern does not have a value , it gets the value of the result in that spot .
If we get an empty list , there is no record matching the key .
Note that we get a list as a result because some Mnesia table types support duplicate keys .
In our table , the result will always be an empty list or a list with one item .
The next two patterns match a row .
# sunshine {...} is a record reference for the sunshine record .
In the first of the two patterns , all the variables have values except for _TimeStart and _Count .
This means the result must be a record that matches the record for this user and this packet .
The second pattern matches a record for this user , but with any packet , as _OtherPacket is without a value .
Pattern matching is nice and powerful .
Not only did we single out exactly the results we needed without any if statements , we also already put the interesting fields into their own variables !
Now we just need to code the actions for each of these three cases .
In the first case , we create a new entry for that user and packet .
In the second case , we need to determine we ’re within TimeInterval seconds of StartTime .
If not , we need to reset the count and start time for this user and packet .
Otherwise , if the count is above StormCount , the user is sending a presence storm and needs to be disconnected , and if the count is below StormCount we just increment the count .
In the final case , we ’ve received a different presence packet , so we need to overwrite the user ’s record in Mnesia with a new one for this packet .
Remember that Mnesia writes happen inside transactions as you look at the code below .
The writes are put into anonymous functions which are then passed to mnesia: transaction / 1 for execution inside a transaction .
on_presence ( User , Server , Resource , Packet ) -> % % get options StormCount = gen_mod:get_module_opt( Server , ?MODULE , count , 10 ) , TimeInterval = gen_mod:get_module_opt( Server , ? MODULE , interval , 60 ) , LUser = jlib : nodeprep ( User ) , LServer = jlib: nodeprep ( Server ) , { MegaSecs , Secs , _ MicroSecs} = now ( ) , TimeStamp = MegaSecs * 1000000 + Secs , case catch mnesia : dirty_read( sunshine , { LUser , LServer , Resource} ) of [ ] -> % % no record for this key , so make a new one F = fun ( ) -> mnesia:write(#sunshine{usr={LUser , LServer , Resource} , packet =Packet , start=TimeStamp , count=1} ) end , mnesia: transaction ( F ) ; [ #sunshine{usr= {LUser , LServer , Resource} , packet =Packet , start=TimeStart , count =Count} ] -> % % record for this key and packet exists , check if we 're % % within TimeInterval seconds , and whether the StormCount is % % high enough .
or else just increment the count . if TimeStamp - TimeStart > TimeInterval -> F = fun( ) -> mnesia:write(#sunshine{usr={LUser , LServer , Resource} , packet =Packet , start=TimeStamp , count=1} ) end , mnesia: transaction ( F ) ; Count =:= StormCount -> %%
TODO : disconnect user F = fun( ) -> mnesia : delete( {sunshine , { LUser , LServer , Resource}} ) end , mnesia: transaction ( F ) ; true -> F = fun( ) -> mnesia:write(#sunshine{usr={LUser , LServer , Resource} , packet =Packet , start =TimeStamp , count =Count + 1} ) end , mnesia: transaction ( F ) end ; [ #sunshine{usr= {LUser , LServer , Resource} , packet=_OtherPacket , count=_OtherCount} ] -> % % a record for this key was found , but for another packet , % % so we replace it with a new record .
F = fun( ) -> mnesia:write(#sunshine{usr={LUser , LServer , Resource} , packet =Packet , start=TimeStamp , count=1} ) end , mnesia: transaction ( F ) end , none .
Disconnecting Users
The only thing left to do is disconnect the user when a presence storm is detected .
I wish this was as easy as ejabberd_sm : disconnect ( User , Server , Resource ) , but it seems that the ejabberd developers have not yet added something along these lines .
To solve this , we will use Erlang ’s message passing to notify the user ’s c2s process that it should disconnect the user .
After some exploring , I discovered you can get the c2s process identifier for a given user by calling ejabberd_sm:get_session_pid/3 which takes the user , server , and resource .
Once we know the process identifer , we can send it a message with Erlang ’s !
operator .
First let ’s finish out on_presence / 4 by replacing the placeholder comment with the disconnect message to the c2s process for the user , shown below .
% % disconnect the user SID = ejabberd_sm:get_session_pid( LUser , LServer , Resource ) , SID !
disconnect ,
Our module is now finished , except that the c2s process will not understand our message .
We ’ll have to provide a new message handler for the disconnect message in ejabberd_c2s.erl .
Add the following clause to handle_info / 3 in ejabberd_c2s.erl .
handle_info( disconnect , _ StateName , StateData ) -> send_text ( StateData , ? STREAM_TRAILER ) , {stop , normal , StateData} ;
You can insert this clause before the first handle _info / 3 clause .
Just search ejabberd_c2s.erl for handle_info , and when you find the function definition , just paste this code immediately before it , but after the function ’s comment .
Now you must recompile ejabberd and restart the server .
If you know what you are doing , you can load this patch into the server while it is running .
We did this at Chesspark to avoid taking the server down .
This is another beautiful feature of ejabberd .
mod_sunshine In Action
We ’re all finished , and mod_sunshine can be deployed to stop the evil presence storms .
To test that it works , just send the same presence stanza a bunch of times , really fast .
You will find yourself quickly disconnected .
You will probably need to write a quick test client for this as you might not be able to trigger duplicate presence with your normal XMPP client .
I highly recommend Strophe.js for this task .
I hope that this tutorial has been helpful to you , and that you use this knowledge only for good .
Go have fun implementing your wild and crazy ideas for server modules !
If you have any suggestions and questions , please let me know in the comments .

The moment a man punched a girl off her feet during a Facebook water fight
This is the moment a girl was punched off her feet during a water fight in a park in which nine people were arrested .
Nine people were arrested for assaulting police and affray at the event , which attracted 250 youngsters to Kensington Gardens , close to Princess Diana 's former home .
It was intended as a fun way to cool down in the blistering heat , but tempers flared after the girl doused a young man with a fizzy drink .
After covering his T - shirt with the red liquid she ran away laughing , but her victim failed to see the funny side .
He chased her and punched her in the face , knocking her off her feet and leaving her helpless on the ground .
The attack happened at around lunchtime yesterday near the Serpentine in London 's Hyde Park .
Shocking : A girl is attacked during the water fight in Hyde Park , central London
Gangs of youths then ran amok , threatening the public , flashing knives and causing riding school children as young as five to be thrown from their horses .
Police feared others were carrying knives after park users reported seeing men " flashing " their weapons .
One man , aged in his early 20s , was shot by police with an electric stun gun after he set his pitbull - type dog on an officer .
He and eight others were arrested for offences including attacking police , public disorder , affray and handling stolen goods .
Three children , aged between five and 12 , who were riding past the brawl , were thrown when their horses became frightened .
They suffered broken bones .
Paramedics took all three to hospital for injuries including suspected broken bones and concussion .
Appalled : Fellow water fighters rush to the victim's aid as the man stands over her
The terrifying scenes came two weeks after teenager Frederick Moody - Boateng was murdered having attended a similar water pistol fight in Holland Park .
About 300 teenagers had responded to the Facebook posting .
One man , who captured the events on camera , said the group had earlier been spoken to by police for disturbing people in the park .
He said : ‘ About 10 minutes after the police left , the girl poured drink over this bloke .
He was not happy and chased after her .
She thought it was a game but he looked really angry .
‘ When he caught up to her he just whacked her so hard - she was lifted completely off her feet .
Hundreds of people saw it .
It was shocking .
He then just stood over her , threatening her until other people in the group pulled him away . ’
Another witness said : ' This burly guy chased her and threw a punch square on to her face .
It knocked her off her feet .
' There was a girl there who seemed to be the organiser of the event and she was in tears . '
The girl later staggered to her feet and was helped away by friends .
Play fight :
The girl splashes the man with coloured liquid from a bottle
Game turns nasty :
The man begins chasing his victim
Other witnesses claimed hundreds of police , some with dogs , later descended on the park to disperse the youths .
Paramedics were called to Serpentine Road to treat some of the injured horseriders for suspected broken bones and concussion .
At 7.30 pm a search cordon was put in place in Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens .
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said several people became ‘ hostile to police actions ’ , resulting in nine being arrested : four for assault on police , three for public order offences , one for affray and one for handling stolen goods .
All were men in their twenties and were taken to central London police stations .
Police are still trying to trace the thug responsible for the attack .
The incident happened on Wednesday , the same day Ministry of Justice figures revealed soaring levels of violence committed by under 18s .
ABOARD THE MCCAIN CAMPAIGN PLANE — Republican presidential candidate John McCain kept up his criticism today of the Russian invasion of Georgia , noting that he spoke again this morning with Georgia 's President Mikheil Saakashvili and discussed the latest abuses by Russian troops .
" There is a clause in this cease - fire that the Russians are using as a loophole for maintaining their presence there , " McCain said in an interview with U.S. News editors .
McCain said Saakashvili is " deeply saddened and outraged by the human - rights violations that are taking place . "
The Arizona senator said he has talked to Saakashvili every day during the current crisis .
McCain also referred to media reports that " the Russian troops reeked with alcohol and are looting . "
Since the crisis began , the entire episode has reinforced McCain 's doubts about the intentions of the Russian government .
McCain said the rise of Vladimir Putin , Russia 's powerful prime minister and former president , has revealed Russian ambitions for a " restoration of the old Russian empire . "
The military clashes , set off by disputes in two pro-Russian secessionist regions of Georgia , have triggered echoes of old Cold War-era tensions between Moscow and Washington , which has strongly backed Georgia 's democratically elected President Saakashvili .
In recent days , the English - speaking Georgian leader has talked with President Bush and Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama as well as with McCain .
All three have expressed support for Georgia and called on Russia to withdraw its troops .
President Bush sent humanitarian aid and dispatched Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Tbilisi for talks with Georgian leaders .
McCain , speaking with U.S. News en route from Birmingham , Mich. , to Eagle , Colo. , said there would not be a return to the Cold War but there would be a " dramatically different relationship " between the United States and Russia unless Moscow 's behavior changes .
" It is not acceptable behavior in the 21st century , " McCain argued .
In the past , McCain has advocated expelling Russia from the Group of Eight major industrialized nations , citing its pullback from democratic principles , but it is unlikely that the major European members would go along with such a move .

Sam Stein gave us the heads up about McCain ’s appearance in Sturgis , South Dakota :
On Sunday , the McCain campaign announced that the Senator will participate in the Sturgis Rally 2008 at Buffalo Chip in South Dakota , an annual tribute to American veterans .
The event is up the Arizona Republican ’s wheelhouse , attracting thousands of active duty and former servicemen , many who have a natural affinity towards the Senator .
But it is hard not to notice the evocative , non-political sideshows that will literally surround McCain ’s speech .
As the presumptive nominee takes the stage , the “ Ringin ’ Wet & Wild ” women ’s wrestling event will be taking place on the main amphitheater .
Two hours before then , the “ Miss Buffalo Chip Beauty Pageant – Bikinis on the Beach ” will be staged at a different venue .
That affair is described by ESPN ’s Jim Caple as “ essentially a topless beauty pageant .
And occasionally bottomless , too . ”
John McCain did show up in Sturgis — and suggested Cindy compete for that same “ Miss Buffalo Chip ” :

Talk about family values .
Pimping your wife ’s breasts for votes seems like a pretty cheap trick .
Not than anyone would ever hold John McCain accountable for suggesting his wife enter a topless beauty pageant .
Although , one wonders what James Dobson , McCain ’s Catholic guru Deal Hudson and the other theocrats think of this .
The current economic slowdown may look global , but it might turn out to be the first in history that hits rich countries harder than developing ones .
The contagion of weak U.S. growth has spread to Europe and Japan , the world 's second - and third - largest economies , respectively .
Prolonged economic booms in Australia , Ireland and Canada finally have faded ; no one 's talking these days about the " Irish miracle " now that Irish job growth and housing values are in decline .
Jobless construction workers now queue up at 5 a.m. outside the Águeda Diez unemployment benefits office in the Carabanchel district of Madrid .
Until 2006 , Spain was building more houses – about 700,000 a year – than Britain , France and Germany combined .
But the Spanish housing market now is in a deep slump , and construction giant Martinsa - Fadesa SA , with debts of 5.2 billion euros , $ 8.3 billion ( Canadian ) , last Tuesday made Spain 's largest - ever bankruptcy filing .
As recently as last spring , Europe was forecast to avoid the slump afflicting the U.S. But in mid-May , European stock markets abruptly began to decline .
The continent 's banking sector , loaded with dubious U.S. subprime debt , has tightened lending practices , triggering a credit crunch for consumers and business alike .
The world 's biggest financial firms already have suffered more than $ 415 billion ( U.S. ) in writedowns and credit losses since the start of 2007 .
French consumer spending , a pillar of the 15 - nation euro zone 's domestic economy , is in a funk .
The British housing bubble , like its counterparts elsewhere in Europe , has burst .
In May , new - home mortgage demand plummeted 63 per cent .
" The credit crisis , runaway inflation , mind - blowing energy crisis , falling confidence , housing prices – they have created a perfect story , " Henk Potts , equity strategist at British bank Barclays PLC , told the Washington Post on Wednesday .
" It 's currently a market for the brave . "
In Germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , a strong euro , weak orders and sharply higher costs for oil and other commodities have forced blue - chip firms such as Siemens AG , Henkel AG and Heidelberger Druck AG , world 's largest maker of printing presses , to announce the same kind of large job cuts that have racked the Ontario economy .
The Bank of Japan on Tuesday released its growth forecast of just 1.2 per cent through to March 2009 – the most anemic since 2002 .
Canadian economic growth is now expected to clock in at just 1 per cent this year , the weakest in 16 years .
A report last week showed the first decline in prices for existing houses since 1999 .
Meanwhile , consumers worldwide are suffering rapid commodity - price inflation even as economic growth rates sag .
The European Central Bank's June report shows a near doubling in oil prices in the past year , a tripling in corn prices since the beginning of 2006 , and an 80 per cent hike in wheat .
Yet , that squeeze between lower income and household wealth and a higher cost of living is largely absent in the more dynamic developing world economies .
China , the superstar among emerging economies , posted double - digit growth of 11.9 per cent last year and 10.4 per cent in the first half of this year , despite vigorous efforts by Beijing to cool the economy with interest - rate increases and a modest decline in exports to Europe and North America .
" It is amazing that China is still able to maintain double - digit growth rates , " Sherman Chan , Sydney - based China analyst for Moody 's Investor Services , told The Australian on Thursday .
Russia , emerging energy superpower of Europe , will see 8 per cent GDP growth this year , and consumer spending is up 13 per cent so far in 2008 , insulating the world 's second - largest oil exporter from credit - market volatility .
In the U.S. last week , federal officials were bailing out the giant mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , along with a California bank , IndyMac , that was hit with a bank run .
In fast - growing Kenya , by contrast , savers are lining up to open bank accounts .
And Nairobi's stock exchange , in contrast to significant exchange reversals in Toronto , New York , London and Frankfurt , has jumped 10 per cent in the total value of shares traded in the three months ended in June .
The world 's emerging - world economic powerhouses increasingly are flexing their muscles as buyers of depressed assets in developed countries .
Brazil 's CVRD last year snapped up Inco Ltd .
It was state investment funds in the United Arab Emirates and Singapore that came to the rescue of Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. with emergency cash injections , becoming the largest shareholders in those American financial icons in the process .
Earlier this month , another UAE fund bought a 90 per cent stake in Manhattan 's landmark Chrysler Building .
A new paradigm seems to have emerged , in which wealthy nations drag each other down , a mirror image of how Asian currency crises in the late 1990s triggered panic selling only in other developing world markets , leaving mature economies unscathed .
This time it 's the emerging markets that continue to thrive while so - called First World countries struggle with the double whammy of declining growth rates and soaring inflation .
The dilemma for industrial nations is that elevated inflation levels constrict the ability of central bankers to stimulate laggard economies without risking still higher inflation as a result of their efforts .
Indeed , in a report last week , the International Monetary Fund identified inflation and not weak GDP growth as by far the greater worry for mature economies .
" Inflation is a rising concern and will constrain the policy response to slower growth , " the IMF warned in its report released on Thursday .
Even though some experts put Europe 's chances of sliding into recession as high as 40 per cent , the European Central Bank raised its key rate earlier this month by a quarter point , to 4.25 per cent .
And on Tuesday , the Bank of Canada left its key overnight rate unchanged at 3.0 per cent .
For China , the challenge is too much economic growth too quickly , creating an overheated economy where food prices leapt 20.4 per cent in the first half of 2008 , and wages rose 19 per cent in the first quarter .
A modest economic slowdown in Beijing , and for that matter , global economic lethargy , is not viewed as the worst of outcomes by China 's economic planners .
Vikram Nehru , World Bank chief economist for East Asia and the Pacific , said , " In some ways , this is not only welcome but desired by the Chinese . "
As federal agency declares ' new phenomenon ' downed WTC 7 , activists cry foul Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday August 21 , 2008
Print This Email This According to a federal agency report released Thursday , a " new phenomenon " known as thermal expansion was directly responsible for the mysterious collapse of World Trade Center 7 on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
This study , posed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology -- a federal scientific agency which promotes technical industrial standards -- marks the first ' official ' government theory on the collapse .
The building 's demise occurred some seven hours after the twin towers collapsed on Sept. 11 , 2001 , and has been the source of numerous conspiracy theories key to the " 9/11 Truth " movement , most of which argue that the symmetrical , seven - second collapse was brought about by a controlled demolition .
Dr. Shyam Sunder , director of Institute 's building and fire research laboratory , oversaw the government 's three - year research efforts .
The report aims to disprove the controlled demolition argument .
However , Richard Gage , founder of Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth and a member of the American Institute of Architects , does n't believe a word of the theory .
His group , which has swelled to over 400 architectural and engineering professionals , immediately responded to the Institute 's claim in a press conference .
" Tons of [ molten metal ] was found 21 days after the attack , " said Gage in an interview with a Vancouver , Canada television station .
" Steel does n't begin to melt until 2,700 degrees , which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused . "
" There are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through , " Gage added during the press conference .
His group asserts that thermite , a steel cutting agent , was used to bring the building down .
Dr. Sunder disagreed .
" We conducted the study without bias , without interference from anyone , " said Dr. Sunder .
" We have only one single - minded goal in this effort . "
While the Institute said it considered the possibility of a controlled demolition taking place at WTC 7 , the notion was dismissed due to the absence of any recordings of an explosion sound .
Thermite , however , does not make an explosion sound .
And while this was raised to Dr. Sunder in the media 's Q&A session , he dismissed it as impossible .
" FEMA found it , " said Gage .
" Dr. Steven Jones found it , in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower Manhattan .
And he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal [ from the towers ] . "
Specifically , in Appendix C of its World Trade Center Building Performance Study , FEMA claimed :
Evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel , including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent intergranular melting , was readily visible in the near - surface microstructure .
A liquid eutectic mixture containing primarily iron , oxygen , and sulfur formed during this hot corrosion attack on the steel ...
The severe corrosion and subsequent erosion of Samples 1 and 2 are a very unusual event .
No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified .
Yet , no study of the mysterious sulfur or melted steel was included in the NIST report .
After New York City officials cut off the water main to the tower Sept. 11 , 2001 , the building 's sprinkler system was unable to function , Dr. Sunder said .
This allowed fires across 10 floors to burn uncontrolled for nearly seven hours .
The Institute asserts that due to the lack of water supply , an extraordinary event occurred , and for the first time ever , steel expanding due to heat from the flames caused columns to separate from structural concrete .
Column 79 was the first to fail , according to the report , which brought about a quick succession of failures in adjoining columns .
" Thermal expansion of long - span floor systems " was a critical element in the collapse , said Dr. Sunder .
The " kink " seen in the building 's penthouse portion in video of the collapse was in - line with the columns which failed first .
" If water had been available , it is likely that sprinklers would have operated and the building may still be here today , " he said .
" It looks like they want to wrap - up this investigation and blame [ the collapse ] on normal office fires , " said Gage during counter - conference .
WTC 7's structural system is in " widespread use " in other buildings , he added , insisting that such effects may also be present elsewhere .
The Institute 's report also includes recommendations for the strengthening of building codes to avoid future thermal expansion - driven collapses .
The collapse of WTC 7 is " no longer a mystery , " Dr. Sunder claimed .
The Institute 's full report is available at wtc.nist.gov .
Further details from the Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth press conference are forthcoming .

ST . PAUL , Minn .
— Republican National Convention protesters targeted in a series of police raids Friday night and Saturday said they would n’t back down from their plans to march on the convention ’s opening day .
Organizers have said they hope to attract up to 50,000 people to the protest Monday .
Four people were arrested at two Minneapolis homes and booked on probable cause of conspiracy to commit a riot , said Gina Berglund , an attorney helping to represent protesters .
There were no arrests at a third home targeted .
Later , the Ramsey County Sheriff ’s Office said a fifth person was arrested at an undisclosed location .
“ A lot of people in the activist community are really on pins and needles about who ’s next , ” Berglund said .
A fourth home , this one in St. Paul , was raided Saturday afternoon .
Two people were detained outside the home in handcuffs for about two hours before St. Paul police arrived with a search warrant .
St. Paul police spokesman Tom Walsh could not confirm whether anyone had been arrested .
Eileen Clancy , one of the founders of a New York City video collective called I - Witness Video , sent an e-mail saying she was inside the house and was told she could n’t leave while police waited for a search warrant .
Clancy said an employee of the collective — whose Web site says it uses video to protect civil liberties — was being held outside the house in handcuffs .
On Friday night , Ramsey County sheriff ’s deputies raided an organizing site of a group — the RNC Welcoming Committee — that has publicized plans to disrupt convention activities .
No one was arrested .
“ They will not crush our spirit , ” said protester Lisa Fithian from Austin , Texas , at a gathering of about 300 people in a Minneapolis park Saturday afternoon .
“ Our organization will continue .
We will be on the streets . ”
Dave Thune , a St. Paul city councilman whose district includes the theater building used as a hub for the protesters , denounced the raid , saying people had a legal right to assemble there .
“ We spent so much time trying to welcome people to the city and now this is the way we start out , ” he said .
“ It pretty much sucks . ”
Arresting people on conspiracy charges to pre-empt disruptions is troubling because it stops people from exercising free - speech rights , said Chuck Samuelson , executive director of ACLU in Minnesota .
He said he was also concerned about the broad scope of the search warrant .
ACLU attorneys were monitoring the arrests , Samuelson said .
In a statement , Sheriff Bob Fletcher said authorities moved to head off planned illegal acts .
“ These acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses , breaching venue security and injuring police officers , ” Fletcher said .
The RNC Welcoming Committee , a self - described anarchist / anti-authoritarian group , has worked to help other protest groups with food and housing , but has also strategized to map roadways , bridges and access points to aid in disruptive protests .
Jordan Kushner , head of the mass defense committee of the National Lawyers Guild ’s Minnesota chapter , denied that criminal activity was being planned .
“ They took away all their means of communication , so that they ca n’t engage in legitimate political expression , ” Kushner said .
“ This is police state harassment and spying . ”
The sheriff ’s office said it confiscated weapons on Saturday including a machete , hatchet and several throwing knives , empty glass bottles , rags and flammable liquids , homemade devices used to disable buses , metal pipes , axes , bolt cutters , sledge hammers , empty plastic buckets made into shields , an Army helmet , and large amounts of urine .
Protesters said deputies also seized materials including laptops , protest literature and sign - making materials , bus schedules and a topographical map of St. Paul , site of Xcel Energy Center , the convention hall .
Betsy Raasch - Gilman , a member of the RNC Welcoming Committee , said St. Paul officials decided to allow the building raided Friday to reopen .
“ We ’ll be using our space again , ” she said .
“ It ’s quite a significant victory and it shows the sheriff ’s department way overstepped last night . ”
On Saturday , Randi McClure stood outside one of the raided homes where three people were arrested .
Residents were forced to move out and told it was being boarded up for undisclosed building code violations , she said .
“ Where ’s their evidence ?
What are they doing ?
Obviously they ’re just trying to disrupt the protests , ” said McClure , 23 , who was in the house at the time of the raid .
Walsh , the St. Paul police spokesman , said city officers helped the county carry out a search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation .
“ We ’ve known all along that there are people coming to our city who are not planning to conduct themselves in a lawful manner , ” Walsh said .
“ This is an affirmation of that . ”
Those arrested were Monica Bicking , 23 , Eryn Trimmer , 23 , Garrett Fitzgerald , 25 , Nathanael Secor , 26 , and Erik Oseland , 21 .
Nestor , one of their attorneys , said Bicking , Trimmer and Fitzgerald all are from Minneapolis .
It was n’t immediately known where Secor or Oseland were from .

Democrat claiming political prosecution appeals decision to prohibit visit to dying wife Lindsay Beyerstein
Published : Friday August 8 , 2008
Print This Email This
The onetime Mississippi trial heavyweight Paul Minor -- once the largest Democratic donor in the state of Mississippi -- has filed a brief appealing a Justice Department move to prohibit him from visiting his dying wife .
Minor 's attorneys filed a brief with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals last week in an attempt to get their client released from federal prison pending his appeal .
The filing is only the latest salvo in an ongoing legal battle aimed at Minor 's release , but the stakes are especially high now because Minors wife , Sylvia , has terminal cancer , and Minor hopes to be released to care for her .
 Even if these prosecutors were so cold hearted and so focused on getting Paul , they should have been humane enough to agree to some release terms that would enable him to be with his very sick wife ,  said Abbe Lowell , Minors attorney .
Lowell stresses that time is of the essence because Mrs. Minor has only weeks or months to live .
 Her cancer is spreading everywhere ,  he says .
The filing by Minors attorneys came in response to a motion filed by prosecutors arguing Minor should not be released because he has previously violated the terms of his probation .
Prosecutors agree that Minors wifes condition is worthy of sympathy , but maintain that the law does not allow the judge to take compassion into account when ruling on Minors release .
 Minor 's actions and his actions alone are responsible for his imprisonment , and no amount of sympathy can form a legal basis for his release from prison ,  the prosecutors  motion states .
Lowell said that Minor has also applied to the Bureau of Prisons for a compassionate furlough to visit his wife but that the Bureau has yet to reply .
A spokesperson for the Bureau initially declined to comment on the status of Minors furlough application on the grounds that the information is not public .
A second spokesperson , Felicia Ponce , explained ,  Each case is evaluated individually , so theres not a specific timeframe that I can indicate a request will be approved .
The U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Mississippi did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment .
The prosecution argues that Minor should not be released because he has violated the terms of release agreements before .
He was forced to receive treatment for a drinking problem after being thrown out of a hotel bar in April 2006 , while free on a pre-trial bond .
As a result , his bond was revoked and he was sent for inpatient alcohol treatment .
After completing his treatment , Minor broke the rules again by leaving his house without permission to consult an expert about hurricane damage to his home .
The meeting took place at a restaurant where alcohol was served , although no one alleges that Minor was drinking .
Minor says he contacted his probation officer beforehand , seeking permission to attend the meeting , but received no reply .
The restaurant was within walking distance of Minors home .
As was reported earlier by RAW STORY , prosecutors claim that even though Minor is a non-violent offender who has never been deemed a flight risk , he is too dangerous to be let out of prison , because he is an alcoholic and because he violated the terms of his pre-trial release .
Minors lawyers stress that their client has been sober for 27 months and that his substance abuse counselor pronounced his prospects for recovery to be excellent .
Both sides in the dispute agree that Minors alcoholism contributed to his rule - breaking , but disagree about what that means for his future prospects .
The prosecution contends that Minors newfound sobriety doesnt mitigate the danger he poses to the community because the unauthorized meeting happened after he completed his treatment .
They worry that Minor is still subject to many of the stresses that his lawyers blame for his earlier rule - breaking , including his wifes illness and the prospect of more prison time .
Minors lawyers say that their client has earned another chance .
 [ Minor ] was never found to be a flight risk and the issue of danger was with his alcoholism , for which there is now a clear record of improvement and which could be redressed through numerous conditions that could be imposed on release ,  the defense reply brief states .
Minor admits that he broke the rules .
The most serious of these infractions took place while Minor was an untreated alcoholic who was grappling with his wifes breast cancer diagnosis , the destruction of his Biloxi home by Hurricane Katrina , and his second criminal trial .
Those missteps earned him two years in jail .
In the reply brief , his lawyers note that this penalty is more than enough to teach their client to respect the courts orders .
 There are of course conditions of release that would ensure that he complied with court order , so that he's not a danger to anyone ,  Lowell said .
Minors longtime friend and spiritual advisor , Right Reverend Joe Morris Doss , a retired Episcopalian bishop in residence at Grace Church in New Orleans , believes that Minor is ready to rejoin the community .
 [ Paul ] has courageously examined his life , confessed his personal failings and faults , and is trying to choose who he wants to be from this point on in his life ,  Doss wrote in an email to RAW STORY .
In 2007 , Minor , a wealthy Gulf Coast plaintiffs attorney and major Democratic donor , was sentenced to 11 years in prison and a $ 4.25 million fine in connection with campaign loans he guaranteed for two Mississippi judicial candidates who later ruled on cases involving Minors clients .
The government alleges that these loans were bribes to ensure favorable rulings .
This was Minors second trial on charges stemming from loan guarantees to judges .
The first time around , the government failed to obtain convictions against Minor or any of the three judicial candidates who accepted loans from him .
One of the judges , Oliver Diaz , was fully exonerated at that first trial , but the government retried Minor and the other two judges .
Many observers suspect that politics played a role in the federal cases against Minor .
At Minors second trial , Judge Harry T. Wingate of the Southern District Court of Mississippi revised the burden of proof downward and excluded evidence that Minors lawyers had been allowed to present at the first trial .
The first set of jurors had been told that for them to find the defendant guilty of bribery , the government had to prove that that the loan guarantees were part of a quid pro quo  an exchange of campaign money for future favorable rulings .
The second jury was given a looser definition of bribery .
Judges are elected in Mississippi and it is not illegal for attorneys to contribute to judicial campaigns , through either direct donations or loan guarantees .
At the time Minor guaranteed the loans , lawyers contributed more money to judicial campaigns than any other group .
Minor himself had been guaranteeing loans to judicial candidates for years
The initial indictments against Minor were released just in time to become fodder for the successful gubernatorial campaign of Republican Haley Barbour .
The news was politically explosive because Minor had donated tens of thousands of dollars to Barbours Democratic opponent , former Governor Ronnie Musgrove .
The US Attorney who brought the original case against Minor , Dunnica Lampton , is a Bush appointee with two unsuccessful Republican congressional bids under his belt .
Lampton and his office are currently being investigated by the Justice Department over allegations of selective prosecution .
Brig Gen Hartmann was appointed to provide impartial legal advice
A military judge has barred a US general from the second war crimes trial at Guantanamo Bay .
The judge , Col Steve Henley , ruled that Air Force Brig Gen Thomas Hartmann , legal adviser to the tribunal , had compromised his objectivity .
Brig Gen Hartmann allegedly " pushed " for Afghan detainee Mohammed Jawad to be charged because of the " gripping " details of his case .
However , moves to dismiss the charges against Mr Jawad were rejected .
Col Henley ruled that the legal adviser 's public statements aligning himself with prosecutors and defending the Pentagon 's system for prosecuting terrorists suspects had compromised his objectivity .
Brig Gen Hartmann , who was appointed to supply impartial legal advice to the Pentagon appointee overseeing the proceedings , was also barred from the first Guantanamo Bay war crimes trial against Osama Bin Laden 's former driver .
' Bullying '
In the current trial , Mr Jawad is accused of throwing a grenade into a US military jeep at a bazaar in Kabul in December 2002 .
He is charged with attempted murder .
Former chief prosecutor , Air Force Col Morris Davis told the hearing : " The guy who threw the grenade was always at the top of the list . "
It was also alleged that Brig Gen Hartmann was " abusive , bullying and unprofessional " .
It is now expected that there could be further legal challenges concerning the legal adviser 's role in other cases .
Lawyers for the five men accused of involvement in the 11 September attacks - including the alleged ringleader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed - are also challenging Brig Gen Hartmann 's involvement in the preparation of charges .
Brig Gen Hartmann supervises the chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay , which is in Cuba , and has extensive powers over the tribunal system .

Emmanuele Bassi has summarized a discussion that happened on IRC after my Gtk+ 3.0 post .
His blog entry starts by saying that we should not use blogs to discuss and then goes on to discuss .
I agree with the sentiment , but IRC is not a good place to do the meeting either as we do not even have IRC logs for whatever channel they were on discussing .
It is about the ISVs
Emmanuele seems to think that this is a marketing problem .
It is not .
This is about the effect that the current Gtk+ 3.0 plan has on ISVs .
KDE has almost no ISVs , Qt does .
GNOME has almost no ISVs , Gtk+ does .
Most likely because anything beyond the core toolkit is too unstable in both cases , and because things are too quickly flagged as deprecated with no roadmap in place .
The Qt situation is much better , as it is commercially designed , and they have existing customers that are paying them money to solve problems for them , not introduce new ones .
Qt is also designed to be bundled with your application , and you can make your proprietary application not break if the user upgrades his Qt.
This is not the modus operandi for Gtk + .
Having an " abandoned Gtk 2.x " and a " maintained , but API and ABI incompatible 3.x " which will not be available everywhere at the same time is a major turn off for ISVs .
Creating an ISV ecosystem is incredibly hard , and somehow the new generation of Gtk+ developers is now " OK " to throw away years of work of those that had to work with fewer resources than Gnome has today , fewer developers , a smaller community , slower computers , bigger challenges and yet , managed to keep Gtk+ 2.0 API compatible .
Perhaps it is not a matter of being " OK " , but the new crop of Gtk+ developers does just not appreciate just how much value ISVs are for Gtk+ , Gnome and the Linux desktop in the first place .
They did not have to fight to get those guys on board on the first place .
The premises and the conclusions of Imendio's paper would not hold if you were to consider application developers in the mix .
But in particular , it seems that the mindset is dangerously close to the rationalization used recently by a KDE spokesperson and lampooned by the Linux Hater Blog .
What bothered me last night
What bothered me last night after I blogged was the realization that most of the Imendio developers have switched to OSX as their main desktop operating system ( At least rhult , hallski and kris ) .
These are great developers , but for their day - to - day activities , they have given up on the Linux / Gnome desktop .
Their concern is no longer to attract ISVs , as long as the source compiles with some changes , they will be OK .
There are certainly some developers at Imendio that still use Linux , and I am sure they have a " Linux partition " to test things out .
But when it comes to ensuring the viability of the Linux desktop ecosystem , I do not feel comfortable about wiping out the ISV ecosystem that we have .
Discussion
Emmanuele says :
for instance , I would have loved to have Miguel at the gtk + team meeting of Tuesday at GUADEC : it would have been a great discussion , I ’m sure of it , and we might have had a different state of the union talk .
I mentioned this problem in my previous blog entry .
Even if I had made it to Istanbul on Tuesday , I am merely one of the voices concerned about API stability .
" Tuesday Meeting at Guadec " is hardly inclusive :
There was no Adobe .
There was no VMware .
There was no Medsphere .
There were no Eclipse folks ( who have complained previously about the ABI / API issues ) .
There was no Gnumeric .
And these are the ones I can think of the top of my head .
Senior voices from our own community were missing , like Morten Welinder who has expressed his opinion in a shorter post :
The best thing about tabs that I can think of is that it will keep certain people from doing more harmful things like changing the gtk+ api for no good reason .
I do not know who attended the Gtk+ planning on Tuesday , but it was not inclusive , and I suspect it was heavily tilted towards the Nokia - ecosystem .
From a Nokia standpoint , I understand the desire of dropping older code , get a smaller version of Gtk + out there , and be able to get a very flashy system at all costs .
The iPhone and OSX are strong UIs , and I can understand the desire to compete , but lets not throw the baby with the bathwater .
Decisions about the future of Gtk+ can not be done without all the stakeholders , and specially without those that have worked for years in keeping the API stability under duress and have built applications on top of it .
Features
Emmanuele says :
Yes , 3.0.0 might not have features .
is this bad marketing ?
probably .
so we need to fix this .
a way1 to do this would be keeping the 3.0.0 in alpha state , call it 2.99.02 and add features to that until we get to a 3.0.0 that developers will want to migrate to , like the new scenegraph API or the new style API .
let ’s break with 2.x in style
As I said previously , I would endorse such a plan if it is shown that fundamental new features could not be implemented in an API / ABI compatible way .
Nobody has yet refuted my assessment of the various areas that would not break compatibility , and that covers most of the new features .
Although I am not the only stake holder , nor the only ISV , nor the only developer .
Communication
Emmanuele says :
communication : there ’s a certain lack of communication between the gtk+ team and the users of the library .
in my opinion , it ’s due to the small number of active developers and to the fact that ISVs do n’t really get involved into shaping the platform they are using .
they have the source code , and sometimes it ’s easier to fix in - house than to communicate and go through the proper process — and this is a structural problem that is caused by the small number of people involved in the said process as well .
the gtk + team needs to open up more , and at the same time the ISVs need to get more involved .
sometimes it feels to me that the team is waiting for features , direction and help in the development , while the users of the library are waiting for the team to come up with the perfect plan to fix all the bugs and warts while retaining the whole API and ABI .
I agree with Emmanuele .
We setup the GNOME Foundation for things like this ;
Lets use the GNOME Foundation organizational powers to reach out to ISVs ; to organize a platform and Gtk+ summit as it is now clearly needed ;
Lets include all the stakeholders , not only the active developers .
Process
Emmanuele says :
process : this is connected to the first point - we have a lot of channels , and it might be daunting to actually follow them all ; but we 're also open in terms of discussion and revision .
this is our strength .
so please : if you want to discuss , join the IRC meetings on the #gtk - devel channel on Tuesday at 20:00 UTC or send an email to gtk - devel - list with your points .
get involved .
help shaping the future .
do n’t stand idly by , and wait for stuff to break to complain .
Casual discussion on IRC is OK , but that should not be the repository for decision making for such a fundamental component of GNOME and the Linux desktop .
Perhaps the discussion can start on IRC , but minutes , summaries and decisions should be posted to the Gtk+ developers and users mailing list and given enough time for all the stake holders to participate .
Additionally , you can not expect that your blog has now reached all the ISVs , not even the gtk - devel - list ( which is presumably a mailing list for the developers of Gtk+ not for its users ) .
We need to have a mailing list discussion , and then we need to have an outreach program to get to all stakeholders , including the ISVs to formulate a plan .
Pacific Gas & Electric ’s announcement last week that two Bay Area companies hope to build the nation ’s largest photovoltaic solar electric plants near San Luis Obispo is evidence of the dynamic future of solar power – and of Congress ’ confounding failure to foster it .
The projects ’ combined 800 megawatts – the size of a small nuclear plant – will produce enough power to light up 239,000 houses , about 2 percent of PG&E ’s power needs .
They will help the utility meet the state law requiring that by 2010 it line up alternative energy sources to produce 20 percent of its power .
They will establish solar photovoltaic energy as competitive with wind and other alternative energy sources , including solar - thermal power plants .
But both solar power companies have made it clear they cannot move forward with their projects unless Congress extends the investment tax credit for solar energy .
The 30 percent solar tax credit is set to expire Dec. 31 .
Eight times this year , Congress has failed to extend it .
Opening up offshore to further oil drilling will not yield a drop of oil for more than a decade .
Passing the tax credit would spur energy production now .
But House and Senate Republicans continue to block the sun , holding the credit hostage to permanently enacting President Bush ’s deficit - exploding income tax cuts .
Of the two major presidential candidates , Democrat Barack Obama voted for the tax credits .
Republican John McCain , while lately expressing support , has missed all votes in the Senate extending them .
San Jose - based SunPower Corp .’s 250 megawatts would be nearly 20 times the size of the company ’s largest plant to date .
Its 12 - by - 8 - foot photovoltaic collectors would be mounted over 3 1 / 2 square miles of non-prime farmland in a valley free from coastal fog .
Hayward - based OptiSolar ’s very thin sheets of silicon solar panels , laid out on an adjoining nine square miles , would produce 550 megawatts .
Increasing numbers of homeowners and other retail electric customers of PG&E have taken advantage of federal and state solar tax credits to install photovoltaic cells .
By seeding the market through the tax credit , Congress has helped to lower the price of solar cells and to make them more efficient .
That ’s one reason that large - scale photovoltaic solar projects can now compete in the wholesale electricity market with other alternative energy sources .
America is vulnerable to oil price spikes and unstable petrocrats .
Extending the credit is good for the valley ’s economy and America ’s security .
Laramie , Wyo .
ON Wednesday , the United States Justice Department revealed its evidence that Dr. Bruce E. Ivins , on his own , committed the worst act of bioterrorism in the country ’s history .
This 18 - year veteran scientist of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick , Md. , is accused of killing five people and sickening 17 others in the fall of 2001 .
Dr. Ivins died on July 29 of an apparent suicide without a chance to give his side of the story .
After reading the affidavits and listening to the Justice Department briefing , I was both disheartened and perplexed by the lack of physical evidence supporting a conviction .
Dr. Ivins was a friend and colleague of mine for nearly 16 years .
We worked together at Fort Detrick .
He was a senior scientist , and I was , first , a bench scientist and , from 1999 to 2003 , the chief of the bacteriology division .
The Justice Department has presented different types of evidence to support its argument that Dr. Ivins was the person who mailed anthrax to Tom Brokaw , Tom Daschle and others in September and October of 2001 .
Much of this evidence is outside the realm of science : Dr. Ivins ’s alleged fixation with a sorority ; strange comments in excerpts from his e-mail messages ; a connection to a Greendale school that might or might not explain the fictitious return address on anthrax mailings .
I will not address these points beyond noting that they are highly circumstantial .
Why did banks become so overexposed in the run-up to the credit crunch ?
A risk manager at a large global bank — someone whose job it was to make sure that the firm did not take unnecessary risks — explains in his own words
Gary Neil
IN JANUARY 2007 the world looked almost riskless .
At the beginning of that year I gathered my team for an off - site meeting to identify our top five risks for the coming 12 months .
We were paid to think about the downsides but it was hard to see where the problems would come from .
Four years of falling credit spreads , low interest rates , virtually no defaults in our loan portfolio and historically low volatility levels : it was the most benign risk environment we had seen in 20 years .
As risk managers we were responsible for approving credit requests and transactions submitted to us by the bankers and traders in the front - line .
We also monitored and reported the level of risk across the bank 's portfolio and set limits for overall credit and market - risk positions .
The possibility that liquidity could suddenly dry up was always a topic high on our list but we could only see more liquidity coming into the market — not going out of it .
Institutional investors , hedge funds , private - equity firms and sovereign - wealth funds were all looking to invest in assets .
This was why credit spreads were narrowing , especially in emerging markets , and debt - to - earnings ratios on private - equity financings were increasing .
“ Where is the liquidity crisis supposed to come from ? ” somebody asked in the meeting .
No one could give a good answer .
Looking back on it now we should of course have paid more attention to the first signs of trouble .
No crisis comes completely out of the blue ; there are always clues and advance warnings if you can only interpret them correctly .
It was the hiccup in the structured - credit market in May 2005 which gave the strongest indication of what was to come .
In that month bonds of General Motors were marked down by the rating agencies from investment grade to non-investment grade , or “ junk ” .
Because the American carmaker 's bonds were widely held in structured - credit portfolios , the downgrades caused a big dislocation in the market .
Like most banks we owned a portfolio of different tranches of collateralised - debt obligations ( CDOs ) , which are packages of asset - backed securities .
Our business and risk strategy was to buy pools of assets , mainly bonds ; warehouse them on our own balance - sheet and structure them into CDOs ; and finally distribute them to end investors .
We were most eager to sell the non-investment - grade tranches , and our risk approvals were conditional on reducing these to zero .
We would allow positions of the top-rated AAA and super - senior ( even better than AAA ) tranches to be held on our own balance - sheet as the default risk was deemed to be well protected by all the lower tranches , which would have to absorb any prior losses .
In May 2005 we held AAA tranches , expecting them to rise in value , and sold non-investment - grade tranches , expecting them to go down .
From a risk - management point of view , this was perfect : have a long position in the low - risk asset , and a short one in the higher - risk one .
But the reverse happened of what we had expected : AAA tranches went down in price and non-investment - grade tranches went up , resulting in losses as we marked the positions to market .
This was entirely counter - intuitive .
Explanations of why this had happened were confusing and focused on complicated cross-correlations between tranches .
In essence it turned out that there had been a short squeeze in non-investment - grade tranches , driving their prices up , and a general selling of all more senior structured tranches , even the very best AAA ones .
That mini-liquidity crisis was to be replayed on a very big scale in the summer of 2007 .
But we had failed to draw the correct conclusions .
As risk managers we should have insisted that all structured tranches , not just the non-investment - grade ones , be sold .
But we did not believe that prices on AAA assets could fall by more than about 1 % in price .
A 20 % drop on assets with virtually no default risk seemed inconceivable — though this did eventually occur .
Liquidity risk was in effect not priced well enough ; the market always allowed for it , but at only very small margins prior to the credit crisis .
So how did we get ourselves into a situation where we built up such large trading positions ?
There were a number of factors .
As is often the case , it happened so gradually that it was barely perceptible .
Fighting the last war
The focus of our risk management was on the loan portfolio and classic market risk .
Loans were illiquid and accounted for on an accrual basis in the “ banking book ” rather than on a mark - to - market basis in the “ trading book ” .
Rigorous credit analysis to ensure minimum loan - loss provisions was important .
Loan risks and classic market risks were generally well understood and regularly reviewed .
Equities , government bonds and foreign exchange , and their derivatives , were well managed in the trading book and monitored on a daily basis .
The gap in our risk management only opened up gradually over the years with the growth of traded credit products such as CDO tranches and other asset - backed securities .
These sat uncomfortably between market and credit risk .
The market - risk department never really took ownership of them , believing them to be primarily credit - risk instruments , and the credit - risk department thought of them as market risk as they sat in the trading book .
The explosive growth and profitability of the structured - credit market made this an ever greater problem .
Our risk - management response was half - hearted .
We set portfolio limits on each rating category but otherwise left the trading desks to their own devices .
We made two assumptions which would cost us dearly .
First , we thought that all mark - to - market positions in the trading book would receive immediate attention when losses occurred , because their profits and losses were published daily .
Second , we assumed that , if the market ran into difficulties , we could easily adjust and liquidate our positions , especially on securities rated AAA and AA .
Our focus was always on the non-investment - grade part of the portfolio , especially the emerging - markets paper .
The previous crises in Russia and Latin America had left a deeply ingrained fear of sudden liquidity shocks and widening credit spreads .
Ironically , of course , in the credit crunch the emerging - market bonds have outperformed the Western credit assets .
We also trusted the rating agencies .
It is hard to imagine now but the reputation of outside bond ratings was so high that if the risk department had ever assigned a lower rating , our judgment would have been immediately questioned .
It was assumed that the rating agencies simply knew best .
We were thus comfortable with investment - grade assets and were struggling with the huge volume of business .
We were too slow to sell these better - rated assets .
We needed little capital to support them ; there was no liquidity charge , very little default risk and a small positive margin , or “ carry ” , between holding the assets and their financing in the liquid interbank and repo markets .
Gradually the structures became more complicated .
Since they were held in the trading book , many avoided the rigorous credit process applied to the banking - book assets which might have identified some of the weaknesses .
The pressure on the risk department to keep up and approve transactions was immense .
Psychology played a big part .
The risk department had a separate reporting line to the board to preserve its independence .
This had been reinforced by the regulators who believed it was essential for objective risk analysis and assessment .
However , this separation hurt our relationship with the bankers and traders we were supposed to monitor .
Spoilsports
In their eyes , we were not earning money for the bank .
Worse , we had the power to say no and therefore prevent business from being done .
Traders saw us as obstructive and a hindrance to their ability to earn higher bonuses .
They did not take kindly to this .
Sometimes the relationship between the risk department and the business lines ended in arguments .
I often had calls from my own risk managers forewarning me that a senior trader was about to call me to complain about a declined transaction .
Most of the time the business line would simply not take no for an answer , especially if the profits were big enough .
We , of course , were suspicious , because bigger margins usually meant higher risk .
Criticisms that we were being “ non-commercial ” , “ unconstructive ” and “ obstinate ” were not uncommon .
It has to be said that the risk department did not always help its cause .
Our risk managers , although they had strong analytical skills , were not necessarily good communicators and salesmen .
Tactfully explaining why we said no was not our forte .
Traders were often exasperated as much by how they were told as by what they were told .
At the root of it all , however , was — and still is — a deeply ingrained flaw in the decision - making process .
In contrast to the law , where two sides make an equal - and - opposite argument that is fairly judged , in banks there is always a bias towards one side of the argument .
The business line was more focused on getting a transaction approved than on identifying the risks in what it was proposing .
The risk factors were a small part of the presentation and always “ mitigated ” .
This made it hard to discourage transactions .
If a risk manager said no , he was immediately on a collision course with the business line .
The risk thinking therefore leaned towards giving the benefit of the doubt to the risk - takers .
Gary Neil
Collective common sense suffered as a result .
Often in meetings , our gut reactions as risk managers were negative .
But it was difficult to come up with hard - and - fast arguments for why you should decline a transaction , especially when you were sitting opposite a team that had worked for weeks on a proposal , which you had received an hour before the meeting started .
In the end , with pressure for earnings and a calm market environment , we reluctantly agreed to marginal transactions .
Over time we accumulated a balance - sheet of traded assets which allowed for very little margin of error .
We owned a large portfolio of “ very low - risk ” assets which turned out to be high - risk .
A small price movement on billions of dollars ' worth of securities would translate into large mark - to - market losses .
We thought that we had focused correctly on the non-investment - grade paper , of which we held little .
We had not paid enough attention to the ever - growing mountain of highly rated but potentially illiquid assets .
We had not fully appreciated that 20 % of a very large number can inflict far greater losses than 80 % of a small number .
Goals and goalkeepers
What have we , both as risk managers and as an industry , to learn from this crisis ?
A number of thoughts come to mind .
One lesson is to go back to basics , to analyse your balance - sheet positions by type , size and complexity both before and after you have hedged them .
Do not assume that ratings are always correct and if they are , remember that they can change quickly .
Another lesson is to account properly for liquidity risk in two ways .
One is to increase internal and external capital charges for trading - book positions .
These are too low relative to banking - book positions and need to be recalibrated .
The other is to bring back liquidity reserves .
This has received little attention in the industry so far .
Over time fair - value accounting practices have disallowed liquidity reserves , as they were deemed to allow for smoothing of earnings .
However , in an environment in which an ever - increasing part of the balance - sheet is taken up by trading assets , it would be more sensible to allow liquidity reserves whose size is set in scale to the complexity of the underlying asset .
That would be better than questioning the whole principle of mark - to - market accounting , as some banks are doing .
Last but not least , change the perception and standing of risk departments by giving them more prominence .
The best way would be to encourage more traders to become risk managers .
Unfortunately the trend has been in reverse ; good risk managers end up in the front - line and good traders and bankers , once in the front - line , very rarely go the other way .
Risk managers need to be perceived like good goalkeepers : always in the game and occasionally absolutely at the heart of it , like in a penalty shoot - out .
This is hard to achieve because the job we do has the risk profile of a short option position with unlimited downside and limited upside .
This is the one position that every good risk manager knows he must avoid at all costs .
A wise firm will need to bear this in mind when it tries to persuade its best staff to take on such a crucial task .
Earlier this year , two British men were arrested for their involvement with an online paedophile network that spanned the globe and traded in more than 400,000 images of children being abused .
After a two - year investigation by the FBI in the US and the Queensland police in Australia , the images were passed to their countries of origin , and eight children from the UK – between the ages of 6 and 14 – were identified after a painstaking search .
Six men are now serving jail terms for sexually abusing them .
Yet this is only one investigation , one seizure of one collection of images , one drop in a very deep ocean .
Six men provided the images , but how many looked at them ?
And once an image is released to the web , it can never really be erased ; even when the child in that photograph is an adult , the image remains frozen in time .
According to last year 's annual report by the Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) , which hunts down illegal internet content , the number of images of serious child abuse online had quadrupled over the previous three years .
While the IWF 's success means it is rare for a UK site to host an abusive website , last year it identified a core of 2,755 websites hosted abroad and investigated 31,776 reports of illegal images of children .
This is the dark side of the web , which lets individuals transmit hundreds of photos from one continent to another , at the click of a mouse .
And they do .
Every day .
It 's one of the most emotive subjects around .
And taboo .
Which is why , when the BBC decided to create Fiona 's Story , a drama imagined from the perspective of a wife whose husband is caught downloading illegal images , my extensive research brief was paramount .
Behind the headlines of every arrest , there are often important figures sidelined in the story .
Who talks about the offender 's family ?
Who cares ?
There is often an assumption that the wife " must have known " .
'
Preconceptions are often a bulwark to caring too much .
But what if , one morning , the police knock on your door , and this is the first you know of your partner 's illegal online activities ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The script – woven together from a collection of stories from anonymous interviewees – explores the effects on an " everyman " family when the husband is arrested .
It was already well under way when , with horrible coincidence , the comic actor Chris Langham was charged with exactly this offence .
It brought the discomfort close to home : a respected professional , a family man , a much - liked individual , now charged with making images of children being sexually abused .
He was sentenced to 10 months in prison for making 15 counts of indecent images of children .
Terminology is important here : " making " an image is the legal way to describe downloading , " distributing " is the charge when an individual sends an image to someone else .
And how are the lines drawn between " just looking " and those doing the physical abuse ?
Many of the women I interviewed , whose partners were arrested for downloading images , said their men protested that " they were only pictures " , that they could separate two - dimensional images from living children .
But in a realm where images of abuse are currency , normal rules are eroded ; letting fantasy take over is a dangerous game .
This is why the language used to discuss the activity is vital , and it's not political correctness that prompts many professionals to shun the term " child pornography " .
The people behind Child Exploitation & Online Protection ( CEOP ) , who receive an average of 400 reports a month from the public , and last year investigated almost a million images of child sex abuse , say that calling these pictures " child porn " only helps the abusers .
" Pornography " , they argue , is legal in most countries , so the word invites ideas of compliance and legitimacy , rather than forced abuse .
Paul Griffiths headed the victim identification team at CEOP on the recent FBI case , trawling through images in an attempt to identify and rescue children .
" These images , " he says , " are crime - scene photos where children are being subjected to sexual abuse . "
Jim Gamble , chief executive of CEOP , puts it just as bluntly : " If I were to take a woman to a hotel room , commit rape and take a picture , no one would call that pornography . "
Once found , what to do with the men whose viewing appetites feed this abuse ?
Steve Lowe , director of the Ray Wyre Independent Consultancy , works with offenders and their families .
" I 'm interested in child protection , not castigating people , " he says .
" But over the past nine years , the whole attitude to the problem has become very antagonistic .
There 's little interest politically and publicly in providing proper treatment facilities .
It has done such disservice to children . "
Another group stepping into this breach is the Lucy Faithfull Foundation , which , between opening its " Stop It Now ! " helpline in 2003 and this June , received 10,976 calls .
In the first year , one internet offender called ; last year , it was up to 199 .
The scale of the problem is only starting to come to light .
It may still be taboo , but it is clear that the children in those images – and the families involved – need somebody to talk about it .
' Fiona 's Story ' will be broadcast on BBC1 at 9 pm on 31 August .

Wife 1 : ' I ca n't tell anyone '
" It was 8 am on a Monday , over a year ago , when suddenly there were all these voices in my house .
I thought they were Jehovah 's Witnesses at first .
Then they said they were the police .
They did n't tell me why they were there for ages but they knew things about my children – their names and what they were doing .
I got more and more scared – I do n't think I 've ever shaken so badly .
Then they showed me the search warrant – I could n't believe my eyes .
The words ' indecent images of children ' .
I was in shock and had no inkling of what my partner was doing , yet at the same time I had a sort of sudden understanding of why he had n't been easy to live with for so long .
I had to send the police off to the business we run , to arrest him .
I thought , that 's the end of my world .
The first thing he said when he was arrested was , ' I 'm going to have to commit suicide . '
That 's the first thing I thought he'd do when I read the search warrant .
I 've known him for 20 years – I knew what he'd think .
Meanwhile , they searched the house , took away any computer materials .
The senior policewoman came with me to wake my teenage daughter .
I told her what had happened .
She did n't take it in .
Then we went to the school .
My other daughters were taken into a room one by one with me and their older sister and the police , and told what had happened .
They were devastated .
Then , without me , they were questioned about their relationship with their father .
It was devastating .
That their dad had this interest , and also that someone might think he was doing that to them , which was not the case .
They chewed us up and spat out .
How do you deal with it ?
We did lots of talking .
We were all sitting on a bed that night , and someone thought of dad all on his own , and we sent him a text , saying we loved and supported him and were there for him .
He did n't come home .
He could have , but did n't .
It was better that we had some space .
We spoke on the phone the next night .
It was dreadful .
He 's such a kind - hearted person , and he felt strongly that he wanted his children to have a childhood , yet it did n't occur to him that he was taking away someone else's .
I 've always thought the people doing these things were monsters , but I can't think that any more because this does not define him .
He has a heartfelt desire to deal with the problem , and it is something he has to atone for .
He got a non-custodial sentence , but this has tainted him forever .
I feel tainted forever .
I did n't tell anyone for an awfully long time : my mother and siblings do n't know .
I did tell a few friends , but aside from one couple who stood by both of us , they support me but not him .
I do n't blame them , but it upsets me – it does n't work unless they support all of us .
I 'm an open person , but I can't communicate with people in the way I used to : there is always this black cloud that I can't tell anyone about .
I feel sad about it , but I made the choice for my family to have as normal a future as possible , and for my future and his to be as normal as possible .
We 'd been together for years but actually got married after this happened .
Just our daughters were present .
We realised our family was the most important thing in our life .
And as a couple ?
We have a lot of work to do , but that has to come after he has done the work on himself first .
If I did n't have absolute confidence that in his heart he wants to overcome this , I could n't do it .
None of us view his arrest as anything but positive because it is really the only route out .
He needed help to stop ; I know that he tried to stop himself at least once because actions he took , which did n't make sense at the time , now fall into place .
But how could anybody with three daughters , addicted to illegal activities of this nature and on whom the entire family was financially dependent , ever admit what he was doing ? "
Wife 2 : ' Neighbours wo n't say hello '
" When my husband and I were first arrested , we were about to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary , so I thought I knew him .
We met at university and married at 22 .
Both teachers , we had two children , and had worked our way up through the profession .
I became a university lecturer , he a head of department .
We were a stereotypical middle - class family .
The knock came on my door at 7 am .
My husband was away .
It was the police who told me they were arresting me on the grounds of suspicion that I 'd been downloading child pornography .
My jaw dropped .
I did n't say ' There must be a mistake , ' or anything like that , I just stood there and burst into tears .
They said I 'd better get dressed – I could n't .
The policewoman came with me to my bedroom ; I was trembling .
I said , ' I do n't know what to do , I ca n't decide what to wear , ' and she said , ' How about what you wore yesterday ? '
' But then you 'll think I 'm dirty , ' I said .
I curled up in a ball but they told me I had to witness what they were bagging up .
We 've got tons of photographs , and they started searching them .
Then , of course , the panic : what if we have a picture of the grandkids in the bath ?
I really can't applaud the police enough .
They were polite and considerate , and explained that they take it in the context of the album as a whole .
In the police station it was horror .
I 'm a primary teacher as well , and chair of the school governors : my whole life has been dedicated to protecting children .
You could n't have accused me of anything worse .
So every time they asked me if I had done this , or had I done that , I burst into tears .
At the end of the day they bailed us both ; I thought they 'd let me go .
Back home , he admitted it straight away and oh , the fury , the horror , the confusion .
And I 'll never forget his reaction : " But it 's only pictures . "
But they 're pictures of real children , I said .
The absolute shock on his behalf that they were connected to real children kind of helped .
He did n't think he was hurting a child .
He 'd denied it to the police , so spent two years trying to reverse his statement , but they said that until the computer was searched there was no point in another interview .
It was two - and - a - half years before it came to court .
Although we'd both retired from full - time teaching , I was still part - time .
The day after the arrest , they withdrew our police clearance to work with children .
I had to resign from all my posts , two days before term started .
I let everybody down .
I said we had a horrendous family circumstance , and I had to leave .
Everyone assumed I had days to live , and were so sympathetic , and I was thinking , ' If only they knew . '
I never lie , so we drew up the drawbridge as I could n't face people .
Next , social services said we could n't see our grandchildren without supervision .
We were a key part of the family working structure : babysitting , that kind of thing .
That all collapsed .
They said they were telling our daughter 's borough immediately , and would visit her to make sure she protected her children from us both .
So we had to tell the kids .
There 's no way of doing it ; I just blurted it out .
In the two - year lull , my husband and I had no physical contact .
I always thought if it happened to me I would go – how could you possibly stay with such a despicable creature ?
But initially I was so distraught that I was n't fit to go .
Then I thought he was going to commit suicide .
That would solve everything , I thought .
I did n't know I was capable of such hate .
The truth gradually emerged : he had retired from teaching on the grounds of depression and ill health 10 years earlier , and had got further depressed , and was on anti-depressants .
Then he was drinking , and we'd had terrible rows – I 'd stomp off to bed , and he'd go on the computer .
He never bought anything or visited illegal sites , but met people online who were swapping pictures .
And because he had sent pictures he was charged with distributing .
Whatever he'd been looking for he had n't found it , and the police found that he'd stopped doing it 10 months prior to the arrest .
Time gradually heals ; you can't be angry every day .
I said I could n't be a wife but I would be a friend .
After the second Christmas , when I could n't be with our grandchildren , I reached rock - bottom .
That 's when I rang the Lucy Faithfull helpline .
They said I had to share this with people .
So , one by one , I did .
My husband and my father used to be so close , and I think that 's damaged now .
I have to say , it 's turned out to be Christians or people with strong faith who have been most forgiving and believe he deserves a second chance .
My husband got a 15 - month sentence , and had to do seven and a half .
The neighbours were good to me while he was away .
They looked after me , but now that he 's home , they do n't say hello , not even to me .
It 's not nastiness , just silence .
I inch forward each week , but then the probation service meetings send me right back .
I wo n't be able to leave it behind until it stops hitting me in the face every week .
Once his probationary licence ends , he 'll be on the sex offenders register for 10 years , and have to tell the police where he 's sleeping .
I would have never have thought I could contemplate putting it behind me , but I want to be a wife .
I 'm trying . "
Wife 3 : ' My child cries all the time '
" The police came to our door on a winter 's morning , just after 6 am , arrested my husband , and took away the hard - drive of our computer .
The children in the photos my husband looked at are not the only ones who were affected ; I will never forget driving our children to school that day – the whole thing profoundly hurt them .
One was extremely emotional : crying , not wanting to go to school , needing to know what was going on .
The other was deathly quiet in the back seat , all the emotion bottled up inside .
At school they became disruptive , misbehaving ; it was very difficult .
I am not an apologist : it makes me feel sick to think that my husband looked at indecent images .
They might have been " low category " , but it still makes me shudder .
But I want to know why – why do men do this ?
No one seems to be asking that question , and without it , nothing will change .
I know that my husband never had an inkling of anything like this until he began an IT job to determine the safety of internet sites .
All the focus goes on catching the men , and while this is necessary , I stand bewildered as to why no one seems to be trying to get to the root of the problem .
It has made me think about the fact that adult pornography has overtones of child fetishism .
On the day my husband was sentenced to time in prison , I walked past a newspaper stand and saw the front page of a tabloid that had a glamour - model in school uniform , spilling out of her shirt , wearing suspenders .
It seemed such an ironic example of the confusion that exists .
The pressure of uncertainty between the arrest and conviction was intense .
He immediately lost his job , and while I was fortunate to be working , the burden of financial commitments is heavy .
It 's no surprise to me that men commit suicide before they go to court .
It is so upsetting when the people you have for years counted as your closest dearest friends shun you .
For my husband , it was like closing a door on his whole life up to that point .
He can't go back – he has lost his career , his friends ; there is no return to the life that he had spent all those years building for himself .
My husband had not shared images with others , had not saved them , and had begun looking comparatively recently ; he somehow thought he could stay on the right side of the law if he looked at images that were called " artistic " .
He had such self - deception before his arrest : in the police sessions he said things like , " I never looked at child pornography – it said on the website that these were artistic images , " and once he even said , " But the children were smiling " .
Immediately after his arrest , he began going to therapy , and those sessions were a process of discovery for us both .
I 've found out things that I never wanted to know , small things , but horrible : that " making an image " means downloading an image , say .
I can't stop feeling that I should have spotted something .
I can't help asking myself why did n't I see what was going on .
I feel very sharply the injustice of this for me and my children .
It has been very hard holding the family through this , but I am trying to keep us together . "
