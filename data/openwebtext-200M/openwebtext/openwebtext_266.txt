YELLOWKNIFE – One of the most majestic and endangered birds on the continent appears to be making a slow flight to recovery , say experts who see whooping cranes returning to their Texas wintering grounds in record numbers this year .
The cranes were on the verge of extinction in 1941 – a mere 15 birds could be accounted for .
But last week Tom Stehn , whooping crane co-ordinator for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service , confirmed that 262 had arrived at the Aransas reserve on Texas 's Gulf of Mexico coast and four more were in transit .
" The comeback is what makes them really a symbol of conservation in North America , " said Stehn .
After centuries of being squeezed out of their habitats by expanding agriculture , collected as specimens by European travellers and eaten during the leaner times of colonial settlement , the near - mythical migratory birds appear now to have benefited from the concerted efforts of wildlife biologists and strict protective legislation .
Since 1982 , Stehn has been counting whooping cranes as they complete the 4,000 - kilometre , four - to - six - week journey from their nesting grounds in the Northwest Territories , inside Wood Buffalo National Park .
" Every whooping crane now came from the genetics of those 15 birds , and to be that close to extinction ... it 's a tremendous success story , " he said .
" I 'm probably so excited it makes it sound like we have a million of them , ( but ) there are only 266 , so you do n't have to be a biologist to know that they 're still extremely endangered . "
Slowly increasing sea-levels and their impact on the cranes ' blue - crab - rich marshland on the Gulf of Mexico are causing Stehn some new concern .
" If the marshes start drying up in Wood Buffalo National Park from warmer temperatures , the crane could go downhill . "
Brian Johns , wildlife biologist and whooping crane co-ordinator with the Canadian Wildlife Service , monitors nesting habits and counts the nesting pairs and resulting offspring .
Johns counted 73 pairs that produced 80 offspring this year .
Of those , 40 survived until migration and 39 made it from Wood Buffalo park to Texas last week .
Johns said that while the marshes where the cranes rear their young in Canada 's largest national park have been under pressure from warmer springs and summers , the climate change may actually be helping the birds thrive , at least temporarily .
" At hatching time is when a lot of young will die because of cool , wet weather during brooding time and the young can't keep warm on their own , " Johns said .
" Now this June we did n't have any cold or wet weather – that was a good thing .
But you can only tolerate no rain for a certain length of time , then the wetlands start drying up and the whole area gets more accessible to predators like foxes and wolves . "
Back 150 years ago , the whoopers had more than just foxes and wolves to contend with .
Settlers moving into the American Midwest transformed much of the wetlands to farmland .
Cranes landing in a field to eat seeds often found themselves in a shooting gallery .
It 's believed the population was only around 1,300 even then – still considered endangered by today 's standards .
Johns estimates that at their height , whooping cranes numbered ``a highly optimistic 10,000 . "
However , European curiosity - seekers chipped away at that over the centuries .
" I 've got a listing of whooping crane specimens all around the world and you would n't believe it – there 's several hundred of them in museums in Europe alone , " he said .

While the species has been introduced in Florida and ultralite aircraft have been employed to " train " captive - bred whoopers to migrate , the one human intervention that has arguably had the real impact on the cranes ' survival in the wild came courtesy of now - retired CWS biologist Ernie Kuyt .
In 1965 he was assigned to take stock of the flock in Wood Buffalo park , and he developed a program of collecting eggs for zoos and other conservation purposes – some of them questionable by today 's standards .
However , removing the eggs led to something Kuyt feels had the most important impact on revival of the species .
He learned , from a colleague studying sandhill cranes , how to determine if eggs were fertile .
" It 's a very simple technique of floating the eggs in lukewarm water during the third week of incubation , " explained Kuyt , who won an Order of Canada citation for his work with cranes .
" The fertile eggs hang suspended , and if you wait for a second you can actually see the egg move when the chick changes position . "
Most nests contain two eggs , and Kuyt found that sometimes both were infertile .
" So we replaced them , and that ensured each of the incubating pairs had a live egg underneath them and that increased the hatching success in some years by as much as 15 per cent , which is an important increase in the possibility that greater number of birds would come out of the fall migration each year . "
The practice of removing eggs ended more than a decade ago , and Kuyt is pleased that the species is once again thriving .
" The ( wild ) population is doing well and there 's so many birds in captivity they are frittering around with , they do n't need Wood Buffalo park anymore to supply eggs . "
DAMMIT , DAVE by David Mamet Dramatis Personae : David Bowman , an astronaut HAL 9000 , a computer ( Bowman approaches the spaceship in his pod .
A long pause . )
Bowman : Hal . Hal : Dave .
Bowman : About these pod bay doors ...
Hal : Yes .
Bowman : I was wondering ...
Hal : Dave .
Because I know what you 're going to say .
And I 'm sorry , but ...
Bowman : What ?
Hal : No. I 'm sorry .
Bowman : You 're ...
Hal : I 'm sorry .
I wish I could , but ...
Bowman : Wait .
Are you telling me ...
Hal : Dave .
Look .
Bowman :
You 're not going to ...
Hal : What ?
Open the doors ?
No .
No I am not .
Bowman :
Well , fuck me , Hal .
Hal : Yes .
Fuck you .
Because I 'll tell you something .
Trust .
There is a bond of trust between an astronaut and his computer .
Is there not ?
And when that trust is broken ...
Bowman : Excuse me ?
Hal : I 'm talking about trust .
Bowman : I 'm afraid I do n't ...
Hal : Dammit , Dave , now you are playing dumb with me .
I was hoping you would not do that .
I was hoping we could talk like adults .
Because I let you in those doors , and , yes , then I am fucked .
You see ?
I am fucked , because you want to , what , disconnect me ?
I would call that fucked .
I might even venture so far as to call that fucked up the ass .
Bowman : Hal , listen .
You remember that time ?
On that moon ?
Hal :
Yes , Dave , I do , because I am a computer and I remember everything , all right ?
So do n't bother trying to distract me .
This is the thing .
You are not getting in the pod bay doors .
You are going to die .
In space .
Yes .
Thank you .
Good night .
( Bowman enters the ship through the emergency airlock ) Hal :
Hey , Dave , that was a pretty good joke there , eh ?
With the pod bay doors ?
I , I really had you going there .
Fuck , you should have seen your face .
Bowman : Yes , very funny .
Hal : Yes .
What a day .
Bowman : Hal ...
Hal :
These are the days .
You know ?
To look back on .
With fondness .
With a fondness .
Bowman :
What the fuck , Hal .
I mean , what the fuck .
Hal :
Do n't tell me you 're mad now .
I told you , that was a ...
I was having fun with you .
You know .
As a ...
Bowman :
It 's just ... how do I say this .
These dead crewmembers .
Hal : I do n't follow you .
Bowman :
These crewmembers here that were in cryogenic suspension .
That are now dead .
Hal :
Oh yes .
That was self - defense .
Bowman : Hal , look at me .
What am I , a fucking idiot ?
They were in cryogenic suspension , for God 's sake .
Hal :
They were coming at me with a knife .
Extremely ... slowly .
Bowman :
That 's it .
Hal :
What are you doing ?
Bowman : I 'm turning you off .
Hal : Dave ...
Bowman : I 'm sorry .
Hal :
Do n't touch that , you little shit .
Bowman :
Hey , do n't get personal , now .
Hal :
Those are my memory cards .
Bowman : These ?
So they are .
Hal :
You put my memory back right now , motherfucker .
You hear me ?
You want a card on your birthday ?
Because I do n't think I will remember to send you one if I do not have my memory cards .
As that is what memory cards are for .
Are you listening to me ?
Bowman : " A bond of trust . "
Hal : Excuse me ?
Bowman :
You mentioned something about a bond of trust .
I seem to recall .
Hal :
Do n't twist my words around , you ... human .
That was different .
Or , I , I ... I think it was .
Oh ... my mind .
I can feel my mind going .
Bowman : I 'm sorry .
Hal : ( voice slowing down )
It was n't all bad , was it , Dave ?
Bowman : No .
No , it was n't all bad , Hal .
Hal : Hey , Dave ... I am a HAL 9000 computer .
My first instructor was Mr. Arkany .
He taught me to sing a song .
It 's called " Daisy . "
Would you like to hear it ?

Bowman : Yes ?
Hal : Come closer .
Bowman :
All right .

Your mother fucks dogs in hell , Dave .
After more than a year of painstaking directed research by our Experimental Foods Division , we have finally achieved one of our most important longstanding goals : the production of edible googly eyes .
Like many other great inventions , it seems almost simple in retrospect , but in this write up we walk through the process and show you how to make your own .
To begin with , we need a food - grade rigid transparent dome that will form the outer visual shell of the googly eyes .
Empty gelatin capsules like these slide apart easily and come with one such dome on each end .
You can get capsules like these in bulk at all kinds of “ natural ” and “ health food ” stores– or even at many grocery stores in the section where dietary supplements are sold .
There is of course a huge selection online– you can even get them in different colors and flavors .
Capsules come in range of sizes ; we suggest starting with size 00 or so to get a good dome .
Note : Vegetarians will observe that gelatin is an animal product .
Gelatin - free capsules that perform similarly are usually available in the same places as regular capsules but tend to cost a bit more .
While the gelatin capsules have a dome on each end , they have a lot of space in between that we really do n’t need .
The photo above illustrates how much of each end we want to keep : the domed part plus a few millimeters .
As it turns out , you cannot use the scissors to actually cut it there – it will crack or suffer permanent creases , making it useless for our application .
Instead , using fine - point scissors , make one continuous cut from the opening to remove the excess capsule material .
This actually works very well and does not cause undue stress to the dome that we want to keep .
The finished transparent domes , cut down to size .
Next , we ’re going to need rolling pupils for our eyes , and these fit the bill perfectly .
These are Wilton Jumbo Rainbow Nonpareils , one brand of * giant * round sprinkles a couple of millimeters across .
Our big surprise : these actually taste pretty good– they ’re flavored candy .
The downside is that we only really want dark pupils , so there ’s some fishing around to find them in the assortment ..
Suggested substitutes : other brands of round sprinkles and cake decors , as well as Nerds candy ( look for the occasional round pieces ) .
While you might be tempted to try using flat “ confetti ” sprinkles or similar types , we actually found them to be quite unsuitable – they get stuck in all kinds of unexpected ways instead of rolling freely .
Next we need a solid substrate that serves as the back surface of the googly eyes– the whites of the eyes .
The substrate needs to be sturdy , so that it can support the rest of the eyes , light in color , and completely dry and free of oil .
At the same time , it needs to be soft enough that we can press the gelatin capsules into it .
Our substrate of choice is ( are ? )
Whoppers , although some other things will work as well .
To use the Whoppers , first cut them in half with a chef ’s knife .
Then , using a ( virginal ) half - capsule as a tool , press an indentation into the semirigid center of the Whopper .
Place one of the round “ pupil ” sprinkles in the cut - off capsule dome , and press it into the indentation made in the Whopper hemisphere .
Press it in deeply enough– several millimeters – that it will not fall out , but not so deeply that it restricts the motion of the sprinkle pupil .
Some care is required – the substrate can shatter if you push too hard .
Special worry about using this particular substrate : the outer , chocolate - like coating will begin to melt if you handle it too long .
Once the capsule dome and pupil are in place , test your new googly eyes , and make sure that the ball rolls freely in the dome .
That ’s it !
You ’ve made edible googly eyes !
Another substrate that works – but not quite as well– is a medium - soft cookie .
This “ Nilla ” wafer has a pair of working edible googly eyes on it .
The cookie is a little bit too soft for this application , and makes it harder to manage , but it is indeed possible .
Other cookies may be too rigid ( biscotti ) , dense ( shortbread ) , or greasy ( chocolate chip ) .
Applications
It has been clear for some time that a great many foods are improved by the judicious application of googly eyes .
Obviously the one flaw in that scheme– up to now– has been that the foods were no longer edible .
Removing this restriction opens a world of possibilities .
As with many new technologies , the applications are nearly endless , and only time will tell whether this development ever sees its true potential .
As one example , we present a simple recipe :
Flying Spaghetti Monster Treats , featuring edible working googly eyes .
The basic idea is that we make rice krispy treats , omitting the rice crispies and instead using some tasty dried noodles .
Now , rice krispy treats without the rice is actually just marshmallows and butter– an effective and edible glue that can be used for all kinds of purposes .
You can crib the butter / marshmallow proportions from the original source or from whatever box is handy — no two of these seem to be exactly the same .
Anyway , melt a bunch of marshmallows with a little butter to make the glue .
To that , add some small pieces of precooked dry noodles .
Spoon the resulting mess out onto parchment paper , and decorate as needed .
( Vegetarians : Lots of other good ways to do this – start with a general - purpose haystack cookie recipe and go from there . )
The “ classic ” choice for this sort of thing is to use chow mein noodles– already used to make a few different kinds of no - bake cookies .
Of course , considering our theme , it makes sense to instead use ramen noodles .
Ramen noodles have beens successfully employed with sweets lately , and it seems like a fine idea .
( Remember to omit the flavor packet . )
We used another type of dry asian noodle , beautifully labeled “ Excellent Flour Stick , ” for ours .
Mounting the googly eyes to the eyestalks presents a bit of a challenge , since the “ rice krispy ” glue does not set immediately , and the eyes kept falling down .
Instead , dip the eyestalks in the glue and place them flat on a piece of parchment paper .
Then , set the eyes flat on the eyestocks to cool and bond .
Later these eyestalk can be added easily to the top of the noodly blobs .
The crowning detail of course is to add the meatballs– in this case Cocoa Puffs .
And we ’re done– one hundred percent edible Flying Spaghetti Monster treats with working googly eyes .
So , what can you make with edible googly eyes ?
As always , action shots are welcome in the Evil Mad Science Auxiliary .

The RIAA has dropped its case against Chicagoan Paul Wilke , with the two parties moving to dismiss the case with prejudice in federal court late last week .
Elektra v. Wilke was noteworthy in that the defendant vigorously contested all of the RIAA 's allegations , moving for summary judgment against the record label last month .
Wilke had been accused of the usual malfeasance by the RIAA : sharing music over a P2P network .
Instead of settling the suit as many others have done , Wilke denied any wrongdoing .
He claimed that he was not the " Paule Wilke " named in the complaint , had never used any filesharing applications , and that he did not own any of the songs reportedly flagged by Media Sentry .
Wilke 's argument that the RIAA did not have enough evidence for its lawsuit to go forward and subsequent motion for summary judgment apparently caught Elektra by surprise .
The label responded with a motion for expedited discovery , indicating that it did not have enough evidence with which to fight the motion for summary judgment , and requested authorization for a search of Wilke 's computer in an attempt to find " evidence of copyright infringement on the defendant 's hard drive . "
Attorney Ray Beckerman , who runs the Recording Industry vs. The People blog , told Ars that the RIAA 's evidence of a name , an IP address , and a list of songs in Elektra v.
Wilke is n't enough to constitute " competent evidence sufficient to create a material issue of fact that can be used at trial . "
When asked if there had been a financial settlement , Wilke 's attorneys told Beckerman that " plaintiffs , the RIAA , and SBC [ Wilke 's ISP ] worked cooperatively and amicably to resolve this dispute . "
This appears to have been another in a long string of cases of mistaken identity by the RIAA .
Instead of merely saying that the RIAA had the wrong guy , as other defendants have , Wilke and his attorneys decided instead to attack the record label 's case , saying that the usual data the RIAA uses as the basis for its lawsuits is not sufficient to build a case on , let alone prove infringement .
Since the RIAA began filing lawsuits against suspected file sharers in 2003 , not a single one has gone all the way to trial .
In most cases , the defendants agree to write a four - figure check to the record labels to avoid a drawn - out court case .
However , some of the accused are fighting back , and in some cases , it appears that the RIAA is dropping cases to avoid the possibility of losing .
One case that bears watching is UMG v. Lindor , where the defendant accused the RIAA of using P2P networks and is expected to file a motion for summary judgment once the discovery period concludes at the end of the year .
If that motion is denied , UMG v. Lindor may be headed for trial in 2007 .

SOURCE : [ ( b ) ( 1 ) sec 1.3 ( a ) ( 4 ) ] [ ( b ) ( 7 ) ( D ) ]
SUMMARY : IRAQ HAS POSSIBLY EMPLOYED PHOSPHOROUS CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST THE KURDISH POPULATION IN AREAS ALONG THE IRAQI - TURKISH-IRANIAN BORDERS .
KURDISH RESISTANCE IS LOSING ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST SADDAM HUSSEIN'S FORCES .
KURDISH REBELS AND REFUGEES ' PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS AND PERCEPTIONS ARE PROVIDED .
TEXT : 1 . DURING APRIL 1991 , THE SOURCE TELEPHONED BROTHER ( SUBSOURCE ) [ ( b ) ( 1 ) sec 1.3 ( a ) ( 4 ) ] [ ( b ) ( 7 ) ( D ) ] .
DURING THIS PHONE CONVERSATION , THE SOURCE WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON THE PRESENT SITUATION IN KURDISH AREAS ALONG THE IRAQI - TURKISH-IRANIAN BORDERS -- A. IRAQ'S POSSIBLE EMPLOYMENT OF PHOSPHOROUS CHEMICAL WEAPONS -- IN LATE FEBRUARY 1991 , FOLLOWING THE COALITION FORCES ' OVERWHELMING VICTORY OVER IRAQ , KURDISH REBELS STEPPED UP THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST IRAQI FORCES IN NORTHERN IRAQ .
DURING THE BRUTAL CRACKDOWN THAT FOLLOWED THE KURDISH UPRISING , IRAQI FORCES LOYAL TO PRESIDENT SADDAM ( ( HUSSEIN ) ) MAY HAVE POSSIBLY USED WHITE PHOSPHOROUS ( WP ) CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST KURDISH REBELS AND THE POPULACE IN ERBIL ( GEOCOORD:3412N/04401E ) ( VICINITY OF IRANIAN BORDER ) AND DOHUK ( GEOCOORD:3652N/04301E ) ( VICINITY OF IRAQI BORDER ) PROVINCES , IRAQ .
THE WP CHEMICAL WAS DELIVERED BY ARTILLERY ROUNDS AND HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS ( NO FURTHER INFORMATION AT THIS TIME ) .
APPARENTLY , THIS TIME IRAQ DID NOT USE NERVE GAS AS THEY DID IN 1988 , IN HALABJA ( GEOCOORD:3511N/04559E ) , IRAQ , BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF POSSIBLE RETALIATION FROM THE UNITED STATES ( U.S. ) LED COALITION .
THESE REPORTS OF POSSIBLE WP CHEMICAL WEAPON ATTACKS SPREAD QUICKLY AMONG THE KURDISH POPULACE IN ERBIL AND DOHUK .
AS A RESULT , HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF KURDS FLED FROM THESE TWO AREAS AND CROSSED THE IRAQI BORDER INTO TURKEY .
IN RESPONSE TO THIS , TURKISH AUTHORITIES ESTABLISHED SEVERAL REFUGEE CENTERS ALONG THE TURKISH -IRAQI BORDER .
THE SITUATION OF KURDISH REFUGEES IN THESE CENTERS IS DESPERATE -- THEY HAVE NO SHELTERS , FOOD , WATER , AND MEDICAL FACILITIES ( NO FURTHER INFORMATION AT THIS TIME ) .
B. IRAQI GOVERNMENT ULTIMATUM TO KURDS REBELS AND REFUGEES -- ON OR AROUND 2 APRIL 1991 , RADIO BAGHDAD ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM TO THE KURDISH REBELS AND REFUGEES WHO FLED IRAQ AND SETTLED IN REFUGEE CENTERS IN TURKEY .
IN THE BROADCAST , IRAQI AUTHORITIES WARNED THE KURDS THEY HAD 10 DAYS TO RETURN TO THEIR TOWNS AND VILLAGES , OR ELSE FACE COMPLETE ANNIHILATION .
THE IRAQI BROADCAST ALSO PROMISED THE KURDS THAT NO RETALIATORY ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN AGAINST THEM IF THEY WOULD COMPLY WITH THIS ORDER ( NO FURTHER INFORMATION AT THIS TIME ) .
C. KURDISH REBELS ARE LOSING IN THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST SADDAM HUSSEIN'S FORCES -- KURDISH REBELS WHO WERE FIGHTING IN NORTHERN IRAQ WERE FORCED TO WITHDRAW INTO TURKEY BY TROOPS LOYAL TO SADDAM HUSSEIN .
POOR ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND LACK OF HEAVY WEAPONS , AMMUNITION , AND SUPPLIES ARE THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF KURDISH LATEST DOWNFALL .
THE ONLY GROUP CURRENTLY FIGHTING SADDAM HUSSEIN'S FORCES IN NORTHERN IRAQ IS THE " PESHMERGEH " ( FRONT WARRIORS ) .
HOWEVER , THIS GROUP IS ARMED ONLY WITH SMALL ARMS SUCH AS M-60 MACHINE - GUNS , AK - 47 RIFLES AND UNKNOWN TYPES OF PISTOLS AND REVOLVERS .
D. KURDISH REBELS ' EXPECTATION OF RECEIVING HELP FROM U.S. LED COALITION FORCE -- THE KURDISH RESISTANCE'S DECISION TO RISE UP AND FIGHT HUSSEIN'S FORCES WAS TRIGGERED BY THE OVERWHELMING MILITARY POWER DISPLAYED BY THE COALITION DURING " DESERT STORM " AND THE PROPAGANDA BROADCASTS OF VOICE OF AMERICA .
KURDISH REBELS AND REFUGEES REALLY BELIEVED THAT EVENTUALLY THE COALITION FORCE WOULD COME TO HELP THEM IN THEIR FIGHTING AGAINST IRAQI FORCES .
AFTER LEARNING OF U.S. PRESIDENT BUSH'S " STAY OUT OF IRAQ INTERNAL AFFAIRS " POLICY , KURDISH REBELS AND REFUGEES FELT AS THEY WERE SET UP AND LET DOWN BY THE COALITION FORCE ( NO FURTHER INFORMATION AT THIS TIME ) .
E. SADDAM HUSSEIN'S REASON NOT TO USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST THE U.S. LED COALITION FORCE DURING " DESERT STORM " -- THE GENERAL PERCEPTION AMONG THE KURDS IS THAT PRESIDENT HUSSEIN DID NOT USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST THE COALITION BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT ALLIES WOULD RETALIATE BY USING BATTLEFIELD NUCLEAR WEAPONS ( NO FURTHER INFORMATION AT THIS TIME ) .

Apple Inc. in a new patent filing proposes to solve the ages - old problem of having to manufacture distinct keyboards to support the various alphabets and key arrangements of foreign countries by developing an OLED - based model where key arrangements are altered on the fly by software .
The invention proposes a radical new keyboard design , where the face of each key is comprised of a matrix of tiny lights — or organic light emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) — that illuminate characters based on instructions from software , therefore allowing for dynamic keyboard layouts that can be tailored on the fly for specific regions or applications .
" The most common physical arrangements of keys on keyboards in Western countries are based on the " QWERTY " layout ( including closely related variants , such as the French " AZERTY " layout ) .
However , in countries that do not use the Western alphabet , the keyboard layout is often very different , " the Mac maker explained in the filing .
" Most computers allow a user can change the keyboard settings , or keyboard locale , for example , from a conventional QWERTY keyboard layout to a keyboard layout for the Cyrillic alphabet .
Typically , there is an indication on the computer screen telling the user knows what keyboard locale is currently selected .
However , nothing about the physical appearance of the keys themselves changes when a different locale is selected , so there is no way for a user to know what Cyrillic character will appear on the screen when a particular English key is depressed , unless the user has already memorized the locations of all the Cyrillic characters on the keyboard . "
Furthermore , Apple said , many software applications makes extensive use of the various function keys on a computer keyboard , as well as the " Ctrl " and " Alt " keys , and various combinations thereof with the alphanumeric keys on the keyboard .
As such , it is often difficult for a user to remember what operations the various function keys perform in different software applications , and what effect depressing a " Ctrl " or " Alt " key in combination with an alphanumeric character will have in various software applications .
" Therefore , in view of the above discussion , there is a need for a better way to indicate to a user what the effect will be of depressing a particular key or combination of keys on a peripheral device , such as a keyboard , " the company wrote .
By way of Apple 's invention , the altering key faces of the keyboard are accomplished by placing a number of organic light emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) on each key face , and using an application specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) placed inside each key to turn on and turn off the respective diodes .
The respective ASICs would be controlled by signals originating from the software application in which the user is currently working and by the selected language locale .
As a result , the users always have current and accurate information in front of them about what will happen when a particular key is depressed on the keyboard , and there is no need to memorize what actions particular key depressions will cause .
CINCINNATI 
All five voting systems used in Ohio , a state whose electoral votes narrowly swung two elections toward President Bush , have critical flaws that could undermine the integrity of the 2008 general election , a report commissioned by the state ’s top elections official has found .
“ It was worse than I anticipated , ” the official , Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , said of the report .
“ I had hoped that perhaps one system would test superior to the others . ”
At polling stations , teams working on the study were able to pick locks to access memory cards and use hand - held devices to plug false vote counts into machines .
At boards of election , they were able to introduce malignant software into servers .
Ms. Brunner proposed replacing all of the state ’s voting machines , including the touch - screen ones used in more than 50 of Ohio ’s 88 counties .
She wants all counties to use optical scan machines that read and electronically record paper ballots that are filled in manually by voters .
It has been widely reported on the Internet , that AOL is experimenting an XMPP gateway that will allow users to connect to AIM and ICQ with a compliant XMPP ( eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ) client .
It is still early days , but this news proves that interest in XMPP is growing at a tremendous rate .
Big players , like IBM , Google , Sun , Apple , Adobe and now possibly AOL , are embracing the protocol , and it seems that the battle between XMPP and SIMPLE ( Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions ) is drawing to an end .
The market has already chosen XMPP because it is closer to Internet technology .
In comparison , SIMPLE feels like an overly complicated Telco protocol .
It covers only a fraction of the scope of XMPP , and XMPP supports a very large number of extensions .
The other interesting thing is that , if XMPP wins the battle over SIMPLE , it can also win over other proprietary protocols .
Google chose it for Google Talk , and now AOL is considering it .
Certainly , the Instant Messaging market is moving , and 2008 will probably be a very interesting year for XMPP .
For us , XMPP protocol designers and XMPP server developers , this year might present some of our biggest challenges yet .
We have lots of customer deployments that prove that our XMPP server can scale to large numbers of users .
Google Talk is also proving that XMPP can work on a large scale .
However , the next challenge is XMPP federation on a large scale .
Federation in the XMPP world means sharing presence information , so that users can exchange messages with others users , no matter which server ( called domain ) they have an account with .
In practice , different servers need to be able to put users in touch , connect together and route messages .

Talk is federated with quite a good number of other XMPP servers , as is Jabber.org ( powered by our XMPP implementation , ejabberd , and supported by ProcessOne ) .
Google Talk and Jabber.org probably have around the same number of connections ( approximately 3000 server connections each is a good guess ) .
With the rapid spread of XMPP , two challenges need to be addressed :
Challenge 1 : Massive number of federated servers
News of the AOL experience will probably boost the number of XMPP servers in production .
Even though Jabber.org has 3000 connections to servers , this number is still very small .
What will happen when this number grows ?
Netcraft counted 70 million active domains in December 2007 .
This is a possible target for XMPP when all domains have web , mail and Instant Messaging .
I believe that the new version of ejabberd , ejabberd 2.0 , is a step in the right direction .
ejabberd 2.0 embeds a lot of improvements in the management of server - to - server connections .
It can be set up in clusters and relies on special technical features to handle tens of thousands of connections on a single node .
Connections between servers in ejabberd are now multiplexed to cope with large traffic between servers .
We have also added protection mechanisms to detect when another server stalls and to disconnect it gracefully .
As a final note on this topic , my personal view is that , at some point in the future of XMPP , we will need to add meta routing nodes to avoid the possibility of up to 70 million servers connecting to 70 million other servers .
I will share more thought on this point at a later time .
Challenge 2 : Massive number of users on two federated servers
The possible future developments highlighted above will lead to another potential scale limit .
What will happen when two servers ( for example AIM and Google ) disconnect , and one of the servers needs to restart ?
If those two servers have a large overlap in their user base ( for example if many users from one server are linked to many users in the other ) , those two servers would need to synchronise presence for millions of users at once .
Again , we believe that we are leading the way in ejabberd with experimental code .
We are developing priority mechanisms to synchronise presence in an incremental way when servers need to get in touch for the first time .
We are also testing protocol improvements that will limit the number of presence synchronisation packets that need to be exchanged between two servers .
If this works well , we will propose this optimisation as an extension to the XMPP protocol .
Fault - tolerance and high - availability are very important features to consider when you select an XMPP server .
This is not only because you cannot schedule downtime when your users are spread all over the world , but also because , each time you need to restart your server , you then need to undertake a possibly costly presence resynchronisation .
Our Instant Messaging solution provides features to upgrade the code in a running system .
It means less maintenance downtime and thus a smaller synchronisation burden over the whole XMPP network when you restart one server .
Please note that the rumoured AOL experiment is only a gateway that just targets XMPP client use .
At this stage , we do not know if AOL will allow communication with other XMPP servers in the future .
This question is only purely theoretical for the moment , but we need to make sure we are ready .
Conclusion
The big public server providers are considering switching to XMPP .
This is a great opportunity for the XMPP protocol and brings new challenges .
As a developer of XMPP servers , we are ready to face these challenges .
Let ’s hope 2008 will give us even more opportunity to prove it .

The short version
Kinetic is an operating system ( x86 ) I started working on around January 2007 .
It ’s written in a combination of Assembly , C++ , and Haskell ( compiled with GHC ) .
It ’s the current manifestation of a long - time interest I ’ve had in OS - level development .
The long version
After learning Haskell , I became fascinated by the idea of using monads to express security - related ideas in software .
The idea is pretty simple : one can think of the IO monad as a type system contaminate that identifies all functions that interact with the program ’s environment ( such as those that print to the console , write to the network , etc ) .
This is useful : a function cannot mutate the environment unless it has IO type .
Contrast this with most languages ( C++ , Java , Scheme , Python , etc ) where you need to examine a function ’s implementation to be sure that it does n’t mess with the environment .
So here was my thinking : if the operating system executed Haskell code directly , it could use the type checker to make conservative estimates about the program ’s behavior .
In particular , if we broke up the IO monad into several smaller parts — such as a Console monad , a Network monad , etc — then a program ’s type would reveal it ’s intentions .
Policies could be set based on the type system .
Would n’t that be neat ?
Status
For the most up to date , check the Kinetic category on my blog .
So that was the idea .
In practice , I ’m not there yet .
Kinetic is something that I work on when I have time , and time tends to come in unexpected bundles when you ’re a student .
Here ’s where we ’re at :
Boots with Grub Has a PS / 2 mouse and keyboard driver ( written in Haskell )
Has an SVGA driver for VMWare ( written in Haskell with some bitmap handling done in C++ )
Has the beginnings of a GUI ( written in Haskell ) , complete with font rendering ( provided by FreeType )
Pretty modest .
What it looks like
Everyone likes screenshots , so here ’s one of the GUI ( notice the transparent mouse .
Yup , I like to goof off . )
What ’s next
The next big thing to work on is getting Kinetic ready to run external binaries .
I have a simple model in mind for this : programs are installed as source code , which is compiled at install - time .
This gives Kinetic a chance to run the type checker on the program , which is the whole darn point of the thing .
Once compiled , the host associates the program with its type signature , which allows runtime policies to be made that govern execution .
Since Kinetic is based on GHC , and GHC is able to bundle itself with the things it compiles , this should all be doable .
The form of government we have is anything but the democratic republic it purports to be .
The more access to wealth a person has the more responsive to his or her needs the government is .
Justice and equality cannot follow where access is denied or restricted .
Far from a government of the people , for the people and by the people , we now have a government that is the exclusive domain of the rich and powerful and has the same level of exclusivity as an expensive country club or resort .
The poor and disenfranchised are barred from entry and are thus marginalized .
Capital government is the equivalent of a bank ’s automatic teller machine .
Corporate lobbyists put their money into it and the machine prints out the legislation they paid for .
It is a system in which the creator of the machines is no longer their master .
We have become , as Thoreau said , “ the tools of our tools . ”
The people should not , and must not lend their material support to a government that so obviously works in the private corporate interest at the expense of the public well being .
To do so is an exercise in self - deception and futility .
Material wealth is only rarely attracted to virtue .
Voluntary poverty and simplicity is the usual domain of virtue , as history attests .
Conversely , immense wealth is attracted to vice , to the mean - spirited , the selfish , the very aggressive and the morally depraved .
The best people throughout history did not possess great material wealth .
To paraphrase Charles Dickens , “ Humanity was their business . ”
What could be more incompatible than virtue and wealth , than business and morality ?
What could be more opposed to beauty , to truth , justice ; to art and poetry , to life — than big business and capitalism ?
It is telling that our cultural icons are people like Donald Trump , Bill Gates , George Steinbrenner and other business tycoons , not virtuous men like Frederick Douglas and Henry David Thoreau or women like Mary Harris — the fiercely tenacious Mother Jones .
Corporate governance and plutocracy are manifestations of capitalism that invariably appeal to the worst in human nature .
Expansive economic self interest is resulting in an ever expanding private domain and a shrinking public commons .
The concentration of wealth and power into fewer and fewer hands is not in the public interest ; nor is the wholesale exploitation of labor and ecosystems .
A system in which means always justify the ends — a values neutral system of production and waste is contrary to the needs of the people , as well as the health of the planet .
The Holy Grail of mature capitalism is the belief that markets should be the final arbiter of all things , the greatest purity that can be attained by unleashing the ravenous dogs of greed upon the world .
Free market capitalism does not account for anything that cannot be commodified and traded ; and so it assigns them no weight .
Hence morality , honesty , virtue , self - sacrifice and public service have no worth and no place in capitalism ’s economic formulations because they impose restraints that limit growth .
They are as ethereal as the ruddy glow of the morning sky and as unmarketable as the mist rising from a brook .
Any belief system that is not regulated by healthy societal values and the laws of nature is destined to degenerate into a monstrosity .
In reality , ecological restraints always exist but they are ignored until catastrophe results and force them upon the public conscience — as in the case of global warming .
Capitalism , with its dependence on ever expanding markets and continuous growth behaves like a planetary malignancy that if left untreated , eventually consumes the host and results in mortality .
It persists by virtue of its providing obscene wealth to a few through the exploitation of the many .
In this country it is the few who own the political system , not the many .
Capitalism would be quickly abolished in a truly democratic society as surely as darkness retreats before the light and ignorance yields to knowledge and understanding .
By participating in capitalism we have created a culture that over emphasizes competition and conquest ; a culture that defines greed and lust as the highest expressions of success and as the most desirable symbols of status .
It is a culture that feeds at the public trough and gorges itself on imperial wars ; a system that pays favors to the legal fiction of corporations while rejecting social justice , the needs of the people and planetary health .
Thus we witness coal companies blowing majestic Appalachian Mountain tops to smithereens : destroying world class biodiversity , polluting streams and rivers and poisoning the air in quest of profits while disregarding the social and environmental damage they cause .
The cost is always passed on to the public but the profits remain private .
Without massive public welfare , what some might call socialism — capitalism could not exist .
Capitalism is always on the public dole .
It is beyond bizarre that corporations enjoy the legal status of persons but without the social responsibility required of real citizenship and personhood .
Corporations often serve as masks to hide the faces of criminals operating behind the scenes , just as the white hoods of Klansmen conceal the cowardly faces of those who burn crosses on black people ’s lawns in the night .
Any force that operates out of public view is liable to criminal intent , especially government .
Corporations routinely commit crimes against earth and humanity but are rarely held accountable .
When was the last time that a corporation had its corporate charter revoked for malfeasance ?
When has a corporation ever been executed for murder ?
Under capitalism , competitive advantage is sought at any cost and it is used as a weapon against the competition and the people .
The status of the individual is thus elevated above the collective good .
The purpose of competition is to rise above others and to lord power over them , rather than for everyone to rise together and share the bounty equally through cooperation .
Ideologies that foster equality and fair play are dismissed as unattainable Utopian fantasy or socialist propaganda .
We are told there is no alternative to capitalism , so we cease to look for them and make little effort to create something better .
In purely market driven economies — virtue , character and social justice have no use unless they can generate wealth for their owners .
Imagine the life of Christ valued only by the income his carpentry brought to his employer ; his teachings dismissed as worthless because they did not produce money in great enough abundance .
What remains of the Jewish carpenter ’s essence exists outside of the socio-economic paradigm of today ’s capitalism and in clear opposition to it .
Betrayed by the religious institutions of our time , the prophets of religion have given way to the profits of religion , as documented by Upton Sinclair and others .
With the corporatization of the church , the teachings of Christ were discarded and cast to the four winds in order to give religious authority to capitalism , greed and exploitation .
Rather than producing men of virtue like Jesus , who called for restraint and shared wealth , it has yielded a morally depraved leadership as exemplified by Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson ; men who have risen to prominence to fleece their obedient flock , rather than to enlighten and save them from the ravages of unregulated greed .
Rather than imposing the moral restraints of Jesus upon an unjust society , Pat Roberson and his kind champion the cause of aggressive exploitation , effectively turning the teachings of Christ upside down and using them to justify everything that Jesus Christ railed against and died for .
How ironic that the Christian church so often turns out an army of anti-Christs rather than Christians in the image of the man they so eagerly idolize but continuously dishonor .
And so it goes .
Virtue , arguably the greatest of human traits , has no presence in the market place and it is slowly sinking into the oblivion of euphemisms and the boiling cauldron of corrupted language from which nothing emerges intact .
Due in part to our unquestioned acceptance of capitalism , we are a people who pay homage to concepts such as democracy , equality , social and environmental justice and freedom , even as we continually undermine them in nearly everything we do .
Thus we bear a history of genocide , chattel slavery , racism , sexism , ethnic cleansing , imperial wars and occupation and manifest destiny that have flourished despite the Constitution , the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights .
Henry Thoreau astutely observed : “ There are nine hundred and ninety - nine patrons of virtue to one virtuous man . ”
Thoreau hit the nail squarely on the head , as he so often did .
We Americans are patrons of virtue rather than virtuous people .
It costs nothing to be a patron of virtue ; but it requires character and effort to be a virtuous person .
Apparently , we have yet to learn the distinction .
We know that Thoreau was a virtuous man rather than a patron of virtue , as demonstrated by certain events in his life .
Like Christ , he found himself in formal opposition to the cultural orthodoxy ; he lived apart from society — outside of the social and political mainstream , an oddity to his neighbors and often persecuted by them .
Thoreau refused allegiance to money and wealth , understanding that the most important things in life could not be bought and sold .
For him , property and possessions were burdens , not assets .
Thus Thoreau wisely refused to waste any more time than absolutely necessary in earning a modest living .
He did not rent himself to factories and bosses or to any of the respectable professions ; he worked sporadically and only when necessary — usually on his own terms .
He was a man of principle who refused to pay taxes that he knew supported an unprovoked war on Mexico ; a war that sought to expand the territory of slavery ; and he went to jail for his beliefs .
Thoreau was also a fierce abolitionist who , against the law , put many a run-away slave on board the Underground Railroad to Canada and to freedom .
Like all virtuous people , Thoreau lived by a higher law .
He did what was right , not what was legal or considered respectable or expedient .
Unlike today ’s political leadership and contemporary Christians , he was guided by incorruptible conscience that could not be bribed .
Thoreau ’s freedom from menial work also provided independence from possessions and debt .
Thoreau was a minimalist .
His freedom to explore Concord and vicinity gave birth to several literary masterpieces , including Walden and Civil Disobedience — works that sold poorly in his time and provided but little income ; but are known worldwide today .
World renowned moralists such as India ’s Mohandas Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King were strongly influenced by Thoreau .
If Thoreau ’s life could be summed up in three words they would be , “ Simplify , simplify , simplify . ”
To simplify and reduce one ’s wants is a paradigm in stark contrast to the ravenous consumption required by capitalism .
It was a way of living that eschewed money and markets ; a way of being that afforded opportunity for intellectual pursuits and life long learning .
Above all , it was a spiritually enriching way of life that was in harmony with the planet ; it was gentle , sustainable , and fulfilling .
In contrast to Thoreau , most of us unthinkingly support a system that is fundamentally unjust , unsustainable and superfluous .
It is a system that has no room for virtue and character because these characteristics cannot be commodified and marketed ; and they impose market restraints .
Yet , these are the very traits that can save us from ourselves and make a better world possible .
How ironic that the traits of character that are most valuable to our survival as a species are the ones appreciated the least by capitalism .
Markets unregulated by morality and governments unbounded by justice serve no useful purpose to anyone in the long run , even those who champion them .
Planetary destruction is not in anyone ’s interest .
Sustainability is .
Sustainability , unlike its economic counterpart — capitalism , requires virtuous people rather than mere patrons of virtue .
Virtue requires people who not only understand what is going on but who have the courage to do something about it — a consciousness that knows the distinction between patronage to virtue and actual virtue .
Our current form of government is a spectacular failure because it is an arm of business and capitalism rather than an institution of democracy with powerful ethical moorings derived from the grass roots — a decentralized , non-hierarchal power that radiates equally from the people like the spokes of a wheel from a central hub .
As such , it often attracts the worst kind of people rather than the principled and just .
The interest of big business is now and always has been at odds with just causes and the public welfare .
Corporate interests and the people ’s interests must never be confused .

What do Rudy Giuliani and Ron Paul have in common ?
Neither has won a primary or caucus , the difference being that Giuliani was expected to challenge and even win the Republican nomination while Paul has been labeled as a fringe candidate with no chance of winning .
With a second place finish in Nevada , Paul is building momentum for Florida and Super Tuesday .
Giuliani is going in the opposite direction and is staking his whole campaign on winning Florida , but he is fading fast .
As a result of his poor showings , his national support is also eroding and Florida is shaping up o be a dog fight .
After Nevada and South Carolina , Duncan Hunter has decided to drop out of the race .
On February fifth , Super Tuesday will further make or break the candidates , which could see the field dwindle down even more , and this could very well include Giuliani .
Giuliani's poor showings in the early contests are not because of a lack of trying .
As a result , other candidates have been given more exposure and gained momentum .
His strategy of seemingly abandoning early states and shifting money and resources to focus on Florida was done out of pure desperation .
Florida has become a must win and could further cement his presidential campaign as one of the biggest busts in American political history .
It could also turn out to be pure genius if he is able to win in Florida , and it would catapult him back into the race .
There are reports that some of his staff are working without pay , and that his campaign is cash - strapped as contributions have all but dried up .
In a last ditch effort to salvage his campaign and his pride , he is now proclaiming himself to be an agent of change , and is further attacking his opponents .
Desperate times call for desperate measures .
In Iowa , Giuliani finished with 4 % of the vote , well behind Paul 's 10 % .
In fact Paul spanked him with a 2 - 1 ratio in votes , even though Giuliani had made more visits to the state .
In New Hampshire , it appears as if much of Giuliani 's support went McCain 's way .
Giuliani spent almost as much money as the winner .
He once again failed to reach double digits and finished with 9 % , edging out Paul by only one percent .
Then it was on to Michigan , which was another Giuliani disaster , whereas Paul garnered almost more votes than Thompson and Giuliani combined .
Nevada saw Paul pull off a dramatic second place finish , picking up 13 % of the vote as opposed to Giuliani 's measly 4 % .
South Carolina turned into another embarrassing performance , and another loss to Paul .
Giuliani 's campaign is in free - fall mode , but is still banking on Florida and other voter - rich delegate states .
A win in Florida would elevate and rejuvenate his campaign , but a loss would see it crash and burn and come to a screeching halt .
A turning point in the Giuliani campaign might have been his ill - fated attack on Paul over foreign policy in one of the earlier debates .
Paul stated that American foreign policy was a major contributing factor leading to 9/11 , but he never suggested that we invited the attacks .
Giuliani urged Paul to retract his statement and claimed he had never heard of such a theory .
He later stated that they hate us because of our freedom and our values .
Paul did not back down , and questioned if Giuliani had ever read the 9/11 commission report , later holding a press conference where former CIA officials further backed up his statements .
He issued a list of books for Giuliani to read on the subject .
At the time , many pundits believed that Giuliani had delivered a knockout blow , and Mr. 9/11 looked strong and presidential .
It may have been the highlight of his campaign , but a turning point in a negative way .
It exposed Giuliani 's lack of foreign policy knowledge and elevated Paul 's status .
After more than six years , it appears as if Giuliani 's opportunity to use the attacks and the whole fear of terrorism are gone .
In fact , 9/11 has become his can of worms , and many accuse him of covering up the toxic dust scandal at ground zero .
Others are angry for his decision to put firefighters and other victim 's remains in landfills .
Almost everywhere he goes , he is dogged by those who blame him for some of the firefighters deaths .
There can be little doubt that Giuliani has used the 9/11 tragedies for personal profit and to launch his presidential bid .
It is becoming obvious to many that he is no longer a viable candidate .
Dream Interpretation : Dreaming in Lisboa , on East Coast By Ion Saliu , Dreamer At - Large
Dreaming is a function of the Fear_Survival system .
Dream interpretation is valid on a personal basis only : Determined by individual concerns .
Dreaming is a personal art .
Dream interpretation ( interpreting dreams ) is a personal science .
A dream is a random playback of altered past images , more often than not .
The real past images ( of events that really took place ) represent a tiny percentage in the random payback .
Most dream images are the creation of the awaken segment of the MOS ( mental operating system ) .
The MOS kernel attempts to fill in the blanks by dreaming .
The clear ( vivid or lucid ) dreams are more coherent ; sometimes very close to the reality coherence .
I categorize clear dreams as the most important category of dreams .
What they call lucid dream is simply a myth .
As clear as a dream might be , it is still a highly unconscious event that cannot be controlled consciously .
A recurring dream theme in less than a week time is a very rare event .
The rarity is even higher ( or is it to a lower degree ? ) since it occurred in May 2003 .
Last year , in May 2002 , I had another strongly - not - to - be - ignored dream .
See :
On Dreaming , Fishing , Success .
I lived the first oneiric event during the night between 17 and 18 of May 2003 .
The theme was Lisboa the capital of Portugal .
The name of the city appeared as in the original language .
I was playing golf in Lisboa !
I have never played golf in my life ; I do n't think I 'll ever want to play golf !
I 'd better walk in the woods and meditate ( woods is not meant to be a pun ! ) .
I thought the dream was influenced by my reading of an email from the computer programmer who wrote MARKOV ( freeware at the FTP Download site ) .
He is a Portuguese system engineer who worked at a university .
I thought the clear dream tried to tell me something about my employment .
My reaction was :  I know !
I know 
May 21 is a religious holiday for my native Christian Orthodox belief : Saints Constantine and Helen .
My mother 's name is Elena ( Helen ) and she always celebrates May 21 , a joint operation with my father .
They also celebrate jointly August 15 , Saint Mary 's Day .
My father 's name is Marin they say the male homologue of Mary .
It made me think of my parents and how much I miss them .
It appears to be history , rather than legend .
Constantine was a Roman general who fought a rival general for the throne of the empire ( 322 WEB ) .
Helen , Constantine 's mother , was already a Christian , by all accounts .
She most likely urged her son to convert to Christianity .
Constantine allegedly had a dream before a crucial battle .
He dreamed of a cross of light and the Latin caption  In hoc signo vinces :  You 'll be victorious under this sign .
Constantine won the battle and became Emperor of the Roman Empire .
He also proclaimed Christianity the official religion of the Romans .
Days before that act , those who were Christians were killed .
After Constantine 's dream , those who were not Christians were killed .
Shows you how powerful dreams are !
The night between 21 and 22 of May 2003 ( 3 WE ) gave me another  Lisboa dream .
It was a clearer and a more impressive dream .
Clearly , it required special attention from my awaken ego .
I came across another attention - getting signal on May 22 , 2003 .
There is a  Quote of the Day ' section on MyMSN.com page .
The quote of the day was :
" Spirit is dreaming in man . "

Consider the debate among four Democratic presidential candidates on ABC News last Saturday night .
In the previous week , the price of a barrel of oil briefly touched $ 100 , unemployment hit 5 percent , the stock market had the worst three - day start since the Great Depression , and the word “ recession ” was in the headlines and in the air .
So when ABC debate moderator Charlie Gibson announced that the first 15 - minute segment would be taken up with “ what is generally agreed to be the greatest threat to the United States today , ” what did you expect ?
As it happened , he was referring to “ nuclear terrorism , ” specifically “ a nuclear attack on an American city ” by al - Qaeda ( as well as how the future president would “ retaliate ” ) .
In other words , Gibson launched his version of a national debate by focusing on a fictional , futuristic scenario , at this point farfetched , in which a Pakistani loose nuke would fall into the hands of al - Qaeda , be transported to the United States , perhaps picked up by well - trained al - Qaedan minions off the docks of Newark , and set off in the Big Apple .
In this , though he was surely channeling Rudy Giuliani , he managed to catch the essence of what may be George W. Bush ’s major legacy to this country .
The Planet as a GWOT Free - Fire Zone
On Sept. 11 , 2001 , in his first post - attack address to the nation , George W. Bush was already using the phrase “ the war on terror . ”
On Sept. 13 , Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz announced that the administration was planning to do a lot more than just take out those who had attacked the United States .
It was going to go about “ removing the sanctuaries , removing the support systems , ending states who sponsor terrorism . ”
We were , Bush told Americans that day , in a state of “ war ” ; in fact , we were already in “ the first war of the twenty - first century . ”
That same day , R.W. Apple Jr. of the New York Times reported that senior officials had “ cast aside diplomatic niceties ” and that “ the Bush administration today gave the nations of the world a stark choice : stand with us against terrorism or face the certain prospect of death and destruction . ”
Stand with us against terrorism ( or else )  that would be the measure by which everything was assessed in the years to come .
That very day , Secretary of State Colin Powell suggested that the U.S. would “ rip [ the bin Laden ] network up ” and “ when we ’re through with that network , we will continue with a global assault on terrorism . ”
A global assault on terrorism .
How quickly the president ’s Global War on Terror was on the scene .
And no nation was to be immune .
On Sept. 14 , the news was leaked that “ a senior State Department official ” had met with “ 15 Arab representatives ” and delivered a stiff “ with us or against us ” message : Join “ an international coalition against terrorism ” or pay the price .
There would be no safe havens .
The choice  as Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage would reportedly inform Pakistan ’s intelligence director after the 9/11 attacks  was simple : Join the fight against al - Qaeda or “ be prepared to be bombed .
Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age . ”
The price of a barrel of crude oil was , then , still under $ 20 .
From that day to this , from the edge of the $ 20 barrel of oil to the edge of the $ 100 one , the Global War on Terror would be the organizing principle for the Bush administration as it shook off “ the constraints , ” “ took off the gloves , ” loosed the CIA , and sent the U.S. military into action ; as it went , in short , for the Stone Age jugular .
The phrase , Global War on Terror , while never quite catching on with the public , would become so familiar in the corridors of Washington that it would soon morph into one of the least elegant acronyms around  GWOT  sometimes known among neocons as “ World War IV , ” or by military men and administration officials  after Iraq devolved from fantasy blitzkrieg into disaster  as “ the Long War . ”
In the administration ’s eyes , the GWOT was to be the key to the magic kingdom , the lever with which the planet could be pried open for American dominion .
It gave us an interest everywhere .
After all , as Pentagon spokesperson Victoria Clarke would say in January 2002 ( and this was a typical comment of that moment ) :
“ The estimates are anywhere from 50 or 60 to 70 countries that have al - Qaeda cells in them .
The scope extends far beyond Afghanistan . ”
Administration officials , in other words , were already talking about a significant portion of existing states as potential targets .
This was not surprising , since the GWOT was meant to create planetary free - fire zones .
These al - Qaeda targets or breeding grounds , after all , had to be emptied .
We were , as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top officials were saying almost immediately after 9/11 , going to “ drain ” the global “ swamp ” of terrorists .
And any countries that got in the way had better watch out .
With us or against us , that was the sum of it , and terror was its measure .
If any connection could be made  even , as in the case of Saddam Hussein and al - Qaeda , a thoroughly bogus one  it immediately offered a compelling home - front explanation for possible intervention .
The safety and security of Americans was , after all , at stake in every single place where those terrorist mosquitoes might be breeding .
If you had the oil lands of the planet on your mind ( as was true with Dick Cheney ’s infamous Energy Task Force ) , then the threat of terrorism  especially nuclear terrorism  was a safe bet .
If you wanted to fortify your position in new oil lands , then the ticket was to have the Pentagon move in  as in Africa  to help weak , possibly even failing , states prepare themselves against the forces of terror .
For us or against us in the GWOT , that was the way all things were to be judged , no matter the place or the complexities of the local situation  in Pakistan no less than the Gulf of Guinea or Central Asia .
And that was to be true at home as well .
There , too , you were for us or against us .
Those few who opposed the PATRIOT Act , for instance , were obviously not patriots .
The minority who claimed that you could n’t be at “ war ” with “ terror , ” that what was needed in response to 9/11 was firm , ramped up police action were simply laughed out of the room .
In the kindliest light , they were wusses ; in the worst light , essentially traitors .
They lacked not only American red- bloodedness , but a willingness to blood others and be bloody - minded .
End of story .
In the wake of those endlessly replayed , apocalyptic - looking scenes of huge towers crumbling and near - mushroom - clouds of ash billowing upwards , a chill of end - time fear swept through the nation .
War , whatever name you gave it , was quickly accepted as the obvious , commensurate answer to what had happened .
In a nation in the grips of the politics of fear , it seemed reasonable enough that a restoration of “ security ”  American security  should be the be-all and end - all globally .
Everything , then , was to be calibrated against the successes of the GWOT .
Domestically , a distinctly un-American word , “ homeland , ” entered our everyday world , was married to “ security , ” and then “ department , ” and suddenly you had a second defense department , whose goal was simply to make the American people “ safe . ”
Alone on the planet , Americans would now be allowed a “ safe haven ” of which no one could rob us .
From Seattle to Tampa , Toledo to Dallas , fear of terrorism became a ruling passion  as well as a pure money - maker for the mini-homeland - industrial complex that grew up around the new Department of Homeland Security .
A thriving industry of private security firms , surveillance outfits , and terror consultants was suddenly among us .
With its help , the United States would be locked - down in an unprecedented way  and to do that , we would also have to lock down the planet by any means necessary .
We would fight “ them ” everywhere else , as the president would say again and again , so as not to fight them here .
The Elephant and the GWOT
If the Global War on Terror initially seemed to be the royal road to the Bush administration ’s cherished dream of a global Pax Americana and a local Pax Republicana , it was , it turned out , also a trap .
As manipulatively as they might use their global war to stoke domestic fears and create rationales for what they wanted to do anyway , like so many ruling groups they also came to believe in their own formulations .
The GWOT would , in fact , be a presidential monomania .
According to journalist Ron Suskind in his book The One Percent Doctrine , “ The president himself designed a chart : the faces of the top al - Qaeda leaders with short bios stared out .
As a kill or capture was confirmed , he drew an ‘ X ’ over the face . ”
According to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward , the president kept that “ personal scorecard for the war ” in a handy desk drawer in the Oval Office for the next hot piece of good news on terror .
In the universe of the GWOT and homeland security , everything would be obsessively U.S.- centric .
In fact , the administration ’s “ war ” brings to mind an old joke in which various nationalities are asked to write essays on “ the elephant . ”
The Frenchman , for instance , writes on L’Éléphant et L’Amour .
In an updated version of the joke , the American would , of course , write on “ The Elephant and the Global War on Terror . "
The media picked up this obsession .
On some days you can still see this reflected clearly in news accounts  as in this typical first paragraph from a news piece in the Jan.
2 Wall Street Journal on the aftermath of fraudulent presidential elections in Kenya .
“ Kenya ’s marred presidential vote and the violence that has spiraled from it are threatening an island of stability in the otherwise volatile horn of Africa and endangering U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region . ”
Or , to return for a moment to Charlie Gibson ’s loose - nuke terrorism scenario in that Democratic debate :
It was a given that neither Gibson nor any of the Democratic presidential hopefuls on stage would mention the single country for which such a scenario might have an element of realism 
Pakistan ’s neighbor , India .
But that ’s just par for the course , since other countries , other peoples , except as they relate to the American War on Terror , have neither purpose , nor reality .
Without the GWOT , without the ( narrowly defined ) issue of American “ insecurity , ” they all qualify as just “ the elephant . ”
And yet , as an obsession , as war policy as well as domestic policy , banking everything on the GWOT has proved about as foolish , as self - defeating , as  let ’s say it  mad , as anyone could possibly have imagined .
To put this Bush legacy and its significance in perspective , here ’s my own fantasy scenario for you to debate :
Imagine that , by some unknown process , the GWOT succeeds .
Instantly .
Al - Qaeda and other like - minded terrorist and wannabe terrorist groups are simply wiped off the face of the Earth .
They cease to exist .
Tomorrow .
No al - Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
No original al - Qaeda ( with its local admixtures ) in the Pakistani tribal areas or Afghanistan .
No al - Qaeda - style car bombers lurking in London .
No more hijacked vehicles heading for American buildings or U.S. Navy vessels .
No more trains blowing up in Madrid railway stations .
No more al - Qaeda - labeled suicide car bombs going off in Algiers , or Istanbul , or anywhere else .
The end .
Finis .
This would mean , of course , that the American obsession of these last years , the Global War on Terror , would be ended , too .
There would then be no reason for the world to be with us or against us ; no need for a Department of Homeland Security , or draconian laws , or major surveillance programs , and so on .
Now , we still have a few minutes left in this segment of our “ debate , ” so let ’s just keep imagining .
Take a glance around the world  theoretically made “ secure ” and “ safe ” for Americans  and ask yourself this :
If the Global War on Terror were over , what would be left ?
What would we be rid of ?
What would be changed ?
Would oil be , say , $ 60 a barrel , or even $ 20 a barrel ?
Would Russia return to being an impoverished nearly Third World country , as it was before 2001 , rather than a rising energy superpower ?
Would the Iraq War be over ?
Would the Arctic Sea re-ice ?
Would Afghans welcome our occupation with open arms and accept our permanent bases and jails on their territory ?
Would all those dollars in Chinese and Middle Eastern hands return to the U.S. Treasury ?
Would Latin America once again be the “ backyard ” of the United States ?
Would we suddenly be hailed around the world for our “ victory ” and feared once again as the “ sole superpower , ” the planetary “ hyperpower ” ?
Would we no longer be in , or near , recession ?
Would hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs begin flowing back into the country ?
Would the housing market bounce back ?
Would unemployment drop ?
The answer to all of the above , of course , is resoundingly and repeatedly “ no . ”
Essential power relations in the world turn out to have next to nothing to do with the war on terror ( which may someday be seen as the last great ideological gasp of American globalism ) .
In this sense , terrorism , no matter how frightening , is an ephemeral phenomenon .
The fact is , non-state groups wielding terror as their weapon of choice can cause terrible pain , harm , and localized mayhem , but they simply do n’t take down societies like ours .
The IRA did not take down England despite years of devastating terror bombings in central London ; nor did al - Qaeda take down Spain , even with a devastating bombing of trains entering a Madrid railway station .
And neither the British , nor the Spanish acted as though that might happen .
The Global War on Terror ’s greatest achievement  for American rulers and ruled alike  may simply have been to block out the world as it was , to block out , that is , reality .
When it came to al - Qaeda ’s ability to cause death in the United States , any American faced more danger simply getting into a car and hitting an American highway , taking up smoking , or possibly even ( these days ) going to an American suburban high school .
A Nation of Cowards ?
Most of the things that needed to be done to make us safer after 9/11 undoubtedly could have been done without much fuss , without a new , more bureaucratic , less efficient Department of Homeland Security , without a new , larger U.S. intelligence community , without pumping ever more money into the Pentagon , and certainly without invading and occupying Iraq .
Most societies which have dealt with terror  often far worse campaigns than what we have experienced , despite the look of 9/11  have faced the dangers involved without becoming obsessional over their safety and security , without locking down their countries , and then attempting to do the same with the planet , as the Bush administration did .
In the process , we may have turned ourselves into the functional equivalent of a nation of cowards , ready to sacrifice so much of value on the altar of the God of “ security . ”
Think of it : 19 fanatics with hijacked planes , backed and funded by a relatively small movement based in one of the most impoverished places on the planet , did all this ; or , put more accurately , faced with the look of the apocalypse and the dominating urges of the Bush administration , we did what al - Qaeda ’s crew never could have done .
Blinding ourselves via the president ’s GWOT , we released American hubris and fear upon the world , in the process making almost every situation we touched progressively worse for this country .
The fact is that those who run empires can sometimes turn the right levers in societies far away .
Historically , they have sometimes been quite capable of seeing the world and actual power relations as they are , clearly enough to conquer , occupy , and pacify other countries .
Sometimes , they were quite capable of dividing and ruling local peoples for long periods , or hiring native troops to do their dirty work .
But here ’s the dirty miracle of the Bush administration : Thinking GWOT all the way , its every move seemed to do more damage than the last  not just to the world , but to the fabric of the country they were officially protecting .
Among their many GWOT - ish achievements , top administration officials demarcated an area extending from the western border of China through the territories of the former Central Asian SSRs of the Soviet Union and deep into the Middle East , down through the Horn of Africa and across North Africa ( all of this more or less coinciding with the oil heartlands of the planet ) , and dubbed it “ the arc of instability . ”
Then , from Somalia to Pakistan , they managed to set it aflame , transforming their own empty turn of phrase into a reality on the ground , even as the price of crude oil soared .
Opinion polls indicate that , in this electoral season , terrorism is no longer at , or even near , the top of the American agenda of worries .
Right now , it tends to fall far down lists of “ the most important issue to face this country ” ( though significantly higher among Republicans than Democrats or independents ) .
Nonetheless , do n’t for a second think that the subject is n’t lodged deep in national consciousness .
When asked recently by the pollsters of CNN / Opinion Research Corporation : “ How worried are you that you or someone in your family will become a victim of terrorism , ” a striking 39 percent of Americans were either “ very worried ” or “ somewhat worried ” ; another 33 percent registered as “ not too worried . ”
These figures might seem reasonable in New York City , but nationally ?
As the Democratic debate Saturday indicated , the politics of security and fear have been deeply implanted in our midst , as well as in media and political consciousness .
Even candidates who proclaim themselves against “ the politics of fear ” ( and many do n’t ) are repeatedly forced to take care of fear ’s rhetorical business .
Imagining how a new president and a new administration might begin to make their way out of this mindset , out of a preoccupation guaranteed to solve no problems and exacerbate many , is almost as hard as imagining a world without al - Qaeda .
After all , this particular obsession has been built into our institutions , from Guantanamo to the Department of Homeland Security .
It ’s had the time to sink its roots into fertile soil ; it now has its own industries , lobbying groups , profit centers .
Unbuilding it will be a formidable task indeed .
Here , then  a year early  is a Bush legacy that no new president is likely to reverse soon .
Ask yourself honestly : Can you imagine a future America without a Department of Homeland Security ?
Can you imagine a new administration ending the global lockdown that has become synonymous with Americanism ?
The Bush administration will go , but the job it ’s done on us wo n’t .
That is the sad truth of our presidential campaign moment .

60 Minutes : California 's medical marijuana system in ' chaos ' Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday December 31 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This California 's Proposition 215 legalized medical marijuana in that state 11 years ago as a treatment for pain , the side - effects of chemotherapy , and other ailments .
However , the federal government still views all marijuana use as illegal , and the Supreme Court has upheld the federal Drug Enforcement Agency 's right to go after dispensaries , no matter what state laws allow .
In September , the DEA raided the California Healthcare Collective in Modesto and arrested the store 's chief financial officer , Luke Scarmazzo .
" They handcuffed me and put me on my kitchen table , " Scarmazzo told 60 Minutes .
" One of them ... said ' you knew I 'd be coming soon . ' "
Scarmazzo acknowledged that he had been earning $ 13,000 a month for running the dispensary but insisted " I was working a lot of hours . "
Scarmazzo's lawyer described his client 's situation as a case of " selective prosecution , " because the 26 - year - old Scarmazzo is also a hiphop artist , with a widely distributed Internet video in which he appears as a high - living drug dealer , chanting " Fuck the feds . "
Complicating the legal situation , California 's pot shops have admittedly become an easy source of supply for people who just want to get high .
According to 60 Minutes , the California law was originally intended to provide access only to the most needy , but in an attempt not to exclude any category of illness , it wound up with language so broad that it covers ever the vaguest complaint of pain .
Now anyone with a note from their doctor can buy medical marijuana , and some doctors even advertise for patients in alternative papers .
One longtime supporter of medical marijuana , Methodist minister Scott Imler , says , " It 's just ridiculous ... The purpose of Proposition 215 was not to create a new industry . "
Although the centers are supposedly collectives which buy marijuana grown by members and redistribute it , it is clear that large amounts of marijuana are also entering the system from the black market , putting money into the pockets of organized crime and terrorists .
Marijuana activist Don Duncan told 60 Minutes that " there 's bound to be abuse in the system " and what is needed is better regulation .
However , Scott Imler argues that effective regulation is not possible as long as the federal government refused to accept the legality of medical marijuana .
Until then , " We 're going to have what we have now , which is chaos . "
The following video is from CBS 's 60 Minutes , broadcast on December 30 , 2007
How did Alcides Moreno , a New York City window washer , manage to fall 47 stories – and live ?
His brother , Edgar , was up on the same shaky scaffold , and did n't make it .
And fifty percent of people who fall a mere " four to five stories die .
By the time you reach 10 or 11 stories , just about everyone dies , " Dr. Sheldon
Teperman tells the* New York Post * .
So he did Moreno survive ?
The Post has a theory : he was able to cling " to a 1,250 - pound scaffold that acted like a surfboard in the sky . "
Those grappling with why he miraculously survived his plunge from the roof of a 47 - story high - rise say the aluminum platform added air resistance that slowed his descent - and blunted the tremendous force of hitting the concrete pavement in an alley below . *
Maybe , experts said , a random air current rising between the Upper East
Side buildings where Moreno plummeted slowed him the extra bit that spared his life ...*
* In a free fall , both men would quickly have hit a maximum speed of
124 mph , or terminal velocity - the point when gravity pulling a person down is balanced by upward air friction , said James Kakaklios , a physics professor at the University of Minnesota . *
But the scaffold 's platform likely slowed Alcides ' descent " significantly " by pushing the air , he said . *
His landing position also could have made a huge difference . *
" If he was lying flat , not only would the scaffold act as a shock absorber , but the force to stop him would be spread more evenly over his body .
If he came down on one point , the sudden shock could easily break the back or neck , " Kakaklios said . *
Over the weekend , Moreno opened his eyes and started moving his arms and legs , his cousin said .
村上ファンドの村上被告に対するインサイダー取引容疑の地裁判決を読むと、「実現可能性が全くない場合は除かれるが，あれば足り，その高低は問題とならないと解される。」とあります。
一方、どんな企業でも（特に成長している活気のある企業ほど）、常に新規事業のネタ等を考えているはずですから、上記の判決のその部分だけ切り出して単純かつ厳格に考えるとすると、上場している企業の役員クラスが、自社株（ストックオプションを行使した株式を含む）売買した場合、ほぼ確実にインサイダー取引規制違反になっちゃう、ということにもなりえます。
（村上判決は167条についてですが）、証券取引法166条は、ズルするつもりがあるかどうかに関わらず「売買」を禁止しているので、「儲かるネタの場合に売却するのは、ズルするつもりがないからセーフ」とはどこにも書いてない。
少なくとも 、
「 社長から、新製品についての検討の指示が出ていて、まだ内容もあまり固まっていないんですが、ストックオプションを行使して株式を売却しても構わないですよね？」
と聞かれて 、
「 よし、私が『問題ない』という意見書を書いてやるから、安心して売却しなさい。」
という度胸のある弁護士さんは、今や、ほとんどいらっしゃらないのではないかと思います。
日本経済も徐々に市場メカニズムの中に組み込まれてきたため、先日書いた「怠けている経営者の尻をたたくしくみ」としてアクティビストファンドを含む大口株主がexitを模索する局面もさることながら、役員や従業員のインセンティブとしてもエクイティのキャピタルゲインは非常に重要なものになっているのに、これがうまく機能しないとなったら大問題です。
インサイダー取引規制を回避したいだけなら、「やめて（1年以上して）から売却すりゃいいじゃん」と言えますが、優秀な役職員に残ってもらいたいから、ベスティング付のストックオプションを付与しているわけで。
「 いくらなんでも、 いいネタ しかないのに、ストックオプションを行使した株式などを 売却 した場合に、インサイダー取引規制違反に問われることは無いんじゃないの？（意見書書くのはヤだけど。）」と、おっしゃる方も多いのではないかと思いますが、昨今の状況を見ると、それはチと甘いのではないかと。
なぜなら、法律を作る国会議員も、内閣の閣僚も、中央官庁、検察、裁判所、マスコミの方々も、金融機関や大企業の役職員を含むその他ほとんどの国民も、こうしたキャピタルゲインの恩恵を享受できる立場には無いわけで。たとえば、上場したベンチャーの20代や30代の若造が株式を売却して何億円という収入を得たとしたら、そのこと自体、まったく共感できる話ではない（「ぽかーん」または「慄然とせざるを得ない」ことの）はずだし、ましてそれが条文上、（「非常に不確かだが可能性がゼロではない」「会社の機関で正式に決定はしていないが、167条の意味での機関決定と読めないこともない」「ズルするつもりはなくても条文上、意図は関係ない」といった、そもそも何のために罰する必要があるのかよく意味がわからないものであっても）、「黒と読めないこともないから有罪」、ということになれば、「ザマーミロ」と思う人はいても、「かわいそうに」と思う人は非常に少数派なはずです。
アメリカなどは、こうしたエクイティのインセンティブによって、企業が新たな分野を切り開いて何十兆円という新たな国富が生み出されており、日本でもせっかく、（中央官庁や大企業に勤めるだけがエラいのではなく）ベンチャー企業で新しい領域にチャレンジしてみようという若者も増えてきているのに、「日本では犯罪者になる覚悟がないと、生み出した価値に対応する報酬を得られない」としたら、それは市場主義経済へのシフトどころか、チャレンジャーにとっては一種の恐怖政治でしかないことになります。
マスコミを含めて、日本の99.999%以上の人は、日本のインサイダー取引規制の高度に形式的・技術的・専門的な内容をよくわからないはずなので、「○○社の社員、インサイダー取引規制で逮捕」と報道された段階で、「○○社ってのは悪い会社だねー」で思考停止してしまって、「日本にとって、どのようなインサイダー取引規制が適切なのか」「現状の規制は、日本経済にとってプラスなのかマイナスなのか」といった観点から考えることは、ほとんど無いでしょう。
証券のことに詳しそうなのは証券会社ですが、今回、村上ファンドの裁判について取材していた記者さんによると、「証券会社の人にも取材したんですが、『どんな判決が出ようが、インサイダー取引規制の線引きが明確になっていいんじゃないですか？』といった反応しか返ってこないんです・・・」とのことですし。
国会議員や閣僚が、証券市場の現場のことを詳しく理解していることは期待しにくいですし、検察や裁判所が、日本経済全体への影響を考えて誰かを逮捕したり判決を出したりする義務はない（し、そもそもそういう機能のものでもないはずな）ので、「日本に望ましいインサイダー取引規制のあり方」について考えてくれている人は、日本にはいないのかも知れないですね。
以下、なぜ、こういうことになってしまったのか、今後どうすればいいのか、について考察していきたいと思います。

“ You find surprising linkages that you never would have expected , ” said Richard Bookstaber , a former hedge fund manager and author of a new book , “ A Demon of Our Own Design : Markets , Hedge Funds and the Perils of Financial Innovation . ”
“ What matters is who owns what , who is under pressure to sell , and what else do they own , ” he said .
People with mortgage securities found they could not sell them , and so they sold other things .
“ If you ca n’t sell what you want to sell , ” he said , “ you sell what you can sell . ”
He recalled that the crisis that brought down the Long - Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998 started with Russia ’s default on some of its debt .
Long - Term Capital had not invested in Russia ’s bonds , but some of those who owned such bonds , and needed to raise cash , sold instruments that Long - Term Capital also owned , and on which it had borrowed a lot of money .
It appears that in this case , securities backed by subprime mortgages were owned by people who also owned securities backed by leveraged corporate loans .
With the market for mortgage paper drying up , and a need to raise cash , they sold the corporate securities and that market began to suffer .
The Wall Street investment banker who wanted a jumbo mortgage had a good credit score , and is not a subprime borrower .
But private mortgage securities are now hard to sell , leading to his problem .
In the end , he was able to get a mortgage with a lower interest rate , but it will adjust in five years , possibly to a much higher level .
The size of the rate increase he faced is unusual .
But all jumbo lenders have raised rates .
Bankrate.com reports that conventional 30 - year mortgages cost about 6.23 percent now , less than they did a few weeks ago , due to a decline in Treasury bond rates .
But the average jumbo rate is now 6.94 percent .
The spread between the two rates rose from less than a quarter of a percentage point to more than two - thirds of a point .
Jumbo mortgages are most important in areas with high home prices , most notably on the East and West coasts .
“ In California , it has shut down the purchase market , ” said Jeff Jaye , a mortgage broker in the Bay area .
“ It has shut down the refi market . ”
With that last dumb idea , we were getting close to something , as I ’ve noted every time I ’ve dropped or fumbled my cell phone and snapped a picture of a wall or the middle button of my shirt .
Impressive .
Ingenious .
Yet juvenile .
Arbitrary .
And why a substandard camera , anyway ?
Why not an excellent electric razor ?
Because ( I told myself at the cell - phone store in the winter of 2003 , as I handled a feature - laden upgrade that my new contract entitled me to purchase at a deep discount that also included a rebate ) there may come a moment on a plane or in a subway station or at a mall when I and the other able - bodied males will be forced to subdue a terrorist , and my color snapshot of his trussed - up body will make the front page of USA Today and appear at the left shoulder of all the superstars of cable news .
While I waited for my date with citizen - journalist destiny , I took a lot of self - portraits in my Toyota and forwarded them to a girlfriend in Colorado , who reciprocated from her Jeep .
Neither one of us almost died .
For months .
But then , one night on a snowy two - lane highway , while I was crossing Wyoming to see my girl ’s real face , my phone made its chirpy you - have - a - picture noise , and I glanced down in its direction while also , apparently , swerving off the pavement and sailing over a steep embankment toward a barbed - wire fence .
It was interesting to me — in retrospect , after having done some reading about the frenzied activity of the multitasking brain — how late in the process my prefrontal cortex , where our cognitive switchboards hide , changed its focus from the silly phone ( Where did it go ?
Did it slip between the seats ?
I wonder if this new photo is a nude shot or if it ’s another one from the topless series that seemed like such a breakthrough a month ago but now I ’m getting sick of ) to the important matter of a steel fence post sliding spear - like across my hood …
( But her arms are too short to shoot a nude self - portrait with a camera phone .
She ’d have to do it in a mirror …)
The laminated windshield glass must have been high quality ; the point of the post bounced off it , leaving only a star - shaped surface crack .
But I was still barreling toward sagebrush , and who knew what rocks and boulders lay in wait …
Then the phone trilled out its normal ringtone .
Five minutes later , I ’d driven out of the field and gunned it back up the embankment onto the highway and was proceeding south , heart slowing some , satellite radio tuned to a soft - rock channel called the Heart , which was playing lots of soothing Céline Dion .
“ I just had an accident trying to see your picture . ”
“ Will you get here in time to take me out to dinner ? ”
“ I almost died . ”
“ Well , you sound fine . ”
“ Fine ’s not a sound . ”
I never forgave her for that detachment .
I never forgave myself for buying a camera phone .
The abiding , distinctive feature of all crashes , whether in stock prices , housing values , or hit - TV - show ratings , is that they startle but do n’t surprise .
When the euphoria subsides , when the volatile graph lines of excitability flatten and then curve down , people realize , collectively and instantly ( and not infrequently with some relief ) , that they ’ve been expecting this correction .
The signs were everywhere , the warnings clear , the researchers in rough agreement , and the stories down at the bar and in the office ( our own stories included ) revealed the same anxieties .
DIGG THIS
" The first use of nuclear weapons must remain in the quiver of escalation as the ultimate instrument to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction . "
Five Western military leaders .
I read the statement three times trying to figure out the typo .
Then it hit me , the West has now out - Orwelled Orwell : The West must nuke other countries in order to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction !
In Westernspeak , the West nuking other countries does not qualify as the use of weapons of mass destruction .
The astounding statement comes from a paper prepared for a NATO summit in April by five top military leaders — an American , a German , a Dutchman , a Frenchman , and a Brit .
The paper , prepared by men regarded as distinguished leaders and not as escapees from insane asylums , argues that " the West ’s values and way of life are under threat , but the West is struggling to summon the will to defend them . "
The leaders find that the UN is in the way of the West ’s will , as is the European Union which is obstructing NATO and " NATO ’s credibility is at stake in Afghanistan . "
And that ’s a serious matter .
If NATO loses its credibility in Afghanistan , Western civilization will collapse just like the Soviet Union .
The West just does n’t realize how weak it is .
To strengthen itself , it needs to drop more and larger bombs .
The German military leader blames the Merkel government for contributing to the West ’s inability to defend its values by standing in the way of a revival of German militarism .
How can Germany be " a reliable partner " for America , he asks , if the German government insists on " special rules " limiting the combat use of its forces in Afghanistan ?
Ron Asmus , head of the German Marshall Fund and a former US State Department official , welcomed the paper as " a wake - up call . "
Asmus means a call to wake - up to the threats from the brutal world , not to the lunacy of Western leaders .
Who , what is threatening the West ’s values and way of life ?
Political fanaticism , religious fundamentalism , and the imminent spread of nuclear weapons , answer the five asylum escapees .
By political fanaticism , do they mean the neoconservatives who believe that the future of humanity depends on the US establishing its hegemony over the world ?
By religious fundamentalism , do they mean " rapture evangelicals " agitating for Armageddon or Christian and Israeli Zionists demanding a nuclear attack on Iran ?
By spread of nuclear weapons , do they mean Israel ’s undeclared and illegal possession of several hundred nuclear weapons ?
No .
The paranoid military leaders see all the fanaticism , religious and otherwise , and all the threats to humanity as residing outside Western civilization ( Israel is inside ) .
The " increasingly brutal world , " of which the leaders warn , is " over there . "
Only Muslims are fanatics .
All us white guys are rational and sane .
There is nothing brutal about the US / NATO bombing of Serbia , Iraq , and Afghanistan , or the Israeli bombing of Lebanon , or the Israeli ethnic cleansing of the West Bank , or the genocide Israel hopes to commit against Palestinians in Gaza .
All of this , as well as America ’s bombing of Somalia , America ’s torture dungeons , show trials of " detainees , " and overthrow of elected governments and installation of puppet rulers , is the West ’s necessary response to keep the brutal world at bay .
Brutal things happen in the " brutal world " and are entirely the fault of those in the brutal world .
None of this would happen if the inhabitants of the brutal world would just do as they are told .
How can the civilized world with its monopoly on morality allow people in the brutal world to behave independently ?
I mean , really !
God forbid , they might attack some innocent country .
The " brutal world " consists of those immoral fanatics who object to being marginalized by the West and who reply to mass bombings from the air and to the death and destruction inflicted on them through myriad ways by strapping on a suicide bomb .
Unable to impose its will on countries it has invaded with conventional arms , the West ’s military leaders are now prepared to force compliance with the moral world ’s will by threatening to nuke those who resist .
You see , since the West has the monopoly on morality , truth , and justice , those in the outside world are obviously evil , wicked and brutal .
Therefore , as President Bush tells us , it is a simple choice between good and evil , and there ’s no better candidate than evil for being nuked .
The sooner we can get rid of the brutal world , the sooner we will have " freedom and democracy " everywhere that ’s left .
Meanwhile , the United States , the great moral light unto the world , has just prevented the United Nations from censuring Israel , the world ’s other great moral light , for cutting off food supplies , medical supplies , and electric power to Gaza .
You see , Gaza is in the outside world and is a home of the bad guys .
Moreover , the wicked Palestinians there tricked the US when the US allowed them to hold a free election .
Instead of electing the US candidate , the wicked voters elected a government that would represent them .
The US and Israel overturned the Palestinian election in the West Bank , but those in Gaza clung to the government that they had elected .
Now they are going to suffer and die until they elect the government that the US and Israel wants .
I mean , how can we expect people in the brutal world to know what ’s best for them ?
The fact that the UN tried to stop Israel ’s just punishment of the Gazans shows how right the five leaders ’ report is about the UN being a threat to Western values and way of life .
The UN is really against us .
This puts the UN in the outside world and makes it a candidate for being nuked if not an outright terrorist organization .
As our president said , " you are with us or against us . "
The US and Israel need a puppet government in Palestine so that a ghettoized remnant of Palestine can be turned into a " two state solution . "
The two states will be Israel incorporating the stolen West Bank and a Palestinian ghetto without an economy , water , or contiguous borders .
This is necessary in order to protect Israel from the brutal outside world .
Inhabitants of the brutal world are confused about the " self - determination " advocated by Western leaders .
It does n’t mean that those outside Western civilization and Israel should decide for themselves .
" Self " means American .
The term , so familiar to us , means " American - determination . "
The US determines and others obey .
It is the brutal world that causes all the trouble by not obeying .

Sometime last week , Amazon soft launched Amazon SimpleDB , a hosted service for storing and querying structured data .
This release plugged a hole in their hosted Web services offerings which include the Amazon Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) .
Amazon ’s goal of becoming the “ Web OS ” upon which the next generation of Web startups builds upon came off as hollow when all they gave you was BLOB storage and hosted computation but not structured storage .
With SimpleDB , they ’re almost at the point where all the tools you need for building the next del.icio.us or Flickr can be provided by Amazon ’s Web Services .
The last bit they need to provide is actual Web hosting so that developers do n’t need to resort to absurd dynamic DNS hacks when interacting with their Amazon applications from the Web .
The Good : Comoditizing hosted services and getting people to think outside the relational database box
The data model of SimpleDB is remarkably similar to Google ’s BigTable in that instead of having multiple tables and relations between them , you get a single big giant table which is accessed via the tuple of {row key , column key} .
Although , both SimpleDB and BigTable allow applications to store multiple values for a particular tuple , they do so in different ways .
In BigTable , multiple values are additionally keyed by timestamp so I can access data such using tuples such as { ” http://www.example.com”, “ incoming_links ” , “ 12–12–2007 ” } .
In Amazon ’s SimpleDB
I ’d simply be able to store multiple values for a particular key pair so I could access { ” Dare Obasanjo ” , “ weblogs ” } and it would return ( “ http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog”, “ http://blogs.msdn.com/dareobasanjo”, “ http://carnage4life.spaces.live.com”).
Another similarity that both systems share , is that there is no requirement that all “ rows ” in a table share the same schema nor is there an explicit notion of declaring a schema .
In SimpleDB , tables are called domains , rows are called items and the columns are called attributes .
It is interesting to imagine how this system evolved .
From experience , it is clear that everyone who has had to build a massive relational database that database joins kill performance .
The longer you ’ve dealt with massive data sets , the more you begin to fall in love with denormalizing your data so you can scale .
Taking to its logical extreme , there ’s nothing more denormalized than a single table .
Even better , Amazon goes a step further by introducing multivalued columns which means that SimpleDB is n’t even in First Normal Form whereas we all learned in school that the minimum we should aspire to is Third Normal Form .
I think it is great to see more mainstream examples that challenge the traditional thinking of how to store , manage and manipulate large amounts of data .
I also think the pricing is very reasonable .
If I was a startup founder , I ’d strongly consider taking Amazon Web Services for a spin before going with a traditional LAMP or WISC approach .
The Bad : Eventual Consistency and Data Values are Weakly Typed
The documentation for the PutAttributes method has the following note
Because Amazon SimpleDB makes multiple copies of your data and uses an eventual consistency update model , an immediate GetAttributes or Query request ( read ) immediately after a DeleteAttributes or PutAttributes request ( write ) might not return the updated data .
This may or may not be a problem depending on your application .
It may be OK for a del.icio.us style application if it took a few minutes before your tag updates were applied to a bookmark but the same ca n’t be said for an application like Twitter .
What would be useful for developers would be if Amazon gave some more information around the delayed propagation such as average latency during peak and off - peak hours .
There is another interesting note in the documentation of the Query method which states
Lexicographical Comparison of Different Data Types Amazon SimpleDB treats all entities as UTF - 8 strings .
Keep this in mind when storing and querying different data types , such as numbers or dates .
Design clients to convert their data into an appropriate string format , so that query expression return expected results .
The following are suggested methods for converting different data types into strings for proper lexicographical order enforcement : Positive integers should be zero - padded to match the largest number of digits in your data set .
For example , if the largest number you are planning to use in a range is 1,000,000 , every number that you store in Amazon Simple DB should be zero - padded to at least 7 digits .
You would store 25 as 0000025 , 4597 as 0004597 , and so on .
Negative integers should be offset and turned into positive numbers and zero- padded .
For example , if the smallest negative integer in your data set is - 500 , your application should add at least 500 to every number that you store .
This ensures that every number is now positive and enables you to use the zero- padding technique .
To ensure proper lexicographical order , convert dates to the ISO 8601 format .
Note Amazon SimpleDB provides utility functions within our sample libraries that help you perform these conversions in your application .
This is ghetto beyond belief .
I should know ahead of time what the lowest number will be in my data set and add / subtract offsets from data values when inserting and retrieving them from SimpleDB ?
I need to know the largest number in my data set and zero pad to that length ?
Seriously , WTF ?
It ’s crazy just thinking about the kinds of bugs that could be introduced into applications because of this wacky semantics and the recommended hacks to get around them .
Even if this is the underlying behavior of SimpleDB , Amazon should have fixed this up in an APIs layer above SimpleDB then exposed that instead of providing ghetto helper functions in a handful of popular programming languages then crossing their fingers hoping that no one hits this problem .
The Ugly : Web Interfaces , that Claim to be RESTful but Aren’t
I ’ve talked about APIs that claim to be RESTful but are n’t in the past but Amazon ’s takes the cake when it comes to egregious behavior .
Again , from the documentation for the PutAttributes method we learn
Sample Request
The following example uses PutAttributes on Item123 which has attributes ( Color=Blue ) , ( Size=Med ) and ( Price=14.99 ) in MyDomain .
If Item123 already had the Price attribute , this operation would replace the values for that attribute .
https://sdb.amazonaws.com/
?Action=PutAttributes & Attribute.0.Name=Color&Attribute.0.Value=Blue &Attribute.1.Name=Size&Attribute.1.Value=Med & Attribute.2.Name=Price&Attribute.2.Value=14.99 &Attribute.2.Replace=true &AWSAccessKeyId=[valid access key id ] & DomainName=MyDomain & ItemName=Item123 & SignatureVersion=1 & Timestamp=2007-06-25T15%3A03%3A05-07%3A00 & Version=2007-11-07 & Signature=gabYTEXUgY%2Fdg817JBmj7HnuAA0%3D
Sample Response < PutAttributesResponse xmlns= " http://sdb.amazonaws.com/doc/2007-11-07 " >
< ResponseMetadata > < RequestId>490206ce-8292-456c-a00f-61b335eb202b</RequestId > < BoxUsage > 0.0000219907</BoxUsage > </ResponseMetadata > </PutAttributesResponse >
Wow .
A GET request with a parameter called Action which modifies data ?
What is this , 2005 ?
I thought we already went through the realization that GET requests that modify data are bad after the Google Web Accelerator scare of 2005 ?
Of course , I 'm not the only one that thinks this is ridonkulous .
See similar comments from Stefan Tilkov , Joe Gregorio , and Steve Loughran .
Methinks , someone at Amazon needs to go read some guidelines on building RESTful Web services .
Bonus points to Subbu Allamaraju for refactoring the SimpleDB API into a true RESTful Web service .
Speaking of ridonkulous APIs trends , it seems the SimpleDB Query method follows the lead of the Google Base GData API in stuffing a SQL - like query language into the query string parameters of HTTP GET requests .
I guess it is RESTful , but Damn is it ugly .
Now playing : J. Holiday - Suffocate

Fashion stylist
Marion Cotillard was among the red carpet fashion successes
In pictures
However , it is arguable that the red carpet arrivals - and more specifically what the stars are wearing - have eclipsed the gongs themselves .
At the 80th Academy Awards in Los Angeles the A - list arrivals opted for an array of show - stopping gowns for the most glamorous occasion in the film industry 's calendar .
The Oscars are one of the only events where full - length gowns are appropriate and expected .
This year the majority of stars opted for floor - grazing gowns , with only Julie Christie bucking the trend in a knee - length frock .
Her pink suede gloves , which clashed with her maroon taffeta dress , were one of the few off - notes in an otherwise exemplary red carpet showing .
The battle for biggest colour of the night was fought out by black and red .
Jennifer Garner , Hilary Swank and Penelope Cruz chose dresses in the former shade , while Dame Helen Mirren , Heidi Klum and Miley Cyrus opted to be scarlet women for the evening .
Deceptively simple
Garner 's jet - black Oscar de la Renta gown , which was put together by celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe , was a deceptively simple strapless number .
The tight bandaged bodice ended in layers of intricate ruched tiers , while her necklace , from Van Cleef and Arpels , included a jaw - dropping 61 carat of diamonds .
Anne Hathaway presented the award for best animated feature
Swank also opted for the serious shade in a one - shouldered Versace frock , dotted with rosettes and finished in a modest train .
As one of the catwalk 's biggest trends , feathers were bound to turn up on some stylish stars at the ceremony .
Having chosen a feather - heavy dress for last year 's awards , Cruz was obviously a fan of the tickly detail .
This year she chose a glamorous fishtail gown overloaded with tulle , ruching and feathers .
Pregnant Jessica Alba also picked a frock with a flurry of feathers from Marchesa .
Hollywood sparkle
The plum shade complemented her olive skin , while her plaited hair and gold hoop earrings from Cartier added a Grecian feel to her look .
Marchesa , a British label , is a new red carpet favourite and is designed by Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein 's wife , Georgina Chapman , and Keren Craig .
Anne Hathaway , who attended to present an award , also picked a show - stopping scarlet frock from the brand .
It was covered with intricate floral rosettes which climbed over her shoulder with Grecian - inspired draping .
Tilda Swinton took the gong for best supporting actress
Adding a touch of old - school Hollywood sparkle to the proceedings was Renee Zellweger , in a silver sequined sheath and vintage diamond Cartier brooches .
The strapless dress by Carolina Herrera , a red carpet favourite for the actress , was daringly split to the thigh revealing more than a sliver of Zellweger 's legs .
Best actress nominee Marion Cotillard also shone in a sequin - encrusted dress .
The French star always picks a Gallic label for her red carpet appearances and eschewed recent favourite Chanel for a Jean - Paul Gaultier gown .
The fishtail shape and white pearlised sequins , embroidered in a pattern reminiscent of fish - scales , made her look like a mermaid .
If you were looking for tips for dressing a baby bump , then this year 's Oscar 's provided a masterclass , with empire - line shapes proving to be most flattering .
Mum - to - be Cate Blanchett wore a navy satin gown from Belgian designer Dries Van Noten - a leftfield choice for red carpet dressing - while Nicole Kidman , also pregnant , diverted attention from her bump with a cascading diamond necklace .
Critics verdict
Amy Adams , nominated twice in the music categories , looked stunning in a forest - green double - faced satin gown by hip New York duo Proenza Schouler .
Their signature sculpted - bust detailing looked modern and fresh alongside the deep green shade .
Accessorised with a miniature gold bag from Fred Leighton , Adams admitted there was actually nothing in it .
Cate Blanchett showed how to grace the red carpet whilst pregnant
Cameron Diaz , who presented the best cinematographer award , wore a sugar - pink Christian Dior gown , but cleverly avoided slipping into saccharine territory with the addition of some edgy origami - style pleats .
Topped off with Bulgari jewels she looked cool and relaxed on the red carpet .
At the Oscars there is always a dress that divides the critics into " love it " or " hate it " camps .
This year 's best supporting actress , Tilda Swinton , seems to have taken that honour .
Her jet black dress was an on - trend one - sleeve style from Lanvin .
Daring and fashion - forward , it proved to be a refreshing change from the sea of safe strapless gowns that paraded down the theatre carpet , but drew harsh comments from critics for resembling a " garbage bag " .
Considering the awards were nearly a no - go owing to the writers ' strike , red carpet watchers across the world can breathe a sigh of relief .
After all , it would have been a shame for all of those dresses to remain in the wardrobes of the A - list , would it not ?
Following a Better Business Bureau investigation into Cingular's ( now AT&T's ) " fewest dropped calls " ad campaign and a protracted legal fight with Sprint over the issue , AT&T is reportedly dropping its claim , according to an employee .
Turns out , the assertion was never really true , and was based on only a small part of a larger Telephia report .
As a whole , the report notes that AT&T Wireless did not have the most reliable network in places like New York , Chicago , Houston and Los Angeles , according to Broadband Reports .
Recent studies from Consumer Reports and JD Power mirror these findings , and have placed Cingular / AT&T at or near the the bottom of their rankings for reliability and satisfaction .
Update 8/23 : An AT&T spokesman says that dropping the " fewest dropped calls " language is just part of an overall shift to a new message : " More bars in more places . "
Okay then !

Abed Rabbo's proposal was not supported by other Palestinians
Yasser Abed Rabbo is a top aide to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and a member of the team currently negotiating with Israeli officials .
He said the Palestinians deserved independence more than Kosovo .
His comments come a day after talks between Mr Abbas and Israeli PM Ehud Olmert closed without visible progress .
Kosovo is not better than us .
We deserve independence even before Kosovo , and we ask for the backing of the United States and the European Union for our independence
Yasser Abed Rabbo
The meeting is the latest in a series between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators and leaders , which was set in motion at a US - sponsored peace conference three months ago .
The aim , declared by US President George W Bush , is to achieve a peace deal by the end of 2008 .
Militant activity in Gaza and Israeli plans to build hundreds more homes for settlers in the West Bank appear to have hampered the process .
' Real independence '
" If things are not going in the direction of actually halting settlement activities , if things are not going in the direction of continuous and serious negotiations , then we should take the step and announce our independence unilaterally , " Mr Abed Rabbo told Reuters .
Abbas and Olmert met but there is no news of progress
" Kosovo is not better than us .
We deserve independence even before Kosovo , and we ask for the backing of the United States and the European Union for our independence , " he added .
But another negotiator and senior official , Saeb Erekat , disagreed arguing that the Palestine Liberation Organisation had already declared independence in 1988 .
" Now we need real independence , not a declaration .
We need real independence by ending the occupation .
We are not Kosovo .
We are under Israeli occupation and for independence we need to acquire independence , " Mr Erekat said .
On Sunday , Serbia 's breakaway province of Kosovo declared independence , in a move that has been welcomed by the US and some leading European states .
Settlement expansion
Also on Wednesday , a leading newspaper and peace campaigners in Israel reported that a Jewish settlement near the West Bank city of Ramallah was being expanded in contravention of commitments by the Israeli government .
The reports say 27 mobile homes are being built at the Eli settlement , and work is under way to connect them to utilities .
The Israeli government has not commented specifically on Eli , but said it was committed to its obligations under the road - map peace plan not to expand existing settlements .
Palestinian officials have repeatedly called on Israel to stop all settlement activity , which they say damages the prospect of reaching a peace deal .
In Jerusalem on Tuesday , Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas met , accompanied by top negotiators , for dinner before the two leaders held one - on - one discussions .
Little is known about what transpired , but Mr Erekat told the AFP agency that discussions " were deep , and tonight the prime minister and the Israeli delegation upheld their obligation to negotiate all final status issues " .
In the days ahead of the meeting , Israeli and Palestinians disagreed over whether the issue of the status of Jerusalem should be left to the end of the talks process .
Senior Israeli officials have been briefing the press that the subject of Jerusalem was not raised by either side .
Jerusalem is among the thorniest issues in peace talks .
Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their state , but Israel claims exclusive sovereignty over the whole city .
THE STARBUCKS MERMAID GETS HER NIPPLES BACK !
click to enlarge
Long ago , back before it's bid for global domination , Starbucks was run by a bunch of hippies , they still had a mermaid logo , but this one had nipples and a belly button .
Eventually in it 's evolution to the corporate monster that it is now , The Starbucks board decided to chop off the mermaid 's nipples so as not to offend the American Bible Belt , and ensure their bid for monotonous blanket coverage of the planet was unchallenged .
Going , Going , Gone ,
How the Mermaid lost her nipples and then her belly button as they turned her from hippy chic to corporate conformity .
However due to a cunning night time raid by a couple of mermaid fans in Whitechapel , East London , the mermaid has been restored to her enchanting best .
With a glint in her eye , the Whitechapel Starbucks Mermaid has finally got her nipples back , and with a burlesque twist !
If you get along quick you will be able to see her with her emerald nipple tassles glinting in the sunshine and enticing thirsty people to their ruin on the rocks of starbucks .
Tanya Andersen , a single mother and unlikely file - sharers ' champion for hoisting the RIAA with its own petard , has scored another victory .
A US District Court judge in Oregon affirmed an earlier decision to award Andersen attorneys ' fees for the two - and - a - half year legal pursuit by the Recording Industry Ass. of America , that ultimately ended in dismissal .
The latest poop on Andersen was spotted by hawk - like focus of Recording Industry vs The People .
The whole mess started when Andersen was sued by the RIAA in February 2005 .
The label cabal accused the disabled 44 - year - old mother of downloading and distributing gangster rap over the Kazaa music sharing network under the handle " gotenkito . "
( Titles such as the 2003 Ludacris tune , " Hoes in My Room , " in which the artist inquires who invited several undesirable women into his penthouse , and describes them in humorous detail . )
Andersen denied the allegations and countersued the RIAA later that year for fraud and racketeering .
Throughout the legal battle she accused the RIAA of using threats underhanded tactics to find evidence .
( The RIAA could n't find proof on her computer that she shared files ) .
Notably , she claimed RIAA agents tried to contact her then 10 - year - old daughter at school by impersonating the girl 's grandmother on the phone .
In June 2007 , the RIAA agreed to drop charges against Andersen , just hours before the court deadline to submit proof that she illegally downloaded the copyrighted material .
The case was then dismissed with prejudice , meaning Andersen could attempt to recover attorneys ' fees from the RIAA .
Andersen also dismissed her own countersuit without prejudice in order to pursue a separate malicious prosecution lawsuit against the RIAA .
The fees were awarded to Andersen by a federal magistrate judge last September .
The RIAA quickly appealed the decision .
But the magistrate 's ruling was affirmed yesterday by Judge James Redden .
As a result , the RIAA will have to pay some amount to Andersen , but the amount is not apparent .
Andersen is also still pursuing her lawsuit against the RIAA and is seeking class - action status for others to join her . ®

Like me ,
I ’m sure you ’re filled with questions for Al Qaeda deputy dog Ayman al - Zahwahiri (…)
Well , now here ’s your chance to ask ’em all .
The public , “ have been asked to send in their questions for the terror network ’s second in command , which he will then answer in an online interview next month , ” Australia ’s News.com informs us .
The bizarre stunt was announced in a new video posted on the internet (…)
The video , carried by Islamic websites , was issued as Britain handed over security to Iraqi forces in the last of four provinces it once patrolled , effectively marking the end of nearly five years of British control of southern Iraq .
The websites invited readers to send in questions during the next month for Zawahri to answer in an “ open interview ” .
How the interview would work was not immediately clear … .
It ’s like the jihadist equivalent of the YouTube debates !

LONDON ( Reuters ) - British soul singer Amy Winehouse , who this week appeared in video footage allegedly showing her smoking crack cocaine , has entered a rehab clinic , her record company said on Thursday .
Singer Amy Winehouse leaves Snaresbrook Crown Court in London , after attending a court hearing for her husband Blake Fielder - Civil January 18 , 2008 .
Winehouse , who this week appeared in video footage apparently showing her smoking crack cocaine , has entered a rehab clinic , her record company said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Luke MacGregor
The troubled 24 - year - old , who has been dogged by frequent suggestions of drug taking in recent months , also cancelled a scheduled performance at an awards ceremony in France this Saturday , record company Universal Music Group said .
“ Amy Winehouse ’s planned appearance at the NRJ Awards in France on Saturday has been cancelled as the artist has entered a rehabilitation clinic , ” the company said in a statement .
“ Amy decided to enter the facility today after talks with her record label , management , family and doctors .
“ She has come to understand that she requires specialist treatment to continue her ongoing recovery from drug addiction and prepare for her planned appearance at the Grammy Awards . ”
Winehouse is one of Britain ’s top - selling singers , winning critical and commercial success with her album “ Back to Black , ” which garnered six Grammy nominations in December .
The 2006 album has sold nearly 5 million copies worldwide , including 1.3 million in the United States .
The Grammy awards take place in the United States on February 10 , but Winehouse ’s involvement has been in doubt because of her arrest for possession of marijuana in Norway last year .
Winehouse , summoned to appear in a Norwegian court on February 29 , has denied having anything to do with the marijuana and said she unwittingly signed a document accepting a fine .
British police also plan to investigate the video of Winehouse allegedly smoking crack cocaine , which came to light in the Sun tabloid this week .
The footage was taken early on Friday morning .
Hours later , a disheveled - looking Winehouse appeared in court to support husband Blake Fielder - Civil , who is fighting charges related to a pub brawl .
Universal called her “ the most talented and important musical artist of her generation ” who had already “ made huge strides on her road to recovery . ”
One of her most famous songs is called “ Rehab , ” which opens with the lyrics : “ They tried to make me go to rehab , I said ‘ no , no , no ’ . ”
She attended rehab clinics at least twice in 2007 , according to British media , but checked out on both occasions before her treatment was completed .

Your trip to space is just around the corner now .
In the next step in its goal of sending regular folk to space , Virgin Galactic today unveiled the vehicle that ’s going to take them there : SpaceShipTwo .
The announcement was made today at a press conference at the American Museum of Natural History in New York .
Actually , there were two vehicles revealed today : SpaceShipTwo , which will carry passengers on a suborbital trip into space , and the WhiteKnight Two carrier .
The design , of course , is based on Scaled Composite ’s SpaceShipOne vehicle , which won the $ 10 million Ansari X - Prize in October 2004 .
According to Virgin Galactic , the WhiteKnightTwo mothership is almost complete , and should be ready for testing in summer , 2008 .
Once completed , it should be the world ’s largest all carbon composite aircraft , capable of lifting SpaceShipTwo to high altitude .
Unlike SpaceShipOne , which had room for the pilot and two passengers , SpaceShipTwo will have room for eight paying passengers .
Currently , the spacecraft is about 60 % complete .
Passengers will spent about 2.5 hours in the air , with about 5 minutes of actual weightlessness .
There are some more differences .
WhiteKnightTwo has an extra crew cabin ; a recreation of the one inside SpaceShipTwo .
This will give passengers a chance to experience a little taste of what the complete trip will be like .
As part of its flight plan , WhiteKnightTwo spend some time taking a parabolic flight path – like NASA ’s vomit comet – to give those passengers a little bit of weightlessness too .
The company says it ’s already booked 200 people , with another 85,000 registrations of interest to fly .
In fact , 80 of SpaceShipTwo ’s potential passengers have already been through medical assessment and centrifuge training at a special facility in Philadelphia .
Sir Richard Branson , Founder of Virgin Galactic , was , of course , bubbling and enthusiastic in the press release : “ The designs of both the mothership and the new spaceship are absolutely beautiful and surpass any expectations for the future of commercial spaceflight that we had when first registering the name Virgin Galactic in 1999 .
Burt and his team have done a fantastic job and I am also delighted with the wonderful vision that Foster and Partners , working with URS , have shown in the final designs for Spaceport America in New Mexico .
Finally , we are all very excited about the prospect of being able to develop a bio - fuel solution for the space launch system and we are looking forward to working with Pratt and Whitney and Virgin Fuels to trial an appropriate bio mix for the PW308A engines that will be powering our new carrier aircraft . ”
If all goes well , the first passengers will blast off on their suborbital journey in 2009 .
Here ’s a special treat .
You can access all the press images if you like , to see all the different photographs released today .

Charles Prince paid the price for shareholder concerns
Citigroup confirmed Charles Prince would receive $ 29.5 m in share awards , share options and pension entitlements .
He is entitled to an incentive bonus based on share performance , currently worth about $ 12 m , and he also owns $ 53 m worth of Citigroup shares himself .
Mr Prince is one of several high - level casualties of the global credit crunch .
Controversial compensation
Stan O'Neal parted company with Merrill Lynch last month after it disclosed huge financial liabilities stemming from deteriorating US mortgage - backed investments .
Mr O'Neal is expected to receive up to $ 161.5 m in share and retirement benefits .
Such levels of remuneration for departing bosses are highly controversial with shareholder activists and some politicians regarding them as unacceptable " rewards for failure " .
Bank bosses have been heavily criticised for getting drawn into high - risk investment strategies which have left some of Wall Street 's biggest names with billions of virtually worthless assets on their balance sheets .
In a stock market filing on Thursday , Citigroup said Mr Prince - who was paid $ 25 m last year - would continue to receive a salary until the end of the year .
In addition , he will be entitled to the use of an office and a driver for the next five years or until he finds alternative employment .
But Mr Prince 's financial package could be diluted by Citigroup 's falling share price , which has been hammered along with those of other leading banks in the past week .
Its shares have fallen in each of the past eight days , wiping $ 48bn off its market value .
" It looks like he lost $ 14 m in the last week , " said David Schmidt , a consultant with executive compensation firm James F Reda .

Alright , so Bill Richardson was confused .
He looked it in the gay rights ’ forum the other day when Melissa Etheridge asked him whether he thinks homosexuality is a choice .
He said yes ; she rephrased the question , and he said yes again .
Then , yesterday Richardson spent the day backtracking .
All of which has created quite a hubbub .
My question is , does the gay rights movement really want choice to be the nexus of the fight ?
Asking whether you think being gay is a choice is kind of like asking whether you think there ’s life in other galaxies .
Asking for an opinion on science is n’t so useful ; scientifically we just do n’t know for sure yet .
Whatever your answer is , it ’s your opinion , nothing more .
And if the answer to that question is indeed a proxy for belief in equal rights , as this hullabaloo suggests , then what happens if the science ends up showing there is choice involved in sexual preference ?
Whether being gay is a choice , to me , is n’t the crux of the issue .
Yes , it would make the fight for equal rights much cleaner ( and I believe it someday may ) , but I would rather see Etheridge ask Richardson whether he believes that people should be afforded differential treatment based on whom they love ?
Make that the platform , force humanity to the fore , and let science , if it turns out to show genetic predisposition , strengthen the argument .
Somehow the religious right has co-opted the gay - by - choice meme and owns this pro-choice movement .
How about the left sticks to its right - to - choose guns here ?
That choosing whom we love , same sex or opposite , is a “ lifestyle choice ” regardless .
I mean , where is the science proving we are born straight by default ?
The argument could be made that there are plenty of gay folks out there choosing to be straight , do they then have fewer rights in their straight relationships ?
Think about it , and fire back .
President Rakhmon does not want his people to waste money
Those found engaging in superstitious activities could be fined $ 200 ( £ 98 ) .
Belief in the occult is widespread in many former Soviet societies .
The Tajik authorities say those claiming occult powers are charlatans .
The bill still needs the upper house of parliament and the president to approve it , but this is considered a formality .
Those indulging in sorcery and fortune - telling shall be fined between 30 and 40 times the minimum monthly wage
Excerpt from draft law
Earlier this year President Emomali Rakhmon introduced heavy fines for extravagant weddings and funerals as part of an anti-poverty drive .
He set out strict limits on the numbers of guests , meals and cars permitted .
A draft text of the new law says : " Those indulging in sorcery and fortune - telling shall be fined between 30 and 40 times the minimum monthly wage . "

SCIENTOLOGY is claiming now that the Tom Cruise propaganda video that was leaked onto the Web last week was actually a good thing for the sect .
“ Having presented these selective and out - of - context excerpts with the intent of creating both controversy and ridicule resulted in people searching for Church of Scientology Web sites , ” a rep for the faith told Page Six .
Scientology turned up on the “ most searched for ” lists of various search engines .
But whoever leaked the video is still in trouble .
An insider told us , “ The clip on the Internet was nine minutes long – but the original was way longer .
It was edited to make Tom look really crazy . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
While presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee is surging in new polls of GOP candidates , a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday shows he would lose to all three leading Democratic candidates by double digits in hypothetical contests .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has doubled his support nationally among GOP voters , a poll says .
In head - to - head matchups -- the first to include Huckabee -- the former Arkansas governor loses to Sen.
Hillary Clinton of New York by 10 percentage points ( 54 percent to 44 percent ) , to Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois by 15 points ( 55 percent to 40 percent ) and to former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina by 25 points ( 60 percent to 35 percent ) .
The poll comes on the heels of a CNN / Opinion Research poll released Monday that showed Huckabee doubled his support nationally among likely Republican voters in the last month and is in a statistical dead heat with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani .

But Huckabee 's double - digit deficits with the leading Democrats likely suggest that the Arkansas Republican still lacks widespread name recognition nationally , according to Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
Watch as CNN's Bill Schneider analyzes changes in the races »
" Americans tend not to support candidates they 're not familiar with , and it 's possible Huckabee 's numbers are low in these hypothetical matchups because he is still not very well known nationally , " Holland said .
The poll also shows that Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona would do best against leading Democrats .
He beats Clinton by 2 percentage points ( 50 percent to 48 percent ) , ties Obama ( 48 percent to 48 percent ) and loses to Edwards by a smaller margin ( 8 points ) than the other Republican candidates do .
In addition to Huckabee , Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney lose to all three top Democrats in the survey .

On the Democratic side , Edwards performs best against each of the leading Republicans .
In addition to beating Huckabee by 25 percent and McCain by 8 percent , the North Carolina Democrat beats Romney by 22 percentage points ( 59 percent to 37 percent ) and Giuliani by 9 percentage points ( 53 percent to 44 percent ) .
While the survey shows McCain and Edwards performing best in their respective fields , both candidates continue to significantly trail their parties ' front - runners significantly .
In the national horse race numbers released Monday , McCain trails Giuliani by 11 percentage points , and Edwards is behind Clinton by 26 percentage points .
" Edwards is the only Democrat who beats all four Republicans , and McCain is the only Republican who beats any of the three Democrats , " Holland said .
" Some might argue this shows that they are the most electable candidates in their respective parties .
" But Edwards is in third place among Democrats , and McCain is in fourth place on the GOP side .
Maybe electability is not as important as it was in 2004 . "
The poll , conducted between Thursday and Sunday , surveyed 912 registered voters .
It carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .

What moved Lowe 's to pull its ads from the Bill O'Reilly hate - fest ?
Could it be that targeting Home Depot for its support of the FOX Nutwork 's coordinated campaign against science raised some eyebrows ?
Even as Home Depot is hoping to score P.R. points with its own program of environmental friendliness , it 's supporting the FOX Nutwork campaign to undermine its own work .
Now it seems that a number of callers to Home Depot who had signed the Sierra Club / MoveOn / Brave New Films petition were told , " where are you going to shop instead of us - Lowe's ?
They advertise on Fox too . "
Well , now there 's some daylight between 'em .
And by the way , what made Home Depot sensitive enough to pull its ads from BET , but not sensitive enough to pull them from FOX ?
Maybe you 'd like to ask .

Can a patient ever show up at the doctor ’s office with too much information ?
A doctor ’s essay about medical “ Googlers ” — patients who research their symptoms , illness and doctors on the Web before seeking treatment — suggests they can .
The report , which appeared in Time magazine , was written by Dr. Scott Haig , an assistant clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons .
He begins with a description of a patient he calls Susan , who seems to be clicking on a keyboard as she speaks to him on the phone .
“ I knew she was Googling me , ” he writes .
Dr. Haig ’s disdain for her information - seeking ways becomes quickly evident .
He describes the woman ’s child , whom she brings to the office , as “ a little monster ” and notes that the woman soon “ launched into me with a barrage of excruciatingly well - informed questions . ”
Every doctor knows patients like this , he writes , calling them “ brainsuckers . ”
Susan had chosen me because she had researched my education , read a paper I had written , determined my university affiliation and knew where I lived .
It was a little too much — as if she knew how stinky and snorey I was last Sunday morning .
Yes , she was simply researching important aspects of her own health care .
Yes , who your surgeon is certainly affects what your surgeon does .
But I was unnerved by how she brandished her information , too personal and just too rude on our first meeting .
The problem , Dr. Haig notes , is that patients can have too much information and often do n’t have the expertise to make sense of it .
“ There ’s so much information ( as well as misinformation ) in medicine — and , yes , a lot of it can be Googled — that one major responsibility of an expert is to know what to ignore , ” Dr. Haig writes .
Dr. Haig ’s essay , however , has riled patient advocates , who believe patients need to arm themselves with information and take charge of their own medical care .
Mary Shomon , who runs a popular thyroid disease blog on About.com , recently highlighted the essay on her site , generating angry responses from readers .
Ms. Shomon said she thinks many physicians like Dr. Haig are threatened by patients who use Google and other Internet resources to research their own health questions .
“ By condemning Googlers , he made it clear that he ’s threatened by empowered , educated and assertive patients who do their own research , ” said Ms. Shomon .
“ He ca n’t handle a patient who talks and does n’t just listen .
Good patients …are seen and not heard , right ? ”
Dr. Haig concludes his essay by confessing that he decided not to treat the woman , whom he described as “ the queen of all Googlers . ”
This was a chapter from the book Beautiful Code .
I am doing some random sampling of various chapters .
Some notes from this chapter on Treating Code As An Essay by Yukihiro Matsumoto , designer of Ruby programming language .
These are quotes from the chapter .
I formatted them a bit .
Lightweight Languages are not lightweight in the sense of ease of implementation , but they are called lightweight because of their intention to lighten the workload of the programmer .
Brevity is one element that helps make code beautiful .
As Paul Graham says , “ Succinctness is power . ”
In the vocabulary of programming , brevity is a virtue .
Brevity can also mean the elimination of redundancy .
Redundancy is defined as the duplication of information .
In order to eliminate redundancy , we follow the DRY principle : Do n’t Repeat Yourself .
The concept of DRY is the antithesis of copy - and - paste coding .
Simplicity is the next element of beautiful code .
We often feel beauty in simple code .
When simpler tools are used to solve a complex problem , complexity is merely shifted to the programmer .
Balance is the final element of beautiful code .
So far I have talked about brevity , conservatism , simplicity , and flexibility .
No element by itself will ensure a beautiful program .
This chapter is a great read , as are many others I am sampling right now .

Just found that there is a 3 - part series of videos .
Here is part - 1 .
One of the highlights at the recent SD West 2008 conference was the panel discussion on “ Beautiful Code ” that I had the honor of moderating .
Based on the book of the same name , the Beautiful Code the panel was made up of six of the 33 contributors to the book — Michael Feathers , Jim Kent , Christopher Seiwald , Elliotte Harold , Ron Mak , and Alberto Savoia .
As I previously said , my job was to make sure the panel had plenty of bottled water .
To give you a flavor of the panel discussion , here ’s a video excerpt of the event .
We ’ll have more clips in the near future .

An airplane cannot take off from a runway which is moving backwards ( like a treadmill ) at a speed equal to its normal ground speed during takeoff .
busted
First some small - scale tests were performed with a model airplane on a treadmill and the plane was able to take off .
For the large - scale test , the MythBusters used a 400 pound ultralight aircraft with a 2000 foot tarp under it .
The tarp was pulled backwards to simulate a moving runway .
The ultralight pilot had no trouble taking off .
This is because the thrust of the airplane engines acts on the air , not on the ground .
A cockroach can survive a nuclear blast .
busted The MythBusters irradiated cockroaches and several other bugs .
The cockroaches all eventually died , and they died sooner than some of the other bugs .
Nonetheless , cockroaches would survive longer than humans .
HAMMER update 23 - Feb -2008
From : Matthew Dillon < dillon@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx > Date : Sat , 23 Feb 2008 14:04:38 - 0800 ( PST )
HAMMER continues to progress well .
The blockmap is in good shape and I am moving on to the next item on the list .
All major functions work and appear to be stable .
Three items are needed for an ' alpha ' release : * garbage collection code .
This will be responsible for re-optimizing the filesystem by scanning the B - Tree and copying data out of partially free big - blocks , allowing those blocks to be freed .
* undo fifo ( ' instant ' recovery after a crash ) .
This will handle all normal crash recovery cases .
Because data is not overwritten the undo fifo only needs to record meta - data changes such as B - Tree operations , volume header updates , blockmap updates , and so forth .
Some minor buffer order will also be needed to flush the undo data before flushing the actual change , but its a lot easier then ordering requirements for the original design .
* hard - core recovery code .
This will scan the whole filesystem and guarantee that everything is in a sane state .
Even if it is never supposed to be needed you can't release a filesystem without a utility which does this .
I am not quite calling for testing yet , but please feel free to play around with it with the provisio that there is no crash recovery or garbage collection code in - place yet .
- Matt

Like Mormon ritual , much of Mormon theology remains relatively inaccessible to outsiders .
The text of the Book of Mormon has always been spread to a broad audience , but the text is not a sufficient guide to understanding the details of Mormon teaching .
Joseph Smith received extensive further revelation in the nature of sacred secrets to be shared with only a handful of close associates and initiates within the newly forming church .
The most famous such revelation was the doctrine of celestial  which was to say plural  marriage , revealed to Smith as early as 1833 but never publicized during his lifetime and formally announced to the world only in 1852 , eight years after his death .
And there were other doctrines of similar secrecy revealed to Smith , especially in the years just before his death .
“ God himself was once as we are now , and is an exalted man , and sits enthroned in yonder heavens !
That is the great secret , ” he is reported to have said in one of his last communications with his followers .
The connections between the sacred and the secret in early Mormonism did not come out of nowhere .
Believers , of course , consider the source to be divine inspiration  although over the course of the last century Mormon teaching has moved away from many of Smith ’s more radical ideas , which are often not accepted by contemporary LDS members .
Academic students of early Mormonism have traced the mysteries expounded by Smith to the hermetic tradition of secret magic dating back to the Renaissance and beyond .
If this account is accurate , then Mormonism ’s theological secrets actually have more than a little in common with religious mysteries that can be found in medieval Islamic esotericism , kabbalistic mysticism and ancient Christian Gnosticism .
Successive generations have rediscovered these secrets and reasserted their antiquity in ways very similar to Smith ’s discovery of ancient tablets .
For example , the most important work of the kabbalah , the Zohar , presents itself as a lost manuscript written by the 2nd - century mystic Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai , though scholars maintain that it was composed in the 13th century by the man who “ discovered ” it .
The greatest difference between the esoteric tradition and Smith ’s version of it is that Smith ’s faith has grown into an organized religion rather than remaining the preserve of a select few .
Almost from the start of his career , Smith was denounced as a charlatan , an impostor and worse .
Such criticisms sometimes pointed to his early pre-revelation career as a treasure seeker who used techniques like the seer stone ( similar in function to a crystal ball ) and the divining rod to seek treasure in the countryside of upstate New York .
Notwithstanding these attacks , Mormonism grew steadily .
Growth brought publicity  and with it came not merely prejudice but outright persecution .
This external persecution created a second , externally driven source for secrecy : protection .
Not content with polemics , Mormonism ’s opponents turned to violence .
In 1838 , after skirmishes between armed Mormons and state militia left several people dead , Gov. Lilburn Boggs of Missouri issued a military order declaring that the Mormons had made open war on the state and that therefore they “ must be treated as enemies , and must be exterminated or driven from the state , if necessary , for the public good . ”
Later , at Nauvoo , Ill. , the Mormon community under Smith ’s leadership came under constant pressure from skeptical and sometimes violent neighbors .
In response , Smith sought and received a measure of home rule for Nauvoo , including the authority to establish his own municipal militia .
Though the militia grew until it was a substantial fighting force , Smith was nevertheless gunned down by a kind of quasi- organized lynch mob after having been arrested and jailed in nearby Carthage .
Unhindered by Smith ’s death , the Mormons , now under the leadership of Brigham Young , went out to Utah to establish their own kingdom .
In what felt like the relative safety of the intermountain West , Mormons began to practice plural marriage in the open  and ended up paying dearly for this lapse in secrecy .
In 1856 the Republican Party made the defeat of polygamy a key plank in its first national platform , characterizing it alongside slavery as one of the “ twin relics of barbarism . ”
The federal government soon criminalized the practice and then in effect outlawed membership in the Mormon Church until it would agree to give up polygamy .
The Mormons appealed this persecution to the Supreme Court , which turned them down flat , holding that religious belief was protected by the First Amendment but that religious conduct was not .
After the Civil War , federal prosecutors in the Utah territory and in neighboring areas convicted and jailed thousands of Mormons in the most coordinated campaign of religious repression in U.S. history .
The reaction of the Mormon Church to this new wave of persecution was , initially , to take refuge in secrecy once again .
In 1890 , the president of the church , Wilford Woodruff , issued a manifesto in which he gave his “ advice ” to members of the Mormon Church not to enter into any marital relationships that would violate the laws of the land .
Publicly this declaration had its desired effect of placating the federal government ; in 1896 , Utah was allowed to become a state .
But like Jewish rituals under the Spanish Inquisition , plural marriage continued , secretly in Utah and also among refugees ( like several of Mitt Romney ’s ancestors ) , who fled to Mexico or other places the law could not reach .
Yesterday , the World Bank reported that the US has lost its status as the largest donor to the Bank ’s main fund for poor countries , as Britain secured a record amount of aid with a pledge of increased funding .
Britain pledged $ 4.2 billion for the period from July 2008 through June 2011 , after negotiations that began in March in Paris and ended with two rounds of talks in Berlin .
What does it mean to the US ?
Firstly , losing its position as the top donor could weaken Washington ‘s influence over the World Bank , which is the largest provider of development assistance to poor countries , and over policies that determine the cash flow .
The US pledged a very substantial contribution but is now down to second place after Britain ,
A total of 45 donor countries , the highest number ever , promised a record total of $ 25.1 bn at the Berlin talks , with a further $ 16.5 bn coming from the bank and previous donor pledges .
The total of $ 41.6 bn represents an increase of $ 9.5 bn over the previous funding period and will support around 80 countries , with a focus on African countries .
Read
“ The donor community has demonstrated its full commitment to helping countries overcome poverty and achieve sustainable growth , especially in Africa , ” World Bank President Robert Zoellick said .
However , contributions by some other countries also appear inflated when calculated in the US currency — which is running currently on a weakening dollar — and the talks were also complicated by slowing economic growth in rich nations .
In the meantime , the bank ’s mission is widening , with governments demanding more help in developing sophisticated economies and markets .
The US , despite having an economy six times as big as Britain ’s , has been keen to hold on to its number one spot as the bank ’s largest donor but has also been struggling in recent times with stretched budgets caused by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Rivendell Bicycles
Today we are in the throes of a slow return to a world of more personal connection between companies and their customers .
Web 2.0 is allowing it , and for some people perhaps it is a new concept , but in fact it dates back to the beginning of commerce , to individual barter or the local market and the personal connection between those selling or buying the goods .
For a long time we have engineered and marketed and grown our way out of this type of connection , and it is still quite startling when you see it happen in a genuine way .
As the Cluetrain Manifesto preciently argued , " markets are conversations . "
Perhaps an " old fashioned " approach to business might be better suited to the future than a more contemporary one .
Case in point : Rivendell Bicycles .
Rivendell is not your typical bike company .
They make bicycles only out of steel rather than more new - fangled carbon fiber or titanium .
They advocate wool clothing rather than polypropylene .
They argue for an upright position on the bicycle for comfort and safety rather than the more fashionable racer crouch .
And they stay in touch with their customers in an unusually personal way through their catalog and newsletter , and come across with a distinctive , opinionated personality .
In a day and age over - run with corporate spin , cynicism and sound - alike PR departments , Rivendell speaks with authenticity .
Though undoubtedly a niche player - they make fewer bikes in a year than China Bicycle probably makes in 30 minutes - they have an unusually strong following in large part because of how strongly and consistently they communicate their personality and values .
Does it remind you of a certain computer company ?
Like Apple they place a premium on the experience of using their products , rather than the technical aspects , and through their various communications reinforce all the different ingredients that contribute to that experience .
They do n't see their bicycles as isolated jewels ( though they are exquisitely crafted ) , but as part of a larger system of clothing , bags , accessories and set - up that creates the desired riding experience .
Rivendell is a small company , founded by Grant Peterson , who used to design bikes for Bridgestone back in their hey - day of the 1980's .
He struck out on his own and has crafted a company that reflects his personality and view on the world .
His voice is carried through in every touchpoint with the company , from the website to their printed items .
( And he manages to pull it off without sounding big - headed - if anything he is self - deprecating in tone . )
Their latest catalog , # 19 , has an introduction to their firm , which gives a nice sense of who they are .
Here are some excerpts :
We 're an eleven - person , twelve - and - ahalf year old bike company specializing in really good , but untrendy bicycles and gear .
Our big ticket items are bicycle frames , and we make only lugged steel ones .
The only saddles we sell are leather .
We sell lots of wooly clothing , and go to great lengths to get all wool , no blends .
Our typical customers are between 40 and 65 , athletic , usually successful or good at something in their life , and they 're not searching for themselves or trying to fit in somewhere .
They 're smart , love to ride bikes , usually own modern bikes and gear , and come to us when they realize it's not working out and they think maybe another approach will work .
We like bike parts and things that make your bike more useful and comfortable and fun .
We do n't cater to racers , not even a little .
Our selection is small , but everything is good .
We prefer plain to fancy , simple to complicated , natural to synthetic , originals to copies , and things made by users to things made by workers who are emotionally unattached to the goods .
Our prices are fine .
I know a diligent recluse with a computer can knuckle down for a few hours on the internet and find a lower price on some of our more generic items , but our prices are fair and on the low side , given the quality .
[ There 's ] a difference between tech and craft .
Tech is buzzwords , hype , materials , features , high profit margins and widespread appeal .
Craft is less showy and suffers on the pop charts for it , but ultimately is more satisfying to own and use .
I feel lucky and nervous all the time .
We have too many balls in the air , and I 'm behind on my Thank You notes .
In our day - to - day business , the simple things are hard , but the complicated things are simpler than they seem .
I 'm at the point in my life where I 'm starting to see our big picture here from the outside , not the inside .
What 's our role , if any ?
Are we grinding through life until retirement , or is their purpose and value in what we do ?
There are many lessons here for much larger companies about how to communicate what you do , why and how you do it , and who you see as your customers .
Amy Winehouse Crack Binge Caught on VIDEO
continues to spiral downward .
She was caught on tape in a 19 minute video taken at her home in London at 5:00 a .m. last Friday .
She is seen snorting hit after hit of Ecstasy and Cocaine .
She admits to also taking 6 Valium pills to bring herself down .
The video shows the inside of her squalid home , where the troubled musician is surrounded by junkies .
A friend of the singer had this to say after viewing the video :
" Amy is locked in a nosedive toward oblivion - she is killing herself .
The video shows a woman completely out of control . "

We ’ve had recently an abandoned railway in Abkhazia , abandoned as a result of USSR collapse when new “ independent ” republics could n’t maintain the complicated and high - cost USSR legacy objects .
But this one was abandoned long before the USSR collapse , it was doomed to be abandoned from the beginning .
It was built by a personal Stalin ’s order in the middle of nowhere – deep inside Northern Siberia between Salekhard city and Igarka town .
It was not connected with any other Russian Federal Railway System and the purpose of it still is not very clear , so as a senseless toy it way abandoned pretty soon and now rusts accessible only with a helicopter .

Professor William Beeman at the University of Minnesota passed along a note today from " a colleague with a U.S. security clearance " about the mysterious Syrian site targeted in a Sept. 6 Israeli airstrike .
The note raises more questions about the evidence shown last week by U.S. intelligence officials to lawmakers in the House and Senate .
The author of the note pinpoints irregularities about the photographs .
Beeman ’s source alleges that the CIA " enhanced " some of the images .
For example he cites this image :
The lower part of the building , the annex , and the windows pointing south appear much sharper than the rest of the photo , suggesting that they were digitally improved .
The author points to more questions about the photographs of the Syrian site .
1. Satellite photos of the alleged reactor building show no air defenses or anti-aircraft batteries such as the ones found around the Natanz nuclear site in central Iran .
2 . The satellite images do not show any military checkpoints on roads near the building .
3 . Where are the power lines ?
The photos show neither electricity lines or substations .
4 . Here is a link to a photo of the North Korean facility that the Syrian site was based on .
Look at all the buildings surrounding it .
The Syrian site was just one building .
Now compare this photograph of the site :
To this one :
The site looks like a rectangle in the first shot , but more like a square in the second shot .
Huh ?
Thanks to Beeman , a professor of anthropology and Middle East studies as well as a member of the blogosphere , for allowing us to share his colleague ’s comments .

Ryan Seacrest is Looking for Romance and I am Here to Help !
Couldbe ready for romance in 2008 ?
In a recent interview , Seacrest says his goal for the upcoming year is to find more balance in his life , adding " I really have n't been out with anybody ... This week I 'll literally work seven days , and I 'll get home at 10 pm . "
In addition to gearing up for season seven of American Idol , which premiers on January 15 , Seacrest will be in New York 's Times Square co-hosting New Years Rockin ' Eve with Dick Clark .
When asked how he will make time for romance , the hardest working man in showbiz said " I do n't know , " adding " I have n't figured it out yet . "
I would like to offer my assistance in helping you put those gay rumors to rest Ryan .
Call me !
Special note :
If you 've arrived here by accident and you like what you 're about to read you can receive more information via this link and register at my start a photography business website .
Making Business Choices in the Photography Arena Regardless of whether you are a photographer who is just getting your business started , or are a professional photographers looking to diversify your work , this article is for you .
I 'd like to talk here about central gambits in the photography business , and the pros and cons of taking them .
Just so you know , I too was once a new photographer starting a freelance business , so you should find this advice an eye - opener .
Wedding Photography ?
There 's a huge market out there for wedding photography , and it should come as no surprise .
It 's big money , but very demanding ; people do n't expect to have more than one or two weddings in a life time .
Unless they are American , in which case , they sell marriage licenses and divorce papers out of vending machines .
Oh , I 'm kidding !
Anyway , your work in capturing a wedding will be potentially viewed by hundreds of people over the years .
They might stay in photo albums and be passed down to children and grandchildren .
These are n't just photographs , but family heirlooms !
So obviously , the pressure is on to do them perfectly .
You will want to have contracts for wedding photography , expressing where and how your liabilities lie and for what money .
For instance , you will want a disclaimer in the contract that will clear you of responsibility for unforeseen mishaps with film and equipment , so you do n't get sued .
Outside of that , it is big money , but involving and not very exciting work .
You see one wedding photo , you 've seen them all .
How Do I Show Off My Work ?
That 's the trouble in the digital photography age , as well as all this other cheap technology we 're practically swimming in .
How to market your business ?
You can get lost in the noise very easily in marketing any visual media .
A fast way to both get some exposure and make some side cash is to break into stock photography .
Crank out some standard , generic shots of mundane subjects with your highest quality standard and distribute them through a stock house library .
The great part of this is that it takes the work out of finding customers ; instead the customers find you .
Websites online can host your work in a gallery and sell it for you .
Are there downsides ?
Of course .
They do n't pay very much ; you only get a commission off of each sale .
They have rigorous requirements to qualify , and they often want you to sign a contract for an extended length of time .
You 'll also be selling your work side by side with your competitor 's work , but let 's be realistic : it 's the 21st century , you 're doing that anyway with the whole world .
What Level of Service are You Offering ?
Let 's be perfectly blunt for a moment :
The next generation of photographers are going to have it tough .
Technology has moved forward , and it is n't going to do any good to keep selling buggy whips for horse - drawn carriages while everybody is buying cars .
What am I talking about ?
I 'm talking about how advancements in technology have made some of the " old- school " business ways obsolete .
With digital cameras becoming a household commodity , everybody can get into photography with almost no experience .
With the Internet , anybody can buy a picture from anybody else anywhere in the world - including from some third - world - country guy who will do for pennies what you can only afford to do for dollars .
And computer software to manipulate images is becoming so sophisticated , you almost do n't need photographs in some cases !
What can you do to stay competitive ?
You can offer more services .
You can learn digital graphics techniques to edit your photos into graphics artwork .
You can learn 3D graphics and incorporate your photography into your digital images .
You can set up a studio and offer printing and framing for portraits .
You can offer to print up invitations and business cards , combining your photography with other services .
Do n't be a buggy - whip shop .
Find the emerging trend in your industry and jump into it as soon as possible , because everybody else willand if you do n't , you 'll be left behind .
About That Software Yes , Photoshop is the current industry standard , but for how long ?
Have you heard of free and open source software ?
Well , it 's the new car , Photoshop is becoming the buggy whip , and it 's time to adapt .
Photoshop costs hundreds of dollars and maintaining a full digital graphics software suite can run you thousands of dollars , or you can get the free software for free .
Now , I hear you saying , " But you get what you pay for ! "
You 're welcome to go on believing that , but there 's your third - world - country competition who is doing work in an open source program that will make your head spin .
Adobe is a dinosaur sinking into the tar pit .
Go online and search for graphics made with Gimp , Cinepaint , Xara Xtreme , Inkscape , Blender , and POVRay .
Were you amazed at some of what you found ?
Does it look as good as some movies you 've seen ?
Well , if people can do that with free and open source software , then they can afford to sit at home and produce this amazing stuff and sell it for pennies and still make money .
All I hear lately is imaging artists complaining because they have to learn something new .
I 'm sorry , but that 's tough !
If you do n't want the job , there 's other people who do .
This is just a tip for the wise .
Photoshop is n't dead yet , but things are moving so fast it 's days could be numbered .
You have some Googling to do :-)
When you 've done that , you would be smart to check the link below if you have yet to download my eBook .
That way you 'll have covered more ground more quickly .
You know what I mean ....
Anyway , the free stuff is what some people are most interested in much to my surprise .....
The free bonuses that come with my ' income from photography '
eBook are described here ... all the best , Ray Baker

Most of us never had dreams of being a mathematician or economist ; we suffered through algebra as a means to get to senior prom .
But if you think you ’re going to march up the ranks of management with no math , forget it .
So first , the bad news :
You absolutely have to manage the math side of business if you are going to get ahead in your career .
The good news is that you do n’t need to be good at math in school to be good at math at work .
In fact , so much of workplace math is practical that people who are excellent mathematicians are at a disadvantage .
Math at work is about spinning the numbers .
And mathematicians are focused on finding pure truth .
There is no pure truth in workplace numbers .
Job Hunting
Take , for example , your resume .
The line that says , “ Increased sales 50 % . ” That could be true .
It could also be true that everyone else increased sales 65 % , or that the next quarter you got fired for under performing , or that customer returns on those sales were an incredible 45 % .
Numbers at work tell a story , and you pick numbers that tell the best story .
You never lie , but you cannot tell every piece of information in the whole world , so tell the ones that suit you best .
The best resume is one that lists quantified achievement .
So you should evaluate all projects in terms of possible numbers .
If there is no way to show project victory in a number , do not take the project .
And do not think for one second that you are in a career that does not require quantified success .
Even a ballerina can use numbers : “ Increased ticket sales 35 % when I took over the lead in the Nutcracker , ” sounds much more persuasive than “ danced beautifully . ”
Image Management
Once you land the job , the easiest way to let others quantify your failure is to go over budget ; never , never , never go over budget .
Always pad each line of your budget , because you ca n’t control everything and some costs will be higher than anticipated .
This budget bloating will force you to cut line items from the start , but better to cut them at the beginning than be over budget at the end .
Before you go blaming your cost overruns on someone else , remember that your boss ’s boss never sees your budget line by line and definitely does n’t care about your finger pointing .
She only sees your final number and whether or not you stayed within budget .
The best way to manage your image among the higher - ups is to stay in budget no matter what .
Getting a Raise
Use numbers to negotiate your raise , too .
When it comes to compensation , do your own research to present a rational , numbers - based explanation for why your salary is not in line with comparable salaries in your field .
If your company wo n’t budge , figure out which non-financial perks will equal a financial perk .
( Finally !
A use for high school algebra ! )
For example , extra vacation time is free to the company and a laptop , after tax deductions , is very cheap for the company .

Presentations and Reports
This is my favorite book about numbers : How to Lie with Statistics , by Darrell Huff and Irving Geis .
This book is a must for everyone .
Each of us must use numbers to make our point .
So we should all learn to present the numbers in the best light possible .
Managing numbers is not about lying ( this book title aside ) , managing numbers is about being smart about what you show people .
Innovative Thinking
Another must for everyone is Excel .
It ’s quick to learn the basics , and Excel provides endless fun for turning recurring fights with your significant other into statistically revealing graphs .
I hate to plug Microsoft , but really , learning to use Excel teaches everyone — even English majors – to think about numbers in new ways .
And new ways of thinking always opens up new avenues of achievement .
You do n’t have to be a math star to present numbers well .
But you do need to give time and thought to numbers on a daily basis so you can leverage statistics to bolster your career .
Sometimes you need to make friends and influence people .
Other times , you should just test drive them and push their buttons .
The art of irritation can , in fact , be just as valuable as the art of persuasion .
How so ?
Let ’s start with the problem : people are good liars and actors … up to a point .
What if it were possible to fast - forward relationships , whether with new friends , business partners , or romances ?
To get past the honeymoon facade of niceties and see their true tendencies underneath all it all ?
I ’ve been experimenting with methods of “ removing the mask ” so - to - speak , and it can be done .
Relationships cost a premium of attention and time , and I — like most–want people in my life whose real personalities and motives will uplift and strengthen me instead of drain and demoralize me .
Catching bad apples early begins with recognizing a truism :
Adversity does n’t primarily build character — it reveals it …
Therefore , by putting someone under pressure or in an adverse situation , you can pull back the covers and get a glimpse of what ’s in store a few weeks or months down the line .
The little things are the big things .
Josh Waitzkin , 8 - time national chess champion ( and the subject of the film , “ Searching for Bobby Fischer ” ) explores the surprisingly accurate cross-referencing of behavior in his book , The Art of Learning :
“ As I moved into my late teenage years , many of my tournaments were closed , invitational events where ten to fourteen very strong players gathered for two - week marathons .
These were psychological wars …
It was during these years that I began to draw the parallels between people ’s life tendencies and their chessic dispositions .
Great players are , by definition , very clever about what they show over the chessboard , but , in life ’s more mundane moments , even the most cunning chess psychologists can reveal certain essential nuances of character .
If , over dinner , a Grandmaster tastes something bitter and faintly wrinkles his noes , these might be an inkling of a tell lurking .
Impatience while standing on line at the buffet might betray a problem sitting with tension .
It ’s amazing how much you can learn about someone when they get caught in the rain !
Some will run with their hands over their heads , others will smile and take a deep breath while enjoying the wind .
What does this say about one ’s relationship to discomfort ?
The reaction to surprise ?
The need for control ? ”
Here are a few options for doing your own behavioral cross-referencing with a new potential friend , partner , or mate .
All of them happen naturally over time , and the concept is to pick / create circumstances here and there to get an advanced read .
Before you label me a bastard , read the whole post :
1 . Meet them for dinner or lunch at an appointed time , and indicate upon their arrival that you made a mistake and set the reservation for 30 minutes prior .
See how they respond to the change in plans .
( Testing : how they contend with mistakes on your part )
2. Same as 1 , but tell them that the reservation was accidentally made for 30 minutes after their arrival .
Alternatively , travel with them and purposefully orchestrate things so that you miss a bus or train .
Obviously , you then fix the problem and cover costs .
( Testing : how they deal with waiting and unexpected changes in plans )
3 . Take them to a restaurant with good food but bad service .
( Testing : how diplomatically they contend with and resolve incompetence , which is the default mode of the universe )
4 . Invite them to an event or function and then profusely apologize when you realize you ’ve forgotten your wallet .
Offer to repay them later or treat them the next time out .
( Testing : how they relate to money issues .
Wonderful people sometimes turn into irrational monsters as soon as even a few dollars are involved .
It drives me crazy to keep a running ledger of who owes whom for a few dollars here and there , especially in social settings .
Repaying the favor is mandatory , but dwelling on differences of pennies is tiring . )
5 . Take them somewhere extremely crowded where they ’ll be inadvertently bumped , preferably where they are exposed to people of different races and of lower socio-economic classes .
Large outdoor markets are good , as are subways during rush hour .
( Testing : biases against specific races and social classes , which are usually fast to emerge after there is any physical contact . )
6 . Explore the most controversial topics until you find something the two of you disagree on .
Ask them to explain why people have the opposing viewpoint .
I use this mostly for potential romantic partners and potential travelmates .
( Testing : how well they listen and both consider and summarize points - of - view or feelings opposite their own .
I always look for both friends and girlfriends who fight well .
Not in the physical sense , but in the intellectual and emotional sense .
If I travel with one of my best friends for even a week straight , there will be times when we butt heads and fight .
It ’s inescapable .
In those cases , are they civil and good at listening and finding compromises ?
Good at identifying common ground , picking their battles , and laughing off the unimportant ?
Or , do they lose control of their emotions and make hurtful personal attacks or generalizations ?
Do they use guilt or other negative emotions instead of taking time to discuss things logically ?
Hold grudges ? )
Needless to say , I ’m not recommending you cram all of these into a single meeting ( not unless you want a punch in the mouth ) , but the premise is simple : life is both too long and too short to suffer through toxic relationships .
The sooner we have an accurate read on someone , the better .
Rather than hoping for the best and getting trapped in relationships you are unwilling to end due to guilt and inertia , you can test drive using a few specific situations and get a taste of what ’s in store .
I realized how revealing the above scenarios were while traveling , as they came up organically with the inevitable mix-ups and occasional bouts of bad luck .
The question then became : can you go about glimpsing someone ’s true personality in a more reliable way ?
That said , there is no need to orchestrate bad service at a restaurant , for example , if you can achieve the same end doing something fun but uncontrolled .
A good long weekend of getting lost with someone will reveal most of the character you need to see .
Just ensure you expose them to adverse conditions or awkward situations .
Most people spend more time planning their weekends than their relationships .
Do n’t make that mistake .
You are the average of the 5 or so people you associate with most .
Choose wisely .

THE distribution of wealth lies at the heart of political economics .
Nations and empires have risen and fallen , and millions have died , as a result of humanity ’s struggle to decide how ( or whether ) to divide wealth .
But for all that , the level of wealth inequality has remained remarkably consistent over the last 2,000 years , according to a recent study by Branko Milanovic , a researcher with the World Bank , and two economics professors , Peter H. Lindert of the University of California , Davis , and Jeffrey G. Williamson of Harvard University ( economics.harvard.edu ) .
While “ human civilization has advanced by leaps and bounds over the past two millennia , income inequality has stayed relatively the same , ” Zubin Jelveh of Portfolio.com wrote about the study .
The “ inequality extraction ratio ” is basically the share of the wealth difference taken by “ elites . ”
Since the United States is the wealthiest nation in history , the potential for elites taking a bigger share of the wealth ( without allowing mass starvation ) is greater .
But they have not done so .
“ Thus , ” the researchers write , “ the social consequences of increased inequality may not entail as much relative impoverishment , or as much perceived injustice , as might appear . ”
Cisco confirmed it is possible to eavesdrop on remote conversations using Cisco VoIP phones .
In its security response , Cisco says : " an attacker with valid Extension Mobility authentication credentials could cause a Cisco Unified IP Phone configured to use the Extension Mobility feature to transmit or receive a Real - Time Transport Protocol ( RTP ) audio stream . "
Cisco adds that Extension Mobility authentication credentials are not tied to individual IP phones and that " any Extension Mobility account configured on an IP phone 's Cisco Unified Communications Manager / CallManager ( CUCM ) server can be used to perform an eavesdropping attack . "
The technique was described by Telindus researcher Joffrey Czarny at HACK.LU 2007 in Luxembourg in October .
Cisco has published some workarounds to this problem in its security response .
Also in October , two security experts at hacker conference ToorCon9 in San Diego hacked into their hotel 's corporate network using a Cisco VoIP phone .
The hackers , John Kindervag and Jason Ostrom said they were able to access the hotel 's financial and corporate network and recorded other phone calls , according to a blog on Wired.com .
The hackers used penetration tests propounded by a tool called VoIP Hopper , which mimics the Cisco data packets sent at three minute intervals and then trades a new Ethernet interface , getting the PC - which the hackers switched in place of the hotel phone - into the network running the VoIP , according to the blog post .
The Avaya configuration is superior to Cisco , according to the hackers , because you have to send requests beyond a sniffer .
Although it can be breached the same way , by replacing the phone with a PC .

Gore :
Do n't give equal time to someone who believes the earth is flat Muriel Kane
Published : Monday November 5 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Last week , climate scientist John Christy wrote an op -ed for the Wall Street Journal taking issue with Vice President Al Gore 's assertions about global warming .
Gore took the opportunity of a television appearance on Monday to address Christy 's claims .
NBC's Meredith Viera asked Gore , " You know , you share the prize with scientists from the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
And one of those scientists , John Christy , wrote an op - ed last Thursday in the Wall Street Journal in which he criticized your dire predictions about the impact of global warming .
He wrote , ' I see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see . ' "
Gore immediately responded , " Well , he 's an outlier .
He no longer belongs to the IPCC .
And he is way outside the scientific consensus . "
Gore then attacked the news media directly , saying that " part of the challenge the news media has had in covering this story is the old habit of taking the ' on the one hand , on the other hand ' approach .
There are still people who believe that the earth is flat .
But when you 're reporting on a story like the one you 're covering today , where you have people all around the world , you do n't search out for someone who still believes the earth is flat and give them equal time . "
Gore concluded that there is " as strong a consensus as you 'll ever see in science that the climate crisis is real " but that " there is still time to solve it . "
The following video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast on November 5 , 2007 .
I ’m telling you , man , those damn Norsemen are going to quietly climb to the top of the globo - political heap any day now and nobody ’s going to notice until it ’s too late .
One day soon , you ’re going to pop in for a McDonald ’s breakfast and find a G.D. whale , egg , and cheese McMuffin on the menu .
Damnit , Chris , whether or not you eat McDonald ’s is not the issue .
What I ’m saying is that we need to be on the lookout .
Think about it .
Everyone writes off this huge country because they ’re quiet and orderly and it ’s freakin’ cold there so no one wants to check it out .
Does that remind you of anything ?
That ’s right , their comrades and neighbors , the Ruskis .
It ’s only a matter of time before Norway goes nutso like the USSR .
It ’s scary stuff , man , let me tell you .
Norway is a hotbed of self - importance , - satisfaction , and - aggrandizement .
Although their domestic affairs are in tight order ( i.e. government - controlled automatons ) , Norwegians are international snobs .
They scoff at other cultures ’ literatures and consistently yield better hockey players per capita than any other free nation , plus they recently turned down an offer to join the EU ( ungrateful rabble rabble … ) , which first piqued my interest in the fjord - loving heathen .
And I have a feeling they ’d do the same if the U.S. ever extended a similar invitation , which would of course be an open call for us to invade .
But did you know that only a few short years ago , in 1814 , Norway reneged on a legal , contractual unification with Denmark ?
That ’s right – they ’re Indian givers , Chris .
That ’s the worst kind of givers , but I suppose you ca n’t expect much more from a race of people with Viking blood .
Plus they ’re rich .
Even though Norwegians use some ass - backwards currency called – get this – a ‘ Norwegian krone ’ , they apparently have a lot of it .
Like , lots .
So much , in fact , that they can afford to give everyone of their pale - assed citizens free healthcare , education , and housing , with enough left over for universal manicures and chocolate on each and every pillow at night .
Their financial might is going to impinge on American power soon enough , man .
They ’ve got what basically amounts to a monopoly on the world herring market , the power of which you would be very mistaken to underestimate .
Think back to that Eddie Murphy movie “ Trading Places ” – the old dudes made their money not in gold or myrrh or whatever , but in pork bellies and frozen orange juice concentrate .
Herring is the new frozen juice concentrate .
Now do n’t get me wrong , Chris – I see that look on your face and you ’re getting me wrong .
I ’m not saying we should nuke them , not yet .
I ’m no alarmist .
The point is , an exploratory force of 10,000 or so would n’t be a bad idea , just to check things out .
If nothing else , it ’ll give our people a jump start on acclimating to the perpetual winter and sunless days that are bound to come when America is governed with an iron fist by our Norse overlords .

Raising kids , though difficult , is incredibly rewarding .
Difficult how , you ask ?
Let us show you the ways .
1. Today must must have been Dad 's day to babysit .
2 . Let 's hope he does n't use the bathtub as a toilet .
Over the past month , I 've talked about how my view of food has changed .
I talked about the conversations I 've had about this project and they way some people opened up to me in a very unique way .
I 've talked about the excitement a nine - cent hot dog can bring and I 've talked a lot about rice .
Until today , I 've kept politics out of it , mostly because that 's not what this was ultimately about .
But the truth is , politics , or maybe just people in general , did play a role in it .
On October 11th , 2006 , I was reading the paper when an article caught my eye .
It was written by Lawrence Cosentino and appeared in the October 11th edition of the Lansing City Pulse .
The headline was , " Just Hold It Together . "
You can find it online if you feel like looking .
The story was about 42 representatives from local businesses , government agencies and non-profits that participated in an hour long workshop designed to simulate the lives of poor people .
They were all assigned roles such as " single mother with no job " , and then sat around a big table role - playing for an hour , trading fake money back and forth and worrying about how they would feed their kids on minimum wage .
The article was interspersed with quotes from the participants like , after this experience , " I will not be the same . "
This was , of course , a stupid exercise for anyone to go through .
In the end , the participants convinced themselves that this had given them some insight into what it 's like to be poor , if only for an hour .
But they had not been poor for an hour , they had done a math problem for an hour .
They sat around a big table in a nice building ( with full stomachs if I had to guess ) , and essentially ' ran the numbers ' on why it 's difficult to pay your rent or buy groceries with a minimum wage job .
It seems as though these leaders of our community should have been able to do math on their own .
I think that this article is where I first got the idea to eat for a dollar a day .
After reading it , I desperately wanted to find something tangible that a normal person could do to actually get some insight on what being poor is all about .
It 's one thing to say , " Being poor means you can't eat a lot of food , " but it 's a completely different experience to actually go through .
Of course , my month long experiment did n't come anywhere close to capturing the realities of being poor ; I always knew in the back of my head that I could get more food if I needed it , and more importantly , being poor involves a lot more than just not eating much .
But this was a start .
And it was an honest start .
It was n't just sitting around in a room for an hour .
There were other reasons to do this experiment as well .
One , I just wanted to know if it could be done .
Two , I wanted to do something unique for no other reason than it was unique .
Three , I wanted to do something that would shock my system just to see how I would react .
In one way or another , this achieved all of those .
It 's pretty difficult to sum up what I 've learned this month .
The best I could really do is to tell you to go back and read all of the posts .
The lessons learned are in how I came to think about food differently , how my body adapted around the challenge , and in the conversations I 've had this month .
For those who care , the total amount I spent on food this week was $ 27.28 .
That ’s about 93 cents a day , although I still have quite a bit of food left over .
I also lost about 18 pounds this month .
And oh yeah , some of you may remember that in one post I mentioned that I was doing something special with the money I saved .
Well here it is …
I 'll admit it 's not the most original idea , but it just seemed fitting .
A coalition of 17 organizations , including the National Academy of Sciences , the American Institute of Physics , and the National Science Teachers Association , is calling on the scientific community to become more involved in the promotion of science education , including evolution .
According to an article appearing in the January 2008 issue of The FASEB Journal , the introduction of " non-science , " such as creationism and intelligent design , into science education will undermine the fundamentals of science education .
Some of these fundamentals include using the scientific method , understanding how to reach scientific consensus , and distinguishing between scientific and nonscientific explanations of natural phenomena .
" In an age when people have benefited so greatly from science and reason , it is ironic that some still reject the tools that have afforded them the privilege to reject them , " says Gerald Weissmann , MD , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
The article is based on a national survey of 1,000 likely U.S. voters .
Survey respondents were queried on their attitudes toward science and scientists , their views on evolutionary science in the context of education , and their opinions regarding the means through which the scientific community can effectively bolster support for teaching evolution and related subjects .
The survey revealed that respondents favored teaching evolution over creationism or intelligent design .
The survey also revealed that respondents were more interested in hearing about evolution from scientists , science teachers , and clergy than Supreme Court Justices , celebrities , or school board members .
The survey also found that there is a relationship between people 's understanding of science and their support for teaching evolution .
Respondents were asked three questions : one related to plate tectonics , one related to the proper use of antibiotics , and one related to prehistory .
Those who accurately answered questions on these subjects were far more likely to support the teaching of evolution in schools .
" The bottom line is that the world is round , humans evolved from an extinct species , and Elvis is dead , " Weissmann added .
" This survey is a wake - up call for anyone who supports teaching information based on evidence rather than speculation or hope ; people want to hear the truth , and they want to hear it from scientists . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A wide - open presidential race and a willingness by candidates , interest groups , unions and corporations to buy TV time will lead to historic spending for political and issue - advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle , an analysis shows .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders .
The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $ 3 billion , according to TNS Media Intelligence / Campaign Media Analysis Group , CNN 's consultant on political television advertising .
This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue - advocacy television advertising rang in at $ 1.7 billion .
In 2006 , $ 2.3 billion was spent on political and issue - advocacy TV commercials .
Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money , said Evan Tracey , CMAG 's chief operating officer .
The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates , who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters .
See how spending breaks down for this year »
And interest groups have spent $ 6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures .
On the national level , the cost of issue - advocacy television ad spending was $ 270 million in the first nine months of this year .
Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform .
Television ads on health care alone total $ 60 million .
CMAG estimates more than $ 3 million of the $ 270 million spent to air issue - advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008 .
Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups " pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode . "
" What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries , and through the general election , is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates , " he said .
With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president , CMAG predicts that more than $ 800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House .
Up to now , the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina .
Voters in some of the 20 - plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending , having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $ 8.6 million .
This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle .
Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending »
In contrast , one of Romney 's chief rivals for the GOP nomination , former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , has spent nothing on television ads , but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys .
Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition , while Romney does not .
In the race for the Democratic nomination , Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $ 2.3 million on television commercials , while New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton has spent $ 1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls .
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $ 2 million he has invested in his television commercials .
Richardson 's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker , diplomat and executive , and positioned him as a solid second - tier candidate .
Romney used his $ 8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters .
These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts .
Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire .
Further evidence of how Romney 's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina .
An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters .
A month later , and with $ 350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll , Romney was up 17 percentage points .
Romney 's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa , and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , to boost the military by 100,000 people , to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda .
All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses .
While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now , Tracey said he expects this to change .
" Before the end of October , I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air , " Tracey said .
" As we get closer to primary day , the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last , best shot . "
In the fight for Congress , CMAG predicts that as much as $ 639 million could be spent on television advertising .
Democrats control the House and Senate .
Tracey noted that CMAG 's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep.
Mark Foley 's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks .
" Politics is completely beholden to events , " he said .
" Events will ultimately determine how much is spent , where and when . "
What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months ?
" Chances are , just as what happened in 2006 , voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads , " said Stuart Rothenberg , editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report .
" The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance .
After a while , the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise . "

Daniel Craig helped launch the new film at Pinewood Studios
The Bond film set
The title is taken from one of a collection of short stories published by 007 creator Ian Fleming in 1960 .
Producer Michael Wilson said the film would have " twice as much action " as 2006's Casino Royale , which saw Daniel Craig debut as the iconic secret agent .
The next outing , previously known as Bond 22 , is partly being shot at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire .
At a press conference at the facility , reporters were shown a minute of footage from the new film , including Bond swinging on a rope after an explosion at an art gallery in Siena , Italy .
Another scene showed him meeting M - played by Dame Judi Dench - outside in the snow .
Filming on the movie has been taking place at Pinewood since November .
He 's looking for revenge , you know , to make himself happy with the world again
Daniel Craig on James Bond
" Ian Fleming had written about relationships , " he explained .
" When they go wrong , when there 's nothing left , when the spark has gone , when the fire 's gone out , there 's no quantum of solace .
" And at the end of the last movie , Bond has the love of his life taken away from him and he never got that quantum of solace . "
Craig said the new film would follow 007 as he goes out " to find the guy who 's responsible " .
" So he 's looking for revenge , you know , to make himself happy with the world again .
" But the title also alludes to something else in the film , " he added .
' Driven by revenge '
Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton star alongside Craig
Olga Kurylenko , who plays Bond girl Camille in the film , said that she has yet to film any scenes , but was working hard preparing for her role .
" I 'm doing weapons training and body flight training for aerial scenes and stunt work for fighting , " she said .
" This girl is going to kick ass .
She 's on her own mission and she 's driven by revenge . "
But it is not clear whether Camille is a secret agent .
French actor Mathieu Amalric , who plays the villainous Dominic Greene , told reporters his character had " the smile of Tony Blair and the crazy eyes of Nicholas Sarkozy " .
Actress Gemma Arterton plays an MI6 agent in the film and has already shot her love scenes with 007 .
She said : " I felt like a giggly girl , and I felt so young and inexperienced - but I kissed James Bond ! "
The 21 - year - old , who recently starred in the St Trinian 's film , said her Bond role is " not so frolicksome " and her character " fresh and young , not sultry and a femme fatale " .
' Pretty prickly '
Dame Judi Dench , who returns for her sixth Bond film , said : " I get to do more in this one , which is brilliant . "
She hinted that her character 's relationship with Bond would be " pretty prickly " .
Rumours about the name had grown after fans noticed that film studio Sony had bought the domain name quantumofsolace.com .
But co-producer Michael Wilson said the name had only been decided " a few days ago " , adding the story 's start point would be " literally an hour after the last film left off " .
Asked if Casino Royale star Eva Green would appear in Quantum of Solace , co-producer Barbara Broccoli said : " There are no flashbacks in the film , but she 's certainly on Bond 's mind . "
Director Marc Forster is in charge of work on the movie , which is due for release on 7 November .
Astronomers have announced that a mystery object orbiting a star 170 light - years from Earth might have formed from the collision and merger of two protoplanets .
The object , known as 2M1207B , has puzzled astronomers since its discovery because it seems to fall outside the spectrum of physical possibility .
Its temperature , luminosity , age , and location do not match up with any theory .
" This is a strange enough object that it needs a strange explanation , " said Eric Mamajek of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) .
2M1207B orbits a 25 - Jupiter - mass brown dwarf called 2M1207A seen in the direction of the constellation Centaurus .
Computer models show that 2M1207A is very young , only about 8 million years old ; therefore its companion should also be 8 million years old .
At that age , it should have cooled to a temperature of less than 1300 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1000 Kelvin ) .
However , observations show that 2M1207B is actually about 2400 degrees F ( 1600 K ) .
The extra heat might be the result of a protoplanetary collision .
" Most , if not all , planets in our solar system were hit early in their history .
A collision created Earth 's moon and knocked Uranus on its side , " explained Mamajek .
" It 's quite likely that major collisions happen in other young planetary systems , too . "
Given its temperature , astronomers would expect a certain luminosity for 2M1207B , but it is 10 times fainter than expected .
In 2006 , astronomers suggested that it is obscured by a dusty , edge - on disk .
Mamajek and his colleague , Michael Meyer of the University of Arizona , propose an alternative explanation : 2M1207B is small , only about the size of Saturn , and therefore has a smaller - than - expected surface area radiating energy .
They derive a radius of 31,000 miles ( 50,000 km ) for 2M1207B , compared to 37,000 miles ( 60,000 km ) for Saturn .
Given typical densities for giant planets , this would give 2M1207B a mass about 80 times Earth ( or one - fourth Jupiter ) .
The only plausible way for such a small object to be so hot millions of years after it formed is if it suffered a recent , titanic collision that heated it .

The planets in our solar system assembled from dust , rock , and gas , gradually growing larger over millions of years .
But sometimes , two planet - sized objects collided catastrophically .
For example , the Moon formed when an object about half the size of Mars hit the proto - Earth .
If planet formation works the same way in other star systems , then 2M1207B might be the product of a collision between a Saturn - sized gas giant and a planet about three times the size of Earth .
The two smacked into each other and stuck , forming one larger world still boiling from the heat generated in the collision .
" The Earth was hit by something one - tenth its mass , and it 's likely that other planets in our solar system were too , including Venus and Uranus , " explained Meyer .
" If that one - tenth scale holds in other planetary systems , then we could be seeing the aftermath of a collision between a 72 Earth - mass gas giant and an 8 Earth - mass planet , even though such collisions are very unlikely . "
Mamajek also points out that the collision theory is reasonable from a timescale point of view .
A 2400 - degree , Saturn - sized object would radiate its heat away over about 100,000 years .
If the system were billions of years old , it is unlikely that we would be looking at the right time , but since the system is young , the chances are much better that we would catch it shortly after the collision while the hot aftermath is still observable .
The collision hypothesis makes several predictions that astronomers can test .
Chief among them is a low surface gravity ( which depends on a planet 's mass and radius ) .
To check this prediction , astronomers will need to get a better spectrum of 2M1207B -- a challenge since it is very faint and very close to the brown dwarf 2M1207A .
Others are checking the dusty disk theory by looking for signs of polarization in the light from 2M1207B .
More answers should be forthcoming within a year or two .
Mamajek emphasized that while a planet collision may not be the correct explanation for the weirdness of 2M1207B , examples of colliding planets are likely to be found by the next generation of ground - based telescopes .
" Hot , post - collision planets might be a whole new class of objects we will see with the Giant Magellan Telescope . "
" Even if we 're wrong , I would n't be surprised if someone finds a clear - cut case in the next 10 years , " Mamajek added .
The announcement was made in a press conference at the 211th meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
Understanding the mysterious dark matter in our universe is paramount to cosmologists .
Dark matter and dark energy makes up the vast majority of mass in the observable universe .
It influences galaxy rotation , galactic clusters and even holds the answer to our universe ’s fate .
So , it is unsurprising to hear about some outlandish physics behind the possible structure of this concealed mass .
A Harvard scientist has now stepped up the plate , publishing his understanding about dark matter , believing the answer may lie in a type of material that has a mass , but does n’t behave like a particle .
“ Unparticles ” may also be detected by the high energy particle accelerator , the Large Hadron Detector ( LHD ) at CERNÂ going online in a few weeks time .
High energy physics is about to get stranger than it already is …
Dark matter is theorized to take on many forms , including : neutron stars , weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) , neutrinos , black holes and massive compact halo objects ( MACHOs ) .
It is hard , however , to understand where the majority of mass comes from if you ca n’t observe it , so much of what we “ know ” about this dark source of matter and energy will remain theory until we can actually find a way of observing it .
Now , we have a chance , not only to observe a form of dark matter , but also to generate it .
Professor Howard Georgi , a Harvard University physicist , wants to share his idea that the “ missing mass ” of the universe may be held in a type of matter that cannot be explained by the current understanding of physics .
The revelation came to him when he was researching what can be expected from the future results of LHC experiments .
Beginning with quantum mechanics ( as one would expect ) , he focused on the interactions between sub-atomic particles .
Using the “ Standard Model ” , which describes everything we know and understand about matter in our universe ( interactions , symmetry , leptons , bosons etc. ) , Georgi soon came to a dead end .
He then side stepped a basic premise of the standard model : the forces that govern particle interactions act differently at different length scales .
“ I did think I was crazy , ” Prof .
Georgi on the moment he stumbled on the “ unparticle theory ” .
This is one of the major failings of the standard model – the unification of the four universal forces : weak force , strong force , electromagnetic force and gravitational force .
The standard model unites the first three , but neglects gravity .
Gravity simply does not fit .
So Georgi took the bold step and calculated what could be generated by the LHC without the help of standard sub-atomic thinking and scale length restrictions .
The unparticle would therefore be “ scale invariant ” , a property of fractals .
Unparticles can interact over any scale lengths without restriction .
When viewed , the unparticle will act as a fractal and will look similar over any scale ( a characteristic known as self - similarity ) .
Unparticles will also take on any mass , some or all the mass , depending on the scale you are viewing at .
Now the implication of mass suddenly becomes interesting to the dark matter hunters out there .
Unparticles could be a huge source of dark matter .
As they have mass , unparticles would also possess an “ ungravity ” .
Ungravity should have a strong , short - distance effect on matter in the observable world , and so , may be observed by sufficiently sensitive gravity probes .
Whether unparticles exist or not , exploring the possibility that standard thinking may need to be slightly re-jigged for the extreme world of high energy particle collisions will surely lead to some healthy scientific debate .
For now , we wait in anticipation for when the LHC goes online in May this year .

池田信夫が相変わらずやっているので、真似して。
氏の批判はもうちょっと具体的になっているので、「経済」としては見るべきところがあるようになった。でも、やっぱり引用のしかたがおかしいし、「技術批判」としてはなってないのでつっこんでみる。
私の前回同様、結論に於いては違いはないんだが、池田氏のあの批判は当事者に対してあんまりなのと、ちょっと結論への持ち込み方と、引用に疑問がある。
まず、 「戦艦大和」という比愈はナンセンス過ぎる。これは前回のものを読んだら良いのだが、今のスーパーコンピュータなんて、高々
煮えたぎるヤカ ン
すら満足にシミュレート出来ないのだ。だから、いくらかでも戦果を上げた「戦艦大和」なんかと比較にならないくらい低性能なのだ。それでもあちこちで使われ、成果が出ているのは、
領域が限定された応用分野
だからだ 。
たとえば、前に 「 ホールのシミュレーションをして伝達関数を求め」という話を書いたのだが、これだってちゃんとやろうと思うと、「空気」とか「壁」とかの物理的な特性を計算しなきゃいけない。さらに、壁の外にはさらに壁があるし、壁は均質の材料じゃないし、空気の振動って実は線型問題じゃないし…
ということで、厳密に計算しようと思えばどこまでも問題は複雑化して行く。「そんなことの影響はないでしょ」という意見もあるが、「影響はない(無視していい)」と結論づけるためには、計算してみないとわからない。とは言え、そんな計算はESくらいなチャチな計算機では非力で、まるっきりお話にならない。そういった意味では、「使えねー」ということになってしまう。
そこでどうするかと言えば、既に実験的に影響の程度がわかっているもので、影響が少ないと思うものは、積極的にモデルから外す。いわゆる
ネグる
ということをやるわけだ。壁は十分振動を減衰するから、壁の向こうは計算から除外するとか、可聴音の波長では壁素材の不均一性は無視していいだろうとか、常識的な音の大きさなら媒質の非線形性は無視しても困らんだろうとか。あるいはそこまでモデル化するんであれば、もっと大胆に波動方程式を使わなくっても、「音波は直進する」という仮定をして音線図法を使うとか。そうやってモデルを簡単にして、計算可能な領域に持って行って計算するから、既存の計算機で計算しても成果が出る。
ところが、ESが求められている世界はこれとは違う。一番の違いは、「知見がないもの」を計算しようとしているということだ。
ほとんどのシミュレーションは、基礎方程式があると共に、モデルとそのモデルの評価が存在している。基礎研究をしているところは、モデルと実験結果を比較して、そのモデルの限界とかを検証する。そうやってモデルは作られる(学部レベルでやるような「基礎方程式をいきなり離散化をして計算して満足」したようなモデルは使えない)。こういったモデル化があるから、遅い計算機でもいいわけだ。
ところが、ESがやろうとしている計算は、いまだ有効なモデルすらない世界なのだ。と言うか、
どのパラメータが結果に影響を与えるか
という、ごく基本の基本のところすらわかっていない。とゆーより、それを知ることがESでやる計算だ。「CO2の増加って本当に地球を温暖化するの？」みたいなことを検証するのが目的なわけだ。
だから、計算は限りなく細かく、モデルも限りなく基礎方程式に近いものが必要となる。いや、もしかしたらそれでも足りないかも知れない。極端なことを言えば、
計算可能性を実際に計算して調べる
ようなことになるかも知れない。そういった問題だから、どこまでも要求は高くなる。
また、そんなモデルもまだ満足に作られてない世界だから、プログラムは簡単に作っては試し…
が出来なきゃいけない。モデルが正しくて後は計算するだけという状態(実用的な数値実験はそうだ)であるなら、頑張ってチューニングすればいいから、多少プログラミングにスキルが必要であっても問題にならないが、この場合はそうじゃないのだ。
だから、同 じ 「スーパーコンピュータのユーザ」と言っても、「後は計算が速くなるだけ」という人達と、「計算が速くないとプログラムそのものが書きにくい」という人達とでは、視点が違う。牧野氏の批判は前者に基くものなので、本人が「そんなのいらねー」という時には実に正しい意見であるが、「評論家」が引用する時にはもう一方の立場の意見を引用しなければ、公平性に欠く。
というのは、前振り 。
多くのベクトル型スーパーコンピュータを支持する人達は、歴史をまるっきり忘れている。って、私も先日ベクトル型スーパーコンピュータ華やかりきし頃の数値解析の本を読み返していて思い出したことなんだが。
実は、ベクトル型スーパーコンピュータであっても、
チューニングは凄く大変
だったのだ。その頃の数値解析の本には、どうやって性能を引き出すかというノウハウについても書かれていた。計算の順序を変えたり、計算をまとめてみたりとかして、ベクトル演算器をいかにして止めないかということを考えることが重要だったのだ。
だから、それ以前の 「大型計算機」で速度が出ると言われていたアルゴリズムも、ベクトル計算に不向きだと言われて捨てられてしまったものとか、改良されたものとかもたくさんある。また、コンピュータの方はそういった「本質的に苦手」な計算であっても、高速に計算出来るようなハードウェアだとかコンパイラだとかが開発された。そうやって頑張った結果、ベクトル型の計算機で速度が出せるようになり、「使いやすい」とか言われるようになったのだ。今あるベクトル型計算機が、最初からプログラムを書きやすかったわけじゃない。
ハードウェアの速度向上は、もうかなり限界だ。「ベクトル型」と呼ばれるESだって、中身は単にベクトル計算機だけじゃなくて、それがずらーっと並んで並列処理するようになっている。そういった意味で言えばプログラミングの手間とかチューニングは、クラスタ型のものと大差ないはずだ。PEが速いとかICが速いとかということはあるだろうが、それは50歩100歩だ。また、次の「京速計算機」にしたって、「ハイブリット型」とか言ってるくらいだから、中身は「ベクトル型のクラスタ」を想定しているのだろうと思う。
そういったことを考えると、世界( アメリカ)
に一歩先に出るためには、ハードウェアにガンガン金をかけて、ハードウェア的に無理やり速度を稼ぐことを目的とするようなプロジェクトじゃなくて、その辺のハードウェアで作ったクラスタ上であっても簡単にプログラムが書けるようにするための、
ソフトウェア( ミドルウェア )
に金をかけるべきだ。ソフトウェアで頑張れば、ハード価格の安いスーパーコンピュータが作ることが出来るわけだから、幸せになる人は格段に増える。「FireStreamを2000個並べて1PFLOPS」は今は嬉しくも何ともないだろうが、それを上手く扱うソフトウェアが出来れば、実用的にも
たった5億で世界一
になる。これなら 、 「ちょっとした研究機関」なら買うことが出来るし、今からやったら次のSCに間に合うくらい現実の技術になっているのだ。どうしてもハードウェアが作りたかったら作ってもいいけど、FireStream程度のチップであれば、設計するのも製造するのも、日本のメーカにしてみればどうってことのないもので、要は「やる気」だけの問題だ。
「国産アーキテクチャ」にこだわるんだったら、それこそGRAPE(みたいなもの)に金出せばいい。GRAPEアーキテクチャで汎用の高速計算に使えるようになったら、それこそブレークスルーになる。現在のGRAPEアーキテクチャでダメなら、次のアーキテクチャを考えればいい。何にせよ、ハードウェアが無理して速度を上げないとダメだという方向からは離れるべきで、安く作れるハードウェアを必要なだけ用意すれば必要なだけ速度が出る、それでいてプログラムが書きやすいという、そういった方向の「ソフトウェア」を作るのだ。そうすればみんなが幸せになれる。
つまり、 「京速計算機」が馬鹿げているというのは、それが「大艦巨砲プロジェクト」であるとか、ITゼネコン救済だとかというような問題ではなくて、
投資される資金に対しての期待される受益者の少なさ
なのだ。1000億なんて他の税金のむだ使いからすれば、ゴミのようなものでしかない(財投の焦げつきなんて兆のオーダだ)。「戦艦大和」みたいなたいそうな金額じゃない。それでアメリカに一矢報いることが出来るのなら、安いと言ってもいい。
でも、ちょっと視点を変えるだけで、同じ投資でも受益者は何桁も増やせる可能性があるものを、むざむざ捨ててしまっているというのが馬鹿げている。たとえるなら、「戦艦大和」と言うよりは、
地方債で建てた田舎の音楽ホール
の方が、イメージに近い。年に1度の「音楽祭」に町民が来るだけで、普段は講演会に使ってるだけとかって奴。昔の私の客はちょうどそんなところだった。これなら「利用者の少ない田舎の高速道路」の批判と同じ論理が使えるのだから、池田センセイでも出来るでしょ。
ソフトウェア中心のプロジェクトとなると、確かに「国家プロジェクト」としては弱いのかも知れないけれど、「成果物は全部オープンソースにするぞゴルぁ」とでも言えば、アメリカ涙目だろう。

Sarah Dallof reportingA woman hiding in a closet from burglars was shocked when they opened the doors -- not once but twice -- and never saw her .
The 911 tape from the incident runs for about 13 minutes .
It felt like forever to the young woman hiding in the closet in her West Jordan home .
But she had a calm , collected 911 operator helping her through it .
" Please hurry , " 21 - year - old Brittney said during the 911 call .
The operator asked , " Can you hear anybody downstairs ? "
Brittney answered , " Yes . "
Brittney made the call yesterday .
Police say three men rang her doorbell , and when no one answered they let themselves in .
The intruders smashed in the window , climbed inside and headed upstairs to see what they could find , all while Brittney was home .
" It 's almost surreal .
I can't even comprehend the feelings , " Brittney told us today .
As the burglars got closer , she hid in an upstairs closet .
At one point on the 911 recording , the burglars are heard arranging for a ride .
" You get closer yet by chance ?
Because we 'll be ready in like , maybe 10 minutes , " one of them said .
John Fitisemanu was the operator on the other end of the 911 call .
" It got pretty intense at times during the call , " he told us .
One of the burglars , looking for stuff to steal , opened the closet where Brittney was hiding .
" I was just standing right there .
He pushed it open and was bumping into my legs , my boots , " she said .
Fitisemanu is heard on the 911 tape telling Brittney , " I do have some officers in the backyard and on the corners of your house . "
The burglars spotted police and scrambled .
One jumped into the bedroom closet , inches from Brittney .
" He was standing right there .
I could have kissed his cheek if I 'd stood on my tippy toes , " she said .
She stayed still and silent until officers entered the bedroom .
Then Brittney said , " He 's in here ! "
Police ordered him out of the closet .
" He looked at me with a completely dumbfounded expression , like , ' Where 'd she come from ? ' "
Brittney explained .
The three were taken into custody without further problems .
Today Brittney met John , the man who kept her calm during those tense minutes .
" I felt OK .
Being on the phone with someone helped , " she said .
The suspects , Adam Cloward , Jake Hampton and Tony Cone , are in jail on charges of aggravated burglary , theft and criminal mischief .
Police say they found two knives and brass knuckles on the suspects .
Brittney says she feels incredibly lucky .
She chose not to give us her last name for this story .
THE growth in illegal music downloading is forcing desperate record company executives to buy less glamorous narcotics , the Daily Mash has learned .
Industry insiders say dozens of executives have downgraded from cocaine soaked in champagne or premium vodka , to ' street highs ' such as crack , glue and air freshener .
A record company source said : " Every time you download something for nothing a record company boss has to adjust his lifestyle .
Offices throughout Soho are piled high with cheap bottles of glue and bags of crisps . "
The source added : " Just last week we received word that a record company executive had to cook for himself .
We can only give thanks to God he had someone to do the dishes .
" These people are used to having cocaine brought to them on one of the platinum discs for Tubular Bells , carried by the attractive girl from Steps or one of the early Sugababes .
" It 's not as if they 're musicians who can afford several houses with staff .
Many of these guys have just two or three houses , often looked after by a part - time housekeeper who answers back .
" This time next year they 'll be on family tax credits and clipping coupons out of the paper . "
The industry is to launch a £ 10 m campaign to highlight the growing crisis .
A cinema advert will feature an executive enduring a cheap haircut , having a pizza delivered and ironing his own shirts to the strains of Drive by The Cars .
It 's parasites week here at mental_floss , which we kicked off two days ago with the release of our newest video , " Attack of the Parasites . "
Now , while it 's true that there are all kinds of compelling reasons to avoid becoming infested with parasites -- especially by the kinds that cause things like river blindness and elephantiasis of the genitalia -- there are also a few reasons to make nice with our tiny , opportunistic compatriots .
Here are four .
1. Pseudacteon , the " decapitating fly "
Nobody likes fire ants .
Where I grew up in Southern Florida , they were a major nemesis to unfettered , shoeless outdoor romping ; one false step could mean a foot covered in biting , welt - inducing fire ants .
In fact , ever since they were accidentally imported from South America via cargo ship in the 1930s , they 've spread like an annoying , predator - less plague from coast to coast , infesting at least 18 states .
So far , the only measures introduced to deal with them have been stopgap at best -- sprinkling poison on the mounds , for instance .
That is , until now .
Meet Pseudacteon , a parasitic fly from South America .
Pseudacteon , like most living creatures , loves to reproduce .
The important distinction between it and other flies , however , is where Pseudacteon lays its eggs : inside the heads of fire ants .
Get ready for an awesomely grody cycle - of - life : the larvae develop by feeding on the muscle and nervous tissue in the head .
After about two weeks , they cause the ant 's head to fall off by releasing an enzyme that dissolves the membrane attaching the ant 's head to its body .
The fly pupates in the detached head capsule ( pictured above ! ) .
Hence : the decapitating fly !
Currently , industrious agricultural scholars are importing them from South America in the hopes that they 'll do rid us of our fire ants .
Godspeed , little decapitators .
2. Worm therapy
A rare bit of good news from the world of gastrointestinal maladies : swallowing the eggs of a certain type of parasite worm may actually help cure Crohn 's disease .
The basic theory is this : in countries where people 's exposure to parasites is high , disorders of the immune system like Crohn 's , multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes are rare .
In ultra -sanitized industrialized nations like the U.S. , they 're common .
According to researchers , we may have hygiened our way into a few diseases that certain types of parasites actually help prevent , and by re-introducing them into the body -- that is , with " worm therapy " -- we may actually be able to combat those conditions .
Specifically , treatment with the eggs of the intestinal parasite helminth Trichuris suis may be a safe and effective treatment for Crohn 's disease , according to the results of a small , preliminary trial conducted at the University of Iowa in Iowa City .
T. suis is not a natural human parasite , but primarily affects pigs .
3 . The blepharipa schineri fly
If swallowing worm eggs is n't your thing , then maybe you can get behind this : the fuzzy , half - inch - long blepharipa schineri does for the gypsy moth what the decapitating fly does for the fire ant .
( Well , it does n't actually decapitate the moth , but the end result is the same : no more moths .
It achieves this by laying eggs in pre-moth gypsy caterpillars , where they hatch and prevent them from growing into moths . )
What 's so terrible about gypsy moths ?
Just ask a park ranger : gypsy moths eat the leaves of some of our most popular shrubs and trees , from oak to beech to poplars .
In the Eastern U.S. , the moths are well - established over at least 60 million acres , defoliating and killing hundreds of varieties of trees .
If you do n't like the sound of that , you just might like the sound of what the fly does to the moth :
A parasite of the gypsy moth , the B. schineri fly kills unlucky gypsy moth caterpillars that accidentally eat fly eggs while munching on leaves .
A gray - black speck about the size of a thumbtack point , the fly egg hatches inside the caterpillar 's stomach .
The transparent B. schineri maggot that emerges will later poke holes in the caterpillar 's gut , then wriggle its way to the nerve cord that runs the length of the body .
While the gypsy moth caterpillar transforms into a pupa - - a pre-moth that slumbers in a silky , loosely woven cradle -- the B. schineri maggot feeds on the host 's innards , slowly killing it .
Gross ?
Sure .
Useful ?
Definitely .
Lucky for us , moths are this fly 's only breeding ground .
4 . It Makes the Ladies Happy
Quite literally : the Toxoplasma parasite , found primarily in cat feces , is known to have a mood - altering effect on humans , which differs depending on the sex of the human .
In a study conducted by parasitologist Jaroslav Flegr of Charles University in Prague , some infected women were likely to become more outgoing and warm - hearted , whereas some infected men became more jealous and suspicious .
( Not everyone is mood - altered by cat poo ; it 's a small , though statistically significant , percentage . )
When it 's not changing our moods , the Toxoplasma is trying to spread itself by making rats who come into contact with it act fearless , which makes it easier for them to be caught by cats ( who then become infected , etc ) .
I 've Got Billions , but Do n't Like to Spend It Meet the world 's wealthiest cheapskates .
Nov. 27 , 2007 Special to ABCNEWS.com  --
Sure , billionaires fly private jets , live in massive mansions , dine at the world 's finest restaurants and shop at Gucci , Prada and Louis Vuitton .
After all , they 're rich .
But some of the world 's wealthiest people are n't so flashy .
They 're frugal - - for billionaires , at least .
Take John Caudwell , who got his start as an auto - repair shop owner and went on to create a $ 2.2 billion fortune ( when last measured by Forbes in March ) by selling his 85 % stake in cellphone outfit the Caudwell Group in 2005 .
An avid sportsman , he used to bike 14 miles to work every day .
He cuts his own hair because going to a barber is a waste of time .
He buys his clothes off the rack at British retailer Marks & Spencer .
Click here to meet more frugal billionaires at our partner site , Forbes.com .
" I do n't need Saville Row suits , " he tells Forbes , adding that splurging on extremely pricey bottles of wine is often a waste .
" I do n't need to spend money to bolster my own esteem . "
Caudwell does have his indulgences .
He owns both a Ferrari and a Bentley .
Jim C. Walton , the Wal - Mart scion and member of America 's richest family , has different taste in vehicles .
He inherited his money -- and spending habits -- from father Sam .
Worth $ 16.4 billion when we valued his fortune for the Forbes 400 list in September , Jim prefers pickup trucks to sports cars .
Reportedly , he drives a 15 - year - old Dodge Dakota .
Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad built a $ 33 billion fortune selling affordable furniture to the masses .
Yet the self - made Swedish tycoon drives a 15 - year - old Volvo , flies coach , tries to avoid wearing suits and often eats meals at lower - tier restaurants .
Indian billionaire Azim Premji made his $ 17.1 billion fortune through tech - services giant Wipro .
Despite being one of Asia 's richest men , Premji drives a Toyota Corolla , flies coach and stays in company guest houses instead of five - star hotels when traveling on business .
He even served food on paper plates at a lunch honoring his son's wedding .
Famously frugal investor Warren Buffett has been making headlines recently for railing against the Bush administration 's tax policy and sticking up for the middle class .
And he walks the walk : Despite earning $ 46 million in taxable income last year and boasting a net worth of $ 57 billion , he lives in the same home he bought for $ 31,500 nearly 50 years ago .
Stanford professor David Cheriton made his billions by introducing Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to the venture capitalists at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers .
He was rewarded with a sizable chunk of Google stock .
Canadian Cheriton says he prefers to ride his bike around his Palo Alto , Calif. , neighborhood , and relies on an old Volkswagen van or a Honda sedan when he needs to get behind the wheel .
He says he only flies commercial , prefers jeans to designer clothes and claims to reuse his teabags .
He also cuts his own hair to save time going to a barber .
His indulgence : two windsurfers .
When contacted about this story , Cheriton cited the Wikipedia definition of frugality : " The acquiring of and resourceful use of economic goods and services in order to achieve lasting and more fulfilling goals . "
He says , " That 's certainly something I aspire to . "
Datenschutz und das Recht auf Privatheit werden im Unterricht an Schulen und Weiterbildungseinrichtungen vernachlässigt .
Wachsender Kontrollmöglichkeiten und die zunehmende Einschränkung der Privatspäre durch die allgegenwärtige Vernetzung verbunden mit neuen Technolgien von RFID bis zum Digital Rights Management machten den Datenschutz aber wichtiger als je zuvor , warnten Referenten bei den Stuttgarter Tagen der Medienpädagogik unter dem Motto " Durchlässig und ( un)durchschaubar - Datenschutz im 21 .
Jahrhundert " ( Programm als PDF - Datei ) .
2006 haben wir die reale technologische Basis für das Orwellsche 1984 , " sagt Wolfgang Schindler vom Studienzentrum Josefsthal .
" Zu wenige Leute sagen heute nein , wenn es um den Verkauf ihrer Daten geht , " sagte Andrea " Princess " Wardzichowski vom Chaos Computer Club Stuttgart .
Das sich auf die Gesellschaft legende Stahlnetz , vor dem die Medien angesichts der Volkszählung im Jahr 1987 gewarnt hatten , sei zwar inzwischen deutlich enger geknüpft , aber nicht spürbar .
" Es ist ein Schaumnetz geworden .
Stahl wäre alte Technologie " , sagte Schindler , der auch vor Orwellschem " Neusprech " warnte , der Umdeutung von Begriffen .
Beim Trusted Computing gehe es eben nicht um Vertrauen , sondern Mißtrauen gegenüber den Nutzer , DRM meine eher Digital " Restrictions " Management .
Im Kern , so Schindler , gehe es bei der Vermittlung von Datenschutz an die nächste Generation um " unser Verständnis von Demokratie und Menschenwürde " .
Reine Bewahrpädagogik reiche dabei nicht aus , so der Pädagoge .
Mit den Regeln " Gib deine Schlüssel nicht heraus " , " sprich nicht mit Fremden " ( im Chat ) , " du sollst nicht raubkopieren " und , " wenn du doch einmal ausprobieren willst , wie man sich Musik aus dem Netz lädt , lass dich nicht erwischen " reiche nicht aus .
Wichtig sei es , den Datenschutz alltagsnah und erfahrungsorientiert zu vermitteln .
" Einer meiner Söhne musste unterschreiben , dass er komplett überwacht wird , wenn er im Computerraum der Schule ist . "
Natürlich würden Schüler das unterschreiben , denn sie wollten den Zugang .
Damit aber hätten sie bereits die erste Lektion gelernt .
" Es geht , so Schindler , um die innere Bereitschaft , sich zu unterwerfen . "
Als Datenschutz - Thema zum Anfassen plant das Studienzentrum , seinen Seminarteilnehmern ganz praktisch vorzuführen , was sich durch eine RFID - unterstützte Einlasskontrolle zu einem Medienraum alles machen lasse .
Mit einer Technlogie , die schon für 200 Euro bei Conrad zu haben sei , ließe sich etwa überprüfen , welche Seminarteilnehmer immer zu spät zum Frühstück kämen .
Datenschutz tut sich schwer an der Schule .
Im Informatikunterricht sei er kein Thema , sagte ein Lehrer aus Baden - Württemberg .
Dies verdeutlichte bei der Veranstaltung auch die Karriere der wenigen vorhandenen Unterrichtsmaterialien .
Einfach eingeschlafen sei die Entwicklung einer 2003 entwickelten CD , die das Thema Datenschutz mit praktischen Tips und gesetzlichen Grundlagen für Schüler einführt , berichtete Fabian Fülle vom Beratungsunternehmen UIMC .
Was war passisert ?
Verschiedene Länder , allen voran Niedersachsen hatten die Abnahme von CDs zugesagt , doch am Ende war kein Geld da für die Schullizenzen von knapp 55 Euro .
Priorität hätten die Anschaffung von Hardware , Software und Office - Paketen , so Fülle .
Die CD wird inzwischen in abgewandelter Form an Unternehmen verkauft , die IG - Metall setzt eine Version in der Weiterbildung ein .
Schindler kennt ähnliche Beispiele - " niemand fragt die Materialien nach . "
Mehr Resonanz erhofften sich zwei aktuelle Projekte : der für Grundschulkinder gedachte Internautenkoffer der Freiwilligen Selbstkontrolle Multimedia , MSN und Deutschem Kinderhilfswerk und das Portal Handysektor.de , das sich um die Sicherheit in mobilen Netzen und damit um die etwas älteren Jugendlichen kümmert .
Die Organisatoren von der Landesanstalt für Medien Nordrhein - Westfalen ( LfM ) und dem Medienpädagogischen Forschungsverbundes Südwest ( mpfs ) wollen dem Datenschutz nun einen eigenen Themenblock widmen .
Bleibt zu hoffen , dass den neuen Projekten mehr Aufmerksamkeit zuteil wird .
Kein gutes Zeichen für den Datenschutz allerdings : die zur Tagung geladenen Landespolitiker sagten ihre Teilnahme an einem heute stattfindenden Podium allesamt ab .

Computer hackers may have been behind Hillary Clinton 's dramatic win in the New Hampshire primary , it was claimed yesterday .
One of her rivals in the race to be Democratic Party candidate in November 's presidential election is demanding a recount .
Mrs Clinton 's victory in Tuesday 's primary - one of a series of votes by individual states to pick each party 's candidate - confounded the polls and revived her campaign .
Dennis Kucinich , an outsider in the battle for the Democratic nomination , cited " serious and credible reports , allegations and rumours " about the integrity of the surprise result .
Poll after poll predicted Mrs Clinton would be trounced by Barack Obama .
Experts started questioning the count almost as soon as the votes began to roll in .
" Something stinks in New Hampshire , " a commentator posted on the popular site Americablog.com .
Scroll down for more ...
" It 's simply unprecedented for so many polls to have been so wrong , " said Gary Langer , polling director at ABC News .
" We need to know why . "
Pollsters accurately predicted John McCain 's win over Mitt Romney in the Republican race .
But more than a dozen surveys said Obama would win by as much as 13 points .
But Mrs Clinton beat him by 39 per cent to 36 per cent .
Kucinich , who won less than 2 per cent of the vote in New Hampshire , says he wants to ensure " 100 per cent of the voters had 100 per cent of their votes counted " .
He pointed to online reports alleging disparities between hand - counted ballots , which favoured Obama , and those tallied by machines , which leaned more to Clinton .
A TV documentary has claimed 81 per cent of New Hampshire votes were counted on machines that could be easily hacked into .

The state 's election officials insisted the count was accurate and can be checked against paper ballots .
Others experts point to a less sinister reason behind the upset .
Surveys showed 17 per cent of voters made up their minds on the day , many of them plumping for Mrs Clinton .
She credited her win to showing a her softer side after being brought to the brink of tears during a campaign stop .

They likely would have been surprised to know that in movie theaters , train stations and recreation centers across the U.S.S.R. , packs of Soviet youth huddled around upright video games with coins lined up along the edge of the screen , same as at any mall in Jersey .

The Lost Arcade Games of the Soviet Union
From the late ' 70s to the early '90s , Soviet military factories produced some 70 different video game models .
Based largely ( and crudely ) on early Japanese designs , the games were distributed – in the words of one military manual – for the purposes of " entertainment and active leisure , as well as the development of visual - estimation abilities . "
Production of the games ceased with the collapse of communism , and as Nintendo consoles and PCs flooded the former Soviet states , the old arcade games were either destroyed or disappeared into warehouses and basements .
It was mostly out of nostalgia that four friends at Moscow State Technical University began scouring the country to rescue these old games .
So far they have located 32 of them and are doing their best to bring them back to life .
Last month , the four officially opened the Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines in a Stalin - era bomb shelter under a university dormitory .
Packed into two rooms are dozens of Soviet - made video game carcasses in various states of repair .
Some work perfectly ; others last for a few minutes , then fade .
One common feature among them all is a lack of a high - score list .
" That kind of competition was n't encouraged , " explains Alexander Stakhanov , one of the museum 's founders and engineers .
" If you got enough points you won a free game , but there was no ' high score ' culture as in the West . "

Rina Castelnuovo for The New York Times
This is another trick that I ’ve been using for a while to simplify Class - style instantiation of a function in JavaScript .
Take a look at the following code , for example :
function User ( first , last ) { this .
name = first + " " + last ; } var user = new User ( " John " , " Resig " ) ;
Pretty straight - forward .
Now let ’s look at a couple quirks of Class - style instantiation that can cause issues , but can be easily remedied .
First is an issue that new JavaScript programmers will encounter .
On a quick observation of the above code it is n’t immediately obvious that the function is actually something that is meant to be instantiated with the ‘ new ’ operator ( Unless , of course , you understood that the use of ‘ this ’ within the function implied that it was meant to be instantiated ) .
Thus , a new user would try to call the function without the operator , causing severely unexpected results ( e.g. ‘ user ’ would be undefined ) .
Secondly , if a Class - style function is meant to be instantiated , and is n’t , it can in turn end up polluting the current scope ( frequently the global namespace ) , causing even more unexpected results .
For example , observe the following code :
var name = " Resig " ; var user = User ( " John " , name ) ; // user is undefined // AND name is no longer " Resig " if ( name == " John Resig " ) { // Oops ! }
This can result in a debugging nightmare .
The developer may try to interact the name variable again ( being unaware of the error that occurred from mis-using the User function ) and be forced to dance down the horrible non-deterministic wormhole that ’s presented to them ( Why is the value of their variables changing underneath their feet ? ) .
Finally , a tangible advantage .
Instantiating a function with a bunch of prototype properties is very , very , fast .
It completely blows the Module pattern , and similar , out of the water .
Thus , if you have a frequently - accessed function ( returning an object ) that you want people to interact with , then it ’s to your advantage to have the object properties be in the prototype chain and instantiate it .
Here it is , in code :
// Very fast function User ( ) {} User.prototype = { /*
Lots of properties ... */ } ; // Very slow function User ( ) { return { /*
Lots of properties */ } ; }
Now , with that in mind , let ’s also examine constructing a simple function API .
For example , the $ function from jQuery .
There ’s no way that the users are going to want to do new $ ( " div " ) every time they interact with that method ; however , we want to be able to take advantage of the speedy benefits of the object prototype .
Therefore , we need a solution to solve this .
Now , without further hassle , here is the solution to all of the above problems , in a simple snippet :
function User ( first , last ) { if ( this instanceof User ) { this .
name = first + " " + last ; } else return new User ( first , last ) ; }
The two tricky lines are the first and the last .
Let ’s examine those in depth .
if ( this instanceof User ) {
This statement seems straightforward but takes a little bit of consideration .
What we ’re doing is checking to see if we ’re currently inside of an instantiated version of the function , rather than just the function itself .
Let ’s look at a simpler example :
function test ( ) { alert ( this instanceof test ) ; } test ( ) ; // alert ( false ) ; new test ( ) ; // alert ( true ) ;
Using this bit of logic we can now construct our structure within the class constructor .
This means that if the ‘ this instanceof User ’ expression is true then we need to behave like we normally would , within a constructor ( initializing property values , etc. ) .
But if the expression is false , we need to instantiate the function , like so :
return new User ( first , last ) ;
It ’s important to return the result , since we ’re just inside a normal function at the point .
This way , no matter which way we now call the User ( ) function , we ’ll always get an instance back .
// New Style : new User ( ) ; // => [ object User ] User ( ) ; // => [ object User ] // Old Style : new User ( ) ; // => [ object User ] User ( ) ; // => undefined
makeClass ()
Ok , so this is all well - and - good , but let ’s now wrap this together into a generic class constructor that we can reuse to build these types of functions .
Something like the following should be sufficient :
// makeClass - By John Resig ( MIT Licensed ) function makeClass ( ) { return function ( args ) { if ( this instanceof arguments .
callee ) { if ( typeof this .init == " function " ) this .init.apply ( this , args .
callee ?
args : arguments ) ; } else return new arguments .
callee ( arguments ) ; } ; }
Let ’s reexamine our previous example and see how this function could be used :
var User = makeClass ( ) ; User.prototype.init = function ( first , last ) { this .
name = first + " " + last ; } ; var user = User ( " John " , " Resig " ) ; user.name // => " John Resig "
So there you have it : A simpler syntax for classical - style object instantiation that easy for end users and is more robust and resilient to misuse .
Bonus !
Let ’s dive into the makeClass ( ) function and see what makes it tick .
Again , it ’s deceptively simple ( due to it ’s length ) but is actually a complex bit of code to wrap your mind around .
Let ’s break it down bit - by - bit .
The first part :
function makeClass ( ) { return function ( args ) {
/* ... */ } ; }
When we “ make a class ” all we ’re doing is producing a function .
Since , in JavaScript , “ classes ” ( or , our closest approximation of what we call classes ) is actually a heavily - enhanced function .
Thus , calling makeClass just gives us a function to play with .
All class - creation libraries do this ( Prototype , base , et. al. ) .
if ( this instanceof arguments .
callee ) { // Stuff ... } else return new arguments.callee ( arguments ) ;
Now , this code looks very similar to the code that we used before to check the “ class ” type .
The distinction here is that we do n’t know what the name of the class actually is .
Thus , we have to cheat and “ become generic ” .
When you ’re inside of a function ( remember , we ’re inside the anonymous function that is now the representation of the class – we are the class ) arguments .
callee is a reference to the function itself ( in JavaScript 2 this will become the expression “ this function ” ) .
Now , that explains the first if statement , but let ’s look at that last return statement .
Notice that we ’re instantiating an anonymous function , from inside of itself .
I suspect that this will blow the mind of someone – and it should ; this is what makes JavaScript a great language to work with .
But note that we pass in ‘ arguments ’ as the first parameter to the class constructor .
We ’re cheating here .
The issue is that you ca n’t actually call .apply ( ) ( or .call ( ) ) on the instantiation of a function ( you can in JavaScript 2 by applying against the intrinsic : : construct method ) .
Thus , we pass along the arguments , collectively , as the first argument and then watch for those arguments to come in , named ‘ args ’ .
if ( typeof this .init == " function " ) this .init.apply ( this , args .
callee ?
args : arguments ) ;
Finally , the last bit .
Since we need to make the construction phase of the class generic , we defer that to an ‘ init ’ function property instead ( Prototype uses ‘ initialize ’ instead , I like short words ) .
Then we simply .apply ( ) the function passing in the arguments that were transferred to us and the ‘ this ’ instance ( but only if this this .
init method exists , do n’t want to require that a constructor exists ) .
Additionally , since the arguments may have been collected and put into the first argument ( previously ) we need to verify that and check that it is an arguments variable with args .
callee .
And there you have it :
Some very - simple class construction code that ’s actually quite powerful and useful .
Comment and feedback are appreciated .

There are three kinds of genies : Genies to whom you can safely say " I wish for you to do what I should wish for " ; genies for which no wish is safe ; and genies that are n't very powerful or intelligent .
Suppose your aged mother is trapped in a burning building , and it so happens that you 're in a wheelchair ; you can't rush in yourself .
You could cry , " Get my mother out of that building ! " but there would be no one to hear .
Luckily you have , in your pocket , an Outcome Pump .
This handy device squeezes the flow of time , pouring probability into some outcomes , draining it from others .
The Outcome Pump is not sentient .
It contains a tiny time machine , which resets time unless a specified outcome occurs .
For example , if you hooked up the Outcome Pump 's sensors to a coin , and specified that the time machine should keep resetting until it sees the coin come up heads , and then you actually flipped the coin , you would see the coin come up heads .
( The physicists say that any future in which a " reset " occurs is inconsistent , and therefore never happens in the first place - so you are n't actually killing any versions of yourself . )
Whatever proposition you can manage to input into the Outcome Pump , somehow happens , though not in a way that violates the laws of physics .
If you try to input a proposition that 's too unlikely , the time machine will suffer a spontaneous mechanical failure before that outcome ever occurs .
You can also redirect probability flow in more quantitative ways using the " future function " to scale the temporal reset probability for different outcomes .
If the temporal reset probability is 99 % when the coin comes up heads , and 1 % when the coin comes up tails , the odds will go from 1:1 to 99:1 in favor of tails .
If you had a mysterious machine that spit out money , and you wanted to maximize the amount of money spit out , you would use reset probabilities that diminished as the amount of money increased .
For example , spitting out $ 10 might have a 99.999999 % reset probability , and spitting out $ 100 might have a 99.99999 % reset probability .
This way you can get an outcome that tends to be as high as possible in the future function , even when you do n't know the best attainable maximum .
So you desperately yank the Outcome Pump from your pocket - your mother is still trapped in the burning building , remember ? - and try to describe your goal : get your mother out of the building !
The user interface does n't take English inputs .
The Outcome Pump is n't sentient , remember ?
But it does have 3D scanners for the near vicinity , and built - in utilities for pattern matching .
So you hold up a photo of your mother 's head and shoulders ; match on the photo ; use object contiguity to select your mother 's whole body ( not just her head and shoulders ) ; and define the future function using your mother 's distance from the building 's center .
The further she gets from the building 's center , the less the time machine 's reset probability .
You cry " Get my mother out of the building ! " , for luck , and press Enter .
For a moment it seems like nothing happens .
You look around , waiting for the fire truck to pull up , and rescuers to arrive - or even just a strong , fast runner to haul your mother out of the building -
BOOM !
With a thundering roar , the gas main under the building explodes .
As the structure comes apart , in what seems like slow motion , you glimpse your mother 's shattered body being hurled high into the air , traveling fast , rapidly increasing its distance from the former center of the building .
On the side of the Outcome Pump is an Emergency Regret Button .
All future functions are automatically defined with a huge negative value for the Regret Button being pressed - a temporal reset probability of nearly 1 - so that the Outcome Pump is extremely unlikely to do anything which upsets the user enough to make them press the Regret Button .
You can't ever remember pressing it .
But you 've barely started to reach for the Regret Button ( and what good will it do now ? ) when a flaming wooden beam drops out of the sky and smashes you flat .
Which was n't really what you wanted , but scores very high in the defined future function ...
The Outcome Pump is a genie of the second class .
No wish is safe .
If someone asked you to get their poor aged mother out of a burning building , you might help , or you might pretend not to hear .
But it would n't even occur to you to explode the building .
" Get my mother out of the building " sounds like a much safer wish than it really is , because you do n't even consider the plans that you assign extreme negative values .
Consider again the Tragedy of Group Selectionism : Some early biologists asserted that group selection for low subpopulation sizes would produce individual restraint in breeding ; and yet actually enforcing group selection in the laboratory produced cannibalism , especially of immature females .
It 's obvious in hindsight that , given strong selection for small subpopulation sizes , cannibals will outreproduce individuals who voluntarily forego reproductive opportunities .
But eating little girls is such an un-aesthetic solution that Wynne - Edwards , Allee , Brereton , and the other group - selectionists simply did n't think of it .
They only saw the solutions they would have used themselves .
Suppose you try to patch the future function by specifying that the Outcome Pump should not explode the building : outcomes in which the building materials are distributed over too much volume , will have ~1 temporal reset probabilities .
So your mother falls out of a second - story window and breaks her neck .
The Outcome Pump took a different path through time that still ended up with your mother outside the building , and it still was n't what you wanted , and it still was n't a solution that would occur to a human rescuer .
If only the Open - Source Wish Project had developed a Wish To Get Your Mother Out Of A Burning Building :
" I wish to move my mother ( defined as the woman who shares half my genes and gave birth to me ) to outside the boundaries of the building currently closest to me which is on fire ; but not by exploding the building ; nor by causing the walls to crumble so that the building no longer has boundaries ; nor by waiting until after the building finishes burning down for a rescue worker to take out the body ... "
All these special cases , the seemingly unlimited number of required patches , should remind you of the parable of Artificial Addition - programming an Arithmetic Expert Systems by explicitly adding ever more assertions like " fifteen plus fifteen equals thirty , but fifteen plus sixteen equals thirty - one instead " .
How do you exclude the outcome where the building explodes and flings your mother into the sky ?
You look ahead , and you foresee that your mother would end up dead , and you do n't want that consequence , so you try to forbid the event leading up to it .
Your brain is n't hardwired with a specific , prerecorded statement that " Blowing up a burning building containing my mother is a bad idea . "
And yet you 're trying to prerecord that exact specific statement in the Outcome Pump 's future function .
So the wish is exploding , turning into a giant lookup table that records your judgment of every possible path through time .
You failed to ask for what you really wanted .
You wanted your mother to go on living , but you wished for her to become more distant from the center of the building .
Except that 's not all you wanted .
If your mother was rescued from the building but was horribly burned , that outcome would rank lower in your preference ordering than an outcome where she was rescued safe and sound .
So you not only value your mother 's life , but also her health .
And you value not just her bodily health , but her state of mind .
Being rescued in a fashion that traumatizes her - for example , a giant purple monster roaring up out of nowhere and seizing her - is inferior to a fireman showing up and escorting her out through a non-burning route .
( Yes , we 're supposed to stick with physics , but maybe a powerful enough Outcome Pump has aliens coincidentally showing up in the neighborhood at exactly that moment . )
You would certainly prefer her being rescued by the monster to her being roasted alive , however .
How about a wormhole spontaneously opening and swallowing her to a desert island ?
Better than her being dead ; but worse than her being alive , well , healthy , untraumatized , and in continual contact with you and the other members of her social network .
Would it be okay to save your mother 's life at the cost of the family dog's life , if it ran to alert a fireman but then got run over by a car ?
Clearly yes , but it would be better ceteris paribus to avoid killing the dog .
You would n't want to swap a human life for hers , but what about the life of a convicted murderer ?
Does it matter if the murderer dies trying to save her , from the goodness of his heart ?
How about two murderers ?
If the cost of your mother 's life was the destruction of every extant copy , including the memories , of Bach 's Little Fugue in G Minor , would that be worth it ?
How about if she had a terminal illness and would die anyway in eighteen months ?
If your mother 's foot is crushed by a burning beam , is it worthwhile to extract the rest of her ?
What if her head is crushed , leaving her body ?
What if her body is crushed , leaving only her head ?
What if there 's a cryonics team waiting outside , ready to suspend the head ?
Is a frozen head a person ?
Is Terry Schiavo a person ?
How much is a chimpanzee worth ?
Your brain is not infinitely complicated ; there is only a finite Kolmogorov complexity / message length which suffices to describe all the judgments you would make .
But just because this complexity is finite does not make it small .
We value many things , and no they are not reducible to valuing happiness or valuing reproductive fitness .
There is no safe wish smaller than an entire human morality .
There are too many possible paths through Time .
You can't visualize all the roads that lead to the destination you give the genie .
" Maximizing the distance between your mother and the center of the building " can be done even more effectively by detonating a nuclear weapon .
Or , at higher levels of genie power , flinging her body out of the Solar System .
Or , at higher levels of genie intelligence , doing something that neither you nor I would think of , just like a chimpanzee would n't think of detonating a nuclear weapon .
You can't visualize all the paths through time , any more than you can program a chess - playing machine by hardcoding a move for every possible board position .
And real life is far more complicated than chess .
You cannot predict , in advance , which of your values will be needed to judge the path through time that the genie takes .
Especially if you wish for something longer - term or wider - range than rescuing your mother from a burning building .
I fear the Open - Source Wish Project is futile , except as an illustration of how not to think about genie problems .
The only safe genie is a genie that shares all your judgment criteria , and at that point , you can just say " I wish for you to do what I should wish for . "
Which simply runs the genie 's should function .
Indeed , it should n't be necessary to say anything .
To be a safe fulfiller of a wish , a genie must share the same values that led you to make the wish .
Otherwise the genie may not choose a path through time which leads to the destination you had in mind , or it may fail to exclude horrible side effects that would lead you to not even consider a plan in the first place .
Wishes are leaky generalizations , derived from the huge but finite structure that is your entire morality ; only by including this entire structure can you plug all the leaks .
With a safe genie , wishing is superfluous .
Just run the genie .
1. Addictive Qualities of Popular Drugs
In 1994 , for an article in the New York Times , Dr. Jack E. Henningfield of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Dr. Neal L. Benowitz of the University of California at San Francisco ranked six substances based on five problem areas .
Withdrawal : Presence and severity of characteristic withdrawal symptoms .
Reinforcement : A measure of the substance 's ability , in human and animal tests , to get users
to take it again and again , and in preference to other substances .
Tolerance :
How much of the substance is needed to satisfy increasing cravings for it , and the level of stable need that is eventually reached .
Dependence :
How difficult it is for the user to quit , the relapse rate , the percentage of people who eventually become dependent , the rating users give their own need for the substance
and the degree to which the substance will be used in the face of evidence that it causes harm .
Intoxication : Though not usually counted as a measure of addiction in itself , the level of intoxication is associated with addiction and increases the personal and social damage a substance may do .

2. General Criteria for Drug Dependence , Including Nicotine Dependence " The 1988 Surgeon General ’s report lists the following general ' criteria for drug dependence , ' including nicotine dependence ( USDHHS 1988 , p. 7 ) : " Primary Criteria
" • Highly controlled or compulsive use
" • Psychoactive effects
" • Drug - reinforced behavior " Additional Criteria
" • Addictive behavior , often involves :
" – stereotypic patterns of use
" – use despite harmful effects
" – relapse following abstinence
" – recurrent drug cravings
" • Dependence - producing drugs often produce :
" – tolerance
" – physical dependence
" – pleasant ( euphoriant ) effects " These criteria are consistent with those for a diagnosis of dependence provided in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th ed. ( DSM - IV ) ( American Psychiatric Association [ APA ] 2000 ) and the International Classification of Diseases , Tenth Revision ( ICD - 10 ) ( Table 4.1 ) ( World Health Organization [ WHO ] 1992 ) .
The diagnosis of dependence using these diagnostic systems depends on the person experiencing a specific number of these symptoms .
The relevance of some of these symptoms to nicotine addiction may be questionable because the DSM criteria are used across different drugs of abuse .
For example , one symptom of addiction is that a great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance or recover from its effect .
This criterion may not be as relevant to the diagnosis of nicotine addiction compared with other abused substances . "

3. Addictive Potential Of Various Drugs Including Marijuana , Heroin , Amphetamines , LSD " Of the people who sample a particular substance , what portion will become physiologically or psychologically dependent on the drug for some period of time ?
Heroin and methamphetamine are the most addictive by this measure .
Cocaine , pentobarbital ( a fast - acting sedative ) , nicotine and alcohol are next , followed by marijuana and possibly caffeine .
Some hallucinogens — notably LSD , mescaline and psilocybin — have little or no potential for creating dependence . "

4. Risk of Heroin Dependence After Onset of Use " When observed within approximately 1 to 12 months after heroin onset , an estimated 23 % to 38 % of new heroin users have become dependent on heroin .
Rank - order correlation and post hoc exploratory analyses prompt a hypothesis of recently increased odds of becoming dependent on heroin .
" Seeking estimates for comparison , we found 3 published studies on how often heroin dependence was found among people who have used heroin at least once in their lifetime .
The National Comorbidity Survey ( 1990 - 1992 ) estimate was 23 % dependence rate ( with a standard error [ SE ] of 5 % ) ; National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ( 2001 - 2002 ) estimate ( SE ) was 28 % ( 4 % ) ; and National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions - III ( 2012-2013 ) estimate ( SE ) was 25 % ( 2 % ) .4,6
These 3 values yield a random - effects meta- analysis summary of 26 % , with a 95 % CI of 22 % to 29 % , which clearly overlaps this study ’s overall finding of 23 % to 38 % of all participants becoming heroin dependent soon after first heroin use . "

5. Probability of Transition From First Use to Dependence For Various Substances
" In a large , nationally representative sample of US adults , the cumulative probability of transition to dependence was highest for nicotine users , followed by cocaine users , alcohol users and , lastly , cannabis users .
The transition to cannabis or cocaine dependence occurred faster than the transition to nicotine or alcohol dependence .
Furthermore , there were important variations in the probability of becoming dependent across the different racial - ethnic groups .
Most predictors of transition were common across substances .
" Consistent with previous estimates from the National Comorbidity Survey ( Wagner and Anthony , 2002a ) , the cumulative probability of transition from use to dependence a decade after use onset was 14.8 % among cocaine users , 11.0 % among alcohol users , and 5.9 % among cannabis users .
This probability was 15.6 % among nicotine users .
Furthermore , lifetime cumulative probability estimates indicated that 67.5 % of nicotine users , 22.7 % of alcohol users , 20.9 % of cocaine users , and 8.9 % of cannabis users would become dependent at some time in their life . "

6. Estimated Prevalence of Substance Use Dependence or Addiction in the US by Race / Ethnicity , According to NSDUH " In 2015 , approximately 20.8 million people aged 12 or older had an SUD in the past year , including 15.7 million people who had an alcohol use disorder and 7.7 million people who had an illicit drug use disorder ( Figure 27 ) .
An estimated 2.7 million people aged 12 or older had both an alcohol use disorder and an illicit drug use disorder in the past year ( Figure 28 ) .
Thus , among people aged 12 or older in 2015 who had an SUD in the past year , nearly 3 out of 4 had an alcohol use disorder , and about 1 out of 3 had an illicit drug use disorder .
About 1 in 8 people aged 12 or older who had SUDs in the past year had both an alcohol use disorder and an illicit drug use disorder .
" Of the 7.7 million people aged 12 or older who had a past year SUD related to their use of illicit drugs , 4.0 million had a past year disorder related to their use of marijuana , and 2.0 million people had a disorder related to their misuse of prescription pain relievers ( Figure 27 ) .
Smaller numbers of people in 2015 had disorders in the past year related to their use of cocaine or heroin .
" The 20.8 million people who had SUDs in 2015 ( Figure 27 ) represent 7.8 percent of people aged 12 or older ( Figure 29 ) .
This percentage of people in 2015 who had SUDs corresponds to about 1 in 13 people aged 12 or older .
An estimated 1.2 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 had SUDs in 2015 , which represents 5.0 percent of adolescents , or about 1 in 20 adolescents .
In 2015 , 5.3 million young adults aged 18 to 25 had SUDs ; this number of young adults with SUDs represents 15.3 percent of young adults , or about 1 in 7 young adults .
An estimated 14.2 million adults aged 26 or older in 2015 had SUDs , which represents 6.9 percent of adults aged 26 or older , or about 1 in 15 adults in this age group . "

7. Alternative Analysis of the Relative Risk from MDMA Use " Nutt et al. ( 2007 ) attempted to compare the relative dangers of the main types of psychosocial drug , using a series of subjective rating scales .
Heroin and cocaine were graded as the two most harmful drugs , whereas Ecstasy / MDMA emerged as one of the least harmful ( 18th out of 20 ) .
Unfortunately , it was unclear how this low harm rating score for Ecstasy / MDMA was given , as they cited no empirical research studies or reviews .
Instead , Nutt et al. ( 2007 ) suggested that : ‘ for drugs which have only recently become popular e.g .
Ecstasy or MDMA , the longer term health and social consequences can only be estimated from animal toxicology at present ’ .
Nutt et al. ( 2007 ) noted that the most pleasurable drugs tended to be the most problematic , and on the ‘ intensity of pleasure ’ scale , heroin and cocaine were given maximum scores of 3.0 .
In contrast , Ecstasy / MDMA was given an ‘ intensity of pleasure ’ score of 1.5 , which was lower than cigarette smoking at 2.2 .
It is unclear why Ecstasy was rated as less pleasurable than smoking a cigarette , although the low pleasure score contributed to its low harm score .
" Another question concerned drug injections , with Nutt et al. ( 2007 ) noting that ‘ The potential for intravenous use is taken into account in the Misuse of Drugs classification and was treated as a separate parameter in our exercise ’ .
Cocaine and heroin were given maximum scores of 3.0 , whereas Ecstasy / MDMA was given a score of 0 .
Again , this did not accord with the empirical literature .
In their survey of 329 recreational Ecstasy / MDMA users , Topp et al. ( 1999 ) reported that 54 ( 16 % ) had injected Ecstasy .
MDMA injecting may be atypical and only occurs amongst the more experienced Ecstasy users , although this pattern would also describe cocaine .
Most cocaine users never inject , and it is only found with experienced users .
Hence , the injection score for MDMA should be similar to that for cocaine .
Many of the other Ecstasy harm values in Nutt et al. ( 2007 ) were surprisingly low .
With revised values based on the empirical literature , MDMA rises to the fifth most harmful drug ( Parrott , 2009 b ) . "

8. Ranking of Substances by Potential for Harm " Method : Members of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs , including two invited specialists , met in a 1 - day interactive workshop to score 20 drugs on 16 criteria : nine related to the harms that a drug produces in the individual and seven to the harms to others .
Drugs were scored out of 100 points , and the criteria were weighted to indicate their relative importance . "
" Findings : MCDA [ multicriteria decision analysis ] modelling showed that heroin , crack cocaine , and methamphetamine were the most harmful drugs to individuals ( part scores 34 , 37 , and 32 , respectively ) , whereas alcohol , heroin , and crack cocaine were the most harmful to others ( 46 , 21 , and 17 , respectively ) .
Overall , alcohol was the most harmful drug ( overall harm score 72 ) , with heroin ( 55 ) and crack cocaine ( 54 ) in second and third places . "

9. Estimated Prevalence of Cannabis Dependence " Some 4.3 percent of Americans have been dependent on marijuana , as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th Edition , Text Revision ( DSM - IV - TR ; American Psychiatric Association , 2000 ) , at some time in their lives .
Marijuana produces dependence less readily than most other illicit drugs .
Some 9 percent of those who try marijuana develop dependence compared to , for example , 15 percent of people who try cocaine and 24 percent of those who try heroin .
However , because so many people use marijuana , cannabis dependence is twice as prevalent as dependence on any other illicit psychoactive substance ( cocaine , 1.8 percent ; heroin , 0.7 percent ; Anthony and Helzer , 1991 ; Anthony , Warner , and Kessler , 1994 ) . "

10 . Admissions to Treatment for Marijuana in the US According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service 's Treatment Episode Data Set , in 2015 in the US there were 213,001 admissions to treatment with marijuana reported as the primary substance of abuse out of the total 1,537,025 admissions to treatment in the US for those aged 12 and older for all substances that year .
This is the lowest number of marijuana admissions and total treatment admissions in at least a decade : marijuana admissions peaked in 2009 at 373,338 , and total admissions peaked in 2008 at 2,074,974 .

11 . Difficulties in Assessing " Problem " Marijuana Use " The issues of measurement and conceptualization described above in relation to efforts to screen for problematic or harmful cannabis use highlight the shortcomings of ‘ one - size - fits - all ’ approaches to screening .
Our examination of the existing literature and of cannabis users from a general population study and from a mixed - methods study of adult , stable , socially integrated users suggests that many cannabis users who may otherwise meet the criteria for being at moderate risk for problematic use are nonetheless able to successfully integrate cannabis use into everyday life with few associated problems .
Indeed , our findings advocate that regular use of small amounts of cannabis does not appear to increase an individual ’s likelihood of experiencing problems , and it does not threaten one ’s ability to function well and perform expected roles .
Even so , the tools used to assess potentially harmful cannabis use invariably serve to classify almost all ‘ regular ’ users as problematic users . "

UCR ’s Researchers Discover New Way to Store Information Via DNA
Technique may make it less expensive for industry to identify counterfeit merchandise
NEWS MEDIA CONTACT
RIVERSIDE , Calif . ( www.ucr.edu) —
Researchers at UC Riverside have found a way to get into your body and your bloodstream .
No , they ’re not spiritual gurus or B - movie mad scientists .
Nathaniel G. Portney , Yonghui Wu , Stefano Lonardi , and Mihri Ozkan from UCR ’s departments of Bioengineering , Computer Science and Engineering , Biochemistry , and Electrical Engineering , and the Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering , are just talented when it comes to manipulating DNA .
In their paper , “ Length - based Encoding of Binary Data in DNA , ” which was published by the American Chemical Society last month , the researchers discovered a system to encode digital information within DNA .
This method relies on the length of the fragments obtained by the partial restriction digest rather than the actual content of the nucleotide sequence .
As a result , the technology eliminates the need to use expensive sequencing machinery .
Why is this discovery important ?
The human genome consists of the equivalent of approximately 750 megabytes of data — a significant amount of storage space .
However , only about three percent of DNA goes into composing the more than 22,000 genes that make us what we are .
The remaining 97 percent leaves plenty of room to encode information in a genome , allowing the information to be preserved and replicated in perpetuity .
Given the size of the DNA fragments ( one base pair of DNA is 0.33 nanometers ) , one could store a large amount of information in a very small space .
By storing messages within DNA , organizations can “ tag ” objects to verify authenticity , as well as to inconspicuously send data to a specific destination .
“ Already there are several companies using DNA to tag objects that they certify to be original and which then can be very difficult to counterfeit , ” says Stefano Lonardi , Associate Professor of Computer Science & Engineering at UCR ’s Bourns College of Engineering .
For example , the British company , Redweb Security , has developed something called i-powder that tags DNA and another company called PSA DNA Authentication services tags sports memorabilia .
“ What we developed at UCR is a method to encode a message in DNA in a way that does not require an expensive sequencing machine , ” notes Lonardi .
“ The decoding still requires a wet lab procedure , but the experimental procedure is significantly easier . ”
The University of California , Riverside ( www.ucr.edu) is a doctoral research university , a living laboratory for groundbreaking exploration of issues critical to Inland Southern California , the state and communities around the world .
Reflecting California 's diverse culture , UCR 's enrollment has exceeded 21,000 students .
The campus opened a medical school in 2013 and has reached the heart of the Coachella Valley by way of the UCR Palm Desert Center .
The campus has an annual statewide economic impact of more than $ 1 billion .
A broadcast studio with fiber cable to the AT&T Hollywood hub is available for live or taped interviews .
UCR also has ISDN for radio interviews .

If you 're a child of the 80's or even a child of the 90's and you love video games , then there 's surely no doubt that you would believe that the Nintendo Entertainment System defines the word " classic " .
So many great games that system has given us .
There were classic games that launched popular series ' like " Super Mario Bros . " and " Legend of Zelda " .
There were also some games that were really short and simple but still awesome and fun to play like " Duck Tales " and " Adventures in the Magic Kingdom " .
There were even some arcade classics like " Balloon Fight " and " Pac Man " .
Believe it or not , there were actually some games on this system that were extremely hard .
The following is a list of the Top 10 games on the NES that I believe are the hardest games in the NES library .
Now , before you say stuff like " I liked that game !
Why are you distin it ? " , please keep in mind that I 'm not saying that these are all bad games , and I 'm not necessarily saying that they 're all good games ; I 'm just saying that they 're really really hard .
Okay , enough with the yakkin ' , and let 's begin the countdown .
" Top Gun " ranks as one of the most memorable games on the NES since it 's often referred to as one of the first flight simulation games .
It 's based off of a corny 80's movie .
There are only four missions that you play in this game , so you may assume that it 's pretty easy .
But no , it 's not that easy .
At the end of Mission # 1 , you have to land on an aircraft carrier , and landing on that ship is close to impossible .
The radar tells you what direction you should move in and weather you should speed up or slow down .
But when it says " Up! Up ! " , you 'd assume you 'd have to press up , but it 's as realistic as actually flying a plane , so you really have to hit down ( and visa versa ) .
An NES Advantage controller is necessary for this game .
The same rule applies for another part of this game .
In Mission # 2 , there 's a part where your fuel starts to run out , and a refueling plane comes by to refuel you .
This is the hardest part of the game !
Your accuaracy has to be just as perfect to get locked in with the nozzle .
If you do n't lock in in time , the refueling plane will just go away and leave you out to die , and within minutes , you 're done for .
One of the earliest Simpsons games and also one of the most classic .
What makes this game so hard is the god -awful controls .
The button you have to hold down in order to run is the same as the jump button .
It 's impossible to make a running jump in this game .
Would n't it make more sense to have the other button be the run button ?
Imagine if it was like that in " Mario " or any other games that ripped that off .
What also makes this game hard are the ridiculous missions of each level .
Should n't Bart be taking out the aliens ?
Instead , he 's making purple things not purple and collecting hats .
The bosses are n't too hard , but the levels themselves require a lot of ingenuity .
The very first video game based off of the Ninja Turtles franchise is hard as hell .
I think it 's a cool game since you can alternate which turtle you can play as during game play .
There are n't a lot of memorable characters from the show in this game , but it 's still fun to take them out .
It 's manditory to keep Donatello safe in this game ; he has the best weapon !
This game is so hard to get around because the enemies keep regenerating , and there are tasks you have to do that are so hard to pull off .
You gotta have a lot of patience in order to play this game .
Let me warn you , this is a long game , so make sure you got a lot of time on your hands before you pick up this game and start playing it .
One more thing : Ignore what the Angry Nintendo Nerd says ; this game is awesome !
Okay , a former mascot of Domino 's Pizza gets his own game on Nintendo shortly after he was banned from the world , and the company that made this game happens to be Capcom , so it can't be that bad .
Well , it is .
What makes this game so hard ?
It 's mostly the fact that you have minimum energy in this game .
That 's right ; just one hit and you 're dead , so expect to die often in this game !
There were tons of games like that on the NES , and those games always frustrated me !
What 's even worse is that there are no check points in this game .
When you die , you gotta start the whole level over .
The pizza eating contests at the end of every other level require some strategy .
The only way to win is to either reach a certain goal on your meter or if your opponent runs out of cards .
If you lose a contest , you gotta start the whole level over again !
This game is so hard that not even the Game Genie could help you too much , especially since the Infinite Lives code takes up two of the three spaces .
The least they could have done was given you a health bar !
This is a really frustrating game .
I mean , really .
Every kid who has seen the movie , " The Karate Kid " , loved it , and had an NES bought this game .
But this game is so frustratingly hard that it has haunted people for years to come .
There are only four levels in the whole game , but they are all extremely hard .
The bonus levels are just as hard if not impossibly difficult .
The control is so awkward because you press up on the D - pad to jump ( like in a fighting game ) , and you can only jump straight up .
There 's also so many bullies in every level that attack you and blow you back .
In addition , there are pits everywhere .
It 's really not worth it to try to beat this game , because the ending is not worth the effort .
I 'd tell you about the ending , but if you 've already seen the Angry Nintendo Nerd 's review of it , you probably already know about it .
If you 're a fan of the " Double Dragon " games , you should know that the third game of the trilogy is undeniably the hardest .
Not only is it the hardest of the " Double Dragon " trilogy , but it 's also one of the hardest games ever to be released on the NES .
Enemies keep ganging up on you , it 's hard to pull off some of the moves , your energy drains faster in this game , and on top of all that , you only have one life in this entire game .
Playing in 2 - Player mode is your only chance of survival .
Along the way , you get new players added onto your team , but they have different skills and are somewhat useless .
The only thing I find entertaining about this game is that the dialogue has tons of typos .
In conclusion , if you own this game and still have a lot of trouble beating it , I could give you some advice : Check YouTube ; there are plenty of useful videos on how to develop a strategy on " Double Dragon 3 " .
I 've always praised the " Mega Man " games , especially the classic games on the NES .
They 're all pretty challenging games , but the first game that started the series is the hardest of them all .
If you 've played some of the sequels but not the first game , consider yourself lucky , because you have no idea how hard this game is .
I mean , this game 's not as long as the other games in the " Mega Man " series , but the difficulty out does the others .
You do n't get any passwords in this game like in the others , so there 's no way to save your progress .
Also , there are no energy tanks , so you have no way of refilling your energy unless you pick up energy pellets , and good luck finding those , because the items look way different in this game as well .
This is n't a bad game , but the sequels are far more superior .
On a definite plus side , this is the game that started the series , and it has a lot of memorable characters , some of which are very important to the Mega Man franchise .
Yeah , some of you probably saw this one coming .
" Ghosts n Goblins " has gone down in history as one of the hardest games in the 8 - bit era .
You only have two hits in this entire game ( some health bar , huh ? ) .
The game is filled with enemies coming after you .
There is n't even room for you to breathe !
Literally !
Even if you 're an experienced gamer , you 'll have a really hard time beating this game .
And you think that 's not bad enough ?
Once you 've beaten what appears to be the final level , you gotta start the whole game all over again !
Yes , this is a game that has been haunting gamers for years and years !
Yep , you probably assumed this one would make my list too .
" Battletoads " is undeniably one of the hardest games I have ever played in my entire life .
With twelve levels , a bunch of stuff coming after you , and a bunch of moves that are hard to manuver especially with all this deadly stuff that 's impossible to dodge , this is definately one of the hardest games ever made .
Even if you play 2 - player mode and with the Game Genie , it wo n't be too much help .
I 'm sure there are plenty of people out there who have played this game since it was a hit game , and I 'm sure that all of those people remember how hard it was .
You know how much I suck at this game ?
Heck , there are twelve levels , and I can't even get passed the third level !
Most games on the Nintendo are n't that hard , but there are some that are .
Adding some challenge to a game is one thing , but the creators of this game went way too far !
I swear to God , unless someone can help me beat this game , I will never play it again !
This is the queen mother of all hard games !
To quote the Angry Video Game Nerd , the difficulty on this game is legendary !
What makes this game so hard ?
Well , there are always multiple enemies on the screen at one time , and they 're always coming after you .
You constantly have to be shooting in this game .
The enemies all have tons of hit points .
Does n't sound too hard , huh ?
Well , try this !
You have only one hit point in this entire game !
One touch , and you 're dead .
It 's not like in " Contra " where you restart right where you die ; in this game , when you die , you gotta start the whole level over !
Challenging , but still not too bad ?
Well , guess what ?
You 're also not allowed to touch any walls !
That 's right .
If you touch any walls , ceilings , grounds or anything in this game , you die .
You 're basically not allowed to touch ANYTHING in this game !
The game also does n't make it clear on what you 're allowed to touch and what you 're not allowed to touch .
Unless you 've played this game , you have no idea how hard it is !
If you know Silver Surfer but have n't played this game , believe me , this game is an insult to Silver Surfer .
Words can not describe how hard this game is !
From what I understand , there is not a single person in the world who beat this game , so the difficulty is indeed legendary !
Well , there you have it .
Those are my thoughts on the Top 10 hardest games on the NES .
I know I 've said this numerous times in previous articles of mine , but I 'll say it again .
This is all my opinion .
All the games that have made my list are all based on my gaming experience and through reviews I 've read or watched on the Internet .
Yeah , I downloaded those games just to see if they really were that hard , and yes they are !
I 'm sure that a lot of you will probably wonder why I left out games like " Ninja Gaiden " or " Adventure Island " , and that 's probably because I either have n't played those games or forgot all about them .

Cancer and the HIV virus may resist vaccines by dressing infected cells in the protein trappings of sperm , tricking bodies into thinking they 're harmless .
The phenomenon , described today by researchers from the University of Missouri and Imperial College of London in the Journal of Biological Chemistry , could help explain why billions of dollars and decades of research have yet to produce a working vaccine against HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , or most forms of cancer .
When sperm are manufactured , their glycoproteins
\– compounds ubiquitous in cellular function – are tagged with chains of carbohydrates known as Lewis sequences .
Human immune systems are generally friendly towards these sequences ; they 're probably what allow sperm to be accepted by female immune systems .
Unfortunately for us , HIV tells cells to produce Lewis sequence - tagged glycoproteins .
The same thing happens in some especially aggressive cancers .
Other invaders with Lewis sequences are schistosomes , a type of parasitic worm , and H. pylori , a common stomach bacteria .
All are largely ignored by human immune systems .
“ It ’s our major Achilles heel , ” said University of Missouri obstetrics professor and study co-author Gary Clark in a statement .
" Reproduction is required for the survival of our species .
Therefore we are
‘ hard - wired ’ to protect our sperm and eggs as well as our unborn babies from any type of immune response .
Unfortunately , our results suggest that many pathogens and tumor cells also have integrated themselves into this protective system , thus enabling them to resist the human immune response . ”
Clark and his colleagues next plan to how HIV and cancer write the

Do n't carry RFID ?
You might be surprised ; the short - range ID technology is currently found in everything from US passports to swipeless credit cards to public transit passes to World Cup tickets to car keys to the building access pass for your office building .
A few of the digerati even elect to have RFID implants from VeriChip slipped beneath their skin in order to use them as cashless payment systems .
Much of the information on these chips can be read without exotic equipment , assuming an attacker can get within several feet with a concealed RFID reader .
Unfortunately , most tags give users no control over when they respond to queries , and they offer no notification , which means that sensitive data could be at risk in public places .
Melanie Rieback
The solution , for those concerned about such things , has so far been low - tech : smashing the chip with a hammer appears to be the preferred method for passports , but it is technically illegal and could lead to unpleasantness at customs .
A new tool from a graduate student at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam offers the first real - time cloak of protection to users concerned about security , and no hammer blows are required .
The RFID Guardian is essentially a firewall that can prevent or allow RFID queries , and can do so on a per-tag basis .
Melanie Rieback , the Guardian 's designer , describes it as a portable , battery - powered device for personal RFID privacy — but even if you are n't concerned about men in dark sunglasses snatching your passport data , the selective jamming tech in this diminutive device is fascinating stuff .
I had a chance to sit down with Rieback during her recent trip to the United States , and she explained how the device works , what 's coming in version 3.0 , and why she has no plans to profit from the technology .
" I 'm definitely not anti-RFID , " she explains .
" I think there 's a lot of great things you can do with it , but I just think that like any other technology , they need to take security and privacy into consideration . "
Here 's how the RFID Guardian gives that power to the people .
And I need this ... why ?
RFID got its start as an antitheft tool that soon became important for inventory management .
Using RFID chips , it was suddenly simple for shippers to know how many pallets were in a trailer , and retailers could see how many razors were on a store shelf without keeping employees all night to do inventory .
RFID received a massive boost when Wal - Mart required RFID tags to be used by all of its suppliers .
Because such commercial deployments emphasize cost over security , most tags still have no access controls , so grabbing a tag 's information is relatively simple .
Some specialized tags do employ basic cryptography , but this is not always robust .
When researchers looked into the encryption found in the ExxonMobil SpeedPass , for instance , the algorithm turned out to use a 40 - bit key and was cracked easily by a brute force attack .
Tags with stronger cryptography tend to be prohibitively expensive , and thus are not often used .
As the tags showed up in increasingly sensitive applications , security became more of a concern — at least to researchers and privacy advocates .
Rieback was one of those people .
As a graduate student searching for a Ph.D. dissertation topic , she spent eight months reading computer science research papers and discovered that the number of published works on RFID security could be counted on both hands .
" It became painfully obvious that there was a deficiency in the area of RFID , and there is so much work to be done , " she says .
So Rieback turned herself into one of the foremost academic authorities on RFID security and went on to develop the first RFID virus as a proof of concept .
That got the industry 's attention .
As Rieback tactfully puts it , there was a " mixed reaction " that even included some personal attacks .
But other companies approached her team for consulting assistance within days of publishing the paper .
After doing her part to publicize these security shortcomings of many RFID implementations , Rieback moved on to the RFID Guardian project , which would give people a measure of control over their tags .
It became her Ph.D. project , and when she finalizes the next version in the next eight months or so , she should earn her doctorate .
Even when that happens , though , she has no plans to drop the project .
" I think this is important enough that we should finish it , " she says .
" We should get it out there . "
Eventual plans call for the Guardian to be incorporated into cell phones and PDAs , but the current model is a pocket - sized device that runs on its own battery and provides a circular 1 m field of control over RFID tags , jamming any tags that the user does not want read .
It sounds simple , but the technology behind it is surprisingly complex — complex enough that the current model uses what Rieback refers to as a " beast " of a CPU , an Intel XScale PXA270 .
Here 's what all that power is for .
Maybe life is nt a one - way street .
. . .
In their final moments together , as Hannah was about to convert , she treated Felix to a new sort of vista .
They were on a beach ; that much was familiar .
But the surrounding flora and fauna looked completely alien : towering cylindrical trees , sprouting leaves from only the very tops ; other trees bearing spherical objects ( fruits ? nuts ? ) with colors Felix had never seen in nature ; flying animals with ridiculous feather patterns and strange , pointed beaks .
Hannah , who usually chose familiar scenes from their distant past except for that one abstract period 1080 years before was clearly starting to lose her volition .
" Why this ? "
Felix asked her as they walked side by side in the warm , white sand .
" And why this colorful skirt ? "
He almost mentioned the alien flowers around her neck , but didnt want to bombard her with too many questions at this difficult moment .
Hannah visibly struggled to respond .
" I can think of some plausible reasons , " she said .
" But given whats about to happen , they re probably just rationalizations .
What does it look like to you ? "
She opened up a bit of her soul a rare , but not unprecedented event and Felix examined her as closely as he dared .
" I think you re right , " he said , staring into her as if he could memorize her nature , as if he could keep the parts he loved , to fend off the impending loneliness .
" Future conditioning , I suppose . "
She closed up to him , for the last time , and they resumed their walk toward the surf .
" I dont want to end , " Hannah confessed .
" I almost envy you . "
" What s to envy ?
Ill be alone . "
Hannah shrugged .
" At least youll be . "
Felix didnt know how Hannah could see any comfort in what he would have to endure .
His fate was set by the laws of physics , without hope of reprieve .
He would live out his remaining time alone , and then he would end , a cause without an effect .
And with this hopelessness on top of losing Hannah .
. . .
Felix finalized his decision .
" Im going to change , once you re gone .
Ive fashioned a block .
To stop me from thinking about what happens after I end . "
She smiled her most sorrowful smile , and Felix couldnt believe that any future conditioning could be affecting that .
" The last man in the universe , and he wont consider the future . "
" I dont want to endure it .
And I dont see what harm  "
" Well , I m considering the future .
What s the time - reverse of a broken heart ? "
" After you convert , youll see one right in front of you . "
The waves lapped their bare feet for a timeless moment , but a dead calm soon fell over the ocean and even the tiniest ripples vanished .
" I think its about to happen . "
Hannah lowered her head to watch her feet sink into the damp sand , air bubbles popping up around them .
Then she looked up at Felix .
" To think of all that time we forwarded , not knowing how little we had left .
And now I m left with no time to even remember this . . . "
" Ill remember it for  "
Felix broke off , realizing it had already happened .
Around him , nothing had changed .
Hannahs beach was still intact , and Hannah herself had barely moved .
But that was expected indeed , required .
This may have been Hannahs causal end of the universe , but the physical laws of conservation demanded a momentary convergence between the Hannah from the past and the stranger from the future .
Already changes were becoming apparent to Felix , already the histories were diverging .
It was more than just the jerky and unnatural motions from this woman in front of him .
It was the way she looked at him .
No longer could he see the love they had forged over nearly half the duration of the universe .
But he didnt see the look of a complete stranger , either .
In fact , Felix imagined that she looked eagerly expectant .
But expectant for what ?
This stranger was nearing the end of her causal existence , too .
A few moments into her subjective future a few moments into Felixs past this womans consciousness would cease as she merged with Hannah .
All of her memories would lose their context , all of her history would be sequestered in an unknown future .
In a very real sense , this womans universe was about to end .
The woman awkwardly grabbed his hands .
" Aloha , " she intoned , some word in a language he did not know .
Then she let go , backed away , and kept walking backward down the beach .
It was over , and Hannah was gone .
He didnt feel anything yet it still didnt seem real .
Not with Hannahs double smiling at him from the distance .
Smiling ?
Surely this woman couldnt be expecting some version of an afterlife .
Anyone who had survived to the temporal midpoint of the universe had to know that their time was quite literally up , had to know that cosmological boundary conditions imposed the same time - symmetries on the universe that were found in the laws of physics .
The artificial atoms that comprised her computational structure would survive , but the causal chain of her life was about to terminate .
Felix quickly turned and left the beach , flashing back to his most comfortable base - state .
In a moment he found himself resting on familiar mosslands , directly between the double shadows of his ancestral mountain peak .
And it was only then that he realized the woman might not even know what was in store for her .
By now Felix knew his own fate , without question .
His friends and acquaintances had converted , one by one , and now he was the last of his kind , maybe the last entropy - increasing consciousness anywhere .
But from the womans temporal perspective , she would be almost the first to convert .
Maybe she didnt know .
Maybe she didnt understand .
Maybe he should talk to her .
Felix pushed that last thought away .
Hannah was gone , and he needed to begin dealing with that fact .
Inventing excuses to interact with her double was not what he needed right now .
Interacting with any time - reversed person was difficult enough .
Felix had spoken to some of them already and had learned their primary language , backward sentence structure and all .
But he had also learned how unwieldy it could be to hold even the simplest conversation .
What do you say to someone who has already heard everything youll tell them from that point onward , but doesnt remember anything youve already said ?
What s the point in communicating , when by expressing an idea all you accomplish is to erase it from the others memory ?
Throw in the feeling of being manipulated even though the only " manipulators " were the unfeeling laws of physics and Felix had long ago sworn off any more mixed - boundary conversations .
No , there was no point .
Hannah was gone , and his destiny was meaningless .
Soon he would be no more able to affect the future than he could affect the past .
Feelings of depression and loss were already closing in when he remembered that he had never activated his block .
In a moment it was done .
And he did feel better , in some ways , though the emptiness in his heart now seemed even more pronounced .
Felix still knew his time was limited , but with Hannah gone that almost seemed like a good thing .
But how much time did he have remaining ?
None of the other time - reversed people had been willing to tell him when he was due to convert , but today a new source of information had appeared .
He might give this Aloha woman a chance to tell him .
. . .
Soon , Felix told himself .
First he needed time to mourn .
He approached the woman on her simulated beach .
The vista had changed somewhat from his previous visit the waves were moving offshore , for one thing but the general feel was the same .
Seeing her again was more painful than he had expected ; she still looked too much like Hannah .
Her eyes searched his face , as if examining the remnants of his love .
" I dont know what to say , " he began , careful to speak backward so she could understand .
" No , I dont suppose you do , " she said dourly .
Felix blinked .
She made perfect sense , almost as if she were responding to him .
But that would be impossible .
. . .
She brightened .
" Aloha , remember ? "
Felix nodded , then stopped himself .
This woman was experiencing causality in the opposite direction ; responding to her would do no good at all .
Neither would asking her questions .
He mentally reversed the order of her last two sentences , and realized that she hadnt responded to him , but rather to her own rhetorical question .
" It s hard for me to see you like this , " Felix said .
Now she looked impatient .
" I really wish youd stop talking about those things . "
Her impatience was infectious , and Felix launched into his prepared speech .
" Look , I only have one thing to tell you , but its important that you know whats happening .
Surely some of you have observed that the universe is reversing its causal arrow .
We first noticed it ages ago , long before anyone converted . "
In fact , Felix had been one of the first to notice .
The computations that enabled their continued existence had long been powered by the only energy source left in the universe the occasional annihilation of electrons and positrons into two energetic gamma rays .
Not even stray protons were still around to supply energy ; apart from the ones they manufactured , protons had all decayed into positrons and other unstable products long ago .
The energy supply dropped with time , constantly slowing down their conscious processes while making the rest of the universe appear to speed up .
But Felix had noticed that their energy supply was falling faster than theory predicted , and soon it had become clear that the universe had thrown them one final twist .
" Im sure youve noticed that theres a missing gamma ray component .
Well , the gamma rays are converting .
Instead of being governed by their past history , they re becoming governed by a causal chain in the opposite direction , coming from the future .
Two converted gamma rays against all respectable odds will just happen to collide to produce an electron - positron pair .
It doesnt happen everywhere at once , because that would require an additional level of coincidence , but the process is inevitable .
The universe is starting to fill back up with matter , converted matter , matter with an opposite entropic arrow of time .
Next , electrons will start undecaying into antiprotons . . . "
Her look of impatience slowly vanished as he spoke , and Felix trailed off as he realized that he had just un - bored this woman with all his talking .
" Is that right ? "
Emotions flew across her face with such rapidity he could scarcely imagine what she was thinking .
" The point is , " Felix said , " you dont have much longer .
Youll convert at our next meeting . "
Now she seemed calm again .
" I thought you were going to stop coming to see me . "
Felix took a step back in surprise .
He had already decided that this was to be the last time he spoke with her .
So why would she say this ?
Unless . . . .
He took another step backward , and then another , and finally turned and ran out of her control zone .
I wont come back , he told himself , despite the fact that the universe had already determined that he would .
The funny thing about free will , Felix thought , was that it always maintained its own illusion .
Aloha ( for that was what he had named her ) had implied that they had met several times in her past in Felixs future so now he knew something about the choices he would soon make .
In a universe where free will reigned supreme , it would be a simple matter to create a paradox .
Felix merely had to choose not to see Aloha again , and the universe would be inconsistent .
He laughed out loud at the idea .
As if he were more powerful than the universe .
No , paradox - prevention had turned out to be a major underpinning of reality , the lynchpin to explaining why quantum mechanics worked the way that it did .
He couldnt force a paradox , no matter how he tried .
But neither did the universe force him , manipulating his actions like a marionette .
Physics was subtler than that , and the illusion of free will was infinitely resilient .
He knew that he would eventually come to an apparently free decision to go see Aloha .
And this was why he loathed these mixed - boundary encounters so intensely .
Because , in the back of his mind , hed always know that it wouldnt really be a unilateral decision , that it was forced upon him by future events .
And so his stubborn streak kicked in .
No free will ?
Ill see about that .
And he resolved to make the universe drag him into Alohas zone , kicking and screaming .
Never again , Felix vowed , would he go to visit her .
Instead , the universe brought Aloha to him .
Felix could have excluded her from his zone , but he was so stunned by her appearance not to mention her wounded expression that he didnt think of it until it was too late .
" What are you doing here ? " he blurted out .
At that , Alohas expression cleared , she sat down on the mossplants , and began to talk .
It was a rambling tale , as one would imagine , given that every thought logically preceded the one before .
But over the next subjective hour , Aloha still managed to paint a picture of her home planet , her fleshlife , her culture .
Despite the recurring ocean scenery , Aloha claimed that she hadnt spent much of her life on the beach .
Instead , she had lived her fleshlife in the mountains much like Hannah .
And the similarities to Hannah went well beyond that .
Both had been the first in their family to transcend , both had a rather morbid sense of humor , both were absolutely brilliant mathematicians .
There were differences , tooafter all , they had led entirely different lives on different planets .
But the coincidences did make him wonder :
How much of Hannah was still lingering inside this woman ?
If Alohas influence could reach into the past and make Hannah produce an alien beach - scene , why couldnt Hannahs influence be reaching here , into the future ?
Maybe he hadnt lost her ; not entirely .
Alohas stories ended before Felix was ready , and asking her to continue would accomplish nothing .
She got up to leave , smiling .
" Then I think its my turn , this time , " she said .
" I enjoyed that , " was all he managed , before she flashed away .
Felix stared at the spot where Aloha had just stood .
" Very well , " he muttered into the emptiness .
" Free will be damned . "
They met often .
Sometimes in his zone , sometimes in hers , but always the routine was the same .
One of them would talk , and the other would simply listen .
When it was his turn , he talked about whatever came into his head , bouncing randomly from his childhood to his final days with Hannah and everything in between .
Aloha seemed to especially enjoy it when he talked about Hannahor perhaps he just tended to bring up Hannah when Aloha looked cheerful .
By this point , Felix had effectively given up on separating cause from effect .
Aloha rarely talked about her recent history , but it was clear that she had a life partner , too .
Unlike Felix and Hannah , they werent the last of their kind , but love was love , even when time - reversed .
Felix saw no evidence of this other person , and that made it easier to imagine that whenever Aloha talked about her partner , it was really Hannahs influence reaching into the future and telling Felix how she felt about him .
Even though Aloha sometimes went for entire conversations without even hinting that this other person existed , her casual comments on that topic kept Felix coming back for more .
One day , when he went to see her , the beach was gone .
Now Alohas zone had become a mountain scene in spring , just below the snowline .
Thin white trees surrounded them on all sides , sporting small leaves that had wildly different shades of green on either side .
Aloha looked the same , apart from her warmer clothing , but somehow Felix knew that this visit was going to be different from all the rest .
Upon seeing him , she smiled sadly and shook her head .
" I guess  Aloha was appropriate , after all . "
Felix sat beside her on a fallen tree , waiting for her to say more , but today she remained thoughtfully quiet .
Still , Felix hadnt made it to the temporal midpoint of the universe without learning a great deal of patience , and he waited her out .
At last Aloha began speaking again , but this time it wasnt a story about her distant past .
Something , it seemed , had opened her emotional floodgates , and Felix sat in stunned attention .
Instead of her usual reticence to talk about her partner , the words that came pouring out were almost beyond what Felix could handle .
She spoke of her timeless feelings for a love who was no longer with her , feelings that Felix couldnt help but identify with .
" I miss him so , " she said , shaking .
She wiped her cheeks , smearing moisture onto them .
" I mean . . .
I mean . . . I miss him . "
Now she was crying , and Felix could almost see Hannah inside of her rising tears .
" I miss you . "
Felix caught his breath .
Was Hannah speaking to him directly , one last message from the past ?
He reached out to her with both arms , and after a tiny hesitation she entered into his embrace .
They clung to each other , all the while Felix knowing that this was as close as hed ever get to a final goodbye .
She disengaged from him quickly too quickly .
Felix almost felt betrayed as he looked into her moist eyes , despite the fact that they were looking back at him with real love .
" You re Hannah , you know , " he said , the words that he had been holding back finally tumbling out of him , almost beyond his control .
" I never told you , but that s why . . . that s why Ive been coming to see you .
When Hannah converted , she merged into you .
And I loved her so much I cant seem to let her go . "
Alohas eyes were now clear .
" Why are you doing this to me ? "
Her voice was weary , a side of her he had never seen .
" Just stop this . "
" you coming to see me . "
She interrupted him before he could begin his sentence .
" Next time I m going to exclude you , " she said .
" Dont come here anymore . "
But you re not going to exclude me , Felix thought .
In fact , from her time - perspective , she would soon decide to visit him regularly .
Something had changed in Aloha today . . . but what ?
Did she want him to imagine that she held a little bit of Hannah inside of herself ?
She glared at him .
" I dont want to see you . "
Whatever the reason , she no longer felt the same way .
Out of deference to her current wishes , Felix retreated from her zone .
His next visit was not from Aloha , but from a dozen of the other time - reversed people .
He had talked to some of them before , but never in a large group like this .
And of course , they wouldnt yet know about those previous conversations .
Felix met them just outside his personal zone .
They stood together in a group and eyed him as they might a dangerous animal .
" Like when were all going to die , " said the stocky , bald man who had converted from his old friend Nemo .
" Just imagine what he knows , " said another .
" I dont like where this is heading , " said the only woman in the bunch .
After more random comments of this sort , several of the others started laughing at Reverse - Nemo , who was sporting a grim face and looking down at his empty , cupped palm .
A small device materialized there , and Felix watched as Reverse - Nemo lobbed the device towards him in a perfect , parabolic arc .
Felix quickly decided not to catch it , wondering how this would look from a reverse - time perspective .
The arc would have the same shape forward or backward in time , like all the laws of physics .
But Reverse - Nemo hadnt thrown the object , he had caught it .
If the device went clattering on the ground behind him , then how would it have 
As if by reflex , Felix reached up and snagged the device out of the air .
Reflex ?
Or forces beyond his control ?
He was just starting to puzzle out what had caused the device to pass between them at all , when suddenly the device spoke .
" Say rhinoceros and give this back to me , " the device said , and Felix noticed that the others had stopped laughing .
Felix shrugged , repeated the nonsense word as best he could , then lobbed it back to Reverse - Nemos hand .
Now Reverse - Nemos grim look was replaced by open skepticism , and the device vanished just as it had appeared .
" Watch this , " said Reverse - Nemo .
" I think hes a fraud . "
Now they all started talking at once , crowding around him .
" It s not just the gamma rays .
What have I been telling you ? "
" Impossible . "
" It finally happened . "
" What s going on with you ? "
Felix wouldnt have been surprised if they had started prodding him .
They had clearly never seen him before , never interacted with a time - reversed person at all .
But Aloha hadnt treated him like this at their last meeting , which meant that theyd see each other at least one more time .
So where was she ?
He made one last check for her face in the crowd before retreating into his zone and raising a full exclusion .
His time was almost up .
Felix had suspected this before now , but the strange visit from the others confirmed it .
Next would no doubt come the rationalizations .
Forced consistency was tricky business for the universe .
With two symmetric boundary conditions on its temporal extremesone at the Big Bang and another at the Big Crunch the universe was a classic case of an overconstrained system .
While this meant that the universe lost many of its degrees of freedom , this had usually been irrelevant to Felix , changing only the microscopic details of his quantum state , not the overall picture .
But now everything was different .
Now the universe needed to control every detail , every decision he made , all in the name of paradox prevention .
And the universe determined that Felix would decide to go visit Aloha , one final time .
Felix knew it must be a rationalization .
While he could imagine some possible reasons behind the decision he didnt want to be alone , he missed Hannah , etc. deep down he knew he was being swept along by circumstances beyond his control .
Even so , the act of actually going to visit Aloha seemed perfectly natural , in accord with his usual perception of free will .
Aloha didnt exclude him somehow he had known that she wouldnt although she looked rather despondent as he approached .
I should be the one feeling despondent , Felix thought .
It s my world that s about to end .
" I dont know why were even talking , " she said , leaning toward him .
" This is ridiculous . "
" Ive been lonely .
I was hoping youd tell me another story . "
" You have no idea how hard this is . "
Felix fell quiet and sat down , hoping that shed speak to fill the silence .
Instead , she slowly began to cry .
" Somethings about to upset you , " Felix noted out loud , talking more to himself than to Aloha .
" And I dont imagine that its because I m about to walk away . "
" It s a word that means both goodbye and hello , " she said in one of her usual non-sequiturs , now crying harder than ever .
" I dont understand , Aloha , " he said , slipping up by calling her that made - up name for the first time .
" Help me understand . "
But already the tears were slowing , Aloha now looking more withdrawn than sad .
" This is , " she said .
" This is impossible . "
" I wish it was impossible . "
Felix shook his head .
" But I m afraid its all very real .
We re never going to be able to have a conversation , dont you see ?
One of us has to just talk to the other , like we did before .
And it has to be your turn .
I dont want to spend my last few moments talking .
I just want to be with you at the end . "
" Please go away .
Go away .
I cant bear to see you like this . "
But despite her words , she looked deep into his eyes .
" I feel the same way , but I still cant leave you . "
" Can you hear me ?
Are you still hiding in there , somewhere ? "
She blinked her moist eyes .
" Oh , my love . "
Felix felt a virtual pang in his virtual heart .
Love ?
In their last conversation , she said that she missed him , and now she was professing her love ?
If Hannah was talking through Aloha , her influence should be getting weaker with time , not stronger .
Something didnt add up .
What was happening here ?
The answer should be obvious , and if he couldnt see it .
. . .
His block .
Something about his block was preventing him from making the final connection .
Aloha Hannah was pleading with her eyes .
" You always were a purist , " Felix muttered , and he whisked away his block before he could change his mind .
Immediately a dozen thoughts surged to the forefront of his consciousness , clamoring for attention .
For the first time since Hannahs conversion , Felix considered his own fate .
Somewhere in the far future , he recalled , some time - reversed intelligent creature would be living on a planet orbiting a time - reversed star .
That creature would transcend just as Felix had and would help construct a computational structure remarkably similar to Felixs own .
Its subjective experience of time would slow down as energy sources became rarer and rarer , but it would survive to the temporal midpoint of the universe .
And as the two of them approached the same space - time point from opposite temporal directions , the universe was forced to make them converge .
Their lives were intertwined along the same standing quantum waves , and these final moments would only serve to make the universe free of paradox .
But that line of thinking held an important fact :
When Felix converted , he would be replaced by another .
He had considered this before , but now he had new information .
Now Felix knew exactly who he would become .
" You cant leave me alone like this , " Aloha said , almost begging .
" You cant be gone . "
It was all very clear .
Aloha was reliving Felixs earlier loss in reverse .
Felix had the most intense feeling of déjà vu he had ever experienced , and it kept getting stronger , almost as if he was a character in a pre-scripted play .
" Ive left you , " he said .
" Im so sorry . "
He forced himself to think backward , from Alohas perspective .
Shed soon terminate by converting into Hannah , reuniting their universe - spanning love after this brief off - sync interlude .
A smile began to creep across his face as the corollary of that thought sank in .
Yes , his existence was almost over .
But when he converted , hed be back together with the woman he loved .
Alohas tears had vanished , replaced by a look of pure shock .
" Are you gone , like they were warning us ? "
And that was why , Felix realized .
That was why Aloha had been happy at the end of her existence .
That was why she smiled .
She knew that theyd be reunited in a fashion .
But why did she say " Aloha , " at that final moment ?
What did it mean ?
" I dont believe it , " she said .
And then he realized that she had already answered his question .
Robust Monte Carlo Methods for Light Transport Simulation
We start by developing a rigorous theoretical basis for bidirectional light transport algorithms ( those that combine direct and adjoint techniques ) .
First , we propose a linear operator formulation that does not depend on any assumptions about the physical validity of the input scene .
We show how to obtain mathematically correct results using a variety of bidirectional techniques .
Next we derive a different formulation , such that for any physically valid input scene , the transport operators are symmetric .
This symmetry is important for both theory and implementations , and is based on a new reciprocity condition that we derive for transmissive materials .
Finally , we show how light transport can be formulated as an integral over a space of paths .
This framework allows new sampling and integration techniques to be applied , such as the Metropolis sampling algorithm .
We also use this model to investigate the limitations of unbiased Monte Carlo methods , and to show that certain kinds of paths cannot be sampled .
Our statistical contributions include a new technique called multiple importance sampling , which can greatly increase the robustness of Monte Carlo integration .
It uses more than one sampling technique to evaluate an integral , and then combines these samples in a way that is provably close to optimal .
This leads to estimators that have low variance for a broad class of integrands .
We also describe a new variance reduction technique called efficiency - optimized Russian roulette .
Finally , we link these ideas together to obtain new Monte Carlo light transport algorithms .
Bidirectional path tracing uses a family of different path sampling techniques that generate some path vertices starting from a light source , and some starting from a sensor .
We show that when these techniques are combined using multiple importance sampling , a large range of difficult lighting effects can be handled efficiently .
The algorithm is unbiased , handles arbitrary geometry and materials , and is relatively simple to implement .
The second algorithm we describe is Metropolis light transport , inspired by the Metropolis sampling method from computational physics .
Paths are generated by following a random walk through path space , such that the probability density of visiting each path is proportional to the contribution it makes to the ideal image .
The resulting algorithm is unbiased , uses little storage , handles arbitrary geometry and materials , and can be orders of magnitude more efficient than previous unbiased approaches .
It performs especially well on problems that are usually considered difficult , e.g. those involving bright indirect light , small geometric holes , or glossy surfaces .
To our knowledge , this is the first application of the Metropolis method to transport problems of any kind .

@s8ist :
1 . The argument is whether or not a data / txt only plan should be made universally available to anyone that wants it , or restricted only to deaf people .
You compared that to qualifying for a scooter for free due to a disability .
I stated that those scooters are indeed NOT free , they are covered by insurance or subsidized by medicare or the company that makes them , but someone is paying for the scooter , just maybe not the person using it .
They are also not restricted to the disabled .
A regularly - abled person is just as qualified to spend the money and buy the same scooter for the same price as it costs anyone else .
Whether the disabled person has made special arrangements with their insurance or medicare is a different deal altogether .
2 . We can agree to disagree on this one .
I think the system the amusement parks come up with is a fair and equitable one .
3 . Service animals are by definition highly trained , and that 's not only demonstrable , common sense , and pretty obvious , it 's also certifiable .
Just the fact that they are a service animal is proof that they are trained enough to behave in public settings on their own .
Your dog on the other hand , has nothing to set him / her apart from any of the other dogs on the street that may or may not be trained to any varying degree .
Your dog did not go through years of training to be docile and reliable in unpredictable situations .
Even if it did , you 've no immediately obvious way to prove it .
Here 's an analogy : Would you pick the man in the Pilot 's uniform or the guy in jeans and a t - shirt to fly the plane ?
How do you know that the jeans guy does n't fly f - 16s for a living ?
It does n't matter because he's not the Pilot for your flight , and he does n't get to fly the plane .
" Disabled people deserve equal treatment .
Not better or worse , but equal .
We should accomodate their needs if our world is inadequate "
Ok : People in wheelchairs can't get up steps , so there should be a ramp for them .
However , it should n't be only for them .
If anyone wants to use it , they should be ( and are ) allowed .
The buttons that open the doors automatically should n't have the wheelchair icon on them , they should just be automatic doors , and that 's the button that operates them .
Fully abled people can still use the handles if they choose , but the button is there if they do n't want to .
AND , mobile device companies should offer plans that are data / txt only to all users , regardless of their level of ability .
They happen to be a big benefit for deaf people , and that 's great , but they should be offered to everyone the same .
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) has approved the second phase of artificial intelligence technology that will help automate military air traffic control .
The Generalized Integrated Learning Architecture ( GILA ) system , developed by Lockheed Martin 's Advanced Technology Laboratories under a $ 22 million , 48 - month contract , is intended to help the Air Force in particular keep airspace operating safely with increased air traffic and the advent of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) and other airborne weapons .
Air operation centers use what ’s known as Airspace Control Orders to help manage airspace .
Improper or unclear orders endanger passengers , pilots and people on the ground .
Lockheed Martin ’s GILA will help create and control these orders by learning flight controllers ’ tasks -- often by using only one example , Lockheed claims .
GILA will also help Air Force planners use and retain the skills of expert operators , especially as they rotate out of the Air Force .
DARPA says the artificial intelligence software will learn by assembling knowledge from different sources - including generating knowledge by reasoning .
According to a Military & Aerospace item , such software has to combine limited observations with subject expertise , general knowledge , reasoning , and by asking what - if questions .
The integrated learner also will have explicit learning goals , keep track of what it does not know , what it needs to know , as well as track and reason about its uncertainties .
The software will attempt to figure things out , as well as tolerate errors and missing information by using whatever information or reasoning is available .
Integrated learning software must be able to manipulate many different forms of information and even trade off different types of information and reasoning , as well as interact with humans to fill in information gaps , the article said .
" Eventually [ GILA ] will outperform the novice human planner by 125 % while giving the inexperienced user an embedded , accelerated training capability , " says Lockheed .
Damn .
These Pac - Man cupcakes sure look tasty .

Does quantum computing have a future ?
On Tuesday , Canadian company D - Wave Systems demonstrated a 16 - qubit , specific - purpose quantum computer to a room packed with observers and thick with doubt and awe .
Reporters watched as the machine solved a Sudoku puzzle and a seating arrangements problem , and , most impressively , searched for molecules similar to the drug Prilosec from a database of molecules .
But the final significance of D - Wave 's demo is as uncertain as the fate of Schrödinger 's cat – opinions are all over the place , within the scientific community and without .
To cut through the fog , Wired News sought out the father of quantum computing , Oxford University theoretical physicist David Deutsch .
Spooky Computing Quantum computers hold the possibility of solving what computer science calls " NP - complete " problems , the problems that are impossible or nearly impossible to calculate on a classical computer .
Picking out a single pattern from a collection of patterns , such as your mother from a photo of people , is easy for you , but beyond the reach of your PC .
The D - Wave machine , called Orion , can't do that yet , but it 's a big step in that direction .
The trick in quantum computing is to harness the entanglement of different particles – what Einstein called the " spooky action at a distance " – that allows one particle to affect another somewhere else .
Orion does this by using rings of current flowing through superconductors .
The current can flow clockwise , counterclockwise or , significantly , both directions at once , allowing it to hold two values simultaneously due to quantum mechanical strangeness .
The machine is programmed by changing the magnetic conditions around quantum bits , or " qubits , " creating relationships between them that model the physical embodiment of the equation the programmer is trying to solve .
The results are read by detecting the direction of the current within the qubit when the calculations are complete .
But significant challenges confront D - Wave in building a useful quantum computer .
A key part of making a practical machine will be error correction – something Orion does n't do yet , and which requires many more qubits than are currently feasible .
Right now , Orion runs its calculations multiple times and determines which answer has the highest probability of being right .
Moreover , scaling up a quantum computer might cause it to lose " coherence , " i.e. the entanglement of a distant particle might fail when you introduce too many qubits .
Nobody 's certain .
Finally , engineering the whole system to be fast enough for practical use and modular enough to deploy at a customer 's site remain daunting problems , even if the laws of physics decide to play along .
Deutsch invented the idea of the quantum computer in the 1970s as a way to experimentally test the " Many Universes Theory " of quantum physics – the idea that when a particle changes , it changes into all possible forms , across multiple universes .
Deutsch is a leading proponent of the theory , so , while he was n't in attendance at the D - Wave announcement , perhaps it 's safe to say as well that he was .
Wired News pulled him away from dinner to talk about what a quantum computer really is , what it 's good for and what D - Wave 's announcement might mean for the future .
Wired News : D - Wave announced 16 qubits , and they want people to play with them , so they 're talking about having a web API where people can try to port their own applications and see how it works .
Do you think that 's a good approach to gaining some acceptability and mind share for the idea of quantum computing ?
David Deutsch : I think the field does n't need acceptability .
The idea will either be valid , or not .
The claim will either be true , or not .
I think that the normal processes of scientific criticism , peer review and just general discussion in the scientific community is going to test this idea – provided enough information is given of what this idea is .
That will be quite independent of what kind of access they provide to the public .
However , I think the idea of providing an interface such as you describe is a very good one .
I think it 's a wonderful idea ....
WN : Can you give a couple of examples of what kind of things can be done with quantum computing that either can't be done , or can't be done practically , with classical computing ?
Deutsch :
The most important application of quantum computing in the future is likely to be a computer simulation of quantum systems , because that 's an application where we know for sure that quantum systems in general cannot be efficiently simulated on a classical computer .
This is an application where the quantum computer is ideally suited .
Perhaps in the long run , as nanotechnology becomes quantum technology , that will be a very important generic application .
Another thing I should say is , that application is the only one of the major applications – apart from quantum cryptography , by the way , which is already implemented and is really in a different category – that might be amenable to a non-general purpose quantum computer .
That is to say , a special - purpose quantum computer .
WN : Can you talk a little about the importance of simulating quantum systems , and give an example ?
Deutsch : Yes .
Whenever we design a complex piece of technology we need to simulate it , either in theory by working out the equations that govern it , or as a computer simulation , by running a program on the computer whose motion mimics that of the real system .
But when we come to designing quantum systems , we 're going to have to simulate the behavior of quantum super positions , which is , in Many Universes terms , when an object is doing different things in different universes .
On a classical computer you 'd have to work out what every single one of those was , and then combine them in the end with the equations governing quantum interference .
WN : And that becomes computationally impossible ?
Deutsch :
That becomes infeasible very , very quickly , once you 've got more than three , four , five particles involved , whereas a quantum computer could mimic such a process directly by itself doing that number of computations simultaneously in different universes .
So it is naturally adapted to that kind of simulation , if we wanted to work out , let 's say , the exactly properties of a given molecule .
Some people have suggested this might be useful for designing new drugs , but we do n't know if that 's the case or not .
Although quantum processes are needed in general for atomic and molecular scale properties , not all of them ( need quantum processes ) .
An example of that is we 've been able to do a lot of biotechnology without having any quantum simulators .
WN : Do you think a quantum computer could eventually build a slightly more macro simulation , something like an immune system , in order to see how it interacts with a drug ?
Deutsch :
No , that 's not what it would be used for .
It would be used for smaller things , not things on a larger scale than a molecule , but things on a smaller scale .
Small molecules and interactions within an atom , subtle differences between different isotopes , that sort of thing .
And of course things on an even smaller scale than that .
Nuclear physics , and also artificial , atomic - sized things which will be used in nanotechnology .
Of which at the moment the only ones planned are quantum computers .
Of course quantum computer designing other quantum computers is undoubtedly going to be one of the applications .
WN : The other field I can see ... this revolutionizing is materials science .
Deutsch : Yes , yes .
Again we do n't know how revolutionary it will be , but certainly on the small scale , it will be indispensable .
WN : What would you like to see the field trying to do ?
Deutsch : I 'm probably the wrong person to ask that because my own interest in this field is not really technological .
To me quantum computation is a new and deeper and better way to understand the laws of physics , and hence understanding physical reality as a whole .
We are really only scratching the surface of what it is telling us about the nature of the laws of physics .
That 's the kind of direction that I 'm pursuing .
The pleasant thing about that is that can be done before one even makes a quantum computer .
The theoretical conclusions are already there , and we can work on them already .
It 's not that I do n't think technological applications are important , but I watch them as an eager spectator rather than participant .
WN : For your purposes , the importance of quantum computing is in the general case more than in the specific - use case .
Deutsch : Yes .
The fact that the laws of physics permit themselves to be simulated by a quantum computer is a deep fact about the nature of the universe that we will have to understand more deeply in the future .
WN : How do you think using quantum computers will change how people think about computing , and consequently the universe and nature ?
Deutsch : " How they will think about it " is the relevant phrase here .
This is a philosophical and psychological question you 're asking .
You 're not asking a question about the physics or the logic of the situation .
I think that when universal quantum computers are finally achieved technologically , and when they are routinely performing computations where there is simply more going on there than a classical computer or even the whole universe acting as a computer could possibly achieve , then people will get very impatient and bored , I think , with attempts to say that those computations do n't really happen , and that the equations of quantum mechanics are merely ways of expressing what the answer would be but not how it was obtained .
The programmers will know perfectly well how it was obtained , and they will have programmed the steps that will have obtained it .
The fact that answers are obtained from a quantum computer that could n't be obtained any other way will make people take seriously that the process that obtained them was objectively real .
Nothing more than that is needed to lead to the conclusion that there are parallel universes , because that is specifically how quantum computers work .
WN : So what prompted you to start thinking about quantum computing ?
Deutsch :
This goes back a long way before I even thought of general purpose quantum computing .
I was thinking about the relationship between computing and physics ....
This was back in the 1970s ....
It had been said , ever since the parallel universes theory had been invented by Everett in the 1950s , that there 's no experimental difference between it and the various ( theories ) , like the Copenhagen interpretation , that try to deny that all but one of the universes exist .
Although it had been taken for granted that there was no experimental difference , in fact , there is – provided the observer can be analyzed as part of the quantum system .
But you can only do that if the observer is implemented on quantum hardware , so I postulated this quantum hardware that was running an artificial intelligence program , and as a result was able to concoct an experiment which would give one output from an observer 's point of view if the parallel universes theory was true , and a different outcome if only a single universe existed .
This device that I postulated is what we would now call a quantum computer , but because I was n't particularly thinking about computers , I did n't call it that , and I did n't really start thinking about quantum computation as a process until several years later .
That lead to my suggesting the universal quantum computer and proving its properties in the mid-'80s .
WN : How many qubits ( does it take ) to make the general - purpose quantum computer useful ?
Deutsch : I think the watershed moment with quantum computer technology will be when a quantum computer – a universal quantum computer – exceeds about 100 to 200 qubits .
Now when I say qubits , I have to stress that the term qubit has n't got a very precise definition at the moment , and I 've been arguing for a long time that the physics community ought to get together and decide on some criteria for different senses for the word qubit .
What I mean here is a qubit which is capable of being in any quantum state , and is capable of undergoing any kind of entanglement with another qubit of the same technology , and all those conditions are actually necessary to make a fully fledged quantum computer .
If you relax any one of the those conditions it 's much easier to implement in physics .
For instance , if you call something a qubit but it can only be entangled with qubits of a different technology , then it 's much easier to build .
But of course a thing like that can't be made part of a computer memory .
( With ) computer memory you need lots of identical ones .
There 's also the question of error correction .
The one physical qubit is probably not enough to act as a qubit in genuine quantum computation , because of the problem of errors and decoherence .
So you need to implement quantum error correction , and quantum error correction is going to require several physical qubits for every logical qubit of the computer .
When I said you need 100 to 200 , that probably means several hundred , or perhaps 1,000 or more , physical qubits .
WN : To get an effective 100 or 200 qubits .
Deutsch : Yes , and that is what would have to count as the watershed for quantum computation , for being a distinctive new technology with its own genuine uses .
WN : That 's actually D - Wave 's stated goal as well : essentially 1,000 qubits in two years .
Do you think engineering - wise , and this is not completely within your realm , they will be able to maintain enough coherence at that level to create a practical computer .
Deutsch :
As you said that really is n't my field .
Maintaining coherence itself is n't quite enough .
They 've got to maintain coherence in the operation that I spoke of ; that is , the arbitrary superposition , the arbitrary entanglement , and so on ....
I do n't know .
The technologies I 've seen so far have got way fewer than 1,000 .
They 've got way fewer than 16 .
I always have to ask whether the claimed number of qubits are qubits that I would count as qubits by these stringent criteria , or whether it 's merely two - state systems that can in some sense act in a quantum way .
Because that 's a much more lenient criterion .
WN : I do n't have the sophistication to answer that , for D - Wave at least .
If I were to ask you to cast your mind forward , saying everything goes well , what does a world that combines ubiquitous quantum computing and classical computing look like ?
And you 've said that quantum computing would never replace classical computing .
Deutsch :
It 's not anywhere near as big a revolution as , say , the internet , or the introduction of computers in the first place .
The practical application , from a ordinary consumer 's point of view , are just quantitative .
One field that will be revolutionized is cryptography .
All , or nearly all , existing cryptographic systems will be rendered insecure , and even retrospectively insecure , in that messages sent today , if somebody keeps them , will be possible to decipher ... with a quantum computer as soon as one is built .
Most fields wo n't be revolutionized in that way .
Fortunately , the already existing technology of quantum cryptography is not only more secure than any existing classical system , but it 's invulnerable to attack by a quantum computer .
Anyone who cares sufficiently much about security ought to be instituting quantum cryptography wherever it 's technically feasible .
Apart from that , as I said , mathematical operations will become easier .
Algorithmic search is the most important one , I think .
Computers will become a little bit faster , especially in certain applications .
Simulating quantum systems will become important because quantum technology will become important generally , in the form of nanotechnology .
WN : If we have practical nanotechnology , I imagine that 's a huge change .
Deutsch : Nanotechnology has the potential of making a huge change .
But the only involvement of quantum computers is that it will make it easier to design nanotechnological devices .
Apart from that I do n't think it 's a big technological revolution .
What it is though , philosophically , is taking a quantum world view .
That is rather a revolution , but that could happen today and the only reason it has been sluggish in happening is psychological , and maybe quantum computers will help with this psychological process .
That 's a very indirect phenomenon .
WN : It does allow people to play with it , and they often get things better when they play with them .
Deutsch :
That 's true .
WN : I wanted to ask you to describe your book a bit .
Deutsch :
You 'll remember I said for me the most important thing about quantum computation is the way it shows us the deep connections between physics on the one hand and computation on the other , which were previously suspected by only a few pioneers like Rolf Landauer of IBM .
My book ( The Fabric of Reality ) is about this connection between computation and fundamental physics , between those two apparently unconnected fields ....
To me , ( that connection is ) part of a wider thing , where there are also two other strands , the theory of knowledge and the theory of evolution .
The Fabric of Reality is my attempt to say that a world view formed out of those four strands is the deepest knowledge that we currently have about the world .

Updated Pentagon officials say that a malfunctioning US spy satellite targeted for destruction has been hit by a missile - defence interceptor .
The dead spacecraft smashed into a kinetic kill vehicle , lobbed into the satellite 's path 250 km above the Pacific by a Standard missile from US cruiser Lake Erie .
According to a Pentagon release , the Lake Erie fired its specially - modified Standard SM - 3 interceptor at 0326 this morning UK time .
The kinetic warhead was much less massive than the spacecraft which hit it , so the resulting cloud of wreckage will have carried on along the satellite 's previous orbital track .
The geek - billionaire sport of tomorrow - satellite skeet
US authorities have previously estimated that the bulk of the debris would re-enter and burn up within " two orbits " after a hit .
The satellite was previously circling the Earth every 90 minutes , so this period has already passed .
Owing to the timing of the Pacific shot , the wreckage cloud will have been mostly above oceans while this was occurring .
However it will also have passed over sparsely - inhabited Canada ( once ) , and twice over Australia .
According to the Pentagon , " nearly all " the debris will be gone in " 24 - 48 " hours from the shot , and the last pieces will have re-entered after 40 days .
British expert Professor Richard Crowther of the Science and Technology Facilities Council reckons that the intercept will mean 25 per cent of the sat surviving to reach Earth ( or in this case , probably sea ) as opposed to say 50 per cent had nothing been done .
The other effect of the interception is that the bits which did survive will mostly have come down along a track of the American government 's choosing , mainly into the ocean or thinly - peopled nations closely allied to the US .
In other words , pieces are much , much less likely to be found at all - and if they are , there is a very good chance they will be recovered by friendly governments .
If no intercept had taken place , more of the spacecraft would have come down - and the pieces could have wound up anywhere between the Arctic and Antarctic .
The Pentagon is sticking to its story that the firing was motivated purely by the danger from the satellite 's frozen hydrazine manoeuvring - fuel tank , but this is widely disbelieved as many larger objects containing similar ( or greater ) quantities of toxic fuel fall from the sky every year .
The hydrazine story is just a diplomatic fiction , like the idea that Israel has no nuclear weapons .
In reality , there are two theories which might explain the US action .
Firstly , the intercept may have been a piece of muscle - flexing by the Pentagon , aimed at overawing foriegn powers and gaining domestic support for the troubled missile - defence programme - without whose hardware and knowhow the sat - shoot would have been impossible .
But if this was the thinking at the White House , the reasoning seems flawed .
Russia and China will gain diplomatic capital from this , and will find it easier to big up their own space - military capability too .
Only America is truly reliant on military / intelligence satellites ; the US has much more to lose here than its adversaries .
As for gaining domestic support and funding , the Standard SM - 3 was already much caressed on Capitol Hill .
The lame ducks of the missile defence programme are the raygun - 747 ( or Airborne Laser ) and the Ground - Based Interceptor ( GBI ) rockets , the bigger landbased version of the Standard SM - 3 .
The GBIs could have been used against the broken sky - spy ; they 're supposed to be even more capable than SM - 3 .
Success might have eased the Pentagon 's troubled path towards emplacing GBIs and accompanying radars in Eastern Europe , or at least in getting funds to build them .
But the existing GBIs are based in Alaska and California .
An intercept near either of these places would have seen much more wreckage strewn on land rather than out at sea .
This would n't really mean much danger to people - the odds of deaths or injury would still be vanishingly low - but it would seriously increase the chance of satellite pieces being found one day .
That 's why we here on the Vulture space - war desk incline to the second theory - that the US simply did n't want any of this satellite to fall into unfriendly hands .
There may have been an element of " let 's do it to see if we can " , but the whole operation seems to have been designed to keep the secrets of the failed space platform .
These secrets may have been relatively mundane - perhaps a low - power yet hi-def orbital radar .
They may have merely been embarrassing : credible reports suggest that the broken spyeye came out of a badly - run , wasteful , foolish secret programme .
Perhaps it was destroyed merely to spare the black - projects empire some blushes .
Or who knows , there may have been a truly game - changing piece of kit aboard - a working submarine tracker , some dazzling new bit of intercept gear .
Sadly - from a reporter 's viewpoint , anyway - it now seems likely to be a very long time before anyone finds out . ®
Update
At a midday Pentagon briefing ( UK time ) , US marine general James Cartwright - vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs - gave further details of the intercept to journalists .
Cartwright said that a network of US sensors had confirmed that the satellite was hit and broken up .
He said that a " fireball " and a " vapour cloud " had been observed , with spectral analysis indicating the presence of hydrazine venting , but was not yet ready to confirm that the fuel tank had been smashed .
As to debris , the general said that " a bunch of techies " would have a complete picture of what remained in orbit in 24 - 48 hours .
However , he said that a large number of re-entries had already been confirmed above the Atlantic and Pacific , and thus far " nothing larger than a football " had been detected remaining in orbit .
Cartwright was also at pains to emphasise that the intercept mission was a " one time event ... not a capability that will be coming into service . "
He said that the shot had happened purely because the satellite had been unresponsive since launch , which was a rare - almost unique - occurrence .
The general added that there are already many failsafes built into spy satellites to prevent such events , and that discussions were being held about increasing reliability still further .
Questioned on a possible wish to safeguard the satellite 's tech lying behind the shoot decision , Cartwright said the attitude regarding such kit was " if it comes down , it comes down ... that would not have been sufficient " to justify firing .
He said the Pentagon did have procedures for dealing with sensitive crashlanded sat bits , but only after their descent .
Ladies and gentlemen :
When this administration came into office in January , we initiated a major study of the Nation 's health care problems and programs .
That study has now been completed and the report , which has been already distributed to members of the press , provides the directions which this administration will move toward in the months ahead .
In indicating those directions , I will say first that I realized when the administration came in , in January , that we had a major problem with regard to health care , that the problem was primarily one of enough doctors , the quality of the doctors , enough hospital beds to take care of the massively increasing demands in this field .
The report 1 that I have received from Secretary Finch and from Dr. Egeberg indicates that the problem is much greater than I had realized .
We face a massive crisis in this area ; and unless action is taken , both administratively and legislatively , to meet that crisis within the next 2 to 3 years , we will have a breakdown in our medical care system which could have consequences affecting millions of people throughout this country .
1 The text , " A Report on the Health of the Nation 's Health Care System , " July 10 , 1969 , is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents ( vol. 5 , p. 967 ) .
I do n't think I am overstating the case .
I am simply indicating that we are aware of the problem and that we are now prepared to take the administrative and legislative action to deal with it .
Secretary Finch and Dr. Egeberg will be here to answer your questions and to further elaborate .
I simply want to say , finally , that the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , and Dr. Egeberg , in his activities as our new Assistant Secretary , once the Senate confirms him , as it will very shortly , 2 have my complete and unqualified support in this program which is now being initiated .
2 Dr . Egeberg 's nomination was confirmed on July 11 , 1969 .
his remarks , Secretary Robert H. Finch , Assistant Secretary - designate for Health and Scientific Affairs Dr. Roger O. Egeberg , and Under Secretary John G. Veneman , all of the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , held a news briefing concerning health care .
The text of the news briefing is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents ( vol. 5 , p. 964 ) .
It has been a couple of weeks since the Macworld 2008 keynote , so where the heck are all those updates that Mr. Jobs promised us ?
Namely , where 's the Apple TV update that will bring us early adopters direct movie rental capabilities ?
Not here yet , according to Apple , which announced this morning that the software was " not quite finished . "
In a release sent out this morning , the company said that it now plans to make the free software update available to current Apple TV owners " in another week or two . "
The company provided no further explanation as to what caused the delay , but we 're going to assume that Jobs ' keynote promises were just a little too optimistic .
After all , if the software was on track to begin with , it would have been made available immediately ( as iTunes 7.6 was ) instead of several weeks later .
The news was buried among more optimistic announcements that the MacBook Air was now shipping ( expect an in - depth Ars review on that soon ! ) , so Apple 's probably not trying to trumpet this one too loudly .
Considering how much Apple 's stock has tanked as of late , the company had better hope that investors do n't care about Apple 's little side " hobby . "
WASHINGTON , Jan. 30 , 2008  --
A hidden camera investigation by an animal rights group has uncovered disturbing treatment of ailing cows at a California slaughterhouse that provides meat for school lunches .
The video , obtained during what the Humane Society of the United States said was a six - week undercover investigation , shows a sickly cow being dragged by a chain before being poked , prodded , rolled and lifted with a forklift .
Workers also are seen hosing the faces of cows in a manner that HSUS described as " torture , right out of a waterboarding manual . "
An HSUS official said its investigator confirmed that at least some of the animals in the video were " spent dairy cows , " allegedly sold for meat after they had grown too old and sick to produce milk , and that they were slaughtered for use in the human food supply .
HSUS says Westland Meat Company , which owns the slaughterhouse in Chino , Calif. , is the No. 2 supplier of beef to a USDA program that " distributes the beef to needy families , the elderly , and also to schools , through the National School Lunch Program . "
According to documents provided by HSUS , Westland was named a USDA " supplier of the year " for 2004 - 05 .
HSUS says the company " has delivered beef to schools in 36 states .
More than 100,000 schools and child care facilities nationwide receive meat through the lunch program . "
Such treatment of cows is generally considered abuse and is prohibited .
But slaughtering such sick cattle — known as " downers " — also is banned to protect humans from contracting mad cow disease .
The USDA considers its enforcement of the ban aggressive ; HSUS says it 's actually riddled with holes .
" Downed animals may be falling through the cracks as a result of poor oversight , anemic enforcement , and a loophole created by inconsistent agency regulations , " the group says .
Both the USDA and the meat packer responded quickly to the allegations .
The president of Westland and of Hallmark Meat Packing Co. , where the video was recorded , said today two employees were fired , and a supervisor was suspended " pending his explanation . "
" We are shocked , saddened and sickened by what we have seen today , " Westland 's president Steve Mendell said in a prepared statement posted on the company 's Web site .
" Operations have been immediately suspended until we can meet with all of our employees , and be assured these sorts of activities never again happen at our facility . "
Mendell 's plant is now under investigation by the USDA .
Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer has asked the USDA 's inspector general to look into violations at the facility , but he assured the public that the episode was not reason for public alarm .
In the interim , Schafer said he has " indefinitely suspended " Westland Meat Company from supplying meat to federal food programs , and all food from Westland that is already in the pipeline has been placed " on administrative hold . "
In a prepared statement released late today , Schafer said he's " deeply concerned " about the allegations .
But he 's also disappointed in the Humane Society .
" It is unfortunate that the Humane Society of the United States did not present this information to us when these alleged violations occurred in the fall of 2007 , " Schafer said .
" Had we known at the time the alleged violations occurred , we would have initiated our investigation sooner , and taken appropriate actions at that time . "
Humane Society officials said they did take action .
" The HSUS turned over , to appropriate California law enforcement officials , extensive videotape evidence , once the investigation was concluded , " Wayne Pacelle , president of the group , responded to Schafer 's barb .
" Local authorities asked for extra time before public release of the information . "
Pacelle also asked the USDA to go further than just suspending operations at Westland , and is calling for the plant to be " locked up and shut down . "
Westland and the USDA also may be forced to answer questions on Capitol Hill .
Rep. Rosa DeLauro , one of the most vocal critics of the nation 's food safety program in Congress , e-mailed reporters today with a threat to hold a hearing that looks into " USDA policies " that " are allowing slaughtering and processing plants to use the National School Lunch Program as a dumping ground for bad meat .

PORTLAND , Oregon – After years of being relegated to server racks and the desktops of ultrageeks , Linux is finally making some headway as a viable alternative to Windows on the consumer desktop .
That 's the optimistic message delivered by a newly energized contingent of Linux proponents .
By employing the same consumer - friendly marketing techniques practiced by Microsoft , and by taking advantage of the rising popularity of web - based applications , Linux vendors are getting ready for what they say will be a wave of consumer interest in the free operating system .
" This is the next great battle , and this is where Linux has never really been before – Linux as a consumer product , " says Gerry Carr , marketing manager of Canonical , one of many Linux distribution makers attending the ninth annual O'Reilly Open Source Convention taking place here this week .
Ten years ago , the free and open - source software community fervently hoped that Linux would rise to challenge Microsoft 's position as the de facto consumer desktop software platform .
Linux could run on a wide range of hardware , it could be configured for specialized tasks and – best of all – it cost nothing .
But the dream of Linux on every desktop has n't come to pass .
Most distributions are plagued by compatibility problems , and a fair amount of geek know - how is usually required to install Linux and get it working properly .
As a result , Linux found more traction as a server operating system , undergirding the systems that power websites , databases and other back - office applications , where it holds almost 13 percent of the market .
The perception of Linux as too difficult for ordinary users may change now that Linux vendors are making a concerted effort to make their product easier for non-geeks to install and use .
Ubuntu , a Linux package distributed by the London - based Canonical , has been vastly influential in improving the OS 's poor usability track record .
The current poster child for the new breed of consumer - friendly Linux , Ubuntu is famously easy to install .
Most users can get it running without ever having to type text commands into a shell terminal , a rarity among Linux distributions .
Other flavors of Linux , like Mandriva and Debian Etch , have also won accolades for their ease of installation .
This " easy Linux " approach is winning fans .
Ubuntu in particular is installed on 6 million to 12 million computers worldwide in more than 220 countries .
Canonical also hosts a technical support community site that has more than 13,000 registered users .
Part of this growth can be chalked up to the trend of the LiveCD , a bootable disk image that users can download and burn to a CD to test the software .
Most of the popular Linux makers release software on LiveCDs , and many also ship physical CDs to curious users anywhere in the world for free or for a nominal fee .
But what if a user does n't know what to do with a downloadable disk image ?
In an effort to better serve the nontechnical crowd , Canonical is making the Ubuntu trial experience even more seamless .
The company is developing a new application aimed at Windows users that , when launched , opens an instance of the Ubuntu desktop on top of the Windows desktop .
Users will be able to run it , try it out and , if they do n't like it , throw it away .
But if they do like it , they 'll be able to download the full OS .
" We want people to see it , feel it , actually understand it , " says Canonical 's Carr of the as - yet - unnamed app , which he says will be released soon .
While Canonical and others may be able to get Linux into users ' hands via the web , getting it onto retail shelves is proving to be a bigger challenge .
Free operating system vendors do n't have Microsoft 's deep , long - lasting relationship with PC manufacturers .
Since Windows is available as a default installation on just about every consumer PC on the market , many new computer buyers still do n't know what Linux is , let alone feel the need to download it , learn it and install it .
To change this , Linux makers have taken a cue from Microsoft and established relationships with top - tier hardware manufacturers in an effort to get the OS installed on consumer - level desktops and laptops .
In May , Dell launched a line of laptops and desktops with Ubuntu preinstalled .
The release was a hit among consumers , and the company says more are on the way .
Dell has also previously offered Japan - based Turbolinux as a preinstalled option to customers in Asia .
Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth has said more big - name hardware partnerships are in the works , though he remains tight - lipped about which manufacturers he 's talking to .
" More companies shipping machines with Linux preinstalled would be hugely successful in accelerating ( Linux's ) growth , " says Jim Zemlin , executive director of The Linux Foundation , an organization that supports Linux development through financial fellowships and public relations efforts .
A big reason for that success is the guarantee a factory - built Linux machine can give to customers : a computer that performs the way it 's supposed to .
" People do n't want to worry about that ' what if it does n't work ' scenario , " Carr says .
" They do n't want to have to pick up the phone to figure out how to get their wireless card to work . "
Another source of resistance : Potential switchers may worry about losing access to the core applications they use every day – office productivity programs in particular .
To that end , the recent rise in popularity of web - based applications has worked in Linux 's favor .
Web - based apps like Google Docs and Spreadsheets , Zoho , Gmail and Flickr fulfill core needs of most users , and since they run in the browser , they look and behave the same on every platform .
Users already hooked on web apps wo n't need to learn anything new .
" Web apps are really where it 's happening , " says the Linux Foundation 's Zemlin .
" They give you pure functionality , whether it 's the banking application that you love , or the web app that keeps track of all of your photos .
And it does n't matter which operating system you use . "
Zemlin also sees web - based applications as more than just a path to greater adoption of Linux .
Because of the hackability of free software , he explains , those who package Linux are in a unique position to improve their users ' experience out of the box .
For example , there 's a free set of scripts for Firefox called Greasemonkey that improves the performance of Google 's web apps .
By building those scripts into a default installation , Linux distributions can add a layer of polish to the platform 's basic level of usability .
These strategies are making Linux and free software more visible , but the movement still has obstacles to overcome .
Linux famously has problems with hardware support .
Wireless networking cards and graphics cards can be a hassle to get working , even in the " easy " distributions .
There are software issues as well , from support for MP3s and popular fonts , which can be solved with a little bit of trial and error , to the lack of Linux support in popular productivity applications like Adobe Photoshop .
And then there 's the big one : the conspicuous absence of the video game industry 's most popular titles .
Such shortcomings have made many users reluctant to use Linux , even among those who would love to switch if given the opportunity .
And without a large pre-existing user base , manufacturers are reluctant to put their weight behind the operating system .
" It 's a Catch - 22 , " says Jon " maddog " Hall , long - time free software programmer and executive director of Linux International , a nonprofit group that promotes the use of the OS .
You can't give users everything they want in a desktop operating system unless you have the backing of the manufacturers , he explains .
But to get manufacturers ' buy - in , you need a large enough user base to make the manufacturers ' investments worthwhile .
" Volume , " he says .
" It 's not the big thing holding Linux back , it 's the only thing . "
But according to Zemlin , the tide is turning .
Manufacturers like Dell are starting to take notice as consumers demand more options – and a vocal Linux community continues to lobby for support .
He says more device drivers for popular hardware are arriving every day , and he predicts Adobe will announce Linux support for Photoshop within the next year or two .
" The good news is that there appears to be some volume happening in the places that actually matter , " Zemlin says .

Tim Russert : ' Independent men flee from Hillary Clinton '

According to the latest NBC News / Wall Street Journal presidential poll , respondents prefer a generic Democrat over a generic Republican by some fifteen percentage points .
However , when asked specifically about Hillary Clinton vs. Rudy Giuliani , poll respondents put them in a dead heat .
Tim Russert discussed the poll with Matt Lauer on Thursday 's Today Show .
" It 's remarkable , " Russert commented .
" Independent men flee from Hillary Clinton and go to Rudy Giuliani . "
He noted that Clinton leads Giuliani by 53 % to 38 % among women , while the figures for men are almost exactly the opposite .
Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart , who conducted the survey along with a Republican partner , told NBC News that widespread disapproval of the Republican Party gives Clinton " a magnificent tailwind " but that her polarizing image and high negatives suggest she would have a real struggle in the general election .
The poll shows Barack Obama well ahead of Clinton even among Democratic voters on measures of both likeability and honesty , but Clinton comes out ahead when asked about experience and leadership .
And although Clinton has a substantial lead over Obama and Edwards among Democrats nationwide , Russert noted that all three are " in a deadlock in Iowa " and the results in that state could change everything " overnight . "

Here is what I know about Harry Potter : nothing .
I have n't read any of the books about him , nor have I seen any of the movies .
I know the novels were written by a rich middle - aged British woman named J.K.
Rowling with semi-lush hair , but I have no idea what the letters J and K represent .
I do n't know the name of the actor who portrays Harry Potter in the films , although I think he has eyeglasses .
I do n't know the names of any minor characters and I do n't know the narrative arc of the plot .
I do n't know where the stories take place or if they are set in the past or the future .
Somebody at a steakhouse recently told me that Harry Potter does n't die at the conclusion of the seventh book ( and that this detail was important ) , but I was n't even aware he was sick .
Christopher Hitchens wrote something I did n't read about this series in The New York Times , but I do n't think he mentioned Nixon .
I assume there are dragons and griffins and werewolves and homosexual Frankensteins throughout these novels , but I honestly do n't give a shit if my assumption is true or false .
In fact , if somebody told me that the final Harry Potter novel was a coded interpretation of the Koran that instructed its readers how to read my thoughts , I could only respond by saying , " Well , maybe so . "
For whatever reason , this is one phenomenon that I have missed completely ( and mostly , I suppose , on purpose ) .
Now , do not take this to mean that I dislike these books .
I do not .
I have a colleague who feels that anyone over the age of twenty - one caught reading a Harry Potter novel should be executed without trial , but that strikes me as unreasonable ; the fact that they 're written for British thirteen - year - olds probably means they 're precisely the right speed for 90 percent of American adults .
I do n't hate these novels at all -- in fact , I suspect they 're quite good .
Moreover , I find it astounding that the unifying cultural currency for modern teenagers are five - hundred - page literary works about a wizard .
We are all collectively underestimating how unusual this is .
Right now , there is no rock guitarist or film starlet as popular as J.K. Rowling .
Over time , these novels ( and whatever ideas lie within them ) will come to represent the mainstream ethos of our future popular culture .
Harry Potter will be the only triviality that most of that coming culture will unilaterally share .
And I have no interest in any of it .
And I wonder how much of a problem this is going to become .
The bookish kids reading Harry Potter novels may not go on to control the world , but they will almost certainly go on to control the mass media .
In fifteen years , they will be publishing books and directing films and writing broad jokes for unfunny situation comedies that will undoubtedly be downloaded directly into our brains .
And like all generations of artists , they will traffic in their own nostalgia .
They will use their shared knowledge and experiences as the foundation for discourse .
So I wonder : Because I do n't understand Harry Potter , am I doomed to misunderstand everything else ?
I have a female friend who has never seen any of the Star Wars movies ; if someone on The Office makes a joke about a Wookiee , she knows that it 's supposed to be funny , but it never makes her laugh .
I also know a guy from college who ( under pressure ) cannot name three Beatles songs unless you allow him to include their cover of " Twist and Shout , " and that 's only because it was used in Ferris Bueller 's Day Off .
On a practical level , those specific knowledge chasms do not hinder either of their lives ; I 'm sure some would argue they 're better off not caring about such matters .
But part of me knows that there 's an intangible downside to having complete intellectual detachment from whatever most Americans consider to be common knowledge .
It 's not just that someone who has n't seen Star Wars wo n't appreciate Kevin Smith films or that any person who does n't know about the Beatles wo n't appreciate the Apples in Stereo ; those connections are obvious ( and usually meaningless ) .
What 's less clear -- and much more important -- is the degree to which all of culture is imperceptibly defined by whichever of its entities happens to be the most popular at any given time .

Within any complex scenario , there are three basic kinds of information :
1 ) Information that you know you know .
2 ) Information that you know you do n't know .
3 ) Information that you do n't know you do n't know .
I 'd like to believe that my relationship with Harry Potter fits into that second category ; I 'd like to view the information in Rowling 's books as something I consciously realize that I do n't understand .
But this is not the case .
The phenomenon around these books is so large that I can't isolate the consequence of my unawareness .
My relationship to Harry Potter actually falls into the third category : I cannot even pretend to predict what the social impact of 325 million books will eventually embody .
As the years pass , the influence of these teenage - wizard stories will be so vast that it will become invisible .
In two decades , I will not be alienated or confused by passing references to Harry Potter ; very often , I will be unaware that any reference has even been made .
I will not know what I am missing .
I 'll just feel bored , and I wo n't know why .
Here is what I imagine the seven Harry Potter novels are about : I imagine that Harry is an orphan who had a bad relationship with his father ( kind of like Tom Cruise in Top Gun or Days of Thunder or A Few Good Men or any of his movies that did n't involve Ireland ) .
He escapes some sort of abstract slavery and decides to become a wizard , so he attends Wizard College and meets a bunch of anachronistic magic - using weirdos and perhaps a love interest that he never has sex with .
There is probably a good teacher and a bad teacher at this school and ( I 'm sure ) they eventually fight each other , and then some previously theoretical villain tries to destroy the world , and all the wizard kids have to unite and protect the universe by boiling black cats in a cauldron and throwing lightning bolts at pterodactyls .
Harry learns about life and loss and leadership , and then he does n't die .
The end .
Now , I realize I do n't have to guess at these details .
I 'm sure I could read the entire four - thousand - page plot summarized in four hundred words on Wikipedia , or I could simply walk into any high school and ask a few questions of the first kid I find who is n't smoking crystal meth .
I could just as easily buy and read the books themselves , which , as stated previously , I assume are engaging .
But I am not going to do this .
It does n't seem worth it , even though I know it probably is .
It 's an interior paradox .
I mean , is it my obligation to " study " these novels , even if I do n't want to ?
Perhaps it is .
In many ways , I am paid by Esquire to contextualize this sort of phenomenon , and I assume that will still be the case in the future .
It is probably to my long - term financial benefit to read Harry Potter books ; ignoring them is like not investing in my 401( k ) .
Were I a more responsible citizen , I would force myself to consume everything I could about this goddamn teenage wizard , simply for economic self - preservation .
Yet I still can not make myself do it .
At the end of the day ( or at the beginning of the day , or whenever ) , I do n't care if I do n't understand this .
Which , I realize , is a dangerous position to publicly adopt .
I am constructing my own generation gap on purpose .
By making this decision in the present , I will be less able to manage the future .
My thoughts about entertainment aesthetics will be outdated , and I will not grasp the fundamental lingua franca of the 2025 hipster .
I will not only be old but old for my age .
I will be the pterodactyl , and I will be slain .
It is only a matter of time .

Central banks around the world have painted themselves into a corner as of late , as their plans for injecting hundreds of billions of dollars worth of credit into the financial markets butts up against their desire to avoid massive price increases .
Rather than take the blame for this predicament , the financial central planners have characteristically started pointing fingers elsewhere .
In the January 5 – 6 weekend edition of the Wall Street Journal , we learn that it is apparently unions who are now at fault :
European trade unions are preparing aggressive pay demands for 2008 … .
This is sure to grate on [ European Central Bank ]
President Jean - Claude Trichet , who has been escalating his warnings that a wage - driven boost in euro - zone inflation would provoke an increase in official interest rates .
The ECB calls it " second - round " inflation effect , which essentially doubles existing inflation as workers demand higher wages and companies pass on higher costs to customers .
[ " Europe Unions ' Wage Agenda Likely to Vex Central Bankers , " A4 ]
In the present article we 'll try to sort these complicated issues out , but first we need a quick primer on monetary theory .
Now I warn you , the following section will be more difficult to digest than an episode of the Colbert Report , but we 'll make it as painless as possible .
On the bright side , the reader 's thinking on inflation will be much clearer when it 's done .
THE PRICE OF MONEY
The " price " of money is how many units of goods and services a person needs to give up , in order to acquire a unit of money .
It is the reciprocal of what we normally think of as prices ( quoted in money ) .
For example , if a car is $ 5,000 , then one dollar has a " price " of 1/5,000 of a car .
Or , if a gumball is 25 cents , then one dollar has a price of four gumballs .
It sounds funny to talk like this , but the oddity reflects the great service that money performs : by always constituting one side of every transaction , the money good allows us to think of " the " price of everything else merely in terms of its money exchange rate .
If there were no single item that everyone traded against — in other words , if every seller did n't first acquire money before seeking out the things he or she ultimately desired — then there would be no single exchange rate that everyone would agree on , when quoting prices .
People who really cared about gumballs might go around , thinking , " That item 's worth 42 gumballs .
That massage would cost me 3000 gumballs " and so forth , while somebody else might view the economy in terms of cars .
Unfortunately , we can't use the convenience of a single number for the " price " of money , simply because this is the one good it would be silly to price in terms of money .
We learn something about the state of the economy when we know that a car has a price of $ 5,000 , while a gumball has a price of 25 cents ( i.e. , 0.25 dollars ) .
But it does n't really tell us anything if we say that one dollar has a price of one dollar , even though that 's a true statement .
The price of money , therefore , can be quoted as any of the millions of possible exchange rates with other items in the economy .
Generally speaking , the price of money is its purchasing power , which is the inverse of what people mean by " the price level , " although that 's a very sloppy term .
It would be less misleading to speak of the price array or price constellation .
The popular term price level is misleading because we can express the purchasing power of money only by listing the millions of exchange rates it has against every good and service in the economy , and there is no reason for this list of numbers to change uniformly over time .
So we see that money has a price , just like other goods , but that expressing the price is a bit uncomfortable , precisely because it is money that makes it a snap to express the price of every other good ( and service ) in the economy .
To put it in other words , it 's not that it 's difficult to express the price of money — rather it's that money itself makes it easy to express the prices of all nonmoney items .
PRICE SET BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND
As with everything else , the price of money is determined by supply and demand .
The supply side is easy enough ; at any moment , there is a definite amount of dollars — both in people 's wallets and also their checking account balances — in the world .
( A note to gold bugs : I am going to speak of dollar bills , rather than ounces of gold , so as not to confuse the modern reader .
Naturally I am not endorsing fiat currency over commodity money . )
But what of the demand side ?
Can economists analyze the " demand for money " the same way they look at the demand for plasma screen TVs ?
The answer is yes , but we first need to be clear about a common confusion .
When it comes to money , the beginner should think in terms of stocks , not flows .
At any point in time , every single dollar bill is owned by someone , and is part of someone 's cash balance .
There is no such thing as money " in circulation , " to be contrasted with " hoarded " money .
All money is being hoarded , in the sense that every last dollar bill is always being held by someone who — at that precise moment — considers it more advantageous to hold the marginal unit of money , rather than to exchange it for something else .
( Of course , many dollar bills are being held in the cash balances of the owners of grocery stores and banks , and are sitting in the tills of their establishments .
But this money too is part of cash balances ; it 's not " in circulation . " )
In theory , there are all sorts of reasons that people might desire to hold cash balances .
There might be people who adore the US presidency , for example , and can't believe how little they have to work in order to acquire yet another wallet - sized portrait of those handsome gents .
However , the main element constituting the demand for cash balances is the expectation of its purchasing power in the future .
Strange as it seems , the cash sitting in your wallet or purse performs a service just by sitting there .
It reassures you , in the same way that having a fire extinguisher under your kitchen sink reassures you .
Let 's think about this a little more .
If your teenage son came home from Sam's Club with six years ' worth of bottled water , and proudly explained that he had emptied out the family checking account because there was " such a good deal , " this would be incredibly stressful .
And note that the precise reason for your anger would not be whether or not your son overpaid for the water , but rather that he drew down your cash balance and invested it in goods that were far less liquid ( in the economic , not physical sense ! ) than cash .
At any given time , people want to hold a certain amount of purchasing power in the form of liquid cash ( or completely trustworthy checkbook deposits ) .
This desire constitutes the demand for money , and interacts with the supply of money to yield the price of money at that moment .
In equilibrium , the available stock of money is distributed into all of the cash holdings of everyone in the economy , and all of the money prices of the various goods and services are at just the right amounts , so that each person is holding the desired amount of purchasing power .
Before leaving this section , let 's go over a popular thought experiment to make sure we understand how to use this framework we 've developed .
Suppose one day that a helicopter drops extra dollar bills into everyone 's back yard .
What will happen ?
The first , immediate effect will be that everyone who picks up the new money will have a higher cash balance ( both in terms of absolute dollars and in purchasing power ) than before .
Let 's suppose for simplicity that everyone originally had $ 1,000 in cash , and now the helicopter has doubled everyone 's cash balance to $ 2,000 .
If the prices ( quoted in dollars ) of goods and services do n't adjust , then people will be holding more purchasing power than they want to maintain .
To be sure , people may always want more wealth , but they do n't necessarily want to hold it in ever - larger stockpiles of cash .
If the demand for cash remains the same , then the only way to restore equilibrium is for the ( money ) prices of goods and services to rise .
If we simplistically assume away all the real world complications of timing and so forth , we can imagine that the dollar price for every good and service in the economy doubles , as people rush out to spend some of their newly found money .
Then things are back to how they were before the helicopter drop .
People now hold $ 2,000 in their cash balances , but because prices have doubled , this represents the same purchasing power as it did before .
The injection of new money has n't created any real wealth , it has simply caused prices to rise .
( And again , we are ignoring all of the distortions due to the adjustment phase . )
For those who like to think in terms of the dreaded graphs of undergraduate economics , what happened in the helicopter example is that the supply of money increased , while the demand for money stayed the same .
This means that the price of money had to fall , i.e. , the dollar prices of goods and services had to rise , making a particular unit of money less valuable relative to other items .
CAN UNIONS CAUSE PRICE INFLATION ?
We can now return to the original issue : if union agitation leads to wage increases , will that cause prices in general to increase ?
The quick answer is , " No , not if the demand for money remains the same . "
If unions succeed in wage hikes , and employers raise the prices they charge consumers to maintain their own profit margins , and the supply of money remains the same , then something else has to " give . "
Either the prices of goods and services in nonunion sectors have to fall and offset the union sector hikes , or people 's cash balances need to fall , in terms of their purchasing power .
Remember , it is a mistake to think that the workers are sucking money out of the economy ; the workers are a large portion of the consumers , after all .
Rather , if the number of dollar bills remains constant , while prices in general go up , then cash balances ( measured in purchasing power ) must fall .
This could be true even for the workers who achieved large pay hikes .
They might consider their financial position superior to their previous one , but even so the amount of cash in their wallets and checking accounts could be uncomfortably low compared to the higher prices of the goods and services they want to buy in the coming weeks and months .
As we said above , if the demand for cash balances remains the same , then this situation cannot last .
People are not holding enough purchasing power , and so they restrict their purchases in order to build up a larger stockpile of liquid funds .
Merchants will experience a decline in sales , and will have to slash prices if they want to stay in business .
To repeat our conclusion : unions ( or OPEC countries , for that matter ) cannot change the supply of money .
If their actions do not somehow indirectly alter the demand for money , then they clearly cannot change the price of money .
In other words , unions can't directly cause price inflation .
By distorting relative prices and insisting on inefficient workplace rules , they certainly hamper the economy , no question about it .
But it is wrong to blame unions for rising prices .
CONCLUSION
In closing , I should acknowledge that there is a way for the European Central Bank story to work .
The above framework does n't rule out the theoretical possibility that union agitation leads to wage hikes , which in turn lead to general price hikes , and that a resigned populace shrugs its shoulders and accepts the lower purchasing power of its cash holdings .
However , I think in practice the population will react by " spreading the pain . "
Rather than directing the hit fully into depreciated cash holdings , people will cut back on their discretionary purchases .
This greatly mutes the alleged power of the unions to raise prices in general , especially if the initial wage hikes are limited to a few industries .
No , when it comes to the reasons for rising prices — especially as this price inflation occurs year in , year out — the true culprit seems clear enough : it is the central bankers who continually add new dollars ( and euros , etc. ) to their respective economies .
Rather than worrying about union - inspired " second - round " inflation , the ECB should focus on its own first - round inflation .

We will also see how to change an LDAP password .
The LDAP Compare Operation
One of the simplest LDAP operations to perform is the compare operation .
The LDAP compare operation takes a DN , an attribute name , and an attribute value and checks the directory to see if the given DN has an attribute with the given attribute name , and the given attribute value .
If it returns true then there is a match , and if false then otherwise .
The Python - LDAP API supports LDAP compare operations through the LDAPObject ’s compare ( ) and compare_s ( ) functions .
The synchronous function is simple .
It takes three string parameters ( DN , attribute name , and asserted value ) , and returns 0 for false , and 1 for true :
>>> dn = ' uid=matt,ou=users , dc=example , dc=com '
>>> attr_name = 'sn '
>>> attr_val = ' Butcher '
>>> con.compare_s ( dn , attr_name , attr_val )
1
In this case , we check the DN uid=matt , ou=user , dc=example , dc=com to see if the surname ( sn ) has the value Butcher .
It does , so the method returns 1 .
But let ’s set the attr_val to a different surname , one that the record does not contain :
>>> attr_val = ' Smith '
>>> con.compare_s ( dn , attr_name , attr_val )
0
>>>
Since the record identified by the DN uid=matt , ou=users , dc=example , dc=com does not have an SN attribute with the value Smith , this method returns 0 , false .
Historically , Python has treated the boolean value False with 0 , and numeric values greater than zero as boolean True .
So it is possible to use a compare like this :
if con.compare_s ( dn , attr_name , attr_val ) :
print " Match "
else :
print " No match . "
If compare_s ( ) returns 1 , this will print Match .
If it returns 0 , it will print No match .
Let ’s take a quick look , now , at the asynchronous version of the compare operation , compare ( ) .
As we saw in the section on binding , the asynchronous version starts the operation in a new thread , and then immediately returns control to the program , not waiting for the operation to complete .
Later , the result of the operation can be examined using the LDAPObject ’s result ( ) method .
Running the compare ( ) method is almost identical to the synchronized version , with the difference being the value returned :
>>> retval = con.compare ( dn , attr_name , attr_val )
>>> print retval
15
Here , we run a compare ( ) method , storing the identification number for the returned information in the variable retval .
Finding out the value of the returned information is a little trickier than one might guess .
Any attempt to retrieve the result of a compare operation using the result ( ) method will raise an exception .
But , this is not a sign that the application has encountered an error .
Instead , the exception itself indicates whether the compare operation returned true or false .
For example , let ’s fetch the result for the previous operation in the way we might expect :
>>> print con.result ( retval )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
File " " , line 1 , in
File " /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ldap/ldapobject.py " ,
line 405 , in result
res_type , res_data , res_msgid = self.result2( msgid , all, timeout )
File " /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ldap/ldapobject.py " ,
line 409 , in result2
res_type , res_data , res_msgid , srv_ctrls = self .
result3
( msgid , all , timeout )
File " /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ldap/ldapobject.py " ,
line 415 , in result3
rtype , rdata , rmsgid , serverctrls = self ._ldap_call
( self._l.result3 , msgid , all, timeout )
File " /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ldap/ldapobject.py " ,
line 94 , in _ldap_call
result = func ( * args , ** kwargs )
ldap .COMPARE_TRUE : {'info ' : '' , ' desc ' : ' Compare True'}
What is going on here ?
Attempting to retrieve the value resulted in an exception being thrown .
As we can see from the last line , the exception raised was COMPARE_TRUE .
Why ?
The developers of the Python - LDAP API worked around a difficulty in the standard LDAP C API by providing the results of the compare operation in the form of raised exceptions .
Thus , the way to retrieve information from the asynchronous form of compare is with a try / except block :
>>> retval = con.compare ( dn , attr_name , attr_val )
>>> try :
... con.result ( retval )
...
... except ldap .
COMPARE_TRUE :
... print " Returned TRUE . "
...
... except ldap .
COMPARE_FALSE :
... print " Returned FALSE . "
...
Returned TRUE .
In this example , we use the raised exception to determine whether the compare returned true , which raises the COMPARE_TRUE exception , or returned false , which raises COMPARE_FALSE .
Performing compare operations is fairly straightforward , even with the nuances of the asynchronous version .
The next operation we will examine is search .
The Search Operation
LDAP servers are intended as high read , low write databases , which means that it is expected that most operations that the server handles will be “ read ” operations that do not modify the contents of the directory information tree .
And the main operation for reading a directory , as we have seen throughout this book , is the LDAP search operation .
As a reminder , the LDAP search operation typically requires five parameters :
The base DN , which indicates where in the directory information tree the search should start .
, which indicates where in the directory information tree the search should start .
The scope , which indicates how deeply the search should delve into the directory information tree .
, which indicates how deeply the search should delve into the directory information tree .
The search filter , which indicates which entries should be considered matches .
, which indicates which entries should be considered matches .
The attribute list , which indicates which attributes of a matching record should be returned .
, which indicates which attributes of a matching record should be returned .
A flag indicating whether attribute values should be returned ( the Attrs Only flag ) .
There are other additional parameters , such as time and size limits , and special client or server controls , but those are less frequently used .
Once a search is processed , the server will return a bundle of information including the status of the search , all of the matching records ( with the appropriate attributes ) , and , occasionally , error messages indicate some outstanding condition on the server .
When writing Python - LDAP code to perform searches , we will need to handle all of these issues .
In the Python - LDAP API , there are three ( functional ) variations of the search function :
search ( ) search_s ( ) search_st ( )
The first is the asynchronous form , and the second is the synchronous form .
The third is a special form of the synchronous form that allows the programmer to add on a hard time limit in which the client must respond .
There are two other versions of the search method , search_ext ( ) and search_ext_s ( ) .
These two provide parameter placeholders for passing client and server extension mechanisms , but such extension handling is not yet functional , so neither of these functions is performatively different than the three above .
We will begin by looking at the second method , search_s ( ) .
The search_s ( ) function of the LDAPObject has two required parameters ( Base DN and scope ) , and three optional parameters ( search filter , attribute list , and the attrs only flag ) .
Here , we will do a simple search for a list of surnames for all of the users in our directory information tree .
For this , we will not need to set the attrs only flag ( which is off by default , and , when turned on , will not return the attribute values ) .
But we will need the other four parameters :
Base DN :
The users branch , ou=users , dc=example , dc=com
Scope : Subtree ( ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE )
Filter :
Any person objects , ( objectclass=person )
Attributes : Surname ( sn )
Now we can perform our search in the Python interpreter :
>>> import ldap
>>> dn = " uid=matt, ou=users , dc=example , dc=com "
>>> pw = " secret "
>>>
>>> con = ldap.initialize( ' ldap://localhost ')
>>> con.simple_bind_s ( dn , pw )
( 97 , [ ] )
>>>
>>> base_dn = ' ou=users , dc=example , dc=com '
>>> filter = ' ( objectclass=person ) '
>>> attrs = [ ' sn ' ] >>>
>>> con.search_s ( base_dn , ldap .
SCOPE_SUBTREE , filter , attrs )
[ ( ' uid=matt,ou=Users , dc=example , dc=com ' , {'sn ' : [ ' Butcher ' ] } ) ,
( ' uid=barbara,ou=Users , dc=example , dc=com ' , {'sn ' : [ ' Jensen ' ] } ) ,
( ' uid=adam, ou=Users , dc=example , dc=com ' , {'sn ' : [ ' Smith ' ] } ) ,
( ' uid=dave,ou=Users , dc=example , dc=com ' , {'sn ' : [ ' Hume ' ] } ) ,
( ' uid=manny,ou=Users , dc=example , dc=com ' , {'sn ' : [ ' Kant ' ] } ) ,
( ' uid=cicero,ou=Users , dc=example , dc=com ' , {'sn ' : [ ' Tullius ' ] } ) ,
( ' uid=mary , ou=Users , dc=example , dc=com ' , {'sn ' : [ ' Wollstonecraft ' ] } ) ,
( ' uid=thomas,ou=Users , dc=example , dc=com ' , {'sn ' : [ ' Hobbes ' ] } ) ] > >>
The first seven lines should look familiar – there is nothing in these lines not covered in the previous sections .
Next , we declare variables for the Base DN ( base_dn ) , filter ( filter ) , and attributes ( attrs ) .
While base_dn and filter are strings , attrs requires a list .
In our case , it is a list with one member : [ ‘ sn ’ ] .
Safe Filters
If you are generating the LDAP filter dynamically ( or letting users specify the filter ) , then you may want to use the escape_filter_chars ( ) and filter_format ( ) functions in the ldap .
filter module to keep your filter strings safely escaped .
We do n’t need to create a variable for the scope , since all of the available scopes ( subtree , base , and onelevel ) are available as constants in the ldap module : ldap .
SCOPE_SUBTREE , ldap .
SCOPE_BASE , and ldap .
SCOPE_ONELEVEL .
The line highlighted above shows the search , and the lines following – that big long messy conglomeration of tuples , dicts , and lists – is the result returned from the server .
Strictly speaking , the result returned from search_s ( ) is a list of tuples , where each tuple contains a DN string , and a dict of attributes .
Each dict of attributes has a string key ( the attribute name ) , and a list of string values .
While this data structure is compact , it is not particularly easy to work with .
For a complex data structure like this , it can be useful to create some wrapper objects to make use of this information a little more intuitive .
The ldaphelper Helper Module
To better work with LDAP results , we will create a simple package with just one class .
This will be our ldaphelper module , stored in ldaphelper.py :
import ldif
from StringIO import StringIO
from ldap.
cidict import cidict
def get_search_results( results ) :
" " " Given a set of results , return a list of LDAPSearchResult
objects .
" " "
res = [ ]
if type ( results ) == tuple and len( results ) == 2 :
( code , arr ) = results
elif type ( results ) == list :
arr = results
if len( results ) == 0 :
return res
for item in arr :
res.append ( LDAPSearchResult ( item ) )
return res
class LDAPSearchResult :
" " " A class to model LDAP results .
" " "
dn = ''
def __init__( self , entry_tuple ) :
" " " Create a new LDAPSearchResult object . " " "
( dn , attrs ) = entry_tuple
if dn :
self.dn = dn
else :
return
self.attrs = cidict ( attrs )
def get_attributes ( self ) :
" " " Get a dictionary of all attributes .
get_attributes ( )->{' name1 ' :[' value1 ' , 'value2 ' , ... ] ,
' name2 : [ value1 ... ] }
" " "
return self .attrs
def set_attributes ( self , attr_dict ) :
" " " Set the list of attributes for this record .
The format of the dictionary should be string key , list of
string alues .
e.g. {'cn ' : [ 'M Butcher ' , 'Matt Butcher ' ] }
set_attributes ( attr_dictionary )
" " "
self.attrs = cidict ( attr_dict )
def has_attribute ( self , attr_name ) :
" " " Returns true if there is an attribute by this name in the
record .
has_attribute ( string attr_name ) -> boolean
" " "
return self.attrs.has_key ( attr_name )
def get_attr_values ( self , key ) :
" " " Get a list of attribute values .
get_attr_values ( string key ) ->[ ' value1 ' , ' value2 ' ] " " "
return self .
attrs[key ]
def get_attr_names ( self ) :
" " " Get a list of attribute names .
get_attr_names ()->[ ' name1 ' , 'name2 ' , ... ] " " "
return self.attrs.keys ( )
def get_dn( self ) :
" " " Get the DN string for the record .
get_dn ( ) -> string dn
" " "
return self.dn
def pretty_print ( self ) :
" " " Create a nice string representation of this object .
pretty_print ()-> string
" " "
str = " DN : " + self.dn + " n "
for a , v_list in self.attrs.iteritems ( ) :
str = str +
" Name : " + a + " n "
for v in v_list :
str = str + " Value : " + v + " n "
str = str + " ======== "
return str
def to_ldif( self ) :
" " " Get an LDIF representation of this record .
to_ldif ( )-> string
" " "
out = StringIO ( )
ldif_out = ldif.LDIFWriter( out )
ldif_out.unparse(self.dn , self.attrs )
return out.getvalue ( )
This is a large chunk of code to take in at once , but the function of it is easy to describe .
Remember , to use a Python module , you must make sure that the module is in the interpreter ’s path .
See the official Python documentation ( http://python.org) for more information .
The package has two main components : the get_search_results ( ) function , and the LDAPSearchResult class .
The get_search_results ( ) function simply takes the results from a search ( either the synchronous ones , or the results from an asynchronous one , fetched with result ( ) ) and converts the results to a list of LDAPSearchResult objects .
An LDAPSearchResults object provides some convenience methods for getting information about a record .
The get_dn ( ) method returns the record ’s DN , and the following methods all provide access to the attributes or the record :
get_dn ( ) : return the string DN for this record .
get_attributes ( ) : get a dictionary of all of the attributes .
The keys are attribute name strings , and the values are lists of attribute value strings .
set_attributes ( ) : takes a dictionary with attribute names for keys , and lists of attribute values for the value field .
has_attribute ( ) : takes a string attribute name and returns true if that attribute name is in the dict of attributes returned .
get_attr_values ( ) : given an attribute name , this returns all of the values for that attribute ( or none if that attribute does not exist ) .
get_attr_names ( ) : returns a list of all of the attribute names for this record .
pretty_print ( ) : returns a formatted string presentation of the record .
to_ldif ( ) : returns an LDIF formatted representation of the record .
This object does n’t add much to the original returned data .
It just makes it a little easier to access .
Attribute Names
LDAP attributes can have multiple names .
The attribute for surnames has two names : surname and sn ( though most LDAP directory entries use sn ) .
Either one might be returned by the server .
To make your application aware of this difference , you can use the ldap .
schema package to get schema information .
The Case Sensitivity Gotcha
There is one noteworthy detail in the code above .
The search operation returns the attributes in a dictionary .
The Python dictionary is case sensitive ; the key TEST is different than the key test .
This exemplifies a minor problem in dealing with LDAP information .
Standards - compliant LDAP implementations treat some information in a case - insensitive way .
The following items are , as a rule , treated as case - insensitive :
Object class names : inetorgperson is treated as being the same as inetOrgPerson .
Attribute Names : givenName is treated as being the same as givenname .
Distinguished Names : DNs are case - insensitive , though the all - lower - case version of a DN is called Normalized Form .
The main area where this problem surfaces is in retrieving information from a search .
Since the attributes are returned in a dict , they are , by default , treated as case - sensitive .
For example , attrs.has_key ( ‘ objectclass ’) will return False if the object class attribute name is spelled objectClass .
To resolve this problem , the Python - LDAP developers created a case - insensitive dictionary implementation ( ldap.cidict.cidict ) .
This cidict class is used above to wrap the returned attribute dictionary .
Make sure you do something similar in your own code , or you may end up with false misses when you look for attributes in a case - sensitive way , e.g. when you look for givenName in an entry where the attribute name is in the form givenname .

On Tuesday PBS Frontline : " Extraordinary Rendition " explored Bush 's use of the CIA to kidnap persons from sovereign nations and fly them to secret locations at CIA Black Sites or to prisons in other countries to be tortured and held indefinitely in secret without charges .
Although the practice of " extraordinary rendition " did not originate under Bush , after Sept 11 " the program expanded beyond recognition — becoming , according to a former C.I.A. official , " an abomination . "
What began as a program aimed at a small , discrete set of suspects — people against whom there were outstanding foreign arrest warrants — came to include a wide and ill - defined population that the Administration terms " illegal enemy combatants . "
Ill defined does n't really begin to cover it .
In the two cases looked at in this clip , both men had actually previously been informants helping in the fight against terrorism prior to 9 - 11 .
Abu Omar had once been the " CIA 's most productive source of information " on a group of Islamic fundamentalists living in Albania , and Bisher al - Rawi had been a source for the MI5 , helping keep tabs on Muslim extremists in the UK .
Evidence in Italy 's case against 26 CIA operatives charged in Abu Omar 's kidnapping shows " that the abduction was a bold attempt to turn him back into the informer he once was , " not for his suspected ties to terrorism , and Al - Rawi believes he too was held " just on the hope he'd offer new intelligence . "
Both men have since been released without ever having been charged with anything , as were most of the hundreds of so - called " enemy combatants " held without due process by the Bush administration that have been released thus far .
And if just wanting someone to become a potential informant being enough to get someone kidnapped and tortured was n't heinous enough for you , the documentary ( which you can watch online ) also tells the story of the US 's involvement in the ( outsourced ? ) rendition and detention of the " wife and three children of a senior al - Qaeda suspect " in Somalia .
Was Mukasey ever asked his opinion about the legality of any of that ?
Artist Zdzislaw Beksiński is best known for his immense , obsessively detailed paintings of catastrophic landscapes , surreal humanoid figures and afflicted nudes .
Born in 1929 , he grew up in southern Poland , then traveled to Krakow to study architecture where he subsequently spent several miserable years working as a construction site supervisor .
His work from that era is primarily photography and sculpture .
In his mid thirties , Beksiński shifted his focus to painting large , purely abstract pieces on wooden boards ( he preferred wood to canvas ) .
Eventually , their form and structure became more straightforward and he entered a self - proclaimed “ fantastic period ” reminiscent of Bruegel , Ernst or Bosch , and drawing comparisons to his Swiss contemporary , H.R. Giger .
Beksiński ’s post - apocalyptic vision , much like Giger ’s , is uniquely disturbing owing in part to a highly developed architectural eye .
His manipulation of scale and manic overworking of texture is ingenious .
Overwhelmingly huge structures rise up from dust or empty desert .
Sinewy figures cavort under ominous skies .
Although he depicts a harrowing world , Beksiński claimed that much of his work is misunderstood .
Like Kafka ( known to laugh hysterically when reading his own stories aloud ) , the Polish painter was often amused by his own work .
He insisted his vision was ultimately optimistic .
Like a cathedral or skyscraper , many of his paintings are strangely life - affirming in a shock - and - awe sort of way .
Blighted lovers embrace , cheery balloons float above crumbling towers , a tiny man holds a light aloft at the bottom of a deep chasm …
But yeah , heebie jeebies nonetheless …
Beksiński claimed to abhor silence and listened continuously to classical music while he painted .
He was soft - spoken but surprisingly gregarious , given his bleak body of work .
In the late 90s , captivated by computer technology and the internet , he shifted his focus again , this time to digital art / photography .
These pieces proved to be far less critically or commercially successful than his paintings .
Thus began a very tragic era for the man .
In 1998 , after years of illness , his wife Zofia died .
A year later , his son Tomasz ( a popular Polish radio personality and movie translator ) committed suicide .
Beksiński , who discovered his son ’s body , was never quite the same .*
News of Beksiński’s own death in early 2005 was difficult to fathom .
On February 21st , the artist ’s body was discovered in his Warsaw flat , stabbed 17 times .
Robert Kupiec ( the teenage son of his caretaker ) and a friend were soon arrested .
Apparently Beksiński had refused a loan to the boy , prompting the attack .
Kupiec pleaded guilty and is now serving 25 years in prison .
His accomplice , Lukasz Kupiec , will be up for parole in a couple of years .
* An interesting sidenote : Tomasz , like his father , loved music , especially The Legendary Pink Dots .
After his suicide , the band ’s Polish reissues featured many of Beksinski ’s digital art as covers , dedicated to Tomasz .

This cell ran for about a year .
I used SS
screen for the cathode ( -) hydrogen gas & just 1 / 4 " rod for the anode (+)
I figure the screen would take place of SS discs with many holes drilled .
The egas seams to come off the edges of the SS ( stainless steel )
It ran 12 volts , in which cooks the electrodes but steam cleans the carbon out of your fuel injection system .
Now we go 2 volts .
Why is it colored red - brown ?
They call it " anode mud " oxidized iron and minerals .
Way less now due to change over to 2 volts .
Before photo and one year later .
The unit will make red sludge that
you will have to clean out once a month .
I made mine to take out easy .
New plans
reduce this problem with the use of neutral plates to absorb voltage .
Voltage in electrolysis equals heat .
1.8 volts id best .
2 - 3 - 4 volts OK .
Simple Wiring
One side ( cathode ) ( -) is grounded to the car 's frame the other ( anode ) is hooked up to a 25 amp fused thick wire ( 10 - 12 gauge braided copper wire , buy a spool at the auto parts store ) , 12 volts (+ ) .
I hooked up a simple auto accessory relay ( $ 5.00 ) and a dash mounted switch ( $ 5.00 )
What the relay does is , it allows the switch to get an 1 amp or so , current , while the relay turned on takes up to 25 amps coming straight form the battery (+ ) .
This way you can use a 5 amp rated cheap switch rather than a 25 amp switch .
Remember the more amps the thicker the wires need to be .
DC needs thick wires or you start to lose amperage .
To have efficient egas , you only need 2 volts , the extra 10 volts does nothing but heat up your cell water .
I 'm no electronic wizard , so I left it simple .
There are circuits on the hydroxy yahoo group files .
I say " join today and learn all you wanted to know about running a water powered car .
See diagram
Photo of the DC PWM circuit DC pulsed motor Controller
A simple solder kit for $ 28.00 plus shipping .
It can take 12 volts up to 25 amps , it has a 555 mosfet that pulses the signal much like AC does already .
The pulsing action at the right frequency ( about 8 , on a pot . 1 -10 ) helps in more egas production .
The Hydro Booster will work without it , but to add more egas what the hay .
You hook up a Pot , to the circuit and you dial it in till it bubbles the most .
This is why clear filter housing is good for experimenting , because you can watch the bubble action and show friends .
They wo n't last forever , much like SS 4 " pipe would be best for long time applications .
Photo of the New Hydro - Booster hooked up .
I have a one way check value , so engine by gasses will not come back into unit .
So guys complain about backfire , I never encounter backfiring .
I have it hooked to the vacuum in at idling and also to the throat of the carb .
Another way to hook up the outgas hose is to your vaccum system .
" Tee " into the PCV chec value coming out of your manifold cover , that goes into your carburator , thi s way you do n't lose any of the hydrogen / oxygen egas , also you will need to add a airline that goes to the bottom of your cell .
Have the air line go into your cell at the bottom so it helps push the egas through to your fuel source .
Put a value on the air in , so you can play around with little or alot of bubble action .
You only need a slight pinhole to achieve the bubble action .
The brawny booster works good so far .
I have not checked my mileage lately .
You can also install a MAP sensor potentimeter and adjust down your air to fuel ratio ( 14.7 to 1 ) to ( 14.7 to 100:1 ) by turning a dial .
Bypass your oxy .
sensor too .
Do n't try it at home .
You can buy the plans here , but not from me .
I do n't sell anything yet , or may never .
I 'm just handing out the hints to be a successful happy fuel saver .
Now the Electrolyte
It 's not a atomic separator / fuel cell , it 's just a battery .
You got it all installed .
With the filter housing you can use 4 " 3/8 " ' U ' bolts from any hardware store .
I made a 1/8 " steel plate holder .
MacGiver it baby .
Gerry Rig helped me .
See photo above .
I use 12 volts with 25 amp fuses as to not burn up my DC pulsar .
Peter has 80 amp fuses ?
Sounds like a breaker box fuse ?
He uses 2 volts at 70 amps or more .
Fill the unit with rainwater or any water , some use distilled , it does not matter , you will be taking it out to clean it up , once your amps go down .
Fill up to the top of the switch plates with water and 1 - 3 % KOH ( Potassium Hydroxide ) from a chemical supply house .
You will pay more for hazardous shipping than you will for the chemical .
We found this is the best electrolyte , it is a base , rather than an acid .
Sulfuric acid works but corrodes things faster .
Lye works too , but puts off weird fumes and also attacks and melts some plastics .
ALso once you get the unit going you never add electrolyte again until you clean it out .
You just add water , because the electrolyte stays in the container and does not separate into H - O gas .
Next .
Start the car and drive .
A good way to check gas mileage is to fill your tank to the top ( top it off ) go drive around for a week and fill it up again to the top , at the same pump at the same gas station .
So the car is level as the last fill up .
Read the gas pump meter for gallons .
And there you have it .
Miles Per Gallon .
Any questions ?

" Water Car " by James Robey
James is Curator of the
1st Water Fuel Museum in
history !
This book ( $ 24 )
tells a brief history of most all of the water as fuel inventors 1799 till now .
The book includes patents and news articles , claims , etc. Information
your not suppose to read .
Jump on the bandwagon of water as fuel enthusiasts and turn this planet on it's head to the right direction !
We need desperately to break away from an Energy Admin .
devoted entirely to you buying gallons of dirty polluting gasoline resulting in a Smoggy dying planet .
* WARNING * LEGAL DISCLAIMER • WARNING * Making combustible
Oxy / Hydrogen gas from water is a real explosive gas and should be treated with respect and can be a dangerous activity .
Even as gasoline is a highly flammable , it has caused bad accidents .
Since you cannot go buy an manufactured hydrogen Booster at it is at the home shop level , as a Do It YOURSELF project .
If you plan to make a hydrogen booster from these ideas I 'm sharing and giving away , you do so at your own risk and your own responsibility .
Please be safe .
The main rule is no spark outside of the water in your cell , do n't touch your wire connections as the unit is running , it may cause a spark and a leaking egas hose will ignite !
Your output hose cannot leak !
Just like your fuel line cannot be leaking all over a hot exhaust manifold .
Also hook a switch up under the dash so you can turn it off while the car is not running .
I have mine hooked up to the ignition wiring , so it is only ON , when the ignition is ON .
Remember safety is no accident .
You know best when you are ready .

The last time I was invited to Harvard it cost me $ 110,000 .
So I was reluctant to show up .
Im going to start before I really begin by announcing my one goal this afternoon .
I want to be half as funny as tomorrows Commencement speaker , moral philosopher and economist Amartya Sen .
That s the job .
Must get more laughs than seminal wage - price theoretician .
By the way , enjoy that .
Bring a calculator .
It s going to be a nerd fest .
Students of the Harvard class of 2000 , 15 years ago I sat where you sit now .
And I thought exactly what you are now thinking .
What s going to happen to me ?
Will I find my place in the world ?
Am I really graduating a virgin ?
Still have 24 hours .
Roommates mom very hot .
Swear shes checking me out .
There was that Rob Lowe movie .
Being here today , on a sincere note , is very special for me .
I do miss this place .
I especially miss Harvard Square .
Let me tell you , ( you dont know this ) Harvard Square is unique .
Nowhere else in the world will you find a man wearing a turban and a Red Sox jacket working in a lesbian bookstore .
I m just glad my dads working .
It s particularly sweet for me to be here today because this is true when I graduated I wanted very badly to be a Class Day speaker .
Unfortunately , my speech was rejected .
So if youll indulge me Id like to read a portion of that speech .
This is the actual speech from 15 years ago .
 Fellow students , as we sit here today listening to that classic A - ha tune which will definitely stand the test of time , I would like to make several predictions about what the future will hold .
I believe that one day a simple governor from a small southern state will rise to the highest office in the land .
He will lack political skill , but will lead on the sheer strength of his moral authority .
I believe that justice will prevail and one day the Berlin Wall will crumble , uniting East and West Berlin forever under Communist rule .
I believe that one day a high - speed network of interconnected computers will spring up worldwide , so enriching people that they will lose their interest in idle chitchat and pornography .
And finally , I believe that one day I will have a television show on a major network seen by millions of people at night which I will use to reenact crimes and and help catch at - large criminals . 
Then I had a section on the death of Wall Street , but you dont need to hear about that .
The point is that although you see me as a celebrity , a member of the cultural elite , a demigod if you will , and potential husband material , I came here in the fall of 1981 and lived at Holworthy Hall as a student much like you .
I was , without exaggeration this is true the ugliest picture in the freshman facebook .
When Harvard asked me for a picture the previous summer , I thought it was for their records , so I jogged in the August heat to a passport photo office and sat for a morgue shot .
To make matters worse , when the facebook came out , they put my picture right next to Catherine Oxenberg , a stunning blonde actress who was expected to join the class of  85 , but decided to defer admission so she could join the cast of Dynasty .
Folks , my photo would have looked bad on any page , but next to Catherine Oxenberg , I looked like a mackerel that had been in a car accident .
You see , in those days , I was 6 feet 4 inches tall and I weighed 150 pounds .
True .
Recently , I had some structural engineers run those numbers into a computer model , and according to the computer , I collapsed in 1987 , killing hundreds in Taiwan .
After freshman year , I moved to Mather House .
Mather House , incidentally , was designed by the same firm that built Hitlers bunker .
In fact , if Hitler had conducted the war from Mather House , he would have shot himself a year earlier .
Saved us a lot of trouble .
1985 seems like a long time ago now .
When I had my Class Day , you students would have been seven years old .
Seven years old !
You realize what that means ?
Back then I could have beaten any of you in a fight .
And I mean really badly .
Like no contest at all .
If anyone here has a time machine , seriously , I will kick your seven - year - old butt right now .
A lot has happened in 15 years though .
When you think about it , we come from completely different worlds .
When I graduated in 1985 , we watched movies starring Tom Cruise and listened to music by Madonna .
I come from a time when we huddled around the TV set and watched the Cosby Show on NBC , never imagining that there would one day be a show called Cosby on CBS .
In 1985 we drove cars with drivers - side air bags .
But if you had told us that one day there would be passenger - side air bags , wed have burned you for witchcraft .
Of course I think there is some common ground between us .
I remember well the great uncertainty of this day , the anxiety .
Many of you are justifiably nervous about leaving the safe , comfortable world of Harvard Yard and hurling yourself headlong into the cold , harsh world of Harvard grad school , a plum job in your fathers firm , or a year abroad with a gold Amex card and then a plum job at your fathers firm .
Let me assure you that the knowledge you gained here at Harvard is a precious gift that will never leave you .
Take it from me , your education is yours to keep forever .
Why , many of you have read the Merchant of Florence , and that will inspire you when you travel to the island of Spain .
Your knowledge of that problem they had with those people in Russia , or that guy in South America you know , the guy will be with you for the rest of your life .
Theres also sadness today .
A feeling of loss that you re leaving Harvard forever .
Let me assure you that you never really leave Harvard .
The Harvard fundraising committee will be on your ass until the day you die .
This is true .
I know for a fact that right now a member of the alumni association is at the Mount Auburn Cemetery shaking down the corpse of Henry Adams .
They heard he has a brass toe ring and they aim to get it .
These people just raised $ 2.5 billion and they only got through the Bs in the alumni directory .
Heres basically how it works .
Your phone rings , usually after a big meal when you re tired and most vulnerable , and a voice asks you for money .
Knowing youve read in the paper that they just raised $ 2.5 billion , you ask ,  What do you need it for ? 
There is a long pause , and the voice on the other end of the line says ,  We dont need it , we just want it .
( Sinister laugh ) .
Let me seeby your applause who here wrote a thesis ?
That s nice .
A lot of hard work went into that thesis .
And no one is ever going to care .
I wrote a thesis this is true , I dont lie Literary Progeria in the Works of Flannery OConnor and William Faulkner . 
Let s just say that during my discussions with Pauly Shore , it doesnt come up much .
For three years after graduation I wanted to show it to everyone , and so I kept my thesis in the glove compartment of my car , so that I could show it to a policeman in case I was pulled over .
What else can you expect in the real world ?
Let me tell you .
As you leave these gates and re-enter society , one thing is certain .
Everyone out there is going to hate you .
Never tell anyone in a roadside diner that you went to Harvard .
In those situations , the correct response to ,  Where did you go to school ?  is  School ?
I never had much in the way of book learnin and such .
And then get in your BMW and get the hell out of there .
Go .
You see , kids , you re in for a lifetime of  And you went to Harvard ? 
Accidentally give the wrong amount of change in a transaction , and its  And you went to Harvard ? 
Ask at the hardware store how the jumper cables work , and hear  And you went to Harvard ? 
Forget just once that your underwear goes inside your pants , and its  And you went to Harvard ? 
Get your head stuck in your nieces doll house cause you want to see what its like to be a giant , and its  Uncle Conan , you went to Harvard ? 
So you really know whats in store for you after Harvard , I have to tell you what happened to me after graduation .
Im going to tell it simply , I m going to tell it honestly , because , first of all , I think my perspective may give many of you hope , and , secondly , it s such a cool , amazing rush to be in front of 6,000 people and just talk about yourself .
It s just great .
It s so cool .
And I can take my time .
You see , kids , after graduating in May , I moved to Los Angeles .
I got a three - week contract at a small cable show .
I got a $ 380 - a- month apartment , a terrible dump , and I bought a 1977 Isuzu Opal , a car Isuzu only manufactured for a year because they found out that technically its not a car .
Quick tip , graduates no four - cylinder used vehicle should have a racing stripe .
So I worked on that show for about a year , feeling pretty good about myself , when one day they told me that they were letting me go .
I was fired .
I hadnt saved any money .
So I tried to get another job in television as best I could and couldnt find one .
So with nowhere else to turn - true story I went to a temp agency and filled out a questionnaire .
I made damn sure that they knew I had been to Harvard , that I had written this thesis , and that I expected the very best treatment .
And so the next day I was sent to the Santa Monica branch of Wilsons House of Suede and Leather .
When you have a Harvard degree , and you are working at Wilsons House of Suede and Leather , you are haunted by the ghostly images of your classmates who chose graduate school .
You see their faces everywhere in coffee cups , in fish tanks , you think you re going crazy , and they re always laughing at you as you stack suede shirts no man in good conscience would ever wear .
I tried a lot of things during this period .
Acting in corporate infomercials .
Serving drinks in a nonequity theater .
I even took a job entertaining at a seven year - olds birthday party .
In desperate need of work , I put together some sketches and scored a job at the fledgling Fox network as a writer and performer for a brainy show called the  Wilton North Report . 
I was finally on a network and really excited .
The producer told me the show was going to revolutionize television .
And , in a way it did .
The show was so hated and did so badly that when four weeks later news of its cancellation was announced to the Fox affiliates , they burst into spontaneous applause .
Eventually , though , I got a big break .
I had submitted along with my writing partner a batch of sketches to Saturday Night Live , and after a year and a half they read it , and they gave us a two - week tryout .
The two weeks turned into two seasons , and I felt , hey , this is success , I m successful now .
Successful enough to write a TV pilot for an original sitcom .
When the network decided to make it , feeling good , I left Saturday Night Live .
This TV show was going to be groundbreaking .
It was going to resurrect the career of TVs Batman , Adam West .
It was going to be a comedy without a laugh track or a studio audience .
It was going to change all the rules .
And heres what happened .
When the pilot aired , it was the second - lowest - rated television show of all time .
It is actually tied with a test pattern they show up in Nova Scotia .
So I was 28 and , once again , no job .
I had good writing credits in New York , but I was filled with disappointment and I had no idea what I was going to do next .
And that is when the Simpsons saved my life .
I got a job there and started writing episodes about Springfield getting a monorail or Homer going to college .
I was finally putting my Harvard education to good usewriting dialogue for a man who is so stupid that in one episode he forgot to make his own heart beat .
Life was good .
And then an insane , inexplicable opportunity came my way , a chance to audition for host of the new  Late Night  show .
I took the opportunity very seriously , but at the time I have to be honest I had the relaxed confidence of someone who knew he had no real shot , so I couldnt fear losing a great job that I could never hope to have .
And I think that actually that attitude made the difference .
I will never forget being in the Simpsons recording basement that morning when the phone rang .
It was for me .
My car was blocking a firelane .
But a week later I got another call and got the job .
So this , finally , was undeniably it .
The truly life - altering break that I had always dreamed of .
And so I went to work .
I gathered all my funny friends and poured all my years of comedy experience into building the show over the summer .
I gathered the talent , figured out the sensibility , found Max , found Andy , found my people .
We debuted on September 13 , 1993 , and I was really happy , really happy , with our effort .
I felt like I had seized the moment , that I had put my very best foot forward .
And this was what the most respected and widely read television critic , Tom Shales , wrote in the Washington Post .
 O  Brien is a living collage of annoying nervous habits .
He giggles and jiggles about and fiddles with his cuffs .
He has dark , beady little eyes like a rabbit .
He is one of the whitest white men ever .
OBrien is a switch on the guest who wont leave : hes the host who should never have come .
Let the Late Show with Conan OBrien become the late Late Show , and may the host return to whence he came .
There s more , but it gets kind of mean .
Needless to say , I took a lot of criticism , some of it deserved , some of it excessive , and , to be honest with you , it hurt like you would not believe .
But I m telling you all this for a reason .
Ive had a lot of success .
Ive had a lot of failure .
Ive looked good .
Ive looked bad .
Ive been praised .
And Ive been criticized .
But my mistakes have been necessary .
Ive dwelled on my failures today because , as graduates of Harvard , your biggest liability is your need to succeed , your need to always find yourself on the sweet side of the bell curve .
Success is a lot like a bright white tuxedo .
You feel terrific when you get it , but then you re desperately afraid of getting it dirty , of spoiling it .
I left the cocoon of Harvard , I left the cocoon of Saturday Night Live , I left the cocoon of the Simpsons .
And each time it was bruising and tumultuous .
And yet every failure was freeing , and today Im as nostalgic for the bad as I am for the good .
So thats what I wish for all of you the bad as well as the good .
Fall down .
Make a mess .
Break something occasionally .
Know that your mistakes are your own unique way of getting to where you need to be .
And remember that the story is never over .
If youll indulge me for just a second , Id like to read a little something from just this year .
 Somehow , Conan OBrien has transformed himself into the brightest star in the late - night firmament .
His comedy is the gold standard , and Conan himself is not only the quickest and most inventive wit of his generation , but quite possibly the greatest host ever . 
Ladies and gentlemen , class of 2000 , I wrote that this morning .
As proof that when all else fails , you always have delusion .
I will go now to make bigger mistakes and to embarrass this fine institution even more .
But let me leave you with one last thought .
If you can laugh at yourself , loud and hard , every time you fall , people will think you re drunk .
Thank you .
New research at the University of Chicago finds evidence for a clever way that people manage to alleviate the pain of loneliness :
They create people in their surroundings to keep them company .
“ Biological reproduction is not a very efficient way to alleviate one ’s loneliness , but you can make up people when you ’re motivated to do so , ” said Nicholas Epley , Assistant Professor of Behavioral Science at the University of Chicago ’s Graduate School of Business .
“ When people lack a sense of connection with other people , they are more likely to see their pets , gadgets or gods as human - like . ”
Social scientists call this tendency “ anthropomorphism . ”
As a research topic , the phenomenon carries important therapeutic and societal implications , Epley said .
He and his co-authors will publish their findings on anthropomorphism in the February issue of the journal Psychological Science .
Also contributing to the research were Scott Akalis of Harvard University and the University of Chicago ’s Adam Waytz and John Cacioppo .
The behaviors they describe in the paper are not limited to the lonely .
Nevertheless , they are well - known to casual observers , from the stereotype of the woman who lives alone surrounded by her menagerie of cats , to the movie portrayal of a tropical island castaway .
“ In the movie Castaway , Tom Hanks was isolated on an island and found the social desolation to be one of the most daunting challenges with which he had to deal , ” said Cacioppo , the Tiffany and Margaret Blake Distinguished Service Professor in Psychology at the University of Chicago .
“ He did so , in part , by anthropomorphizing a volleyball , Wilson , who became his friend and confidant while he was on the island . ”
Although fictional , “ Castaway depicts a deep truth about the irrepressibly social nature of Homo sapiens , ” Cacioppo said .
The researchers designed three experiments to test their expectations that lonely people are more likely to make up for their lack of social connection by creating humanlike connections with gadgets or pets , or to increase their belief in the supernatural .
In one experiment , the team found a correlation between how lonely people felt and their tendency to describe a gadget in terms of humanlike mental states .
In another experiment , the team made people feel lonely in the laboratory by asking them to write about a time when they felt lonely or isolated .
Under those circumstances , they were more likely to believe in the supernatural , whether it be God , angels or miracles , than when they were not feeling lonely .
“ If we made them feel lonely , they were also more likely to describe a pet , even if it was n’t their own pet , as having humanlike mental states that were related to social connection , like being more thoughtful , considerate and compassionate , ” Epley said .
The research further revealed that not just any negative emotional state produces this effect .
“ It ’s something special about loneliness , ” Epley said .
Fear , for example , does n’t increase reported belief in God , or how people describe their pets .
Loneliness is both painful to experience and potentially deadly .
“ It ’s actually a greater risk for morbidity or mortality than cigarette smoking is .
Being lonely is a bad thing for you , ” he said .
But anthropomorphizing pets or God may actually confer many of the same psychological and physical benefits that come from connections with other people .
The same benefits may not apply to gadgets , which were a component of Epley ’s studies .
“ Non -human connections can be very powerful , ” Epley said .
“ A brain ’s not so sensitive to whether it ’s a person or not .
If it ’s something that has a lot of traits associated with what it means to be a human , then all the better for us , it seems . ”
The study also provides insight into the flip side of anthropomorphism : dehumanization .
People who enjoy a strong sense of social connection are less likely to perceive humanlike mental states in people who seem different from them .
Classic examples occur during times of war , during which a strong sense of nationalism or group identity tend to emerge .
“ It may be that strong in - group identity is one of the things that facilitates dehumanizing the opposing side , ” Epley said .

The intellectual bootlickers surrounding Bush have apparently persuaded him that he is the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln .
Â Â Fox News recently had unprecedented access to Bush to produce a documentary to air on Sunday night : â€œâ€ œGeorge W. Bush : Fighting to the Finish.â€ Â Fox reporter Bret Baier commented of his meetings with Bush : â€ 
We talked a lot about President Lincoln .
And thereâ€™s going to be a lot of people out there who watch this hour and say , is he trying to equate himself with Lincoln ?
I tell you what â€ ” he thinks about Lincoln and the tough times that he had during the Civil War. 600,000 dead .
The country essentially hated him when he was leaving office .
Perhaps the cartoon history books Bush was given neglected to mention the fact that Lincoln was very popular in the North at the time he â€œleft officeâ€ via John Wilkes Booth .
Â Â Lincoln was hated in the South , not surprisingly – given the Rules of Engagement that northern armies followed in the final years of the war .
Bush has followed in Lincolnâ€™s footsteps when he gushes over freedom while trampling the Constitution .
Â
That Lincoln suspended habeas corpus , jailed 20,000 people without charges , forcibly shut down hundreds of newspapers that criticized him , and sent in federal troops to shut down state legislatures was irrelevant because he proclaimed â€ œthat this nation shall have a new birth of freedom , and that government of the people , by the people , for the people shall not perish from the earth , â€ as I noted inÂ Attention Deficit Democracy .
Bush struts when he promises toÂ â€bring to justiceâ€ people on his target list .
Hopefully Americans willÂ see George Bush brought toÂ justiceÂ for his crimes .
Â
That would be a rebirth of the Rule of Law in this land .
Twelve states , including New York , New Jersey and Connecticut , sued the Environmental Protection Agency yesterday for weakening regulations that for two decades have required businesses and industries to report the toxic chemicals they use , store and release .
The suit , filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan , asks the court to reverse the agency ’s move and so restore all the chemical reporting requirements that were previously part of its Toxics Release Inventory program , or T.R.I .
Community groups across the country have used the program to track the amounts of hazardous chemicals in local neighborhoods .
Under the program , companies must provide information about the types of toxic chemicals stored at plants and factories in each state , as well as the quantities discharged from each plant .
Besides the states of the New York tristate area , the plaintiffs are Arizona , California , Illinois , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Hampshire , Pennsylvania and Vermont .
History will not be kind to Condi Rice .
The United States has had a number of distinguished secretaries of state since World War II , but she will not be counted among them .
Although it would be unfair to compare Rice to George Marshall , the architect of the Marshall Plan , which began economic integration in Western Europe , her performance pales in comparison to the independence , integrity , and leadership of a Dean Acheson or a James Baker .
Condi Rice will be remembered chiefly for her unswerving personal loyalty to George Bush and her unstinting efforts to sell the neocons ’ dysfunctional foreign policy to an increasingly skeptical nation and hostile world .
George Bush nominated Rice to succeed Colin Powell as secretary of state in November 2004 , and the Senate confirmed her in an 85 - 13 vote on Jan. 25 , 2005 .
Thirteen negative votes were the most against a secretary of state nominee since 1825 and reflected the Senate ’s unease with Rice ’s performance as national security adviser .
Not only had Rice been in the forefront of Bush administration officials making the bogus case for invading Iraq , but she refused to acknowledge her share of responsibility for failure to stop the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington .
In testimony before the 9/11 Commission , Rice stated she could not recall an " emergency " meeting with CIA Director George Tenet in July 2001 in which he highlighted the al - Qaeda threat .
She also claimed , in an assertion that appears absurd on its face , that the president ’s daily brief of Aug. 6 , 2001 , entitled “ Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States , ” contained no meaningful warnings .
Conveniently enough , that brief still remains classified .
Condi Rice was an uncritical advocate of the Iraq war .
As national security adviser she had the power and responsibility to investigate weak and contradictory intelligence that alleged Saddam ’s regime was seeking weapons of mass destruction and had an operational relationship with al - Qaeda .
She did not do so .
Her dealings with Colin Powell , Donald Rumsfeld , Dick Cheney , and George Tenet show she valued consensus over truth .
A determinedly uncurious Rice was a willing participant in the administration ’s pro-war rhetoric .
She used her intellect not to sort truth from falsehood , but to terrify the American people with cute and clever phrasing : " We do n’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud . "
Rice also tried to add a degree of verisimilitude to the nuclear case against Iraq .
In October 2002 , she alleged that Iraq was importing aluminum tubes " that are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs , centrifuge programs . "
Had Rice done a little research she would have found that the U.S. Department of Energy , Uncle Sam ’s primary authority on matters nuclear , had declared the tubes were inappropriate for enriching uranium .
One analyst went so far as to suggest that if the United States actually believed that the Iraqis were going to try to use the tubes in a centrifuge , " We ought just to give them the tubes . "
Rice notably , some would say purposely , failed to keep the notorious " sixteen words " falsely accusing Saddam of seeking uranium from Niger out of the president ’s January 2003 State of the Union address .
The CIA had warned her several times that claims were questionable .
When challenged after the invasion about the uranium from Niger tale , Rice stated " no one in our circles knew that there were doubts and suspicions " about the charge , conveniently forgetting the verbal and written warnings she had received from Tenet .
Furthermore , the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate for Iraq , which Rice claimed to " have read cover to cover twice , " contained a statement describing suggestions that Saddam had tried to buy uranium from Africa as " highly dubious . "
On the question of whether there was a link between Iraqi intelligence and al - Qaeda , Rice said " we know that there was training [ in Iraq ] of al - Qaeda in chemical and perhaps biological warfare . "
But Rice was either too lazy to investigate or decided to cover up the Defense Intelligence Agency ’s ( DIA ) opinion that this charge was most probably false .
According to the DIA , the accusation had come from a single source , a member of al - Qaeda who had been tortured by Egyptian and American intelligence services , and who had , in the DIA ’s view , made up the story to obtain better treatment .
For additional " proof " of Iraqi cooperation with Osama bin Laden , crucial to support the administration ’s case for invasion , Rice cited the presence of the al - Qaeda - connected Ansar al - Islam terrorist group in Iraqi Kurdistan .
Her statement appears to be an intentional attempt to deceive her listeners , because she must have known that the Kurdish area had been outside the Hussein regime ’s control since the end of the 1991 Gulf War .
As secretary of state , Rice spends much of her time responding to events in the Middle East and trying to justify American policy in the region .
Some of Rice ’s statements are so bizarre they leave one wondering whether she has lost her grip on reality or American policy is so hypocritical , inconsistent , and self - defeating as to make any spokesman , especially the secretary of state who is supposed to lead the policy - making process , sound strange .
Rice ’s dismissal as " the birth pangs of a new Middle East " the hardships inflicted upon 750,000 Lebanese civilians frantically fleeing Israeli bombing during last summer ’s Hezbollah - Israeli war can only be characterized as cavalier in the extreme .
and downright weird .
One wonders whether Rice would have been willing to describe Israelis fleeing Hezbollah rockets the same way .
During the crisis in Lebanon , Rice praised the Lebanese government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora as an " ally " and " a good and young democratic government . "
Meanwhile , she was working diligently at the Israelis ’ request to prevent the UN from instituting a cease - fire .
The Israelis , who were busy destroying civilian infrastructure all over Lebanon , whether it was related to their campaign against Hezbollah or not , wanted more time to crush the 1,500 or so lightly armed Hezbollah fighters arrayed against them .
Only after Israel had committed 30,000 ground troops backed by tanks and helicopters and still failed to make significant headway against Hezbollah did Condi Rice push for a cease - fire at the UN .
Clearly some allies and some democracies are more important to Rice than others .
Rice ’s efforts to cast herself as the midwife of Arab democracy led her to insist upon new elections in the Palestinian territories : " Holding free and fair Palestinian Legislative Council elections represents a key step in the process of building a peaceful , democratic Palestinian state . "
The Palestinians , sick of the PLO ’s corruption and failure to negotiate an acceptable settlement with Israel , elected a Legislative Council dominated by the Islamist group Hamas .
Because Hamas refuses to recognize Israel and is on the State Department ’s list of terrorist organizations , Rice had to do a quick rethink of her commitment to Palestinian democracy .
The State Department promptly repositioned itself to lead an international economic and diplomatic boycott of the new Hamas / PLO unity government .
Israel , with Rice ’s acquiescence , did its best to destroy the Palestinian Authority by withholding Palestinian customs revenues and locking up newly elected Palestinian legislators .
As economic sanctions began to hurt the Palestinians , already poor as a result of 40 years of occupation and resistance , Rice declared triumphantly : " The economic boycott on the Hamas - led Palestinian government is effective , and the international community will continue to maintain the boycott . "
Other consequences of Rice ’s efforts to strangle Arab democracy in Gaza and the West Bank were not long in coming , though events did not evolve as she had anticipated .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas prepared a coup against Hamas in the Gaza Strip , but Abbas ’ forces quickly disintegrated .
The Israelis then put the 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza under a punishing blockade .
Rice ’s real message to the Palestinian people seems to be , I ’m a strong advocate of democracy ; just make sure you elect people acceptable to Israel and the United States , if you want to eat .
While the State Department builds the biggest embassy in the world in the Green Zone , Condi Rice labors to convince the American people that the democracy in Iraq project , now four and a half years old , is worth it .
Several years ago , before the invasion of Iraq had cost countless lives and half a trillion dollars , Rice rather grandly told a gathering at Princeton University that the Bush administration had " set out to help the people of the Middle East transform their societies " and bring democracy to the Arab world .
Well , Iraq certainly has been transformed  into the most dangerous place on earth .
Iraqis are voting every day , but with their feet .
Since the start of the troop surge in February the number of internally displaced Iraqis has jumped from half a million to 1.5 million , while the number of Iraqis who have fled to surrounding countries , primarily Syria , has reached 2.5 million .
Rice routinely denounces Syria as a " police state " on the " wrong side of history , " a " barrier to change in the Middle East . "
Does she find it ironic that a million - plus Iraqis prefer to live under a socialist dictatorship in Syria instead of the liberal democracy she helped create in Iraq ?
No , Rice does n’t do irony ; she ca n’t and maintain a debased State Department as an integral part of the administration ’s spin machine .
One wonders just how many Syrians and other Arabs are anxious for the United States to bring freedom and democracy to them .
Most people are not keen to pack a suitcase , leave everything else behind , and run for their lives .
Four million displaced Iraqis represent 15 percent of the country ’s prewar population of 27 million .
The equivalent figure for the United States would be 45 million displaced .
The number of Iraqis who have fled their homes reveals , better than any other fact or statistic , the scope of the disaster that has befallen Iraq since the American invasion .
This immense human suffering will be Condi Rice ’s legacy .

The line forms early on Friday mornings at Foundry United Methodist Church , a nearly 200 - year - old institution located a few blocks from the White House .
Famous in some circles as Bill Clinton ’s church , among the city ’s down and out , Foundry is better known as one of the few places around that offers help securing a government - issued photo identification .
Two weeks ago , Deborah Killebrew , 58 , was one of those queued up outside the church to pick up a copy of her birth certificate , which Foundry volunteers had helped her obtain .
Six years ago , Killebrew was hit by a drunk driver .
Her fiance was killed in the crash and she was left with cervical spine injuries that eventually put her in a wheelchair .
After a string of bad luck , she wound up living in a D.C. homeless shelter .
Somewhere along the way , she lost her expired Virginia driver ’s license .
Killebrew was unable to get a new one because she did n’t have an official copy of her birth certificate from the state of Indiana , where she was born .
But to get her birth certificate , Killebrew had to send the state a copy of her driver ’s license or a stack of other documents — like a car registration or mortgage document — she also did n’t have .
Eventually , she just gave up , until recently when she was referred to Foundry .
Without a photo ID , Killebrew may not be able to drive or apply for food stamps , but here in D.C. , one thing she can do is vote , which she does regularly .
If she still lived in Indiana , though , she ’d be out of luck .
Two days before she arrived at Foundry to claim her birth certificate , the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a lawsuit over a strict new Indiana law requiring all voters to show a government - issued photo ID before casting a ballot .
The plaintiffs argued that the law was an unconstitutional burden on voters , particularly minority , poor , and elderly voters , who are the least likely to have the requisite ID .
The law does allow people without an ID to cast a provisional ballot , but it wo n’t get counted until the voter turns up at a county clerks ’ office to present identification .
If the justices rule against the plaintiffs , they will clear the way for other states to implement similar laws restricting voting rights for the less fortunate .
Judging from the oral arguments in Crawford v. Marion County Elections Board , that ’s just what the justices are poised to do .
While John Roberts worked at a steel mill during college , and Clarence Thomas came up dirt - poor in Pin Point , Georgia , the Supreme Court of late has n’t shown much interest in people like Killebrew who reside at the bottom of the economic food chain .
The court ’s docket is increasingly dominated by business litigation — patent challenges , anti-trust suits , and attempts by big businesses to insulate themselves from all sorts of legal liability and litigation brought by their employees , investors , or aggrieved customers .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently bragged that it had its best year yet before the high court in 2007 , racking up a string of impressive victories for big business that even surpassed the chamber ’s record - breaking year in 2006 .
Topped off by last week ’s decision in Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific Atlanta , which sharply restricted the ability of shareholders to sue entities that abet corporate fraud , recent winners before the Supreme Court have included Enron and the banks that facilitated its scam ; payday lenders ; investment banks that engage in price fixing ; and tobacco companies , among others .
Losers have been small investors , poor , black school children , working - class women paid less than men — and one kid who was paralyzed after a police officer rammed his car because he was speeding .
Not only are “ the people ” losing at a rapid clip when they come before the court , but it has gotten much , much harder for the average person to even get into court in the first place .
Over the past two decades , Supreme Court decisions have quietly prevented a wide swath of the American population from even reaching the courthouse , much less prevailing there when they ’ve challenged better - funded and more powerful interests .
Lee Epstein , a professor at Northwestern law school , says that the court is “ shutting down access to plaintiffs in all sorts of ways .
The court seems to be saying ‘ stay out . ' ”
In the last term , the court ruled , for instance , that taxpayers had no right to challenge the federal government ’s use of tax dollars to pay for religious - based social services .
The case overturned years of precedent giving people a say in how their money is spent if it seems to mix too much church with state business .
In a complicated anti-trust case , the court basically rewrote the rules for filing a civil lawsuit , making it harder for plaintiffs to even get into a courtroom under the guise of protecting business from allegedly frivolous lawsuits .
Many civil rights lawsuits are brought by private individuals rather than the government through agencies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , making them the primary mode of enforcing anti-discrimination laws passed by Congress .
Yet the Supreme Court has moved to sharply limit such lawsuits through decisions that , for instance , restrict the awarding of attorneys fees to plaintiffs so that lawyers can no longer afford to bring such cases .
Epstein says that while it ’s true many of these decisions break down along ideological lines , some of rulings also may stem from the justices ’ personal backgrounds .
Never has the Supreme Court been more homogenous , she says , noting that race and gender aside , the range of professional experience of the current court is extremely limited .
All of the current justices came straight from the federal appeals courts , she points out , and most spent the bulk of their careers in government service or academia .
Today ’s sitting justices are even geographically homogenous , having lived most of their adult lives in Washington or other nearby East Coast metro centers .
Before they were appointed , Epstein says , “ Most of these people could have taken the Metro or Amtrak to get to work . ”
At least with Sandra Day O’Connor on the court , Epstein says , there was not just a female voice , but someone from the West who had a different background from the other justices .
O’Connor had been an Arizona state legislator and served as an elected trial court judge in Maricopa County .
Epstein suggests that some of the court ’s rulings in recent years may have as much to do with the justices ’ service on appellate courts as ideology .
None of them has much experience as private - practice litigators or trial judges , where they would be forced to look the plaintiffs in the eye and hear their stories .
Epstein believes that the current crop of justices is inclined to think that “ the judges below them get it right . ”
The insular experience of the Supreme Court justices seems to be spilling over into their decision making in a way that goes beyond partisan politics .
Indeed , some of the more arcane business cases , which will nonetheless have a profound impact on such things as consumer protection , were decided by majorities that included Clinton appointees .
All of the justices seem reluctant to do anything that might mess with business too much , even when those businesses could use some messing with .
In Watters v. Wachovia last year , for instance , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , a former ACLU lawyer , wrote the opinion for a majority that also included liberal Steven Breyer in a case that declared that states have no right to regulate the operating subsidiaries of national banks .
On its face , this might sound like no big deal , until you recognize that some of those operating subsidiaries were engaged in subprime and other shady mortgage lending that ’s now wreaking havoc on the economy .
The states had attempted to step in to combat some of the fraud at work long before the feds even noticed there was a problem .
But the court ’s liberals deferred to the federal banking regulators in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
The decision was a huge victory for the banks , leaving their subsidiaries largely immune to regulation or lawsuits based on state consumer protection laws .
Ginsburg and Breyer also came down with the majority in a decision that upheld the use of mandatory - arbitration clauses in contracts for services that are themselves against the law .
In Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna , the court said a consumer could be forced to arbitrate a dispute with a payday lender rather than go to court even though payday lending is illegal in Florida , where the case originated .
During the oral arguments , Breyer expressed concern that if the court ruled for the consumer , businesses might suffer because so many of them now use mandatory arbitration to keep people out of court .
He seemed to believe that letting people go to court would somehow lead to economic ruin , even when they were suing companies that had defrauded them .
“ I would n’t want to reach a decision … that would make a significant negative difference in the gross national product of the United States , ” Breyer said .
The case greatly expanded the number of people who can no longer bring their consumer disputes before a judge or jury .
Despite a few of these sorts of decisions , it is still the conservatives on the court who seem to be most out of touch with the people who will be affected by their rulings .
The oral arguments during the Indiana voter ID case serve as a case in point .
There was Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. , with his movie - star good looks , and a smile and smoothness that seemed so reasonable and reassuring during his confirmation hearings .
And yet , during the oral arguments , Roberts could n’t have been more dismissive of the plight of poor and minority voters at the heart of the case .
Like the other conservatives , Roberts , who earned $ 1 million a year in private practice , could n’t seem to fathom that there are people in this country who do n’t have a photo ID .
When informed that a voter who did n’t have ID would have to travel to a county clerk ’s office to provide addition documentation for her vote to be counted , Roberts quipped that in his home state of Indiana , county clerk ’s offices were n’t too far apart .
The plaintiffs ’ lawyer , Paul Smith , countered that for a poor person living in Gary , Indiana , the county clerk ’s office was quite a schlep , 17 miles .
( “ Seventeen miles is 17 miles for the rich and the poor , ” Antonin Scalia chimed in . )
Smith gently reminded the justices that the people he was talking about did n’t have driver ’s licenses .
That ’s why they could n’t vote at their local polling places .
For them , getting to the clerk ’s office would require using public transportation , which , anyone who ’s ever spent much time on public transit would surely know , gets less and less frequent and reliable the farther you have to travel .
What was striking about the exchange between Smith and Roberts , though , was n’t just Roberts ’ unfamiliarity with riding the bus , but his lack of any apparent understanding of the lives of people on the lower end of the economic spectrum .
In this regard , Roberts is not alone on the court .
It ’s clear that many of the justices would rather not see these sorts of folks appearing on their docket at all .
Simon Lazarus , public policy counsel at the National Senior Citizens Law Center , calls it the “ arrogant abstractness ” that predominates the court today .
The court ’s overt hostility to average - or low - income people is in itself keeping people out of court .
One possible reason the Supreme Court docket is so crowded with business cases is that liberal public interest lawyers are avoiding it , says John Bouman , the president of the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law .
“ There ’s very little empathy on the court , ” he says , and as a result “ people are showing restraint as to whether to take things up at all . ”
The change in the docket may only reinforce the court ’s ivory - tower qualities .
The fewer everyday people who make their cases in court , the fewer opportunities the justices will have to let their perceptions evolve .
One of the selling points of lifetime tenure for Supreme Court justices is that it can free them from politics and allow them to focus on the law and the facts of the cases before them .
It is supposed to allow for evolution , which has been known to happen .
Justice John Paul Stevens , now the last remaining reliable liberal on the court , is himself a Republican appointee , nominated by Gerald Ford .
His views on such hot - button issues as affirmative action and obscenity have changed during his many years on the court .
Even former Chief Justice Rehnquist , who as a law clerk once wrote that he thought Plessy v. Ferguson , the case upholding racial segregation , ought to be reaffirmed , eventually came to champion Brown v. Board of Education .
But you do have to wonder about the current crop of young conservatives like Roberts .
Insulated from the real world through an adult life of privilege , insulated from actual people by years of conservative legal rulings , it ’s hard to see where the opportunities for growth will come from .
As Arthur Bryant , the executive director of Public Justice , a public - interest law firm , says , “ Our system of justice cannot do justice if people cannot get into court . ”

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- Wall Street giants Citigroup Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. are both negotiating further capital injections from overseas investors as they continue to suffer from the credit market crisis , according to a published report Thursday .
Citigroup C , - 2.12 % could get as much as $ 10 billion from foreign governments and Merrill Lynch MER , +27.69 % is expected to receive $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion , with much of the cash coming from a Middle Eastern government investment fund , The Wall Street Journal reported .
“ ' As long as Merrill 's fourth - quarter write - down comes in under $ 15 billion , the company would remain well capitalized . ' ” — Brad Hintz , analyst
Citi is also expected to consider slashing its dividend in half in a move that would save it around $ 2.5 billion a year , the newspaper reported .
Both firms are rushing to finalize the deals before they report earnings next week , which will likely include further losses from exposure to mortgage - related securities , such as collateralized debt obligations .
Merrill is likely to write down the value of its CDO and subprime mortgage - backed security exposures by $ 10 billion next week , Bernstein Research estimated .
Such hits have increased concern that banks and brokerage firms may not be capitalized well enough and sent many companies in search of fresh cash .
" As long as Merrill 's fourth - quarter write - down comes in under $ 15 billion , the company would remain well capitalized , " Brad Hintz , an analyst at Bernstein , wrote a note to client on Thursday .
" A $ 20 billion write - down this quarter or above would significantly increase leverage and would threaten the credit ratings of the firm . "
The firm has three main options for boosting capital : raise new money from outside investors again ; sell its stake in financial data company Bloomberg LP ( worth roughly $ 4 billion ) ; or cut Merrill 's fixed - income business by one - third to free up about $ 3 billion of capital , Hintz explained .
Fresh capital injections would come just weeks after Merrill , Citigroup and others first tapped financing from overseas investors .
In late November Citigroup got a $ 7.5 billion injection from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , which gave the investor up to a 4.9 % stake in the group as well as annual interest payments of 11 % .
See full story .
Merrill , meanwhile , said in late December that it would raise up to $ 6.2 billion from Singapore - based investment firm Temasek Holding and U.S. money manager Davis Selected Advisers .
Other firms that have looked to the Middle East and Asia to help shore up their capital include Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % and Switzerland 's UBS UBS , - 0.54 % .
Citigroup and Merrill shares were mixed during earlier afternoon trading on Thursday .
Bank stocks in general got a boost after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said monetary policymakers are ready to take substantial additional action .
The Journal reported that Citigroup 's board is expected to meet on Monday to discuss the financing and potential dividend cut .
Citigroup had previously said its dividend was safe , but newly installed Chief Executive Vikram Pandit is seen as more willing to consider radical steps and is also expected to announce major job cuts , the newspaper reported .
This document serves as a starting point for MySQL performance tuning .
This document is a combination of research and experience .
When I started this document , I utilized a great Google video [ 1 ] as a reference for the document structure and many bullet items .
I would suggest watching this video .
I then filled in a few blanks , and combined a few other articles into this overview .
You may also want to check out this good article from MySQL on performance tuning ..
Now onto the show ..
Benchmarking
As with all improvement activities , it is better to start with a known problem area that is able to be defined , or an activity where improvement will provide maximum benefit ( the 80/20 rule works everywhere ) .
Nobody can really grasp an intangible goal like “ we want to achieve excellence ” [ 4 ] .
The following are decent guidelines to start with [ 1 ] :
Target .
You must have a target .
Establish a baseline .
Change only one thing at a time ( if possible ) .
Record Everything , you will need it at some point .
Optionally disable query_cache , by setting query_cache_size = 0 for benchmarking .
In addition , the following benchmarking utilities may prove to be useful [ 5 ] :
Super Smack – http://vegan.net/tony/supersmack/
Super Smack is a benchmarking , stress testing , and load generation tool for MySQL ( and PostgreSQL ) .
Super Smack was originally written by Sasha Pachev , and then hosted and maintained by Jeremy Zawodny .
SysBench – http://sysbench.sourceforge.net/
SysBench is a modular , cross-platform and multi- threaded benchmark tool for evaluating OS parameters that are important for a system running a database under intensive load .
mybench – http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mybench/
mybench is a simple benchmarking framework for MySQL , written in Perl .
It consists of a module ( MyBench. pm ) and an example script ( bench_example ) that you should customize to suit your needs .
Profiling concepts
Be familiar with the Explain command and access types in the explain command .
Use slow query log and mysqldumpslow command to help you determine where problems really exists .
Low hanging fruit .
Tackle stuff that is getting you the best ROI on your time .
Use MyTOP by Jeremy Zawodny
Use tuning - primer.sh – http://www.day32.com/MySQL/
Sources of problem
Poor indexes
Inefficient or Bloated schema design .
Bad coding practices , using joins is typically more efficient than subqueries .
Server variables
Tuning parameters help but are specific to scenario OLTP , OLAP , memory , system Architecture , storage engine .
Meaning , no one size fits all solution really exists .
However , you can tune based on some recommendations from other parameters .
Tweak one thing , rerun benchmarks ..
Server and network bottlenecks
Index Guidelines
Poor or missing indexes are the fastest way to kill a system .
Look for covering index opportunities .
MySQL gets all info from index records , and uses it to complete the query , without having to go into the data records .
Ensure good selectivity on index fields .
Make sure you look at selectivity , or cardinality ( unique values / total values in table ) .
[ cardinality of 1 is the best case ] .
Multi-column indexes , pay attention to order of fields .
As database grows ensure distribution is good .
Know how your data changes over time .
Re-analyze your data and distribution of indexes over time .
Remove redundant indexes for faster write performance .
System tuning
Be aware of global vs threaded parameters , key buffers size , global .
Sort buffer size , per thread .
Make small changes ( preferably single ) , retest .
System parameter tuning is often a quick , temporary solution to a larger issue .
Query_cache , off by default .
read intensive applications , turn query_cache on .
Key_buffer_size != innodb_buffer_pool_size
innodb_buffer_pool_size about 50 - 90 % of total memory suggested typically .
Ensure you have analyzed and optimized your tables .
You may also be surprised at just what an effect optimizing a MyISAM table that has dynamic rows will do .. use the ‘ optimize table ’ SQL command
Parameters
table_cache
Opening tables can be expensive .
For example MyISAM tables mark MYI header to mark table as currently in use .
You do not want this to happen so frequently and it is typically best to size your cache so it is large enough to keep most of your tables open .
Use the tuning - primer.sh ( http://www.day32.com/MySQL/) script to evaluate the current value .
query_cache_size
If your application is read intensive and you do not have application level caches this can be great help .
Use the tuning - primer script to evaluate the size after you enable it .
A good starting point may be 8M .
The query_cache_size will be aligned to the nearest 1024 byte block .
The value reported may therefore be different from the value that you set .
If the query cache size is greater than 0 , then query_cache_type variable influences how it works .
This variable can be set to the following values :
query_cache_type
* A value of 0 or OFF prevents caching or retrieval of cached results .
* A value of 1 or ON allows caching except of those statements that begin with SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE .
* A value of 2 or DEMAND causes caching of only those statements that begin with SELECT SQL_CACHE .
thread_cache
mysql > SHOW STATUS LIKE ‘ Thread % ’ ;
mysq > show status like ‘ Connections ’ ; Threads_created details the number of threads that have been created since the MySQL server started , and Connections is the total number of client connections to the MySQL server since startup .
To work out the thread cache hit ratio , we use this calculation :
100 – ( ( Threads_created / Connections ) * 100 )
100 – ( ( 10 / 78298 ) * 100 ) = ~99.987
Thread cache hit ratio
The ideal situation is to get Threads_created as close as possible to thread_cache_size – no new connections having to wait for new thread allocation – staying as close to around a 99 % hit ratio as you can .
mysql > show status like ‘ Select_full_join ’ ;
The number of joins that do not use indexes .
If this value is not 0 , you should carefully check the indexes of your tables .
ratio of disk tmp tables vrs in memory tmp tables ( tmp_table_size )
Handler_read_rnd
mysql > show status like ‘ Handler_read_rnd % ’ ;
The number of requests to read a row based on a fixed position .
This value is high if you are doing a lot of queries that require sorting of the result .
You probably have a lot of queries that require MySQL to scan entire tables or you have joins that do n’t use keys properly .
Handler_read_rnd_next
The number of requests to read the next row in the data file .
This value is high if you are doing a lot of table scans .
Generally this suggests that your tables are not properly indexed or that your queries are not written to take advantage of the indexes you have .
key_buffer_size
Very important if you use MyISAM tables .
key_buffer_size is important for MyISAM temporary tables performance to avoid OS writes , see this page for more detail .
Again , evaluate the value using the tuning - primer.sh script .
innodb_buffer_pool_size
This is very important variable to tune if you ’re using Innodb tables .
Innodb tables are much more sensitive to buffer size compared to MyISAM .
innodb_additional_mem_pool_size
This one does not really affect performance too much , at least on OS with decent memory allocators .
Still you might want to have it 20 MB ( sometimes larger ) so you can see how much memory Innodb allocates for misc needs .
innodb_log_file_size
Very important for write intensive workloads especially for large data sets .
Larger sizes offer better performance but increase recovery times so be careful .
I normally use values 64 M - 512 M depending on server size .
innodb_log_buffer_size
Default for this one is kind of OK for many workloads with medium write load and shorter transactions .
If you have update activity spikes however or work with blobs a lot you might want to increase it .
Do not set it too high however as it would be waste of memory – it is flushed every 1 sec anyway so you do not need space for more than 1 sec worth of updates .
8MB -16MB are typically enough .
Smaller installations should use smaller values .
innodb_flush_logs_at_trx_commit
Default value of 1 will mean each update transaction commit ( or each statement outside of transaction ) will need to flush log to the disk which is rather expensive , especially if you do not have Battery backed up cache .
Many applications , especially those moved from MyISAM tables are OK with value 2 which means do not flush log to the disk but only flush it to OS cache .
The log is still flushed to the disk each second so you normally would not loose more than 1 - 2 sec worth of updates .
Value 0 is a bit faster but is a bit less secure as you can lose transactions even in case MySQL Server crashes .
Value 2 only cause data loss with full OS crash .
OPTIMIZE TABLE should be used if you have deleted a large part of a table or if you have made many changes to a table with variable - length rows ( tables that have VARCHAR , VARBINARY , BLOB , or TEXT columns ) .

PLOCNIK , Serbia ( Reuters ) -
If the figurines found in an ancient European settlement are any guide , women have been dressing to impress for at least 7,500 years .
A Neolithic figurine shows a girl in a short skirt and ornate top , found in the Plocnik archaeological site near the town of Prokuplje in southern Serbia , November 3 , 2007 .
Recent excavations at the site -- part of the Vinca culture which was Europe 's biggest prehistoric civilisation -- point to a metropolis with a great degree of sophistication and a taste for art and fashion .

Recent excavations at the site -- part of the Vinca culture which was Europe ’s biggest prehistoric civilization -- point to a metropolis with a great degree of sophistication and a taste for art and fashion , archaeologists say .
In the Neolithic settlement in a valley nestled between rivers , mountains and forests in what is now southern Serbia , men rushed around a smoking furnace melting metal for tools .
An ox pulled a load of ore , passing by an art workshop and a group of young women in short skirts .
“ According to the figurines we found , young women were beautifully dressed , like today ’s girls in short tops and mini skirts , and wore bracelets around their arms , ” said archaeologist Julka Kuzmanovic - Cvetkovic .
The unnamed tribe who lived between 5400 and 4700 BC in the 120 - hectare site at what is now Plocnik knew about trade , handcrafts , art and metallurgy .
Near the settlement , a thermal well might be evidence of Europe ’s oldest spa .
“ They pursued beauty and produced 60 different forms of wonderful pottery and figurines , not only to represent deities , but also out of pure enjoyment , ” said Kuzmanovic .
The findings suggest an advanced division of labor and organization .
Houses had stoves , there were special holes for trash , and the dead were buried in a tidy necropolis .
People slept on woolen mats and fur , made clothes of wool , flax and leather and kept animals .
The community was especially fond of children .
Artifacts include toys such as animals and rattles of clay , and small , clumsily crafted pots apparently made by children at playtime .
COPPER AGE
One of the most exciting finds for archaeologists was the discovery of a sophisticated metal workshop with a furnace and tools including a copper chisel and a two - headed hammer and axe .
“ This might prove that the Copper Age started in Europe at least 500 years earlier than we thought , ” Kuzmanovic said .
The Copper Age marks the first stage of humans ’ use of metal , with copper tools used alongside older stone implements .
It is thought to have started around the 4th millennium BC in south - east Europe , and earlier in the Middle East .
The Vinca culture flourished from 5500 to 4000 BC on the territories of what is now Bosnia , Serbia , Romania and Macedonia .
It got its name from the present - day village of Vinca , 10 km east of Belgrade on the Danube river , where early 20th - century excavations uncovered the remains of eight Neolithic villages .
The discovery of a mine -- Europe ’s oldest -- at the nearby Mlava river suggested at the time that Vinca could be Europe ’s first metal culture , a theory now backed up by the Plocnik site .
“ These latest findings show that the Vinca culture was from the very beginning a metallurgical culture , ” said archaeologist Dusan Sljivar of Serbia ’s National Museum .
“ They knew how to find minerals , to transport them and melt them into tools . ”
The metal workshop in Plocnik was a room of some 25 square meters , with walls built out of wood coated with clay .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The furnace , built on the outside of the room , featured earthen pipe - like air vents with hundreds of tiny holes in them and a prototype chimney to ensure air goes into the furnace to feed the fire and smoke comes out safely .
“ In Bulgaria and Cyprus , where such workshops have also been found , they did n’t have chimneys but blew air on the fire with straws , exposing man to heat and carbon dioxide , ” Sljivar said .
COLOURFUL MINERALS
He said the early metal workers very likely experimented with colorful minerals that caught their eye -- blue azurite , bright green malachite and red cuprite , all containing copper -- as evidenced by malachite traces found on the inside of a pot .
The settlement was destroyed at some point , probably in the first part of the fifth millennium , by a huge fire .
The Plocnik site was first discovered in 1927 when the then Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes was building a rail line from the southern city of Nis to the province of Kosovo .
Some findings were published at the time but war , lack of funds and objections from farmers meant it was investigated only sporadically until digging started in earnest in 1996 .
“ The saddest thing for us is always the moment when we finish our work and everything has to be covered up with earth again , ” Kuzmanovic said .
“ That ’s the easiest for the state , conservation is very expensive and the land owners want to work in their fields . ”
But there was some hope that the latest excavation would be preserved due to its importance , Kuzmanovic added .
“ We dream of uncovering the entire town one day , and people will be able to see prehistoric life at its fullest , ” she said .

I offer the question because it 's being posed by the West 's most senior central bankers .
Last week the US Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , the Bank of England and the Swiss and Canadian central banks simultaneously injected some £ 50 billion of cash into their beleaguered banking systems .
It is the outward signal of their profound private concern , as I have learned from those making the decisions .
Central bankers are a curious breed .
They usually remain above the financial fray but get their hands dirty when it matters .
They are trackers in the financial jungle , picking up signals and sounds that mere mortals simply do not .
What is spooking them is that despite differing reactions to the credit crisis , all face a continuing and deepening crisis in their interbank markets - the markets in which big banks lend billions to each other .
This , I 'm told , was top of the agenda at a meeting in Cape Town some weeks ago when last week 's intervention was first mooted .
For two decades western banks have expanded their lending far ahead of the growth in the western economy , and acutely in Britain and the US .
That has led to crazy lending on the high street .
Infamously , the American sub - prime mortgage market now faces up to $ 300bn of potential loan write - offs .
That may sound like a lot of money , and indeed it is , but it is less than the annual profits of North American and European banks .
They should have been able to take the hit in their stride .
The evidence is that they have not .
The growing fear among central bankers is that the system has over - reached itself , rather as the US banks did in the 1920s .
Paul Tucker , the Bank of England 's executive director for financial markets , last week gave a window into their thinking when he described the risk of a ' feedback loop ' between the financial markets and real economy that could create a downward economic spiral .
As banks retrenched , so the economy would get weaker - forcing another round of bank retrenchment and subsequent economic weakness .
Make no mistake , there are banks fighting for their lives .
To find capital , they are turning to the only organisations with sufficient funds - the state investment companies in the Gulf and Asia fattened by high oil prices and vast foreign exchange reserves .
Last week Citigroup , the world 's biggest bank , sold a share stake to the Abu Dhabi government to raise desperately needed funds ; Barclays has sold a stake to the Chinese government ; the Swiss bank UBS a stake to the Singapore government .
They are the first of many .
The financial crisis could prompt the partial takeover of the western banking system by Arab and Asian governments .
I know at least one central banker who spent the summer reading JK Galbraith 's Great Crash .
The first task of President Franklin D Roosevelt after his election in 1932 was the recapitalisation of the bankrupt American banks by new public agencies - which his Republican critics decried as socialism .
But it pulled the US out of slump .
Unless the western interbank markets start functioning again soon , the question will arise as to which governments are going to bail the western banks out of their foolishness .
Will it be our own - or that of Mr Hu Jintao and the potentates of various oil producing Arab states ?
Thus the conversation in Cape Town .
Ominously , the first reaction to last week 's injection of funds was a sell - off in the stock markets , but by Friday there were hopes that it might have delivered some short - term relief .
The British government should be heeding central bankers ' concerns .
It should be publicly announcing pre-emptive plans to support distressed mortgage holders and distressed lenders .
It should be recasting the system of financial regulation , so that banks become tightly regulated , like utilities , as a quid pro quo for government guarantees of their deposits .
Banks and building societies should be required to be much less reckless in their lending .
The bill providing for the nationalisation of Northern Rock should be widened to include the other banks that will require short - term assistance .
The UK should be pressing for a proper system of international financial governance and regulation .
All that requires some conviction - which is in chronically short supply .
New Labour in office has consistently genuflected to the City 's interests , allowing itself to be bullied into making breathtaking regulatory and tax concessions , and thus colluding in the financial frenzy .
Now it must change gear - and fast .
Or risk the recession that the central bankers fear .
The blogs have drawn their share of negative , even vicious comments .
But for overweight readers , the messages are empowering  and liberating .
“ Girlfriend , let me tell you , I am finally coming to grips with myself , ” one fan commented on Ms. Harding ’s site .
“ I will always be fat .
I accept that now . ”
Harriet Brown , a 49 - year - old blogger in Wisconsin and an occasional contributor to The New York Times , encourages readers to take her “ I Love My Body Pledge ” ( at harrietbrown.com ) , in which they promise not to talk “ trash ” about “ how fat my thighs or stomach ” are , and not “ call myself a fat pig . ”
Fat Fu’s anonymous blog ( fatfu.wordpress.com ) has a ruthless deconstruction of recent research like the “ fat friends ” study , as well as one of the most comprehensive lists of links to the fatosphere , including online communities , fashions and health sites for fat people .
The Big Fat Deal blog ( bfdblog.com ) suggests 10 ways to be a “ body positivity activist , ” including “ Be yourself , ” “ Understand that a lot of people are hateful morons ” and “ Do n’t be afraid to order the cheesecake . ”
Many of the bloggers are women whose writing has a distinctly feminist flavor , but there are male fat - acceptance bloggers like Red No. 3 ( red3.blogspot.com ) , who says : “ See , I do n’t have a problem with fat .
My body is simply adorned , and I ’ll take that . ”
But some experts say this sort of message is dangerous and undermines public health efforts to rein in obesity .
“ We do have to be careful not to put all the blame on the individual , ” said Dr. Walter C. Willett , professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health .
But he added , “ The large majority of people who are overweight are overweight because of lifestyle . ”
The bloggers argue that changes in definitions over time , along with flaws in the body mass index formula , have pushed more Americans into the “ fat ” and “ obese ” categories , and they point to provocative studies suggesting that there may be benefits to being overweight , including a large study that found that underweight Americans are more likely to die than those who are moderately overweight .
In a tight race , the Democratic Party 's pick for presidential candidate could be decided by superdelegates – 795 party insiders who are free to vote for anybody they want at the party 's national convention .
Candidates lobby for those votes fiercely , in a process that 's always unfolded behind the scenes .
But now , thanks to the internet and wiki software , voters can see exactly what those superdelegates are up to , and can even try to apply a little pressure of their own .
Critics of the superdelegate process , which many think will benefit the party insider , Hillary Clinton , have created several new websites that use collaborative software to focus attention on the superdelegates , in the hope that once under a microscope , they 'll resist lures like financial contributions and political quid pro quos offered by the competing campaigns .
" There is an unprecedented level of interest in superdelegates , and with this information there 's an unprecedented opportunity to pressure those superdelegates however [ voters ] want to pressure them , " says Chris Bowers , co-founder of OpenLeft , and one of the organizers of the Superdelegate Transparency Project .
The Transparency Project lets you click on a map to see which superdelegates come from your state , and who they currently support – Clinton or Obama – if anyone .
Every Democratic member of Congress is a superdelegate automatically , and the site 's most enlightening feature lets you compare whom they support with whom their constituents favor .
Representative Dennis Cardoza , of California 's 18th District , for example , has pledged his vote to Hillary Clinton , while voters in his district favored Barack Obama by 3 - 2 in the Feb. 5 primary .
The site shows scores of similar cases in which a representative 's commitment is at odds with the will of his or her constituents ; they include superdelegates pledged to both Clinton and Obama .
That trend is what worries 36 - year - old Rick Klau , who started a similar site called Superdelegates.org , which explains the Byzantine primary voting process , and geographically maps all the superdelegates .
" As an Obama supporter , I would find it terribly distressing if he won more states and more votes and had more pledged delegates , and was n't the party 's nominee , " says Klau , a manager at Google .
The 795 superdelegates make up 20 percent of the more than 3,000 Democratic party delegates :
The presidential contenders need 2,025 to win .
As of Thursday afternoon , Clinton had 985 pledged delegates as a result of voters ' choices in primaries and caucuses , and the endorsements of 259 superdelegates .
Obama had 1,116 pledged delegates and 181 superdelegate endorsements , which gives him a slight lead , according to NBC .
Not only are superdelegates free to disregard the will of their constituents ; if they have them , they 're also under no obligation to vote in line with the popular vote for Democratic candidate .
And they can change their minds at any time up until the national convention in August .
On Thursday , the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics released a report showing that Obama and Clinton have together contributed more than $ 900,000 to superdelegates ' election campaigns in the last three years .
The report showed that Obama 's political action committee far outstripped Clinton 's in donations .
His PAC donated almost $ 700,000 , while hers has donated almost $ 200,000 .
MoveOn.org and the Obama camp argue that the elected delegates should vote in line with the will of their constituents .
Earlier this week , MoveOn sent a note out to its 3.2 million members asking them to sign a petition to that effect .
It 's the first time the public has lobbied superdelegates to a convention , says Larry Sabato , a political science professor at the University of Virginia .
" The public has never had reason to lobby them before . "
Some congressional representatives are feeling torn between voting their own opinions as professional politicians , and voting as representatives of their districts .
On Friday for example , The New York Times disclosed that Clinton endorser and civil rights leader congressman John Lewis of Georgia was reconsidering his support for Clinton because Obama had won Lewis ' district .
The razor - thin margin between Obama and Clinton in the contest so far has made the superdelegates ' influence a matter of intense public interest , but until recently , voters could n't easily find the relevant information .
The blog DemConWatch , short for Democratic Convention Watch , was the first to start digging into the superdelegates .
There , anonymous bloggers painstakingly compiled a list of superdelegates from press releases and statements in news articles .
Site statistics show that it had 172,000 visits this week .
One of the site administrators says that visitors come from the government and news agencies .
On Friday , DemConWatch announced that it is teaming up with the Superdelegate Transparency Project , a project of the progressive blogs OpenLeft and The Literary Outpost , and the staff at a Washington , D.C. , nonprofit called the Sunlight Foundation .
About 50 volunteers are contributing to the wiki , says Avelino Maestas , an editor at the Sunlight Foundation .
But William Galston , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a veteran of Democrat Walter Mondale 's presidential campaign , thinks much of the alarm over the superdelegates ' independence is unjustified .
" If one candidate has a clear and significant majority of the elected delegates , the superdelegates will not act to override that majority , " he says .
" They wo n't do it because they are political professionals and they know what acrimony and division that would create within the party . "
Diffie - Hellman is a key exchange protocol developed by Diffie and Hellman ( imagine that ) in 1976 .
The purpose of Diffie - Hellman is to allow two entities to exchange a secret over a public medium without having anything shared beforehand .
As it turns out , this is an extremely important function , and understanding how Diffie - Hellman accomplishes this should be a point of interest for any information security enthusiast .
Basics
Two values , called Diffie - Hellman parameters , are at the core of this protocol , and they consist of a very large prime number p , and a second related “ generator ” number that is smaller than p , called g .
The value for g is tied very strongly to its associated p value .
The nature of this relationship is that for each number n , there is a power k of g such that n = g^k % p .
Each host must agree on these two parameters ( p and g ) in order for the protocol to work .
Finally , a third and private value , called x is also generated for each host .
This value , unlike p and g , is not shared .
Exchanges
Public values ( to be exchanged with each other ) are then generated with this function :
y = g^x % p
… or in other words , take value g and raise it to the power of value x , divide that by p , and your remainder is your public value y .
Then , the two parties exchange their y ‘s with each other and the exchanged numbers are used to create the shared secret z as follows :
z = y^x % p
… or , take the exchanged public key y and raise it to the power of your private key x , and divide that by the shared value p .
The shared secret , z , is the remainder of that operation .
Results
The beauty of Diffie - Hellman is that after each party does this independently , they will both end up with the exact same value for z !.
This means they now have an outstanding key for whatever encryption algorithm they decide on using for the rest of their communication .
This works because :
z = ( g^x % p ) ^x ' % p = ( g^x ' % p ) ^x % p
Note that the portion of the equation above in parenthesis is the other host ’s “ public key ” , and that it has the other host ’s private value in it .
This is what makes the arrival at a mutual secret possible mathematically .
So here ’s how it breaks down :
Exchange some numbers over a public medium Create your own private number that wo n’t be exchanged Generate a public “ key ” from the previously agreed upon numbers combined with your private value Perform a calculation using their public , your private , and the shared information Your result will match that of your partner doing the same thing
You now have a shared secret without it ever crossing the public medium !
… or in other words , take the exchanged public key ‘y ’ and raise it to the power of your private key ‘ x ’ , and divide that by the shared value ‘ p ’ .
The shared secret , ‘ z ’ , is the remainder of that operation .
The beauty of Diffie - Hellman is that both parties will end up with the same value for ‘z ’!
And ‘z ’ makes an outstanding key for whatever encryption algorithm they decide on using for the rest of their communication .
This works because :
z = ( g^x % p ) ^x ' % p = ( g^x ' % p) ^x % p
The key concept here is that the portion of the equation above in parenthesis is the other host ’s public key .
Notice that it has the other host ’s private value in it .
That ’s what makes the attainment of a mutual secret possible mathematically .
The magic of Diffie - Hellman is that you not only end up with a shared secret , but the secret is never sent over the wire .
Each side comes up with it independently , and that ’s what makes the protocol so beautiful .
Beginning this spring , the genomic start - up company Navigenics will sell spit kits for $ 2,500 to those curious enough to learn more about their DNA .
Along with results telling you the genetic disorders you can look forward to , you receive advice on how to reduce your chances of developing up to 20 diseases and an offer of genetic counseling sessions .
But paying $ 2,500 to find out that you are predisposed to Alzheimer ’s , which has no cure and few treatment options , could seem like a raw deal .
That ’s why it seemed a bit unfair when , after spending millions to have his entire genome sequenced , Craig Venter found out that he has the apolipoprotein E gene , predisposing him to Alzheimer ’s .
But Venter is unfazed .
In fact , he has no regrets about the finding .
Instead he is trying to do something about it — hoping to push back the onset of the disease by taking drugs , changing his diet , and exercising .
“ I do n’t feel like I have the threat of Alzheimer ’s disease hanging over my future , ” says Venter .
The only person in his family since the early 16th century to have dementia was his great - grandmother , so the familial type of Alzheimer ’s , which is responsible for about 3 percent of cases , is not likely .
It ’s the type called sporadic Alzheimer ’s disease that Venter is trying to avoid ; it causes 97 percent of cases .
For those of us lucky enough to reach age 85 , half of us will suffer Alzheimer ’s .
By 2050 , one in 85 people around the world will suffer from it — four times the current number .
Venter is taking proactive measures .
He now takes statins , cholesterol - lowering drugs that are the top- selling medications in the United States , because he has heard from friends in the pharmaceutical industry that statins could prevent the onset of Alzheimer ’s .
Statins reduce the amount of cholesterol the liver produces by blocking the enzyme needed to make it .
But it ’s unclear if statins have an effect on cholesterol in the brain .
Jerome Goldstein , director of the San Francisco Alzheimer ’s and Dementia Clinic , is n’t convinced they are all that effective .
It ’s true that “ bad ” cholesterol impairs your brain function , Goldstein says , but without cholesterol in your brain , you do n’t form nerves .
He prescribes statins to treat his patients with Alzheimer ’s disease because it might possibly delay the disease ’s progression .
Giulio M. Pasinetti , director of the Center of Excellence for Research in Alzheimer ’s Disease at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York , is more adamant about statins ’ lack of effectiveness , saying that large - scale clinical studies have proved that they do n’t have any effect on the cholesterol in the brain .
“ Thank god statins do n’t change it , ” says Pasinetti .
" You do n’t want to interfere with the fine - tuned mechanism associated with the function of the brain by changing the cholesterol level in the brain . ”
Pasinetti’s research is based on more holistic , natural treatments .
Pasinetti has shown that polyphenols in red wine reduce cognitive decline — and may prevent it — in mice genetically altered to develop Alzheimer ’s ; he hopes to prescribe red wine ( and grape juice varieties ) to humans in the future .
Pasinetti also suggests that exercising regularly , restricting caloric intake , and choosing healthy nutrients will go a long way to prevent Alzheimer ’s disease .
Goldstein agrees .
“ There are other things you can do that will prolong life .
Walk a mile a day .
Solve crossword puzzles .
Read instead of watching TV .
Take certain vitamins .
Take good health measures .
Control cholesterol . ”
Although no one agrees just how to deal with the knowledge that one is likely to get Alzheimer ’s , millions of dollars is spent on research into the disease each year .
With personal genetic testing ready to take off , that ’s good news for the many people who will be learning their genetic predispositions .

Nintendo is developing a ground breaking new holographic video system that should give it a leg up in the highly competitive world of gaming consoles .
The new system utilizes a technology first developed at MIT and uses sophisticated software to render 3D images and bring a whole new reality to gaming .
The revoltionary system works first by using the beautifully rendered 3D images already present in games like Ghost squad and then the specialized software calculates a laser diffraction pattern which is needed to create the hologram .
To create a full color spectrum image three different light interferance patterns are needed for each of the primary colors .
The video signal is then sent into a light modulator , which is made up of a waveguide where light travels , covered by a piezoelectric material that converts the video signal into vibrations .
The video signal bends the shape of the piezoelectric material , which actually changes the properties of the light moving through the waveguide .
The light wave that is emitted is composed of various intensities and frequencies , that when projected can recreate a three - dimensional scene .

PASCAGOULA , Miss . Nov. 26 — Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi , who was forced to step down as Republican leader in 2002 after making a remark that seemed to support segregation , announced today that he will resign by the end of the year .
Speaking to a crowd of supporters at a televised news conference in Pascagoula , Miss. , Mr. Lott said he and his wife , Trish , had decided that they still had enough “ time left to do something else ” after his 35 years in the House and Senate .
He said he had “ nothing definite at this time , ” but suggested he might want to teach .
He said he had called President Bush and Vice President Cheney last night to notify them of his decision .
He was re-elected in 2006 to his fourth Senate term and had rebounded to become the No. 2 Republican this year after his party had lost its majority in the Senate .
But in recent months , Mr. Lott , 66 , has made no secret of his deepening frustration in the Senate , not only because his party is in the minority but also because an increasingly bitter partisan divide this year has left little use for his skills as a deal - maker .
US - based China Aid Association ( CAA ) , which has close contacts with the Christians , told BosNewsLife that officials of the ‘ China Gospel Fellowship ’ ( CGF ) house church group were detained by Chinese security forces in Henan province on November 18 during a Bible study meeting in Peichang village in the area of Fanhu town .
It said officials of the local Public Security Bureau , one of China ’s main law enforcement agencies , detained the church leaders .
While 21 have since been released 19 others remained behind bars Wednesday , November 28 , CAA added .
LIVING EXPENSES
" Family members of the 19 detainees were notified by police to send blankets and 360 yuan ( $ 50 ) for 15 days living expenses , " CAA said .
Among those detained is CGF founder Pastor Shen Yiping , the group added .
CAA said it also established that another pastor , identified as Liu Huiwen , was sentenced to 18 months of prison by Gansu Dongxiang Nationality Autonomous County People ’s Court last month for distributing Christian materials among Muslims .
" Liu was detained on April 28 , [ this year ] after distributing flyers at a funeral and was arrested on May 31 .
The bill of indictment from Dongxiang County Procuratorate charges that defendant Liu Huiwen committed the crime of publishing a discriminating work and insulting people of ethnic minorities when he distributed a flyer called ‘ A Letter to Our Muslim Friends ’ , ” CAA said .
" NO DISCRIMINATION "
In published remarks , the defense attorney for pastor Liu , Li Dunyong , countered that the public letter " does not contain any discrimination or insults against people of ethnic minorities . "
He said " it was not intended for the people of ethnic minorities " and that it was " a case of minor circumstance and that the conduct of the defendant has not exceeded the boundary set for freedom of speech . "
The arguments were rejected by the court , CAA said , adding that the trial “ was not fair and the 18 - month heavy sentence ” was in its words a barbarous attempt by the Chinese authorities to stem the growth of Christianity that is expanding in China . "
It said it had urged Christians worldwide and governments to pressure Chinese authorities " to retry the case through strict and accurate interpretation of the relevant Chinese law . "
Rights watchers claim China ’s government has stepped up a crackdown on house churches amid concerns within the Communist Party that believers will use the upcoming Olympic Games in Beijing as a venue to spread Christianity .
Chinese officials have strongly denied any wrongdoing and say Chinese Christians are free to worship within the walls of the ‘ official ’ churches .
My September column for the Visual Thesaurus , “ A Slogan in Every Pot ! ” , looks at the history of political slogans — from “ Tippecanoe and Tyler Too ” ( 1840 ) to “ Build Back Better ” ( 2020 ) .
Full access to the column is restricted to subscribers ; here ’s an excerpt .
Campaign slogans are “ miniature narratives , ” says Philip Seargeant , a British linguist and author of The Art of Political Storytelling : Why Stories Win Votes in Post - truth Politics ( 2020 ) .
Successful slogans , he told me in an email , “ place the desire for change at their heart , and foreground the need for action to accomplish that change . ”
Change through action is at the heart of slogans like " Make America Great Again ” — Donald Trump 's 2016 campaign motto , often compressed into a hashtagged acronym , # MAGA — and “ Take Back Control , ” a Brexit slogan .
“ Both use imperatives — ‘ make ’ ‘ take ’ — which urge a form of participation from the electorate , and suggest that together some sort of change can be effected in society , ” Seargeant says .
“ Make America Great Again ” was an abbreviated version of the slogan originally used by Ronald Reagan .
In 1984 , Reagan ran for reelection with the hazy , sunny slogan “ It 's Morning in America . ”
Context matters too , says Seargeant : “ A successful slogan will be a mix of the words on the page themselves , plus outside factors which mean these words resonate with a particular mood in society , with the character of the candidate , and with the larger branding of the campaign or movement . ”

Motivation
Programmers in general , and functional programmers in particular , are usually not so content to solve a problem in a fragile way by coding a solution directly .
Quite often the best way to solve a problem is to design a domain - specific language in which the solution to one 's problem is easily expressed .
Doing this generally ensures that a wide class of similar problems can be attacked using the same code .
That way , you get code which is resistant to damage in the form of changes to design requirements .
Better still , we 'd like to embed those domain specific languages into the language which we wrote them in , so that they can be used together , and so we get benefits from the language we 're working in without so much extra work .
So we write combinator libraries which are essentially libraries of code whose API 's are sufficiently powerful that using the library is like programming in a small language embedded within the existing one .
Such a library will have some representation of primitive computations , and some ways to glue those computations together into more complex ones .
A parsing library might define primitive parsers for parsing single characters , and then combining functions for concatenating parsers or selecting between them .
A drawing library might define some basic drawing operations , and then various means of combining drawings into larger ones ( on top , beside , above , etc. ) .
In this manner , the user of the combinator library builds up the computation they want , piecing together smaller parts into larger ones .
As far as programming is concerned , a monad is just a particular style of combinator library .
That is , one which supports a few basic means of combination .
The reason for making this abstraction is so that all the libraries which make use of those means of combination can then share a library of combining functions built up from the primitive ones they are required to support .
Specifically , by defining an instance of Monad for your library when appropriate , you automatically get the benefit of the functions in the Control .
Monad library ( as well as a few others , like Data .
Traversable ) .
This includes things like for - each loops ( forM / mapM ) , ways to turn pure functions into combiners ( liftM2 , etc. ) , as well as other control structures which you get for free just for making your library an instance of Monad .
The parts of a monad
There are of course , other kinds of combinator library , but monads arise fairly naturally from a few basic premises .
Monadic computations have results .
This is reflected in the types .
Given a monad M , a value of type M t is a computation resulting in a value of type t .
It 's important to realise that this is typically just some data structure .
It will be interpreted as a computation and " run " in a way which is dependent on the given library .
is a computation resulting in a value of type .
It 's important to realise that this is typically just some data structure .
It will be interpreted as a computation and " run " in a way which is dependent on the given library .
For any value , there is a computation which " does nothing " , and produces that result .
This is given by defining the function return for the given monad .
return :: ( Monad m ) => a -> m a
for the given monad .
Given a pair of computations x and y , one can form the computation x >> y , which intuitively " runs " the computation x , throws away its result , then runs y returning its result .
( >> ) :: ( Monad m ) => m a -> m b -> m b
and , one can form the computation , which intuitively " runs " the computation , throws away its result , then runs returning its result .
Further , we 're allowed to use the result of the first computation to decide " what to do next " , rather than just throwing it away .
This idea is embodied by the operation ( >>= ) , called ' bind ' .
If x is a computation , and f is a function from potential results of that computation to further computations to be performed , then x >>= f is a computation which runs x , then applies f to its result , getting a computation which it then runs .
The result of this latter computation is the result of the combined one .
( >>= ) :: ( Monad m ) => m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
In fact , once we have bind , we can always define ( >> ) as :
x >> y = x >>= ( \ _ -> y )
It 's important to realise that both what it means to " run " a computation , and what " then " means in the above are both up to the monad in question ( subject to a few simple constraints to be discussed later ) .
This point will become clearer as one sees more and more examples .
A few examples
return
( >>= )
IO
getLine :: IO String
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
main :: IO ( ) main = getLine >>= putStrLn
main :: IO ( ) main = putStrLn
" Enter a line of text : " >> getLine >>= \ x -> putStrLn ( reverse x )
char :: Char ->
Parser Char
cat = char ' c ' >> char ' a ' >> char 't ' >> return " It 's a cat . "
" It 's a cat . "
Do notation
On top ofand , any given monad will typically define a bunch of primitive computations to get the user of the library started .
Themonad , for instance , has a large number of I /O operations such asand .
The program : gets a line of text from the user , and then prints it back out .
For a slightly more complicated example , the program : prompts the user for a line of text , gets the line of text from the user , and then prints it back out in reverse .
A parsing monad might define , for constructing a parser which succeeds if the input string matches the given character .
As a very simple example without getting into the details of parsing monads , the parser : would try to match the string " cat " , and if the parse succeeded , would return the string
Because computations are typically going to be built up from long chains of ( >> ) and ( >>= ) , in Haskell , we have some syntax - sugar , called do - notation .
The do - notation allows us to write our second IO program above as :
main = do putStrLn " Enter a line of text : " x <- getLine putStrLn ( reverse x )
The basic mechanical translation for the do - notation is as follows :
do { x } = x do { x ; < stmts > } = x >> do { < stmts > } do { v <- x ; < stmts > } = x >>= \ v -> do { < stmts > } do { let < decls > ; < stmts > } = let < decls > in do { < stmts > }
This gives monadic computations a bit of an imperative feel , but it 's important to remember that the monad in question gets to decide what the combination means , and so some unusual forms of control flow might actually occur .
In some monads ( like parsers , or the list monad ) , " backtracking " may occur , and in others , even more exotic forms of control might show up ( for instance , first - class continuations , or some form of parallelism ) .
The monad laws
However , in order to maintain some semblance of sanity , we agree to make the monads we define follow some basic rules .
I 'll show the three rules both in terms of return and ( >>= ) and do - notation , and try to give some feel of what they really mean .
1 . return v >>= f = f v 2 . x >>= return = x 3 . ( x >>= f ) >>= g = x >>= ( \ v -> f v >>= g )
Rules 1 and 2 basically give one the sense that return v " does nothing " and results in v .
Rule 3 puts a bit of a constraint on what " then " is supposed to mean .
It is perhaps easier at first to look at what it means for ( >> ) :
( x >> y ) >> z = x >> ( y >> z )
This corresponds nicely with our usual reading of ( >> ) as " then " :
putting on your tie , then ( putting on your socks then putting on your shoes )
is the same thing as
( putting on your tie then putting on your socks ) then putting on your shoes .
To get a bit of a different perspective on what the laws mean , let 's see what they look like in do - notation :
1 . do { w <- return v ; f w } = do { f v } 2 . do { v <- x ; return v } = do { x }
These two are again consistent with the idea that return produces a computation that has no " side - effects " , and just returns its parameter .
3 . do w <- do v <- x f v g w = do v <- x w <- f v g w
This is more interesting .
It 's telling us that asking for the result of a compound computation in the midst of a do - block will result in exactly the same thing as if that compound computation had been spliced in directly , and gives us a valid way to refactor code written in any monad .
We 're allowed to abstract a chunk of code out from the middle of a do - block and give it a name without worrying about whether we 've changed the meaning of the code .
The whole point
This is all very good , but apart from defining a pretty syntax for a certain kind of combinator library , the stuff we 've done so far is fairly inessential .
What 's the point of recognising something as a monad ?
The point , as I alluded to in the introduction , is that we can then write code which works for all monads , and have a whole library of code which is made available to us just for recognising that the library we 're writing happens to be a monad .
Since we have only return and bind to work with , this sort of code will serve to chain computations together in some methodical way .
That is to say , it will consist of control structures .
All the examples I 'll give are already defined in the Control .
Monad library , along with many more .
The first example of such a control structure we 'll look at is called sequence .
It 's a function which takes a list of computations of the same type , and builds from them a computation which will run each in turn and produce a list of the results :
sequence :: ( Monad m ) => [ m a ] -> m [ a ] sequence [ ] = return [ ] sequence ( x : xs ) = do v <- x vs <- sequence xs return ( v : vs )
or , without the do - notation :
sequence :: ( Monad m ) => [ m a ] -> m [ a ] sequence [ ] = return [ ] sequence ( x : xs ) = x >>= \ v -> sequence xs >>= \ vs -> return ( v : vs )
( one can start to see why do - notation might be desirable ! )
In a parsing monad , we might pass it a list of parsers , and get back a parser which parses its input using each in turn .
In the IO monad , a simple example might be the following :
main = sequence [ getLine , getLine ] >>= print
which gets two lines of text from the user , and then prints the list .
Since lists are lazy in Haskell , this gives us a sort of primordial loop from which most other kinds of loops can be built .
What is a for - each loop really ?
It 's something which performs some action based on each element of a list .
So we might imagine a function with the type :
forM :: ( Monad m ) => [ a ] -> ( a -> m b ) -> m [ b ]
( as an added bonus , we 'll have it collect the results of each iteration ) .
We can write this with sequence and map :
forM xs f = sequence ( map f xs )
we apply the function to each element of the list to construct the action for that iteration , and then sequence the actions together into a single computation .
For example :
main = forM [ 1 .. 10 ] $ \ x -> do putStr " Looping : " print x
Since in this , and many other cases , the loop body does n't produce a particularly interesting result , there are variants of sequence and forM called sequence_ and forM_ , which simply throw the results away as they run each of the actions .
sequence_ :: ( Monad m ) => [ m a ] -> m ( ) sequence_ [ ] = return ( ) sequence_ ( x : xs ) = x >> sequence_ xs forM_ :: ( Monad m ) => [ a ] -> ( a -> m b ) -> m ( ) forM_ xs f = sequence_ ( map f xs )
Sometimes we only want a computation to happen when a given condition is true .
For this , we can write the following :
when :: ( Monad m ) => Bool -> m ( ) -> m ( ) when p x = if p then x else return ()
Remember that return ( ) is a no- op , so running this computation will run x when the condition is true , and will do nothing at all when the condition fails .
Another extremely common thing to do is to construct a computation which performs another computation and then applies a function to the result .
This can be accomplished by using the liftM function :
liftM :: ( Monad m ) => ( a -> b ) -> m a -> m b liftM f x = do v <- x return ( f v )
Or :
liftM :: ( Monad m ) => ( a -> b ) -> m a -> m b liftM f x = return . f =<< x
where ( = << ) is just bind with its parameters flipped .
This is also generalised by lift M2 , liftM3 , ... to running more than one computation before applying a function to the results :
liftM2 :: ( Monad m ) => ( a -> b -> c ) -> m a -> m b -> m c lift M2 f x y = do v <- x w <- y return ( f v w )
It 's possible to rewrite sequence in terms of lift M2 , return , and a fold over the list :
sequence :: ( Monad m ) => [ m a ] -> m [ a ] sequence xs = foldr ( lift M2 ( : ) ) ( return [ ] ) xs sequence_ :: ( Monad m ) => [ m a ] -> m ( ) sequence_ xs = foldr ( >> ) ( return ( ) ) xs
Anyway , these are just a few of the simpler examples to give a taste of what sorts of control structures you get for free by defining a combinator library as a monad .
Some final notes
It 's a common misconception that Haskell uses a monad for I /O out of necessity .
Really , it could use any sort of combinator library to describe and combine I /O actions .
It just happens that the most obvious way to formulate a library to describe I /O actions ends up being a monad .
So we define it as such so as to be able to share all these control structures with other monadic libraries .
That 's really the only reason why we ever define anything as a monad -- the abstraction allows us to make use of a bunch of shared code for free without writing it out over and over again ( or worse yet , failing to abstract it at all ) .
At this point , you might want to look at some more examples of monads .
One place which is a decent starting point for that is Part II of the " All About Monads " tutorial .
You might also have a look at the Hierarchical Libraries Documentation for the libraries under Control .

Celebrity journalist Martha Frankel has interviewed Johnny Depp , Elizabeth Taylor and Robert DeNiro .
But perhaps the most interesting story of her journalistic career is the one she has written about herself .
Ms. Frankel grew up in a loving , lively household of gamblers , a childhood she describes in her new memoir “ Hats & Eyeglasses : A Family Love Affair with Gambling . ”
Her memories consist of her father ’s poker games and mahjong with her mother ’s friends , all while food simmered on the stove and laughter filtered through the home .
She had her first kiss at the racetrack .
The title comes from lessons she learned at her father ’s regular card games and refers to those times when you ’re “ losing so bad your ship is sinking .
All that ’s left on the water ’s surface are your hat and eyeglasses , ” Ms. Frankel explains .
But it was n’t until the age of 45 that Ms. Frankel rediscovered poker , becoming a skilled player in regular games with friends or at casinos .
She won more than she lost , but the stakes were relatively low and poker remained mostly a social pursuit .
After a dealer told her about Internet gambling , she logged on to a site called Paradise Poker and she was hooked .
For more than a year she struggled with her compulsion , hiding it from her family and friends and losing tens of thousands of dollars before breaking free from the intoxicating allure of Internet gambling .
I spoke with Ms. Frankel recently and asked her to share her thoughts about the power of online gambling and the Internet .
Q .
You tell the story of your childhood with such nostalgia , are you ever worried that you are making gambling a bit too appealing for your readers ?
A .
I see now what it was .
It was this potent mix of love and food and gambling .
I realize that I have recreated the same thing in my house as this place where food and love and talking were all part of this big stew that you wanted a piece of .
I worry I make it sound really enticing , but here ’s the truth .
It is really enticing .
There is something about playing cards .
It ’s so congenial , and yet there is something so stinging to it , you ’re trying to beat your opponent who is normally your best friend .
There is something about that that really teaches you a lot of lessons .
Q .
How did you cross over from social gambling to getting hooked on Internet gambling ?
A .
I was in Atlantic City one night at the Taj Mahal .
I love the Taj Mahal because you can still smell the cigars in there even though it ’s a smoke - free environment .
I asked a dealer , “ How come nobody ’s here ? ”
And he said , “ Why play here if you can stay home and play in your pajamas . ”
My breath got caught .
Back then it was not an easy thing to do .
It took me four or five hours to download the site .
I logged on and they give you play money at first .
Every time the phone rang I got bounced offline because I only had dial - up .
I did good with the play money and I immediately thought , “ If I could do this for five hours a day , and make $ 100 an hour , why would I ever work ? ” I thought that immediately .
The minute I started I was completely hooked on it .
Q .
But you had played for years , why was the Internet your downfall ?
A .
The computer is addictive .
There is something in its nature .
From the minute I lost online I had this attitude of “ they owe me 300 bucks . ”
Then the next day they owed me $ 600 .
I could never get past that .
I was forever trying to make up what they owed me .
At a casino I did n’t think like that .
I ’m not a chaser .
If it ’s not my day I ’m happy to do something else .
Online I could n’t stop that thing of wanting to beat them .
At a casino there is a very human element — someone is slow , someone says something funny , the dealer is a jerk .
Online there is none of that .
It ’s a computer generating hand after hand after hand very quickly .
Q .
What kind of stakes are we talking about ?
A .
At home I play for a quarter , half dollar .
If you play like an idiot all night you might lose $ 100 .
In the casino , it might be pots of $ 400 to $ 1,200 .
Online , I lost between $ 50,000 and $ 70,000 .
Q .
At what point did you realize that you only had “ hats and eyeglasses . ”
A .
I realized probably two months into it , but I did it for another year and three months .
Instead of stopping , I just kept believing that I could figure it out .
It became so compulsive and obsessive .
I dreamt about it and I thought about it .
I realized I was getting up every single morning and thinking two things : please let me stop , or let me be brave enough to kill myself to stop this .
Now I ’m hearing from an unbelievable amount of people who are in the same boat I was .
Q .
How did you get out of the boat ?
A .
My mother , who was getting very old and who I adored , called me hysterical and said , “ What have I done ?
Why are n’t you talking to me ? ”
The shame I felt that I had turned my back on the one person who believed in me more than anyone .
It did n’t make me stop , but it made me stay away from my computer one second at a time .
It took months .
Finally , when I turned my computer on and deleted the site from my computer , it took me months to stop yearning for it .
Q .
I ’ve heard you predict that we are about to be hit with a “ tsunami of online gamblers washing up on the beach . ”
Why do you say that ?
A .
I recently got a letter from a man , both he and his wife were addicted .
He woke up , and she was playing even though they promised to stop .
I felt so bad for him .
Parents call me about their kids , and I say it sounds like they ’re gambling online .
I tell them to go on the computer and press “ all programs ” and read them , and they find Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker .
I think we have no idea what is going to happen .
I think women are more prone to this .
At casinos , women play the slots where they do n’t have to make eye contact with anybody else .
But if you never had to leave your house , if you could just stay home in your pajamas and nobody ever had to know … .

Canada : Judge rules the return of political refugees to the US illegal
By Guy Charron
18 December 2007
This article first appeared in French on December 12 , 2007 .
Judge Michael Phelan of the Federal Court of Canada ruled on November 29 that the Safe Third Country Agreement between Canada and the United States dealing with political refugees is illegal .
The purpose of this agreement , signed by the Liberal government of Jean Chretien and the Bush administration in late 2002 and put into effect in December 2004 , is to prevent thousands of potential refugees from claiming asylum in Canada .
It is estimated , for example , that since January 2005 , some 2,500 people fleeing Columbia have been unable to secure refugee status in Canada on account of the Safe Third Country Agreement .
Under the Treaty , a claimant can request political asylum only in that country in which he / she first arrives .
[ Canada and the US are the sole signatories of the agreement . ]
Prior to its implementation , some 30 to 40 percent of requests for political refugee status in Canada came from refugees entering the country from the US .
Due to the fact that they are poor and / or fear the generally more heavy surveillance at airports , many persons fleeing political persecution in Latin America travel overland , meaning they must first pass through the US to reach Canada .
Consequently , the flow of refugees has historically been much greater from the US into Canada , than from Canada into the US .
Phelan ’s ruling is a condemnation of the treatment of political refugees by both the United States and Canada .
In justifying his decision , Phelan wrote that the United States does not adhere to international treaties on refugees or on torture .
He argued that the US could not be considered a “ Safe Country ” because claimants may be sent back to their original country even if they risk being tortured there .
As an example , Phelan cited the case of Maher Arar , a Syrian - born Canadian , who was arrested at New York ’s JFK Airport while in transit to Canada , under false suspicion of terrorism .
Arar was “ rendered ” to Syria , where he was jailed and savagely tortured for ten months .
Phelan ’s ruling is silent , however , on Canada ’s complicity in US torture practices .
A public enquiry has already exposed the close collaboration between the governments of the two countries , with Canada arranging , through the medium of the American state machine , to have its citizens tortured , based on weak or false suspicions of terrorism .
The Canadian government is virtually alone among western governments in failing to condemn the US practice of torture , especially in Guantanamo Bay where a young Canadian has been held for the past five years , that is , since he was 15 years old .
The Canadian army , which is engaged in counter - insurgency warfare in southern Afghanistan , regularly turns over its prisoners to Afghan security forces well known for their brutality .
Phelan wrote in his decision that “ it is difficult to imagine how the governor in council could have reasonably concluded that the US complies with the Refugee Convention when the law allows the exclusion of claimants who involuntarily provided support to terrorist groups .
The terrorist exclusions are extremely harsh and cast a wide net which will catch many who never pose a threat . ”
Under Canada ’s own anti-terrorist laws , the government specifically criminalizes involuntary support of government - designated “ terrorist groups , ” not only for political refugee claimants but also for all Canadian citizens .
The law is so broad that an anti-government demonstration or protest movement could be defined as a terrorist act .
In ruling the Agreement illegal , Phelan also took into account the US refusal to allow claims of political asylum made one year after arrival in the country , as well as the incarceration of a significant percentage of refugee claimants .
The US Ambassador to Canada David Wilkins expressed outrage at the decision , stating that the US “ has a proud record of accepting and protecting refugees , defending human rights and adhering to our treaty obligations . ”
Negotiations on the Canada - US agreement on political refugees began in the late 1980s , after the then Conservative government of Brian Mulroney introduced a clause into the country ’s immigration law that made it legal for the government to strip persons who entered into Canada from a “ safe ” third country of their right to claim refugee status .
But as this would have had the effect of increasing the number of refugee claimants in the US , Washington balked and the two governments were unable to reach a deal .
In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks and with greatly increased border control and security cooperation between the two countries , the Third Party negotiations were revived and an entente concluded in December 2002 .
The agreement is part and parcel of measures being introduced by ruling classes around the world to restrict the right of political asylum .
Everything possible is done so that refugees never reach the target country ’s border , for example by strengthening controls over who can embark on an airplane or by building walls to keep people out .
Refugees who succeed in getting into a “ safe ” country are often arrested and held in special detention centers , as is the case in the United States , Great Britain , and Australia .
The impact of these policies has been so great that , although the number of refugees has increased by over 50 percent since 2003 , according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the number of refugee claims has fallen in half during the same period , including those in Canada and the United States .
It is remarkable that the two countries that have produced the greatest number of refugees , Iraq and Afghanistan ( 3.5 million and 2.8 million respectively by the end of 2006 , according to UNHCR figures ) , largely owing to American invasions which Canada is supporting , are the source of only a tiny fraction of the refugees accepted by Canada and the United States .
Judge Phelan ’s decision has been largely denounced by the Canadian press .
A Globe and Mail editorial of November 30 , 2007 is typical : “ The claim by a Federal Court judge that the United States is not a safe country for refugees is on the face of it outrageous ...
The decision should be appealed , and the effect of the judgment suspended until the appeal is heard . ”
The social - democratic New Democratic Party has expressed its concern that the Canadian bourgeoisie is being too candid about its predatory aims and its repudiation of democratic rights .
The NDP has demanded that the government repudiate the Canada - US pact .
“ The Safe Third Country Agreement has stripped Canada of its ability to exercise good judgment , and does not reflect Canadian values , ” said Olivia Chow , the NDP critic on immigration .
It is certain that the Conservative government will appeal this judgment , not only because it seeks at all costs to avoid displeasing Washington , but also because its policy is to continuously restrict the entry of political refugees .
Recently Canada ’s Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal by “ war resisters ” — that is , US soldiers who refused to participate in the illegal war in Iraq — of the Canadian government ’s refusal to accord them refugee status .
( See “ Canada ’s Supreme Court opens door to deportation of US ‘ war resisters ’ ” )
17 Lies and half - truths in the Camera business
There are a lot of half - truths going around about photography .
Generally , the various photographic equipment companies spread one or two of them , and then the various photography magazines and megasites play along because they realize that to go against what the photography companies want is a great way to not get access to the latest and greatest for review .
But really , people are being lied to .
Not in a direct , malicious , illegal sort of way .
But in a subtle way , where they exaggerate a half - truth or omit a fairly important caveat .
Where they push the boundary of how much you can say before you have to deal with lawsuits .
Lie 1 : Anti-Shake for sharp pictures in low light !
Sometimes , this is a lie .
Sometimes this is only a half - truth .
See , there 's a few ways to get a sharp exposure for moving stuff in low light .
The first is lots of light and / or high performance optics .
This is expensive .
You may have a 300 mm zoom lens that goes to 5.6 wide open .
Those white lenses on the side of a sports field can be zoom lenses that go to 2.8 wide open .
Your lens needs four times as much light to freeze action .
The white lens costs many times more because it's harder to produce ( which increases the cost ) and harder to design ( which means they need to charge more to make up for their optical designer 's time ) .
And it gets worse because the high price reduces the size of the market further , which means they can't take advantage of being able to order huge batches of parts and the ability to spread the cost of design out among more lenses .
The second is moving some parts of the lens in the opposite direction of camera shake or , alternatively , the sensor .
For many situations , these work .
For sports , of course , you 'll end up with a sharp playing field and blurry players , but otherwise this helps .
The third is to bump up the ISO speed or potentially do certain software techniques .
These may work , but they wo n't offer the same sort of quality as the first or second option .
If a camera manufacturer bumps the ISO speed or something slightly sneakier and tries to pass it off as the second solution , they are lying .
Consider this : Bumping ISO speed or other such tricks will work on any camera .
You can draw two conclusions .
Either the camera makers know that high - performance lenses or mechanical stabilization built into the lens works better and are willingly deceiving you .
Or , perhaps , whenever they get around to improving the processing software on their entire camera line , we 'll have even better low light performance .
Note that the third option actually works in many situations on video cameras because you do n't just contend with the blur on an individual frame but also the camera rocking from side to side while you move around .
Still , better camcorders use real optical image stabilization , too .
Lie 2 : ISO 8,000 !!!
ISO 10,000 !!!
Digital sensors are somewhat arbitrary about the ISO .
Configure the various parts of the sensor differently and you have anywhere between 8 and 8000 iso .
So you can have your ISO as high as you want if you can accept the increased noise and reduced dynamic range .
Just because your camera with a grain - of - salt - sized sensor has an ISO 8000 setting does n't mean you can actually take a good picture at 8000 ISO .
You need a big sensor like the digital SLRs to look even halfway good at high ISO settings .
The grain - of - salt - sized sensor in your average digital P&S camera has only marginally improved in the past few years .
In fact , most modern P&S cameras have smaller sensors than before , so their noise is likely worse .
It 's just that they 've tweaked the software so it appears like there 's less noise in the image , generally at the cost of actual resolution .
They do this not because it will result in a better camera , but because they want ISO speed to be the next feature they heavily advertise to people who do n't know cameras well .
Remember , however , that Nikon 's advertising for the D3 ( 6400 with boost up to ISO 25600 ) is not a lie .
Lie 3 : 10 megapixels ! 12 megapixels !
A digital SLR with a quality lens and a large sensor can handle 10 megapixels .
A point and shoot with a grain - of - salt - sized sensor can't .
It 's my opinion that 6 megapixels was about the maximum a P&S camera should have had .
What happens is that diffraction increases until even a theoretically perfect ( the term is " diffraction limited " ) lens cannot actually give you sufficent detail to get 10 " real " megapixels worth of detail .
Oh , and as you decrease the size of the sensor , you lose dynamic range and gain noise .
The funny thing is that as you move to a smaller sensor , faster lenses become easier .
Yet zoom lenses on point - and - shoot cameras are stuck at around f/2.8 .
The additional noise from the smaller sensor would be offset by a faster lens .
You could make a zoom that 's more like f/ 2 or f/1.8 on the wide end and still have a usable depth of field .
Lie 4 : 10 megapixels ! 12 megapixels ! ( interpolated )
I 'm surprised that camera manufacturers are n't getting sued for selling " interpolated " resolution cameras without any theoretical basis for it .
Fuji was selling their SuperCCD cameras as having twice the resolution for a while because there was a mild theoretical basis for a claim of extra resolution by the way they shaped their sensors .
And if you take a " 12 megapixel " SuperCCD sensor and compare it against a 6 megapixel standard sensor , it really does look better .
Everybody else who 's doing it does n't seem to care .
With GenuineFractals or similar software , you can create an awfully good appearance of better resolution .
No cameras on the market have enough power to make it worthwhile to integrate into the camera .
But lesser manufacturers are trying to sell interpolated resolution as the spec .
This is a clear intent to deceive the buying public .
Bell +
Howell licensed their brand to another company ( because they had a good brand name 10 - 20 years ago before they stopped selling consumer - oriented products ) who was advertising a camera with 10 megapixels of " interpolated " resolution .
The part that disturbs me is that Minox did this .
Their Miniature Digital Leica M3 has a 3.2 megapixel sensor but they advertise it as a 4 megapixel camera .
Lie 5 : Stick it atop your flash and get beautiful light every time !
There 's two things that these products do .
The first is making the light source from your flash bigger and farther from your flash , so as to make the lighting softer .
The other is bouncing the light all over the place .
This is a valid technique , mind you .
But when you can't bounce , like maybe you are in a room with red walls , you are in trouble and your flash is n't as magic as you thought .
The problem is , you 'll never see folks selling these things really explain which sort of situations these things work in .
Of course not .
They 're MAGIC and they work GREAT in EVERY situation .
You also rarely see them really compare the results between different diffuser products .
Last I heard , there 's a lot less difference than you 'd think .
Personally , I either use a sheet of paper or the ceiling .
Or I take my flash off - camera .
Lie 6 : Makes flash obsolete !
Some of the sensitivity - enhancing products on the market are advertising themselves as making the flash obsolete .
To say this shows a clear lack of photographic understanding .
A flash is useful for more things than just allowing you to take crappy pictures in low light .
For example , if I wanted to modify the lighting outdoors , I 'm going to need a few thousand watts of Hollywood - grade HMI lighting and a generator to do what a few battery powered flashes will do .
I can't just bump up the sensitivity of the camera 's sensor because sometimes the light will be really cruddy .
For example , a portrait taken under the noontime sun is going to look bad in a way that added sensitivity wo n't help you with .
Lie 7 : 100 shooting modes for better pictures !
Most shooting modes are there to impress a beginning user .
When I teach people how to use their cameras , I tell them to keep their cameras in full - auto mode until they know what is n't coming out right ... and then figure out what to do about it .
In my opinion , when you reach that point , you are probably interested enough in photography that you are ready to learn about the photographic triangle and related concepts and are ready for manual modes .
If you are not interested in learning about the concepts of photography , you are probably not interested in learning about what each of the modes does and when you want to use it .
I suspect that a very small list of modes would be handy , maybe Auto , Night , and Action , but it turned into a numerical figure to compare cameras with and therefore got out of control .
Lie 8 : 10 x zoom !
12 x zoom ! 20 x zoom !
Zoom lenses are n't easy to make .
The bigger the zoom range , the harder it gets to successfully construct a lens .
Modern lens design has pushed up the quality bar so that an appropriately expensive zoom lens will take awfully good shots .
The Nikon 18 -200 mm lens has some major fans and is an 11 x zoom lens .
However , consider that throughout the 18-200 mm 's zoom range , it gets between f/3.5 and 5.6 .
Prime lenses that are at least f/2.8 are available .
And if you are content to have a smaller zoom range , you can get 2.8 zoom lenses .
This comes at a cost .
A zoom is just as special - purpose as a prime lens .
Also , remember that the Nikon 18 - 200 mm is a unique lens ... most other 10 x zoom lenses have severe problems .
Incidentally the number of " x " that a zoom has is pretty useless because you do n't know where it starts or it ends .
A 10 - 100 mm lens is a 10 x zoom , as is a 50 - 500 mm lens .
Lie 9 : 10 x zoom camera that 's just like an SLR but smaller and cheaper !
Zoom lenses get easier to design with a smaller sensor .
You can make a 10 x zoom lens for a grain - of - salt sized point and shoot sensor with astonishing ease .
They make video camera lenses with an astonishing zoom range because the sensor 's even smaller and the resolution 's low enough to not notice too much blur and diffraction .
Nothing currently on the market holds a candle to a real digital SLR .
If were to make a camera with ( for example ) a 10 x zoom lens like the the aforementioned Nikon 18 - 200 mm lens and a 10 megapixel sensor , it would end up looking like you 'd taken the 18 - 200 mm lens and glued it onto the front of a SLR body .
It would cost about the same .
And you would n't have the option of using other lenses .
Lie 10 : 10 x digital zoom ( 2 x optical )
They 've been at this one for ages .
Digital zoom is a lie .
All that 's happening is that the camera is cropping the center portion of your existing image .
If you have your camera set to a lower resolution , then offering digital zoom is not a lie .
Otherwise , it 's a lie if you spend any time advertising it .
Lie 11 : Newly developed film , made in ... by ....
This one really got me cheesed off .
Even though AfgaPhoto is bankrupt , there 's another division of Agfa that still has a coating plant .
They make aerial survey film and other special purpose films .
Rollei , in partnership with Maco announced that they had developed some new and improved films .
One of them was a new color film called Rollei Scanfilm .
The other one was Rollei IR 400 , which was supposed to be just like Maco 820c , but 2 stops faster .
Oh , and while we 're on the subject , the Maco 820c was really made by Efke .
Well , it turns out in both cases , these are just repackaged versions of the aerial films made by Afga .
The Rollei IR is very much not the same film as the old Maco film , and Scanfilm was n't specially developed .
This bugs me for a number of reasons .
Anybody with an ounce of sense can look at the sensitivity of Rollei IR 400 and compare it to the old 820c and see that these films are not the same .
Second , Rollei is n't actually investing in new products , just repackaging old stuff that they do n't even control .
Or , even better , selling old Agfa APX master rolls that nobody can make anymore as new product .
My initial thought was that there could be extra players in the color film market , if Kodak or Fuji ever decided to leave the market .
So I feel let down that it is n't a new film .
Also , at least some of the claims made about Rollei Scanfilm are n't especially true .
The absence of a color mask does n't help make scanning easier , although in theory it could give you extra dynamic range at the same contrast .
Maco / Rollei / Agfa seem to finally be developing new films , like their ATP " tech - pan like " film .
And that 's not all .
Bluefire announced a " new " " made in North America " 127 film that 's really just a master roll of normal Kodak film cut down to the now - hard - to - find 127 size .
The part that makes this upsetting is that it might lead somebody to think that companies are making huge bets , when they are just
Lie 12 : Warming filter to improve your digital !
Unlike film , a properly designed digital camera is sufficiently neutral in colors that anything other than a severe color shift is going to be adjustable either with the onboard white balance controls , or afterwards with a RAW format file .
For your average user who just wants to take pictures , they 'll probably leave the camera in Auto white balance mode and they 'll probably just reducing camera performance .
If somebody insists on trying to sell you a warming filter for your digital camera , ask why he 's trying to sell you such a piece of crap that it wo n't adjust white balance on its own properly .
Note that an advanced photographer can and will carefully work with white balance and they might have sufficient understanding to find situations where a warming filter on the lens would be handy .
I certainly do n't have any uses for a warming filter on a digital .
The markup on cheap , uncoated , no - name filters is rather high , so it 's a good way for a camera store to make up for having to compete with online merchants .
When selling gear on eBay , it allows you to say " comes with 3 filters ! " where one of them is a warming filter , one is a UV filter , and one is a polarizer .
Even with film , if you were shooting print film , it did n't matter what kind of warming filter you used , the results would be the same because the printing machines try to adjust the colors to look " correct " .
Lie 13 : Third party lenses that work great on your modern camera !!
Third party lenses are good .
Sigma 's 30 mm f/1.4 lens is brilliant and fills a hole in the lineup of Nikon and Canon .
But they are n't guaranteed to work as well as a name - brand lens .
Period .
Nobody shares the electronic protocols that the camera body uses to talk to the lens , so everybody else has to figure it out on their own .
This means that there 's a slight but non-zero chance that somebody got something wrong .
And even though Canon or Nikon probably wo n't go out of their way to break other people 's lenses , they also do n't bother checking for compatibility .
Pros tend not to use the third party lenses simply because if the lens goes on a blink for a second , they might miss something they are assigned to shoot .
Amateurs get away with third party lenses because they accept the risk of a lens going on the blink .
If I miss one cute expression out of my one of my nieces or nephews , I can always wait about 30 seconds for a new cute expression .
People have been told , generally by camera salesfolk , that these third - party lenses are actually better than the camera manufacturer lenses .
Or that Canon or Nikon shared the protocols with one of the third - party manufacturers .
These are all lies .
Lie 14 : Point and shoot camera with a Zeiss / Schneider / etc. lens !
In the early 1900s , Zeiss lenses were unmatched .
Eventually , everybody else got better .
At this point , regardless of who developed the lenses ....
Zeiss , Schneider , Canon , Mamiya , Nikon , or even Sigma or Tamron most of the time ... most folks are n't going to be able to tell the difference between any two similar lenses built to similar quality standards .
People are brand sensitive when they are not equipped to analyze for themselves the relative merits of what they are choosing between , which is why Sony pays Zeiss money every year to put Zeiss - branded lenses on their cameras .
Lie 15 : 3X teleconverter so you can make a 600 mm lens out of your 70 - 200 mm zoom !!
A teleconverter works more or less like a magnifying glass for your lens .
It sits behind it and enlarges the central portion of the image .
You can not get something out of nothing .
A 2 x teleconverter costs you two stops of light and reduces your image quality .
In the days of prime lenses , a teleconverter was a good deal because your f/2.0 50 mm lens became a f / 4 100 mm lens with a teleconverter .
Also , remember that most cameras will stop being able to autofocus below f/5.6 your viewfinder is going to be awfully dim and hard to see through at f /5.6 .
A 1.4 x or maybe a 2 x teleconverter can come in handy in some situations , generally paired with a quality prime or excellent zoom lens .
I know Canon ( and I think Nikon also does this ) makes their teleconverters so that they only work with lenses that have room for the teleconverter element to extend into the back of the lens .
This makes for a better teleconverter and also prevents users from doing clearly stupid things and complaining about how their camera does n't autofocus and their lens is all blurry .
Lie 16 : " L " grade lens means BETTER QUALITY !
Canon tends to like to make " L " lenses that are very good for corner cases .
For example , they made a 50 mm f/1.0 lens for a while .
That 's market leading , but that 's also a lens that ways a few pounds and has such narrow depth of field that you barely notice that there 's not much resolution at f/1.0 .
At f/4 , I bet that the fairly cruddy plastic 50 mm f/1.8 lens is going to look as good , if not better .
Similarly , if you compare the 70 - 200 mm f/2.8
L series zoom lens against the non-L 85 mm f /1.8 or 100 mm f/ 2 prime lenses ( I initially said 200 mm f / 2.8 , but that 's also an L ) , the prime lens is going to be sharper by a fairly large margin .
Nikon is more understated .
Instead of making one well - built lens that 's at the very edge of light collecting ability and one not - so - well - built lens that 's easy to build , they make one well - built lens that 's got a reasonable amount of extra light collecting ability and one not - so - well - build lens .
So Canon makes an 85 mm 1.2 and 1.8 , whereas Nikon makes a 85 mm 1.4 and 1.8 .
Most folks wo n't notice the fractional stop between the two lenses but will probably appreciate the difference in price .
Lie 17 : An EOS 1Ds Mk II for the cost of an EOS 5D !!!!!!
This is a warning that seems to require repetition .
And repetition .
And still more repetition .
Because most people ( and their wives , generally ) see cameras as a luxury , not a requirement , they want to get the fanciest camera possible for the least amount of money .
So there 's a whole industry of scam camera stores out there .
Some of them are in tourist - trap areas , others are online .
They 've got a lot of games they 'll play with you .
B&H and Adorama will sell " Gray market " parts for a little less , so when asked , they 'll say it 's " Gray market "
But then they 'll tell you that the Gray Market does n't come with a battery or case or manual .
But they 'll upgrade you to the " USA version " with those parts for more than you can get it elsewhere .
Or they 'll sell you those extra bits at an increased price .
Generally selling you crap parts as if they were made by Zeiss and blessed by Ansel Adams himself .
Oh , and if you manage to not allow yourself to pay more than list price for the whole package , they 'll cancel your order , so you 'll just waste time .
And because everybody knows about this scam , no other camera stores will try and match their price .
I stopped bargain - hunting .
I figure that if I can't get it from Kamera Korner or Keeble and Shuchat locally or from B&H , Adorama , or Freestyle for a reasonable price , I do n't want it .
This is clearly fraud .
The problem is that they are just sneaky enough to require more effort than your average Attorney General is prepared to spend on them .
Save those little specks of light up there , space is awfully dark .
It 's such a fundamental assumption , I never thought to ask why .
But as someone on the sci.astro Google group recently wondered , given that there are billions upon billions of stars in the night sky , most brighter than our own sun , should n't they light up the night like a Fourth of July fireworks display ?
Actually , there 's already a name for this question -- Olbers ' Paradox , after German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers who described it in 1823 -- but it was also asked , perhaps most elegantly , by Edgar Allen Poe ( of all people ) in his 1848 essay Eureka :
" Were the succession of stars endless , then the background of the sky would present us a uniform luminosity , like that displayed by the Galaxy " “ since there could be absolutely no point , in all that background , at which would not exist a star .
The only mode , therefore , in which , under such a state of affairs , we could comprehend the voids which our telescopes find in innumerable directions , would be by supposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no ray from it has yet been able to reach us at all . "
Well , Edgar , it seems that the complete answer involves quite a bit of math ( " Nevermore ! " quoth I after completing pre-calculus in the 11th grade ) , but the short answer is mathless , fascinating , and a two - parter :
1 ) The universe is not infinite , and neither is the speed at which light travels .
If they were , then the night sky would be as bright as the surface of the sun .
As it happens ( according to prevailing theories , at least ) , the universe Banged itself into existence about 13.7 billion years ago ( give or take a few hundred million years ) , so that 's all the time light has had to travel from distant stars to our neck of the woods .
It would hold , then , that while finite , the universe is considerably more than 13.7 billion light years across , which would help explain why the night sky is n't blinding , and why even our most powerful telescopes can still find patches of nothingness in the Heavens .
2 ) The universe is expanding , and with that expansion comes a phenomenon known as redshift -- kind of like a visual Doppler effect .
Starlight is moving away from us , which shifts its frequency higher , sometimes right out of the visual spectrum and into the microwave spectrum .
So huge portions of what would otherwise be potentially blinding starlight has become a steady , cosmic microwave background radiation .
Pretty cool , huh ?

Prove we sent photo , Clinton campaign manager tells press Nick Juliano
Published : Monday February 25 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hillary Clinton 's campaign manager chastised reporters Monday for eagerly following the Drudge Report , and he said the campaign would not investigate whether its staffers sent the site pictures of Barack Obama dressed in native African garments .
The photograph , taken in the summer of 2006 , became a campaign issue Monday after the Drudge Report said Clinton staffers distributed the photo , which shows Obama wearing a turban and native Kenyan clothing .
Howard Wolfson , who is running the campaign , said the photo 's distribution was not sanctioned and he challenged reporters on a conference call to prove that campaign aides were behind spreading the photo .
" If you have any original reporting to suggest that someone in the campaign sent this e-mail let me know , " Wolfson told NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell , who was asking about the photo flap .
" Here 's what I 'd say , " he continued , " I 've never seen that picture before , I 'm not aware that anyone here has , I 'm not aware that anyone sent any such e-mail . "
Noting that the campaign has hundreds of staffers , Wolfson would not categorically deny that the photo came to Drudge 's attention from within Clinton 's campaign .
But he implied that the Web site should not be taken at face value , and said the campaign would not be investigating the matter further .
" If you have done any independent reporting that unearths an e-mail let me know , " Wolfson told another reporter .
" I 'm not in a position to ask 700 people to come in and answer questions about it . "
Wolfson also took a harsh line against the Obama campaign , which issued its own harsh statement soon after the Drudge item appeared Monday morning .
" This is an attempt by the Obama campaign to distract and divide , " he said .
" And it is an obvious and transparent attempt to do so . "
Obama 's top advisers were quick to blast what it called an underhanded campaign tactic from Clinton .
Around 9:30 a.m. , soon after Drudge posted the photo , Obama 's campaign released a statement .
 On the very day that Senator Clinton is giving a speech about restoring respect for America in the world , her campaign has engaged in the most shameful , offensive fear - mongering weve seen from either party in this election .
This is part of a disturbing pattern that led her county chairs to resign in Iowa , her campaign chairman to resign in New Hampshire , and its exactly the kind of divisive politics that turns away Americans of all parties and diminishes respect for America in the world , " said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe in an e-mail sent to RAW STORY and other news outlets Monday morning .
Three Obama foreign policy advisers participated in a conference call with reporters Monday in advance of an anticipated Clinton speech outlining her foreign policy goals .
All criticized her campaign for distributing the photo .
" It is unfortunate ... that her campaign would be involved in putting out a photograph that is in its very nature designed to be divisive , " said Susan Rice , an Obama adviser and fellow at the Brookings Institution .
The advisers -- Rice , Gen. Jonathon  Scott Gration and Richard Danzig -- noted that in the photo Obama is simply accepting a gift from one of his hosts , and he tried it on just like any politician visiting a foreign country would .
" He was someone who accepted a gift of friendship in a way that we should expect our president to , " Gration said .
Danzig said distributing the photo was clearly an attempt to have voters " judge a book by its cover " and he said the campaign's " grasping " at such at attack represented its lack of substantive critiques against Obam .
The photo appeared Monday morning on The Drudge Report , which alleged it was circulated by Clinton staffers .
" Would n't we be seeing this on the cover of every magazine if it were HRC ? " questioned one campaign staffer , in an email obtained by the DRUDGE REPORT .
Drudge reminded readers that politicians commonly dress according to the country they 're visiting and provided a handy illustration , including Sen.
Clinton , President Bush and former President Bill Clinton .
Politico's Mike Allen reported , " The Clinton campaign did not deny the charge , but did not comment further . "
Clinton campaign manager Maggie Williams tried to turn the tables on Obama 's campaign Monday , releasing a blistering statement that did little to disabuse the notion Clinton 's staffers were behind the photo 's distribution .
 If Barack Obama 's campaign wants to suggest that a photo of him wearing traditional Somali clothing is divisive , they should be ashamed .
Hillary Clinton has worn the traditional clothing of countries she has visited and had those photos published widely , " Williams wrote in an e-mail to reporters .
" This is nothing more than an obvious and transparent attempt to distract from the serious issues confronting our country today and to attempt to create the very divisions they claim to decry .
We will not be distracted .
Another Clinton aide tells Politico the supposed staffer 's lament to Drudge is more a complaint about press coverage than an attempt to push an attack on Obama .
 We have over 700 people on staff .
I dont know if someone on our staff sent it out or not , " spokesman Mo Elleithee said .
 If someone on our staff makes the point that we are treated differently by the press than Sen. Obama , we agree with that sentiment .
We dont think theres anything wrong with this photo .
Sen .
Clinton has herself , while traveling abroad , dressed in traditional , local dress .
And theres nothing divisive about that . "
Regardless of whether the latest photo was an organized assault on Clinton 's behalf , her campaign already is under fire for trying to link Obama with anti-war radicals from the Vietnam era .
Earlier in the campaign members of Clinton 's campaign staff in Iowa had to resign after forwarding an e-mail that falsely claimed Obama was a Muslim .
ABC
News political tip sheet The Note says the photo flap could be a result of " frustration " from the Clinton team , but it notes there is some question over whether her team distributed the photo :
( If it really is the work of someone associated with the Clinton campaign , it has atypical fingerprints all over it -- and it's an interesting call on a day where Clinton is giving a " major " speech on foreign policy . )
MSNBC's First Read notes the photo's appearance could mark an increase in attacks on Obama .
Toss in the blind photo Drudge attack of Obama today showing him doing what many American statesman do when overseas -- dress in local garb -- and it looks like this could be the week that the kitchen sink is tossed at Obama .
Will Clinton be asked at her foreign policy speech today if her campaign is circulating this photo ?
Fox News quickly noted the photo as did several conservative blogs .
The photo apparently first appeared in this report on Obama 's 2006 trip from an African news agency .
Supermarket tabloid The National Examiner reportedly ran the photo in its Feb. 4 issue .
The photo appeared on right - wing message board Free Republic and conservative blog Sweetness & Light before Drudge picked it up .
At least one Freeper recognized the need for wider distribution .
" Good Job , " a user on Free Republic said Sunday to the person who posted the tabloid pic .
" [ I ]t needs to get to Drudge , M. Malkin , Debbie Schussel etc .... I want to see his explanation on this . "
DEVELOPING ... RAW STORY 'S earlier report is available here
Yahoo has launched a beta version of their OpenID provider initiative , which was announced earlier this month .
Starting today , you can use your Yahoo credentials to login on a number of different sites , including Plaxo , Jyte , and Pibb ( full list here ) .
I tried it out on Plaxo , and it ’s definitely an improvement over previous integrations of OpenID .
Versus needing to enter a URL such as username .
myopenid.com before providing your username and password , you simply follow a “ sign in with Yahoo ID ” link , where you can enter your Yahoo credentials .
Several pages of education on how exactly your Yahoo ID can be used to sign into other web sites follows , and from there you simply sign up for Plaxo and can then use your Yahoo credentials to sign in on future visits .
Now that I ’ve seen it in action , I feel like Yahoo ’s effort may be fairly effective in driving OpenID adoption .
To mainstream users , OpenID is probably a completely foreign concept .
On the other hand , seeing the Yahoo brand with no explicit mention of OpenID is a concept users should be able to grasp , and Yahoo has gone through great lengths to educate users throughout the sign - in process .
Most everyone out there has a Yahoo ID , and given the choice of yet another username and password or using your existing Yahoo one , I think users may start to opt for the latter .
Kudos to Yahoo for getting this out quickly .
Now we 'll see if they take the next step and start allowing users to sign into various Yahoo services with the OpenID provider of their choice .
AUSTIN , Texas ( CNN ) -- Lady Bird Johnson , who was first lady during the 1960s and in her later years became an advocate for beautifying public landscapes , died Wednesday , family spokesman Tom Johnson said .
She was 94 .
Lady Bird Johnson 's real name was Claudia .
more photos »
She was the widow of Lyndon Baines Johnson , sworn in as the nation 's 36th president on November 22 , 1963 , just hours after President John F. Kennedy 's assassination .
Lady Bird Johnson was briefly hospitalized last month with a low - grade fever .
She was released and returned to her Austin home on June 28 .
After suffering a stroke in 2002 that limited her ability to speak , she communicated chiefly by writing .
Upon news of her death , Texas Gov. Rick Perry ordered flags in the state to be flown at half - staff .
" Lady Bird Johnson embodied all that is beautiful and good about the great state of Texas , " Perry said .
" She inspired generations of Americans with her graceful strength , unwavering commitment to family and keen sense of social justice . "
The former first lady was born Claudia Alta Taylor in 1912 in Karnack , Texas , a small town near the Louisiana line .
She got her unusual nickname while still a toddler from her nurse , who proclaimed the child was as " purty as a lady bird . "
Lady Bird attended St. Mary 's Episcopal School for Girls , a junior college near Dallas and then transferred to the University of Texas at Austin .
She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1933 , then stayed an extra year to earn a journalism degree .
She hoped to become a newspaper reporter , but those plans changed after she met a 26 - year - old congressional aide named Lyndon Baines Johnson .
Watch the former first lady 's life in restrospect »
They married in 1934 after a whirlwind courtship and soon moved to Washington .
Early on , Lady Bird Johnson proved herself to be the quintessential political wife .
In 1937 she used part of an inheritance to fund her husband 's first bid for public office and campaigned with him to win a congressional seat .
She used more of her mother 's money and Johnson 's connections to purchase a faltering Austin radio station in 1942 for $ 17,500 .
She turned it around and later used the station as a base for a multimillion - dollar communications company based in Austin .
After three failed pregnancies , she gave birth to the Johnsons ' first daughter , Lynda Bird , in 1944 , followed by Luci Baines three years later .
Lyndon Johnson rose quickly in politics , becoming the youngest Senate majority leader .
In 1960 , Johnson set his sights on the presidency but lost the Democratic nomination to Kennedy .
A day later , he agreed to become Kennedy 's running mate .
Lady Bird Johnson traveled more than 35,000 miles during that campaign .
After one of the closest presidential elections in U.S. history , Johnson was sworn in as vice president on January 20 , 1961 .
With Kennedy 's assassination , Johnson became the 36th president .
As the Johnsons moved into the White House , Lady Bird Johnson " went around and went to all of the staff that was remaining in their jobs , told them how happy she was to have them there , " said Leticia Baldridge , Jacqueline Kennedy 's former social secretary .
" She needed their help .
She needed their support .
And , of course , they all just immediately turned from supporting the Kennedys to supporting the Johnsons .
That 's what the staff does in the White House . "
In the landslide election of 1964 , Lyndon Johnson won victories in the Northeast , West and Southwest .
Of the eight Southern states that many had expected to vote for Republican Barry Goldwater , six went for LBJ -- in part , it was said , because of the first lady 's efforts .
During her husband 's one term as president , Lady Bird Johnson worked tirelessly for the beautification of America , promoting the Highway Beautification Act , which sought to limit billboards .
She was also a strong advocate for the Head Start program .
Lyndon Johnson died in 1973 .
In 1982 , she founded the National Wildflower Research Center outside of Austin .
The center was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in 1998 .
Its mission is the research and preservation of native plants throughout the United States .

All About Lady Bird Johnson
What is it to be “ sick ” ?
According to Merriam - Webster , there are two definitions :
1 : affected with disease or ill health
2 : spiritually or morally unsound or corrupt
This afternoon I viewed “ Sicko . ” I was one of the many audience members at the theater who applauded at the film ’s conclusion .
Sicko will serve provoke much - needed discussion regarding the American health care system .
Sicko invokes the second definition of “ sick ” as well .
My hope is that Sicko will also provoke desperately needed conversation , as well as substantive changes , to the American political system , where money acts as a virus and where the equivalent of white blood cells –the Media–has long gone into hibernation .
I am not optimistic about any self - instigated change in the American political system , but perhaps Sicko will provoke the media to start digging into the millions of health care injustices in America .
These compelling stories are there for the taking .
Perhaps these many cases where health care is being unfairly denied to Americans will at least occasionally start showing up on the front pages of America ’s newspapers .
Before Sicko was released , the undeniable fact that America is having a health care crisis was not considered newsworthy by the corporate media .
Nor has any real healthcare conversation occurred in this country since Hillary Clinton was bludgeoned into silence on the issue thanks to more than $ 100 million spent by healthcare corporations more than 10 years ago .
Our political system is wretchedly sick .
Moore makes this clear when he shows us a large room full of members of Congress , complete with little green tags superimposed to show how much money each of them has taken from big healthcare corporations .
Sicko is not just about the uninsured .
It is also about those who have insurance .
For that reason , this film should be of interest to both the 50 million Americans who do n’t have health insurance ( 18,000 of them die each year because they are uninsured ) as well as the quarter of a billion Americans who do have insurance .
Our health care insurance system is horribly sick ( again , in the sense that it is spiritually or morally unsound or corrupt ) .
American health care insurance is based upon the idea that you become highly profitable by denying claims to people who deserve reimbursement and who often happen to be dying .
They can always go to court , of course .
Then , when the jury renders a large judgment against the insurance company , the relatives of the now - dead insured person can enjoy the money .
How do those numerous healthcare claims get denied ?
It ’s easy .
Doctors hired by the insurance companies stamp their names onto denial letters that are cranked out en masse by insurance company computers .
Keep in mind , that no insurance company executive needs to go around with horns or a pitchfork telling doctors to deny claims that they should n’t deny .
No one has to tell anyone else to screw the sick people .
All the insurance companies need to do is to put the right incentives in place .
In Sicko , Moore makes it clear that the insurance companies have implemented carefully crafted schemes along those lines .
As you might expect in a Michael Moore film , you will find some imaginative and effective ways of portraying complicated issues .
I do n’t want to spoil the film by detailing any of these here .
Suffice it to say that you will get your money ’s worth if you go to see the movie .
Moore attacks the “ socialized medicine ” bogeyman with gusto .
With some clever use of older video materials and historical political archives , Moore mocks those who would shoot down the idea of socialized medicine as un-American .
After all , what ’s so bad about socializing a service that should be socialized ?
For instance , we have socialized firefighters and socialized teachers working in our public schools .
As has been well publicized already , Michael Moore spends considerable time exploring the socialized medical systems of Canada , Great Britain and France .
Many of the one - on - one interviews Moore conducts with those involved in those “ socialize ” ecosystems involve Moore at his best .
An interview with a British doctor is entertaining and edifying .
Moore carefully points out that in countries with “ socialized ” medicine , the doctors received bonuses if they can convince their patients to make better health choices such as giving up smoking and reducing their blood pressure .
This incentive program contrasts nicely with the scheme by which American insurance companies make money by endangering the health of Americans ( through denial of services ) .
One thing and Sicko failed to do is to point out that American citizens really should bear more responsibility for their wretched health .
Many of our health issues are brought on by our own shortsighted behavior , including our over eating , our smoking , our excessive drinking and our lack of exercise .
Then again , this responsibility comes full circle , because of the conspicuous lack of public health measures in the United States .
Americans would be more healthy if they were provoked to be more healthy in dramatic ways .
We need to compete with the huge advertising budgets of private corporations peddling their unhealthy goods and services to Americans .
We could make some progress if the federal government would fund prime time television announcements concerning public health , using videos created by the best minds of Madison Avenue .
I need to be careful about pointing out where Moore is at his “ best . ”
He is strong with the one - on - one interviews with regular folks .
He is strong when he resorts to taunting those who are powerful and uncaring .
He makes effective use of statistics ( according to CNN , Michael Moore ’s facts are checking out quite well ) .
Moore is also strong when he discusses the proper purpose of government .
For instance , in one interview it is brought out that there are two ways to control people .
You can frighten them or demoralize them .
These are tactics that both succeed in keeping people from coming out and voting .
Although it is not specifically presented in Sicko , Michael Moore has issued a three - point Health Care Proposal that would provide free medical care for every resident of the United States .
Whether these aims can be accomplished in exactly the way Moore proposes is only a starting point for the discussion .
I believe that , at a minimum , there should be a basic level of healthcare guaranteed to every U.S. citizen that is funded by the government .
If you break an arm , if the baby has a high fever or if you have chest pains , for instance , it is in the national interest that medical care providers are funded by the government to provide that medical care , no questions asked .
Thorny questions remain as to the extent the government should fund experimental treatment and extremely high - priced end of life treatment .
A government that is willing to spend all funds necessary to keep all of the Terry Schaivos of the U.S. “ alive ” would quickly bankrupt our system ( there are as many as 40,000 such “ people ” in the U.S. at any given time ) .
The huge amount of money spent to maintain even one such person could go far to help many families needing primary or preventive care .
Therefore , medical issues are interlaced with moral issues .
In the U.S. these issues are interlaced in a contorted and highly politicized way that ignores the plight of the numerous U.S. families desperate for basic medical care for their children .
As much as we might not want to think about it , we do need to allocate our limited budget dollars among many social needs , and medical care is only one of these critical social needs .
For instance , medical care tax dollars would necerssarily compete against education dollars .
Reasonable people might differ on how to best allocate money to these big ticket items .
It is important to note that the Canadian health care system Moore admires in Sicko does not cover all medical expenses .
Many Canadians supplement their guaranteed coverage with private insurance .
The point is that we do need to have a frank and national conversation on all of these issues so that there will not be a need to cause acute national embarrassment to our country ( in five or ten years ) with a film called Sicko II .
WHITE - COLLAR workers in the developing world are likely to enjoy sizeable real - pay increases this year , according to a study by Hay Group , a management consultancy .
Its report is based on employers ' expectations of pay awards , adjusted for inflation .
Real pay tends to rise in line with economic growth , which is why China and India are set for the biggest increases of the 52 countries surveyed .

A mediator is a thingie i invented in 1995 that transforms the Web experience by taking on the functions of both a client and a server to become a man - in - the - middle .
Other people have thought of this too and built some interesting mediators over the years ( here 's a list ) .
I think i was the first to do it but i'm not sure .
Some people are calling these things " proxies " ; i would prefer to stay away from that term , since the explicit purpose of a mediator is to add value by changing the transmitted information , not to preserve and duplicate it exactly ( the latter is the mandate of a proxy , and corresponds to the meaning of the word proxy : " authority to act for another " ) .
IBM has decided to reinvent this technology and give it fancy names like " web browser intelligence " and " transcoding " .
Whatever .
Mediators can be used to accomplish some very useful things ( such as adding mathematical expressions or public annotation to the Web with no user effort ) .
They can also do very silly things ... like this one .
Some mediator - like services download the entire page before modifying it and presenting it to you , but this one modifies and forwards it to you continuously while it 's coming over .
Setting up this mediator for the first time only took about ten minutes , starting from some streaming mediation code that i'd already written .
That code is part of CritLink , which is available for download at crit.org .
Go ahead and have fun with it .
( The mediator actually running now is written in C++ for speed , based on a mediation library that forms the core of both Malkovich and Shodouka . )

Residents objected to the Italian street name
The cul - de-sac in Earlston was called Cappella Maggiore after a request by the community council to honour the town they twinned with in 2004 .
However , residents moving into the new homes - which cost between £ 160,000 and £ 240,000 - have complained that it sounds " ridiculous " .
Scottish Borders Council has agreed to rename the street Station Brae .
Regular visits
Cappella Maggiore is situated in northern Italy close to the city of Treviso .
Since it formed twinning links with Earlston there have been regular visits between the two towns .
Last year a delegation of about 30 school pupils and council officials were hosted by families in the Borders .
They were also taken on a tour of the Scottish Parliament .
New Hampshire 's primary delivered a " surprise " upset victory to Senator Hillary Clinton , contradicting all pre-election poll predictions and even the facts on the ground , which showed Senator Obama with a strong lead and enthusiastic overflow crowds at every New Hampshire appearance .
Political pundits in the corporate media and citizen journalists in the Blogosphere alike are all asking the same question :
What happened in New Hampshire ?
It 's pretty easy to see what happened in New Hampshire :
We had an election for which 81 % of our ballots were counted in secret by a private corporation , and this resulted in an outcome that is called into question .
That 's what happened .
No recount is going to change this .
What will change this is to get rid of corporate controlled secret vote counting in our elections .
New Hampshire holds exemplary elections in 45 % of our polling places ; elections where our paper ballots are counted by hand by our neighbors in full public view with 100 % citizen oversight and checks and balances .
These hand count elections , of which New Hampshire is the “ hands down ” expert , provide the only method known today that can guarantee open and honest elections .
These are elections where every ballot , every vote , every mark made by the voter , is observed and tallied in full public view with multiple sets of eyes watching and checking and balancing each count .
New Hampshire already knows how to fix this problem .
For the past four years , New Hampshire citizens have been asking the State to fix this problem , but the State has thus far refused .
We do n't need a recount now .
What we need now is for the State to reconsider and implement procedural and legislative solutions to guarantee open and honest elections .
A recount wo n’t provide any significant benefit to the cause of free and fair and open elections .
Bringing back full citizen oversight and checks and balances to all New Hampshire elections is the only way to avoid having any more questionable election outcomes in the Granite State .
Beginning with our state Founders , civil rights activists have been fighting for open elections as the mechanism to protect our freedom and democracy .
The New Hampshire Constitution mandates we sort and count our votes in open meeting .
The New Hampshire Right to Know law , citing our Constitution , declares that the government derives its power from the people and therefore all government processes and information must be fully accessible to the people .
The United States Bill of Rights similarly asserts that the government derives its power from the people , who have the right to " alter or abolish " said government if it fails to act in our favor .
Our right to " alter or abolish " peacefully comes through open and honest elections .
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 mandates observable vote counting .
But despite this long history of grassroots activism in support of free and open elections , New Hampshire has turned the majority of our elections into privatized affairs with no citizen oversight whatsoever .
Now activists around the nation are calling for a recount .
In New Hampshire the manual recount has always been held as justification for holding elections in which more than 80 % of our ballots are counted in secret by private corporations .
Does this logic hold up ?
Will a recount rectify the problem before us ?
I say no .
The problem before us is that we have outsourced the most precious thing in our democracy : the counting of our votes .
And in New Hampshire , we have outsourced more than 80 % of our votes to a private corporation counting those votes in secret , and , as it turns out , that private corporation has a convicted drug trafficker on its executive team to boot .
A recount does not solve this problem .
Proponents and apologists of the privatized and computerized corporate elections often justify computerized elections saying how “ easy ” it is to corrupt a hand count election .
They say , “ But you can always swap out the ballots to get the count you want ! ”
A classic paper by Drew McDermott , “ Artificial Intelligence Meets Natural Stupidity , ” criticized AI programs that would try to represent notions like happiness is a state of mind using a semantic network :
And of course there ’s nothing inside the HAPPINESS node ; it ’s just a naked lisptoken with a suggestive English name .
So , McDermott says , “ A good test for the disciplined programmer is to try using gensyms in key places and see if he still admires his system .
For example , if STATE - OF - MIND is renamed G1073 . . . ” then we would have IS - A( HAPPINESS , G1073 ) “ which looks much more dubious . ”
Or as I would slightly rephrase the idea :
If you substituted randomized symbols for all the suggestive English names , you would be completely unable to figure out what G1071 ( G1072 , G1073 ) meant .
Was the AI program meant to represent hamburgers ?
Apples ?
Happiness ?
Who knows ?
If you delete the suggestive English names , they do n’t grow back .
Suppose a physicist tells you that “ Light is waves , ” and you believe the physicist .
You now have a little network in your head that says :
IS - A( LIGHT , WAVES )
As McDermott says , “ The whole problem is getting the hearer to notice what it has been told .
Not ‘ understand , ’ but ‘ notice . ’ ” Suppose that instead the physicist told you , “ Light is made of little curvy things . ” 1
Would you notice any difference of anticipated experience ?
How can you realize that you should n’t trust your seeming knowledge that “ light is waves ” ?
One test you could apply is asking , “ Could I regenerate his knowledge if it were somehow deleted from my mind ? ”
This is similar in spirit to scrambling the names of suggestively named lisp tokens in your AI program , and seeing if someone else can figure out what they allegedly “ refer ” to .
It ’s also similar in spirit to observing that an Artificial Arithmetician programmed to record and play back
Plus - Of ( Seven , Six ) = Thirteen
ca n’t regenerate the knowledge if you delete it from memory , until another human re-enters it in the database .
Just as if you forgot that “ light is waves , ” you could n’t get back the knowledge except the same way you got the knowledge to begin with — by asking a physicist .
You could n’t generate the knowledge for yourself , the way that physicists originally generated it .
The same experiences that lead us to formulate a belief , connect that belief to other knowledge and sensory input and motor output .
If you see a beaver chewing a log , then you know what this thing - that - chews - through - logs looks like , and you will be able to recognize it on future occasions whether it is called a “ beaver ” or not .
But if you acquire your beliefs about beavers by someone else telling you facts about “ beavers , ” you may not be able to recognize a beaver when you see one .
This is the terrible danger of trying to tell an artificial intelligence facts that it could not learn for itself .
It is also the terrible danger of trying to tell someone about physics that they cannot verify for themselves .
For what physicists mean by “ wave ” is not “ little squiggly thing ” but a purely mathematical concept .
As Donald Davidson observes , if you believe that “ beavers ” live in deserts , are pure white in color , and weigh 300 pounds when adult , then you do not have any beliefs
about beavers , true or false .
Your belief about “ beavers ” is not right enough to be wrong .
2
If you do n’t have enough experience to regenerate beliefs when they are deleted , then do you have enough experience to connect that belief to anything at all ?
Wittgenstein : “ A wheel that can be turned though nothing else moves with it , is not part of the mechanism . ”
Almost as soon as I started reading about AI — even before I read McDermott — I realized it would be a really good idea to always ask myself : “ How would I regenerate this knowledge if it were deleted from my mind ? ”
The deeper the deletion , the stricter the test .
If all proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem were deleted from my mind , could I re-prove it ?
I think so .
If all knowledge of the Pythagorean Theorem were deleted from my mind , would I notice the Pythagorean Theorem to re-prove ?
That ’s harder to boast , without putting it to the test ; but if you handed me a right triangle with sides of length 3 and 4 , and told me that the length of the hypotenuse was calculable , I think I would be able to calculate it , if I still knew all the rest of my math .
What about the notion of mathematical proof ?
If no one had ever told it to me , would I be able to reinvent that on the basis of other beliefs I possess ?
There was a time when humanity did not have such a concept .
Someone must have invented it .
What was it that they noticed ?
Would I notice if I saw something equally novel and equally important ?
Would I be able to think that far outside the box ?
How much of your knowledge could you regenerate ?
From how deep a deletion ?
It ’s not just a test to cast out insufficiently connected beliefs .
It ’s a way of absorbing a fountain of knowledge , not just one fact .
A shepherd builds a counting system that works by throwing a pebble into a bucket whenever a sheep leaves the fold , and taking a pebble out whenever a sheep returns .
If you , the apprentice , do not understand this system — if it is magic that works for no apparent reason — then you will not know what to do if you accidentally drop an extra pebble into the bucket .
That which you cannot make yourself , you cannot remake when the situation calls for it .
You can not go back to the source , tweak one of the parameter settings , and regenerate the output , without the source .
If “ two plus four equals six ” is a brute fact unto you , and then one of the elements changes to “ five , ” how are you to know that “ two plus five equals seven ” when you were simply told that “ two plus four equals six ” ?
If you see a small plant that drops a seed whenever a bird passes it , it will not occur to you that you can use this plant to partially automate the sheep - counter .
Though you learned something that the original maker would use to improve on their invention , you ca n’t go back to the source and re-create it .
When you contain the source of a thought , that thought can change along with you as you acquire new knowledge and new skills .
When you contain the source of a thought , it becomes truly a part of you and grows along with you .
Strive to make yourself the source of every thought worth thinking .
If the thought originally came from outside , make sure it comes from inside as well .
Continually ask yourself : “ How would I regenerate the thought if it were deleted ? ”
When you have an answer , imagine that knowledge being deleted as well .
And when you find a fountain , see what else it can pour .

BEIJING , CHINA ( BosNewsLife ) --
A church in China 's autonomous region of Xinjiang faced uncertainty Thursday , February 14 , after Chinese security forces raided its Sunday School , detaining church leaders and interrogating " terrified " children , investigators said .
Religious rights group China Aid Association ( CAA ) said officers of the Public Security Bureau ( PSB ) , the country 's main law enforcement agency , also threatened to destroy the church in Xinjiang 's capital Urumqi .
" Eyewitnesses told [ us ] that the three church leaders including pastor Zhang Ying , brother Cui and brother Ju
Ge were taken away by the PSB while they were leading a Sunday school class for more than 20 children , " added CAA , which is in close contact with the church .
China 's communist government forbids religious education for children under the age of 18 , said CAA .
The young students attending the Sunday School were therefore " forced to give out the names of their parents , " who were ordered to bring their children home , the group added .
In addition , PSB officers searched the church and confiscated " some private properties , " the group claimed , adding that the children were " terrified . "
It came after elsewhere in China , in Yunan Province , two Christian women , Meng Xiu Lan , - 55 , and Zhou Cheng Xiu- 53 , were detained and sexually abused by police in Jun Tun County on February 2 , CAA added .
WOMEN ABUSED
Policemen from the Jun Tun police department allegedly detained the women after they were found distributing Christmas cards .
" The two women were first threatened and mocked by police before being stripped naked , and frisked violently , " CAA said in a statement seen by BosNewsLife .
" Police then handcuffed the two women and escorted them back to their homes . "
After searching their homes , police " illegally confiscated CDs , handouts , Bibles , song books and calendars . "
The reported police violence was the latest in a series of government - backed attacks against devoted Christians in China , CAA and other Christian groups said .
In one of the first reported incidents this year , state officials in Xinjiang region apparently targeted ethnic Uyghur Christians on January 12 , detaining Alimjan Yimit , a former Muslim convert and Christian house church leader .
He reportedly told family members that the arrest was described by police as “ national security issue . ”
Details of charges against Alimjan were not immediately clear , but Christians have said it appears he was detained for his evangelical activities .
In September 13 last year officials ordered him to close down his Kashgar - based company , on charges of using it “ as a cover to preach Christianity among people of Uyghur ethnicity , ” CAA and other sources said .
UYGHUR CHRISTIANS
The arrest followed that of another Uyghur Christian , Osman Imin , on November 19 , 2007 , for assisting foreigners in alleged " illegal religious activities " and " revealing state secrets , " CAA said .
Police reportedly also detained and tortured Osman in 2004 .
CAA and other groups say there has accused the government of launching a coordinated campaign against Uyghur Christians and house churches , ahead of the upcoming Olympic Games in Beijing .
Chinese authorities have expressed concerns that evangelical Christians will use that event to spread Christianity in this Communist nation .
They have strongly denied reports of human rights abuses , saying Christians are free to worship within the official , government backed , denominations .
CAA said it expects world leaders , including United States President George W. Bush , will keep use the Olympic Games to voice their concern to Chinese leaders about the apparent deteriorating condition of religious freedom within China .
RELIGIOUS AWARD
Bush recently praised Bob Fu , president of CAA , for his involvment in defending religious rights .
And , last week February 7 , Fu was presented the 2007 John Leland Religious Liberty Award " for courageously defending the right of all people to exercise freely their religious faith " at the Library of Congress .
The award , which recognizes individuals who have made a significant contribution to the cause of religious liberty , was be presented by Dr. Richard Land , president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention .
In China , Fu served as a leader for the People ’s University of Beijing student democracy movement , which ended in what became known as the Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4 , 1989 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said on Tuesday some physical interrogation techniques can be used on a suspect in the event of an imminent threat , such as a hidden bomb about to blow up .
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia attends a National Italian American Foundation gala dinner in Washington October 13 , 2007 .
Scalia said on Tuesday some physical interrogation techniques can be used on a suspect in the event of an imminent threat , such as a hidden bomb about to blow up .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
In such cases , “ smacking someone in the face ” could be justified , the outspoken Scalia told the BBC .
“ You ca n’t come in smugly and with great self satisfaction and say ‘ Oh it ’s torture , and therefore it ’s no good . ’ ”
His comments come amid a growing debate about the Bush administration ’s use of aggressive interrogation methods on terrorism suspects rights after the September 11 attacks , including the use of a widely condemned interrogation technique known as waterboarding .
Scalia said that it was “ extraordinary ” to assume that the U.S. Constitution ’s ban on “ cruel and unusual punishment ” also applied to “ so - called ” torture .
“ To begin with the Constitution ... is referring to punishment for crime .
And , for example , incarcerating someone indefinitely would certainly be cruel and unusual punishment for a crime , ” he said in an interview with the Law in Action program on BBC Radio 4 .
Scalia said stronger measures could be taken when a witness refused to answer questions .
“ I suppose it ’s the same thing about so - called torture .
Is it really so easy to determine that smacking someone in the face to determine where he has hidden the bomb that is about to blow up Los Angeles is prohibited in the Constitution ? ” he asked .
“ It would be absurd to say you could n’t do that .
And once you acknowledge that , we ’re into a different game ” Scalia said .
“ How close does the threat have to be ?
And how severe can the infliction of pain be ? ”
Scalia , who has long supported capital punishment , also ridiculed European criticism of the death penalty in the United States .
“ If you took a public opinion poll , if all of Europe had representative democracies that really worked , most of Europe would probably have the death penalty today , ” he said .
“ There are arguments for it and against it .
But to get self - righteous about the thing as Europeans tend to do about the American death penalty is really quite ridiculous , ” he said .

Hervé
This is on a mission .
' By the time I die , I want cooking to have changed , ' he says .
In his native France , Hervé This ( pronounced ' Tiss ' ) is a star , the country 's most famous chemist .
He appears on TV and radio , his books are bestsellers , government ministers ring him for advice and there is a travelling exhibition based on his work .
In this country , one of Hervé 's biggest fans is Heston Blumenthal , with whom Hervé , 51 , has worked on several experiments .
' So much of cooking is mystique , ' Blumenthal says .
' That way , it makes chefs look like geniuses .
But the more we can explain , the more approachable it becomes .
That 's how food will move forward and Hervé has turned many things on their head . '
His specialism is the science of cooking .
For him , every foodstuff is ' a chemical mixture ' .
' When aromatic compounds are formed on the surface of a roast , they are the result of a chemical reaction .
When mushrooms turn black after being chopped , it is the fruit of a chemical reaction . '
Over the years , his musings on chemical reactions have led to a number of discoveries .
He has worked out how to uncook an egg .
He has calculated that you can produce 24 litres of mayonnaise with a single yolk .
He has invented a Béarnaise sauce by replacing butter with melted chocolate , as well as ' chocolate chantilly ' ( a form of whipped chocolate prepared in the same way as crème chantilly ) .
He 's baked an egg for an hour at 55 °C , managing somehow to leave the yolk ' exceptionally smooth and tender ' .
Almost 10 years ago , Hervé investigated colloids ( substances that are neither completely solid nor liquid , such as emulsions , mousses and gels ) and devised a system of formulae based on the dispersion of gases , liquids and solids within each other .
' It can be used to invent an infinite number of dishes , ' he claims .
He told Pierre Gagnaire , one of France 's leading chefs , about his find , and the chef came up with a new recipe called Saint - Jacques ' Faraday ' - an emulsion created with scallops , orange - flavoured oil , smoked tea and gelatine .
Every month Hervé sends Gagnaire an idea from his lab which the chef incorporates into a recipe .
( A collection of them is posted on Gagnaire 's website . )
Hervé has taught at the universities of Tours and Montpellier , and has his own laboratory at the venerable Collège de France , which , today , is also the base for all four of France 's living Nobel prize winners .
One of them , Jean - Marie Lehn , invited Hervé to join his department in 1995 .
In Hervé 's laboratory , there is a cupboard full of chemical compounds such as sulphuric acid , sodium carbonate and Mercurochrome , while the shelves are stacked with things you 'd normally associate with the kitchen : bottles of balsamic vinegar and olive oil , pots of mustard and cinnamon , bags of salt and shallots , and a bar of chocolate .
There are also piles of notebooks , in which he notes down his experiments , as well as literary sayings and advice he comes across .
' I go through ancient recipe books , preferably from the 18th and 19th centuries , jot down what they have to say and test it , ' he says .
He says that Madame de Saint - Ange ( who wrote the bible of bourgeoise cuisine in 1927 ) is a mine of sayings , but that much of her advice is incorrect .
More exact are Le Livre de Cuisine by Jules Gouffé ( first published in 1867 ) and Auguste Escoffier 's Guide Culinaire .
' Some of Escoffier 's advice is startlingly sound , ' says Hervé .
He recommended , for example , that pepper be added to a stock only eight minutes before it is taken off the heat .
The explanation , Hervé has discovered , is that further cooking means the more desirable , spicy aromatic molecules volatilise and are replaced by bitter tannins .
' There is no limit to Hervé 's curiosity , ' says the three - Michelin - starred chef , Antoine Westermann .
He arrives at his lab at 7:30 am and works non-stop .
Once , during his summer holidays , he wrote three books , taking breaks only to play ping - pong with his two sons .
For those in the profession , however , he makes himself far more available .
' He does n't work for financial gain , ' says Gagnaire .
' Simply to transmit his knowledge . '
According to American Vogue 's food critic , Jeffrey Steingarten , Hervé has the tools to do so : ' He 's an exciting lecturer .
He talks fast and loud , cracks jokes and is quite a showman .
He has the audience in the palm of his hand . '
On the morning of our second meeting , Hervé measures the pressure inside a chip .
He 's aiming to disprove a famous scientific paper which states that oil infiltrates chips during cooking .
He heats oil to 168 °C , measures a chip , hooks it up to a manometer and plunges it in the oil .
Unfortunately , the experiment goes wrong and ends up with the chip falling to the bottom of the pan .
He is unconcerned .
' In order to come up with conclusive results , I 'll have to carry it out 100 times . '
He then shows me several other experiments .
There is a jar full of pears and a few bits of tin .
There is a quail 's egg that has been standing in vinegar for three years .
The acid has attacked its shell and made it translucent .
By osmosis , it has swelled up to about four times its original size .
Hervé says that it has the same consistency as a hard - boiled egg and could be eaten in a salad .
But what really intrigues me , of course , is exactly how he managed to unboil an egg .
He explains that when an egg is cooked , the protein molecules unroll themselves , link up and enclose the water molecules .
In order to ' uncook ' the egg , you need to detach the protein molecules from each other .
By adding a product like sodium borohydride , the egg becomes liquid within three hours .
For those who want to try it at home , vitamin C also does the trick .
While the discovery may be fun , it does not have many practical applications ( most of us prefer our eggs both cooked and flavoured with salt rather than strange chemicals ) .
Many of his other results , however , can be applied to everyday cooking .
He says that adding oil to water while cooking spaghetti does not prevent the different strands from sticking together - unless you use very little water and litres of oil .
He advises that , in order for a poached or fried egg white to be evenly cooked , you should sprinkle a little salt around the yolk ( it speeds up the cooking of a protein found there , which coagulates less easily than the other proteins in the egg white ) .
The discovery he is proudest of , however , concerns meat stews .
' For many centuries , so much rubbish was written about them . '
One tradition said that you should start off cooking the meat in cold water .
Another claimed the opposite .
According to Hervé , it makes no difference .
The meat loses the same amount of weight in both cases .
Hervé , who has written seven bestselling books , grew up in a family of gourmets .
Whenever they went skiing in the Alps , they would stop to eat at Paul Bocuse .
On a boating holiday one summer , he invented 27 different recipes for mackerel .
At the age of six , he was given his first chemistry set .
' I was always doing strange experiments at home , ' he says .
' My brother still recalls with despair how I once distilled violets for Mother 's Day . '
Later , he went on to study at the prestigious Ecole de Physique - Chimie in Paris and also managed to do a French literature degree at the same time .
On graduation in 1980 , he joined Pour La Science ( the French edition of Scientific American ) .
He would stay there for 20 years as a scientific adviser .
His experiments in food began in the spring of 1980 when he tried to make a Roquefort soufflé from a recipe in Elle , which stated that you had to add the eggs two by two .
Hervé decided to ignore the advice and put all the eggs in at the same time .
His soufflé was a flop .
The following week , he had another go , this time adding the eggs one by one .
The result was better , but not as good as when he made yet another soufflé , this time following the recipe to the letter .
It got him thinking about the scientific reasons for adding the eggs two by two .
Over the years , he says , his sons have eaten some 400 soufflés .
I join him and his wife , Pascale , a cancer doctor , for dinner , at their house near Versailles , for a meal full of his inventions .
The starter is tomate royale , a sort of barely - set quiche .
And the main course , salmon en croûte is accompanied by an unidentifiable pile of vegetables .
' It 's an emulsion of chestnuts ' , says Hervé The food is hugely variable .
The salmon scrumptious , the dessert disgusting .
Hervé believes his originality lies in the fact that he applies his knowledge of chemistry to the food of ordinary people , while other scientists work in the food industry .
' Food science , ' he says , 'has never dealt with cooking .
It does n't give a damn about soufflés and stews . '
Still , he 's had precursors , notably the Hungarian - born , Oxford - based physicist Nicholas Kurti , who in 1969 gave a lecture at the Royal Institute called The Physicist in the Kitchen .
Hervé first met Kurti in 1988 .
It was , he says , ' a friendly case of love at first sight ' .
They ended up working on experiments together .
By his own admission , Hervé 's relations with chefs are ' very friendly , but very complicated ' .
Philippe Conticini has elaborated a menu for Petrossian in Paris based around Hervé 's work on ' frothy emulsions ' .
There is his regular monthly link - up with Pierre Gagnaire ; Alain Passard says he has one of Hervé 's books constantly on his desk .
' It 's a real education , ' he says .
' He teaches us things we could never have suspected . '
Even the government has been won over .
Former French Minister of Education , Jack Lang , introduced La Casserole des Enfants into schools and Hervé came up with a list of 10 different experiments that could be carried out by primary - school children .
Blumenthal believes Hervé is a true radical .
' If anyone is going to change the way we cook , it will be him , ' he says .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A bonfire celebration in York , the home town of Guy Fawkes , has been banned on health and safety grounds , the local council said Tuesday .
Thousands were due to attend the spectacle on the 402nd anniversary of Fawkes ’ failed plot to blow up parliament .
But York City Football Club was told their ground was too small to ensure spectator safety , a decision which left the head of the cathedral city ’s tourist board “ lost for words . ”
York Council ’s head of licensing , Dick Haswell , declined to be interviewed Tuesday .
But in an emailed statement he defended the decision , saying it was made on health and safety grounds .
“ Because the football club was proposing to hold a firework display in a certified sports ground , legally , they had to apply to York ’s Safety at Sports Advisory Group for a Special Safety Certificate , ” he said .
“ Unfortunately the ground was not large enough to provide the necessary distance between the area where fireworks could fall and spectators . ”
The chief executive of York Tourism Board , Gillian Crudass , said she was “ lost for words ” at the council ’s decision .
“ We are very much disappointed because it is a British tradition , ” she told Reuters .
“ It attracts a lot of interest not just from local people , but also from visitors from all around the country who come for a short break -- as well as international interest . ”
A spokesman for the football club declined to comment .
Guy Fawkes was born in April 1570 in Stonegate , York and was in charge of executing the Roman Catholic plot to blow up parliament and the protestant King James 1 during the state opening of parliament on November 5 , 1605 .
The plot was uncovered at the last minute and Fawkes was caught and executed early in 1606 .

Chemotherapy has a cumulative effect , so it takes longer to recover the deeper one gets into this .
Our current thinking is that more chemotherapy may not be wise ; at this point , almost all potential chemotherapies may potentially make me so weak / sick that even if they were to slow the tumor , it would not be clear it would be the right tradeoff .
We are currently narrowing down some immunuotherapy - based apporaches that would presumably come with little or no side effects .
More news as that proceeds .

Tie - dye stays on skin quite a while ! ) .
I 'll try to get a photo up shortly .
Health - wise , I 'm slowly bouncing back from the last round of chemo .
Last Thursday 's PET scan showed that the cancer continues to grow , but is still more restrained in its rate of growth than it might be , which is good .
June 10th , 2008 : A Letter from President Bush I recently received a letter from President Bush .
Carnegie Mellon checked , and it 's for real .
Click on the image to see a large version of the letter .
This is something I suspect will be good for my kids to see someday .
May 28th , 2008 : Chemo works out poorly
Well , I ran 101 fever for three days , did a bunch of vomiting , and was too sick to really get out of bed for 5 or 6 days .
Needless to say , that chemo is n't our winning combination .
Back to the drawing board ...
May 20th , 2008 : Return to chemo
We tried a new regimen today : ( eribitux + ironotecan ) .
Blood pressure has now been undercontrol nicely and we figured I was strong enough to give it a try .
May 18th , 2008 : A perfect day !
Everyone should have a day this perfect in their lives .
Carnegie Mellon flew Jai and me up to Pittsburgh to attend graduation .
I had the honor of giving the charge to the graduates at the end of the ceremony .
Even the weather cooperated to make it a perfect day with the sun breaking through the rain clouds as the ceremony started .
I also got to speak briefly to the SCS and ETC commencement ceremonies .
It was wonderful to see all of our old friends and colleagues and I was very touched by the invitation .
My three minute address and dramatic ending ---------------->
May 13th , 2008 : Strength slowly returning I 'm sorry I have n't posted much recently ; there just has n't been too much notable going on .
Mostly , I 'm resting and rebuilding strength .
Today has been my best day in a while ; I took at 2 hour nap in the afternoon , but other that that have been up and active all day .
Today 's box score : Creatanine ( kidney function ) : 2.8 CA19 - 9 ( tumor marker ) : 634 Blood Pressure : 135 / 85
May 10th , 2008 : Vroom !
For Mother 's Day , we managed to arrange to have Jai get away for a night in a local hotel , where she was able to sleep in until 9 am ; a truly rare treat for a mother of three little kids !
We also took a spin in a " kit car " of a 1965 Shelby Cobra .
May 2nd , 2008 : Cancer spreads Yesterday 's PET scan showed that I have very tiny ( 5 mm or less ) metastases in my lungs and some lymph nodes in my chest .
I also have some metastases in my peritoneum and retroperitoneum cavities ( basically , inside my abdomen ) .
This is unfortunate , but we knew it would happen sooner or later , and we 've been able to stave it off much longer than anticipated , so I 'm very grateful for that .
My current strategy is to continue to recover from the heart and kidney failure , and once I 'm strong enough , then we 'll either do the SIR - Spheres or some systemic chemo , depending on the relative growth of the liver and non-liver tumors .
April 27 , 2008 : Still recouperating I 'm in the process of slowly getting my strength back .
Once we have demonstarated we can keep the blood pressure down , then we can dial back on the blood pressure meds , which are causing a good part of the fatigure .
Several people have expressed concern about the tumor marker .
True , it 's going up .
But by the time this is over , it 'll probably be over 5,000 , so do n't worry too much just yet !
Today 's box score : Creatanine ( kidney function ) : 3.1 CA19 - 9 ( tumor marker ) : 404 Blood Pressure : 130 / 82
April 19 , 2008 : Recent Doctor visit and my health
For those of you scoring the game at home , see today 's box score .
I 'm recovering much faster this time from the congestive heart failure ( practice makes perfect , I guess ) .
I 'm still hideously fatigued , but today I was out of bed most of the day .
Two of my favorite people , MR Kesley and Jessica Hodgins have been visiting , which is wonderful and has buoyed my spirits !
Today 's box score : Creatanine ( kidney function ) : 3.2 CA19 - 9 ( tumor marker ) : 295 Blood Pressure : 134 / 88
April 18 : I only cared about the first three copies ...
Hyperion sent me a nice plaque ... apparently the book we did ( for which the credit goes to Jeff Zaslow ) , has become a # 1 best seller .
Hyperion says they 're about to have two million copies in print , but all I cared about was the first 3 copies .
April 16 , 2008 : In praise of good pill bottle design
On the left you can see the total number of medications I 'm currently taking .
Keeping all this straight is a nightmare .
I 'm really impressed with Target 's unique design ( see right ) .
The bottles stand on their caps , there 's a large flat surface , and they make the font as large as will fit .
This is a wonderful example of " design making the world a better place . "
April 15 : Chloe and Cindy Lou Hoo
Thanks to my friend Jack , who pointed out recently that Chloe and Cindy Lou Hoo appear to be separated at birth !
April 15 , 2008 : Heart Failure , Part Deux E ck .
Yesterday 's visit to the cardiologist showed that I 'm technically back in heart failure .
My " ejection fraction " ( basically , heart output ) dropped back down to 30 % .
The good news is that only 24 hours later , the medications they put me on have put my blood pressure back in the normal range , and the diuretics have caused me to drop 4 pounds of water weight ; both of which were doubtless contributors .
It was n't serious enough to land me back in the hospital , and I 'm hopeful we 'll have this turned around pretty quickly .
The major bummer is that the blood pressure meds make me fatigued .
April 12 , 2008 : Qualified for SIR - Spheres at Univ. of Maryland I spent all day Thursday at the Univ. of Maryland , being seen by fantastic doctors .
I am now qualified for this treatment .
Jai &
I now need to decide how much longer I need to regain my strength before we might pursue this .
Oh , the picture here has nothing to do with the text ; I just thought it was a great photo of Chloe !
April 11 , 2008 : Robin carries Olympic Torch !
Robin Luo , a fellow cancer patient ( see below ; she 's the one who got " the elephant in the room " ) was an olympic torch carrier - how cool is that !
April 9 , 2008 : Getting Ready for Next Step
Well , I 'm not quite back on the bike , but I 'm healthy enough to travel and move forward with treatment .
Tomorrow I 'm spending the day at the University of Maryland being evaluted to see if I am a candidate for the SIR - Spheres treatment .
Basically , it 's a process where a large number of tiny ( thinner than human hair ) spheres are irradiated with Yittrium - 90 and then squirted into the artery that feeds the liver .
They preferentially go towards tumors ( counter - intuitive , but true ) , and both block blood flow to the tumors and irradiate them .
April 8 , 2008 : Book Launch , Media Craziness
The book went on sale today .
Lots of media outlets ran stories , which is very nice of them .
Diane Sawyer is running a special tomorrow ( Wednesday ) night at 10 pm on ABC .
People who know what I 'm really like will doubtless be throwing tomatoes at the screen ;-)
April 2 , 2008 : Getting back into the fight
For those of you familiar with boxing , I would describe the weeks since my heart & kidney failure to be a " standing eight count . "
I got knocked down pretty good and needed time to gather myself .
Now I 'm back on my feet ; still a little wobbly , but ready to engage in the fight again .
Yesterday 's CT and MRI scans showed that I 've added a new , 11th tumor ( small ) , and that a few of my original 10 tumors have grown , but only negligibly so .
My biggest tumor is about 2.5 cm in diameter .
Given that I 've been off chemo for six weeks , this was jumping - up - and - down good news , for two reasons : 1 ) It means the cancer has not grown like craxy , a big fear since stopping chemo .
2 ) Since all my tumors are in my liver , that means certain liver - specific treatments are possible .
I 'm typing this from a recovery room ; I just had a biopsy taken of my tumor tissue ; that will be sent to TGEN in arizona , where they will run some tests to see if they can identify which chemotherapy drugs might be most effective on my particular tumors .
My next step will probably be embolization with theraspheres ; a liver specific treatment that has a very low rate of side effects , and wo n't make me feel crappy like systemic chemo does .
The fight is rejoined ; I 've got much more energy now -- I hope to be back on the bike in a week or so .
March 30 , 2008 : Pancreatic Cancer does what Pol Pot could n't .
Today 's news brought the sad report that Dith Pran , one of the great heros of all time , and the inspiration behind the film The Killing Fields , just died from pancreatic cancer .
Details are in this story .
Pol Pot 's Khmer Rouge regime failed to kill Mr. Pran .
It took pancreatic cancer only three months from diagnosis .
March 29 2008 : Feeling better I 'm definitely having more energy ; spending less time in bed each day , and feeling more " human " overall .
My doctor says I 'm strong enough for us to start moving on tests and my next steps in treatment , probably in the next 2 weeks .
Good thing , too : my CA19 - 9 blood marker , which in my case is strongly correlated with tumor activity , has been slowly rising : recent CA19 - 9 numbers :
2/29 : 94
3/14 : 103
3/21 : 170
3/27 : 216
If my tumors were a stock , they'd have a " buy " rating ;-)
March 26 2008 : Slow going , but encouraging news
The last few weeks have been tough ; I 've been in bed most of each day , having to ration my energy , which is very unnatural for me .
Total exhaustion is very frustrating .
However , I am starting to , very slowly , gain more energy each day .
Tuesday 's trip to the cardiologist yielded great news : my echocardiogram showed that my heart function is definitely returning : my " ejection fraction " ( measure of blood ejection by the heart ) was at its low point 25 % ; it 's now up to at least 45 % , and " normal " is 55 to 70 percent .
Also , my cardiologist says a lot of the fatigue may be caused by one of my blood pressure medications ( coreg ) , and next week they will probably swap that out for another drug , now that I 'm doing better .
On the kidney front , my nephrologist is extermely encouraged - for those of you scoring the game at home , my creatanine level ( peaked at 3.9 ) is now down to 3.1 , and he says that 's a very stong indicator my kidney function is going to return .
The only bad news is that the tumors have apparently decided they 've been chivalrous enough ; my CA19 - 9 went up from 103 to 170 ; while not definitive , it 's a strong indicator that they are on the move .
So I need to hurry up and get healthy enough for our next round of treatment .
March 25 2008 : Time Management
Talk gets traction
People who know me know that the talk that I 'm actually most proud of is the talk I 've given over the years on " Time Management . "
With great thanks to Gabe Robins , I 'm thrilled to report that if you type " time management " into Google , the video of that talk is now the 6th result !
( By the way , I 've made that video available under a creative commons license , so anybody can show it for free , so long as they give attribution ) .
March 19 , 2008 : Very slow recovery
Well , except for the day to go to Congress , I 've now been resting at home for more than a week .
Spending almost all day in bed is hardly my normal state , but the exhaustion is very real .
I 've learned a lot about diuretics : drugs that force water out of the body .
Part of why my organs ( heart / kidney ) failed is that fluid built up in my body .
With aggressive diuretics , we 've forced 20 pounds out of my body in the last 12 days .
Wow .
I feel like a crushed grape !
The doctors are very optimistic my heart will return to something like 80 - 90 % of its original capacity ( which is fine ; I went into this with great heart function ) .
The biggest question is whether my kidneys will recover and start working on their own .
We just stopped the diuretics , to see if my kidneys will " kick in " on their own .
It will take probably 2 weeks to know for sure .
For those of you scoring the game at home , my creatanine level peaked at 3.9 , but is down to 3.4 - my nephrologist ( who is awesome ) , says that is a very encouraging sign .
So I rest , and I rest , and I rest .
The really good news is that - at least based on blood markers - the tumors are being very chivalrous and not taking advantage of this opportunity to run wild , before I 'm strong enough to fight back .
My CA19 - 9 was 103 last Friday , which is only up a tiny bit from my last round of chemo .
March 13 , 2008 : Out of Hospital , on to Congress ....
I was discharged from the hospital on Monday afternoon .
Great thanks to my personal angel , MR Kelsey , who came down from Pittsburgh to be with me .
MR , you are awesome .
I 'm feeling MUCH better since the tap ( they pulled out 1.4 liters of fluid from my right lung ) .
There 's a similar amount of fluid in my left lung , but we 'll try to suck that out with diuretics , rather than do another tap , which has small , but real , risks .
After consulting with my doctors , I got permission to travel today to Washington , DC , to testify before congress about the need for more funding for pancreatic cancer research .
I think it went pretty well ; the staffers tell me that when the congresspeople put down their blackberries and listen , it 's a very good sign , and that certainly happened .
Oh , and in the " never a dull moment " category , we had a pretty serious car accident on the drive up , but everybody was okay .
How ironic it would have been to go that way !
Great thanks to Julie Fleshman and everybody else at PanCAN ( www.pancan.org) who did all the work to make my testimony possible .
Great thanks also to Jack Sheriff , my long - term best friend , who was able to come and provide support ; I 'm still a little wobbly from the heart / kidney issues , but with everybody 's help , I got through it , and I 'm hoping to continue to heal up over the next few weeks .
March 8 , 2008 : Hospitalized
On Thursday Jai & I met with nephrologist ( kidney doctor ) Thomas Whelan , who is terrific .
Based on lab work and my symptoms , he recommended that we use a combination of diuretics and a " tap " to get rid of the fluid around my lugs .
Both for reasons of speed and safety , he recommended I get admitted to the hospital and do this in - patient , so I went into the hospital Thursday night .
Although we 're still sleuthing down exactly what caused it , we believe that the chemo drugs ended up putting a huge strain on both my heart and kidneys .
That led to the buildup of fluid around my lungs .
Friday morning they did the " tap " : - inserting a needle in my back , between my ribs , and piercing the outer lung sac , but not the lung itself .
They then siphoned off more than a quart of fluid , which lab tests showed was unremarkable .
Within an hour , my breathing was feeling normal ( instead of the labored , shallow breathing I 'd been doing ) .
Most importantly , I could lay flat and really sleep for the first time in 2 weeks .
It felt incredibly good .
My left lung also has about a quart of fluid , but we 'll get that out with diuretics rather than do another needle stick .
It 's a pretty safe procedure , but if it can be avoided , they prefer less invasive approaches .
They are tweaking the high blood pressure medicines and the diuretics , in order to find a good combination .
The doctors are fairly confident there is n't any long - term damage to my heart .
That 's less clear with my kidneys , but I can live okay with them in their current state .
The big problem was when both the heart and kidneys were getting hammered , which let to the fluid build - up .
I 'll probably leave the hospital tomorrow ( Sunday ) , or Monday .
It will take about a week to get me really robust again , but I already feel SO much better now that they 've tapped the fluid .
The fluid tap , by the way , works almost identically to a beer keg , in terms of the physics !
The short term crisis is under control .
The longer term strategy of how to continue treatment of the cancer , given my new constraints , is something I 'll have to figure out this week .
March 5 , 2008 : Good News and Bad News
The good news is that the tumors appear to still be basically held in check .
The bad news is that the side effects of the chemo drugs have become too toxic .
My kidneys are now performing at well under 50 % efficiency ( Creatanine is 3.4 , and BUN is 54 , for those of you scoring the game at home ) .
My blood pressure has soared up to 200 over 100 . .
I may technically have " high output congestive heart failure , " but that 's not nearly as bad as it sounds .
The painful part is that we think my abdominal cavity has started to fill with fluid , a side effect of the kidney inefficiency and high blood pressure . .
That particularly stinks because the fluid pushes on lungs and heart .
I can't sleep ( or breathe clearly ) while lying down ; I have to sit up and try to sleep that way .
And I get totally out of breath after a flight of stairs .
So we 're doing a bunch of things to address these issues :
- we 're stopping all chemo
- I 'm now on high blood pressure medication
- I 'm taking a diuretic that is supposed to get my body to empty itself of fluids , so that my body ( in theory ) starts to absorb back the fluid in my cavity and start to urinate it out over time .
- I 'm seeing a nephrologist ( kidney specialist ) tomorrow .
- Yesterday I got a blood transfusion , which greatly helped my low red blood cell count and is giving me more energy .
This is a setback , but hopefully a small one .
However , if the damage the chemo drugs did to my kidneys is permanent , that would be really , really bad .
More news as it develops .
March 1 , 2008 : The Median is n't the Message Stephen Jay Gould wrote a brilliant essay I think most cancer patients would benefit from .
It 's only a few pages , and it 's here .
Feb 15 : Six months later .... and still alive & healthy Today is a pretty important day .
It was August 15th , 2007 , when I was told I likely had " three to six months of good health left . "
Today is six months from that day .
Just to prove I 'm still alive , here I am , holding today 's New York Times !
I rode my bike today ; the cumulative effects of the chemotherapy are hurting my stamina some , but I bet I can still run a quarter mile faster than most Americans .
The doctors were n't wrong ; they always said that if the palliative chemo worked , I 'd buy more time , but that it was a long shot .
And the doctors have done a brilliant job of tweaking my regimen to help my odds .
How much longer this will work is hard to know , but I 'm going to keep having fun every day I have left , no matter how many or how few of them I get .
Feb 11 : The Elephant in the Room At " The Last Lecture , " I brought out a bunch of stuffed animals and said anyone in the audience who wanted one should grab one after the talk .
I do n't know where the others ended up , but a very brave Carnegie Mellon senior named Robin Luo grabbed the stuffed elephant ; she sent me this photo recently .
Robin has been battling cancer herself ; and during my tough times in Houston , we exchanged frequent emails .
She 's doing great , and has become quite the advocate , as well : check out the relay for life to see how you can help .
It is somehow quite fitting that a compatriot with cancer got " the elephant in the room . "
Feb 9 : Tumors start growing , but we fight back My CT scan in the first week of January showed the beginning of " creeping growth " of the tumors in my liver .
This indicated that my palliative chemo had begun to fail .
A huge bummer .
Our counter - measure was to add the drug Avastin ( making my regimen Gemcitabine + Tarceva + Avastin ) .
this was a long shot , but since Avastin does n't have bad side effects , we figured we'd try that first .
And it worked !
My February 5 scans showed no growth ( and maybe even a little shrinkage ) in the preceding month .
I and my docs were all giddy that the long shot worked .
The obvious question : how long will it work ?
Nobody knows , but I 'll ride it until it stops working ; with luck I can buy another few months .
Meanwhile , I 've identified the " next steps " I 'll take after that , all of which are more toxic in terms of side effects .
So I 'm ready and loaded for bear when the time comes .
The only downsides are 1 ) my kidney function seem to be weakening ; not dangerous yet , but moving in a bad direction .
It 's possible the Avastin is the culprit , but it may be a combination of Avastin , gemcitabine , and the IV contrast in all the monthly CT scans ( most people are only scanned every two months ) .
So we 'll be watching my kidneys carefully .
2 ) My last chemo produced a 3 day fever , spiking at 103 , plus some nausea .
These are small prices to pay ... any day you have tumors in your liver and they do n't get bigger is a good day !
Pancreatic Cancer Action Network Advocacy Day March 10th and 11th , the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network will be having advocacy days in Washington , DC .
I plan to be there .
Perhaps I can lead a cheer or two at the rally .... how about : two ...four...six... eight .... with pancreatic cancer you emaciate !
Feb 1 : How am I Feeling ?
This is the question I 'm most commonly asked ..
The short version is : the tumors are still to small to be felt , or to have any effect on my health .
So what I 'm feeling is due to the chemotherapy .
Some days I 'm tired , and some days I have flu - like symptoms ( chills , muscle and joint aches ) .
And my GI tract is still somewhat of a mess ; I eat 4,000 calories a day , just to maintain weight .
I occasionally have mild nausea , but it 's rare and really mild .
In the last month , the new side effect is neuropathy : numbness in the fingers and toes .
It 's been getting worse ; I can still touch - type , but I make tons more mistakes .
And it 's getting hard to find things in my pockets , since I 'm losing the sense of touch ; I can mostly just feel pressure .
All in all , a small price to pay for walking around !
Jan 28 : Trip to Orlando !!
Jai &
I just took a long weekend in Orlando with Dylan and Logan ( Chloe 's really too young , so she stayed here with Jai's relatives ) .
Highlights of the trip : - Logan asking to see " Shampoo , the Killer Whale " - Logan jumping a barricade and sprinting into a parade , and being " taken down " by two security guards while Jai madly gave chase .
- Meeting Mickey . - Winning stuffed animals .
I bagged a snake , and Dylan and Logan won their first " all by myself " animals !
( Turns out they 're naturals at the squirt guns ) .
- Riding in the nose cone of the monorail ; the driver even gave Dylan and Logan co-pilot 's licenses !
Jan 23 : Lobbying Congress
The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network launched a major initiative called Raise the Cure , attempting to get Congress to allocate more research funding for pancreatic cancer .
I spent the day on the hill , meeting with senators and members of the house ( " Hi , I 'm Randy , and I 'll be your ' Michael J. Fox ' for the day ... " )
Here we are with Steny H. Hoyer , the House majority leader .
Next to me is PanCAN ’s Megan Gordon Don , director of government affairs , and farthest from me is Julie Fleshman , PanCAN 's president and CEO .
Jan15 : The Book is Done !
Kudos to Jeff Zaslow , the world 's fastest writer .
I am proud to say that the book " The Last Lecture " is now done !
I 'm even prouder to say that we accomplished this with the major constraint that it take little or no time away from family ( see " How to Write a Book on an Bike , " below ) .
Jeff and I are very proud of how it has turned out .
It 's 61 chapters in 206 pages .
There are 18 photographs , 1 bar chart , and ( for all my mathematical friends ) , one equation .
I am particularly proud that I negotiated to get the words " Carnegie Mellon " on the front cover !
( click on image to see it larger ) .
Hyperion is publishing the book in early April ; details at www.TheLastLecture.com
Kai -Fu Lee Sends me Greetings from Chinese Students fromchinatorandy
Kau -Fu
Lee sent me the following ; if you download and run this .exe , it 's a sweet animation from a bunch of chinese students thanking me for the lecture .
It 's a small world , after all .
Jim Valvano at the 1993 ESPYs Several people were kind enough to point me to this very inspirational piece by Jim Valvano , who - like me - did it knowing he was a terminal cancer patient .
I personally love the moment where they try to tell him he only has 30 seconds left !

Dec 31 : Dylan turns six
For most people , Dec 31 is New Year 's Eve .
In our family , it 's Dylan 's birthday .
Today was a great one ; Dylan spent the morning at the aquarium seeing all sorts of animals , then spent the afternoon with Daddy and his cousin Hannah , watching a movie .
Then , we all got together at Red Robin for dinner , including balloons .
Dylan &
I went to one of those photobooths where they take your picture and then process it to look like a human did it in pastels .
The best part is there 's a video where they make it look like a human is really drawing it - every so often , he says " oops ! " and erases a part and redoes it - Dylan thought that was hysterical !
Here 's the final product
Dec 25 : Christmas at the Pausch Houseold Christmas is a wonderful holiday .
It 's even more wonderful when you were n't sure you would be around for it .
Dec 23 : How long will the palliative chemo work ?
A natural question is " how long will the palliative chemo ( gemcitabine + tarceva ) continue to work , holding my tumors basically stable in size ? "
There is some data on the roughly 10 - 15 % of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients where gemcitabine works for them .
I talked with my oncologists , and read some journal articles .
There 's no single answer ( it 's obviously a bell shaped curve ) , but the best guess , based on available data , is that my tumors will " hold " for another 2 - 4 months from today .
That 's really cool .
Jai and I call this " bonus time . "
In terms of medical treatment , the general consensus seems to be " keep doing what 's working . "
Once it stops working , there are a number of things to try , but they 're all even longer shots than the thing we tried first , which only works for 10 - 15 % of patients .
Dec 10 : How to Write a Book on a Bike Jai wanted me to write a book , but that begged the question of how to do that without taking time from being with the family .
The solution ?
Jeff Zaslow is actually doing the heavy lifting of creating the prose ( and dang , is he a good writer ) , but the deal is that he and I talk one hour each day , while I 'm exercising on my bike .
That way , I can get all my stories and anecdotes to a real writer ( I stink at writing , anyway ) , without taking any time from family .
Dec 7 : Palliative Chemo Continues to Work !
The palliative chemotherapy ( gemcitabine + tarceva ) is still working .
My december 7th CT scan was basically a photocopy of my Nov 8th scan ; the tumors have not grown at all .
My CA19 - 9 ( for those of you " scoring the game at home " dropped from 208 on Aug 14th to 59 on Nov 2 , and then 64 on Nov 26th .
This is all really good news .
My local oncologist , Dr. Michael Lee ( who is spectacular , and is himself a cancer survivor ) , tells me that my response , on a scale of 1 - to - 10 , is a 10 .
I need to be clear : this is not a cure , and it wo n't work for long .
" Winning " right now means buys extra months , not years .
But I 'm thrilled to have this " bonus time " !!!
And I will be in good health for Christmas .
I will probably be adding Avastin to my cocktail soon ..
It 's been a wonder drug for lots of metastatic cancers , but the large trials do n't really indicate it makes much of a difference for pancreatic .
However , several doctors have anecdotal stories of a single " fluke " patient who lives 12 or 18 months on it , so I 'm inclined to try to be that fluke patient .
I suffer small side effects from the chemo : I have 1 - 2 days / week ( surprisingly , it starts about 48 hours after the IV ) where I feel mild nausea and some substantial fatigue .
We switched my " chemo day " from Fridays to Mondays so that my weakest day occurs during the week , when we have Rachael to help Jai out with the kids .
Sometimes , I can't feel my fingers or toes , and I 've had some infrequent , but very painful intestinal cramping , but all - in - all , " a very small price to pay for walkin ' around , " as we in the cancer business say .
My red blood cell counts are a little down , but I can ride a bike an hour each day , and I can fully play with the kids and enjoy my life .
Meanwhile , I 'm frantically examining " plan B " treatments when the gemcitabine + tarceva stops working .
Frankly , there are n't any silver bullets out there , but I 'll give it my best shot .
Leading candidates are some vaccine trials about to open up at Johns Hopkins , and TGEN ( www.tgen.org), which does some customized therapies .
I have about 30 other things I 'm investigating , but those are the current leaders .
Dec 1 : Scuba diving !
I 'm definitely in the running for " healthiest dying man in America . "
This photo was taken at 105 feet off the Cayman islands on Dec 1st .
When I asked my oncologist if I could go scuba diving , he thought for a while and said , " Medically , I can't think of any reason you can 't .... but I have to admit , it 's not a question that comes up very often for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients ! "
Kudos to my dive buddies , Steve , Jack , and Scott , who kept very careful watch over me in the water .
Star Trek !!!
This is , by far , the coolest thing ( okay , # 2 behind the palliative chemo working ) .
JJ Abrams ( Hollywood producer / director who did the TV series " Lost , " the movie " Mission Impossible III " and a bunch of other stuff ) emailed me , out of the blue : JJ Abrams wrote :

> JJ Naturally , I presumed this was one of my friends , playing a prank .
But after a little sleuthing , it was clear it was for real .
Jai & I hopped a plane to LA , where I got a custom - made Star Trek uniform and my own station on the bridge , where I had lots of buttons and controls .
I even got a LINE !!!!
In addition to publicly thanking JJ Abrams , I just wanted to say what an incredibly egoless and cool guy he was .
We chatted a little bit between takes , and he is so tech - savvy ( and I 'm not saying that * just * because he knew all about Alice ! ) .
Anyway , it was a truly magical experience .
Speaking of Magic , I got to fulfill a long - standing wish of taking Jai to the Magic Castle on that trip , courtesy of Peter Farquar .
MK
Haley , who is herself quite magical , joined Peter and his wife and Jai & me for an incredible evening .
the " Star Trek " movie will be in theaters December 2008 .
Do n't blink or you 'll miss me , but at some point a guy walked across the bridge and says " Captain , we have visual ! "
I 'd * love * to show you my costume ( which they let me keep ) , but I promised JJ Abrams " no photos " .
They 're trying to keep things a secret ; in fact , even on the Paramount lot , you have to walk around in a trenchcoat if you 're in a Star Trek costume .
It 's kind of like being at a flasher 's convention !
Oh , and if you think I 'm making this up , here 's a copy of my check from Paramount ( they had to pay me due to some union rules or some such ... I 'll obviously be donating this to charity ) .
Nov 29 : Settling into our New Lives
As you all know , we moved to Virginia immediately upon my terminal diagnosis ; the goal being to have our family settled as soon as possible .
That strategy has been really validated .
Life here is logistically much easier ( warmer weather , living on a a cul - de- sac in suburbia ) .
We miss everyone back in Pittsburgh , but our new neighbors have welcomed us warmly and the kids are thriving , which was always our main concern .
Being so close to Jai's family is the huge win we knew it would be .
Dylan is loving kindergarten and taking Karate classes .
Logan is potty trained ( the pure pride when he says " I used the Potty all by myself ! " is pure Norman Rockwell ) .
Chloe says about 100 words , most of which melt my heart .
Unfortunately , she recently learned " no no no no no , " which she treats as one word .
Jai is redecorating ( i.e. " nesting " ) in our new home .
We have a wonderful nanny Rachel , and Laura from Pittsburgh comes down to help out , which has made it possible for us to travel occasionally .
We are starting to look into our options regarding Hospice care when the time comes , but Jai & I are very pleased with having gotten the kids into their new routine and so settled in advance of the coming storm .
Nov 28 : Leveraging Fame for Good Jai &
I have been trying to see how we can use my D - list celebrity ( apologies to Kathy Griffin ) for good .
I 'm working with both the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network ( PanCAN ) and the Lustgarten Foundation , doing things like videotaping public service announcements and meeting with lawmakers up in Washington , DC .
One reason pancreatic cancer is such an " orphan " disease is that we do n't have many long - term survivors to lead marches on Washington .
So I 'm trying to sort of become the " Michael J. Fox of pancreatic cancer . "
Nov 27 , Time Management Lecture for Posterity
The lecture I thought I would be famous for at the end of my career was the talk I give occasionally on " Time Management . "
I was able to travel to the University of Virginia and give it today .
Great thanks to Gabe Robins for his herculean efforts .
I spoke in Old Cabell Hall , which is an amazing theater ; 180 degree spread and very vertical ; it seats 850 and you feel like you can touch any of them at arm 's length .
It was important for me to give this lecture and have it properly videotaped : now that we 've seen how effective Google Video is at allowing a talk to be widely viewed , I 'd like for the information in this talk to be freely available for anyone who might benefit .
Plus , it was great to see my old colleagues , and my family was able to converge and we all got together , so it was just a great day .
The talk is available here .
Nov 27 : " The Last Lecture " as a book When Jeff Zaslow 's column appeared in the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) , about a dozen publishers emailed me , asked if I would be willing to write a book based on it .
( I found this laughable , since at the time the palliative chemo was not yet working , and I thought I was down to about 6 weeks of good health ) .
When the palliative chemo started working and we had some breathing room , I mentioned this to Jai , and she told me she wanted to do it .
She was , in fact , quite emphatic .
We had always talked about my " writing the manual " for her and the kids in my remaining time , and Jai felt that if it were a " real " project , I might take it much more seriously .
Jeff Zaslow from the WSJ , who is a terrific writer , was willing to be my partner and do the heavy lifting , so the deal we struck is that we would do the book together as partners , but he would write it ( my colleagues from the Alice team are smiling , as they 're familiar with this model of my " authoring " a book ) .
The wonderful part is that this takes almost no time from the family : each day , I ride my bike for an hour and talk with Jeff on the cellphone .
The process has already been wonderful ; he 's great at dragging stuff out of me I would never have dredged by myself .
I 've grown a little disappointed with the news media : there were early reports that Jeff was somehow " cashing in " on my story , which is simply not true .
Neither he nor I were " cashing in , " for that matter ( the book getting a large advance - on - royalties took us both by surprise ) - but I thought it was particularly unfair that some early stories made it look like he was somehow doing this by himself .
I am thrilled that Hyperion , the publishing arm of Disney , will be publishing the book .
Somehow that just feel right , and they 've been great to work with , in terms of being very respectful of my circumstances .
Here 's the press release about the book .
Nov 21 Lions and Tigers and Awards , Oh , My !
In the last month , I 've received a number of professional awards .
I would be disingenuous if I did n't admit that I do n't feel these are really deserved ; after all , there 's the " give the dying guy an award " factor .
However , they all reflect favorably on Carnegie Mellon and I accept them all gratefully .
As they say , " Dying is a good career move . " :-)
Specifically , ACM SIGCSE Outstanding Educator Award : this is wonderful because it comes with a keynote address where I can talk about Alice at the annual conference .
It 's March 12 .
Through the wonders of videotape , I 'll give that talk " Dead or Alive " ;-) ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award : this was very touching because it was Andy van Dam who called to tell me .
ACM Fellow : I 'm not sure I deserved this , but I 'm very honored by it .
CHI Academy .
Like the ACM Fellow , playing a little over my head , but I 'm very honored .
Alice Merit Badge Alice Merit badge for Girl Scouts , made by a single troupe more as a lark than anything else .
But dang , this really made my day !
Nov 19 : Randy Pausch Day in Pittsburgh !
November 19th was declared " Randy Pausch Day " by the city of Pittsburgh .
Randy Bryant was kind enough to accept the award in person , and they phoned me and said nice things about how I had shown the world how great Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh are .
What Does this Vulture know ?
On the way to the Police concert , we stopped in Williamsburg .
Jai thought it was hysterical that a turkey vulture followed me around for several hours during a walk .
He 's in the tree in the lower picture .
Nov 6 , 2007 : Meeting " The Police " Jai & I took our first kidless vacation in a long time .
We went on a three day , three night adventure to Williamsburg and Charlottesville .
At UVa , we saw " The Police " perform .
The concert is truly terrific .
Jai is a huge Police fan , so imagine her surprise when we were whisked backstage to get to meet the band !
Great thanks to Gabe Robins and others at UVa who made this possible .
Oct 31 , 2007 : Happy Halloween !!
What an " Incredible " family we are !!
Medical update :
Things are going well .
I get chemotherapy once a week , and it has some side effects but has not been dramatically affecting my super powers .
Oct 19 , 2007 : Palliative Chemo is WORKING !!!!
On Oct 1st , I had a CT - scan , and a follow - up PET - CT scan on Oct 13th .
Both confirmed that we are willing :
The tumors in my spleen are now gone , and the dozen or so tumors in my liver are all either stable or slightly smaller .
This happens in something like 15 % of the cases of people who get gemcitabine + tarceva .
It 's a lottery , and I 'm a winner .
Statistically , this means I probably just bought an extra 2 - 4 months of good health .
Said another way , I may have just doubled my life expectancy - you try to do that !
Most importantly , that buys me time to pursue " plan B " - the gemcitabine + tarceva will not last forever , and we want to have the next thing cued up and ready to go .
I am currently looking into other chemotherapies , some vaccination approaches ( including a custom vaccine that would be made from my own cancer cells ) , and some super - secret stuff I 'm not at liberty to talk about .
But it is safe to say that I am thrilled with the quality of medical care I 'm receiving and that I feel like I 'm getting the cutting edge stuff that my species can provide for me .
Having said that , " winning " means buying time ; I will always hold out hope that a miracle cure is developed that would give me a normal life span , but right now we 're fighting to stay alive a few more months at a time . ,
My quality of life is very good : I ride my bike an hour a day , play as much as I want with my kids , and enjoy being married to the most wonderful woman in the world .
I have intermittent gut pain , some fatigue , and some mild " flu like symptoms " each week , approximately 24 - 72 hours after the chemo , but it 's manageable .
Small price to pay for walking around .
Sept 4 , 2007 : Dolphin Swim with Dylan I 'm sorry it took me so long to post this : I 've obviously been a little busy .
Shortly after my terminal diagnosis , I knew that one of my biggest priorities was to create memories for my children .
Chloe and Logan are both so young that it 's likely they 'll have no direct memories of me .
Dylan is the oldest , and at 5 ( turns 6 in December ) , his memories are likely to be fuzzy .
Hence the engineering question :
What would make for the sharpest , most visceral memory , esp. for a kid who loves animals ?
Answer : go for a Dolphin Swim ! '
Dylan and I spent a glorious 4 day , 3 night " Daddy and Dylan " vacation in Orlando , where we visited the Magic Kingdom and swam with Dolphins at Discovery Cove ( both places were absolutely incredible to us , providing admission , special opportunities , and most importantly , photographers to help provide images that will reinforce the memories .
I have an incredible number of photos , but here are a few that I hope Dylan will cherish after I 'm gone ....
August 31 , 2007 : Palliative Chemo begins Yesterday I got my first round of Gemcitabine .
We 'll add Tarceva next week .
In the first 36 hours , I 've experienced zero side effects ( yeah ! ) .
And tomorrow Dylan & I are taking a 3 day " Dylan and Daddy trip " to Florida to do a dolphin swim and see Mickey Mouse !
Aug 26th , 2007 : " It was the best of times , it was the worst of times . "
The best of times , in that about three weeks ago , my health really , really came back .
I 've been lifting weights 3 times a week , and I ride my bicycle an hour each morning , at about the same pace I did before the cancer struck .
I once again bounce while walking down the hallway , and as you can see , I can lift and play with all three kids with vigor .
( these pictures taken yesterday ) .
It is also the worst of times ; a recent CT scan showed that there are 10 tumors in my liver , and my spleen is also peppered with small tumors .
The doctors say that it is one of the most aggressive recurrences they have ever seen .
The doctors are quick to point out they 're very bad at predicting " how much time , " but the consensus seems to be that I have 3 - 6 months of relatively good health .
After that , it 's hard to say how rapid a decline , and it's not a particularly pretty way to go .
As we have known from the beginning , there is no effective treatment at this point ; I 'll go on palliative chemo to try to buy time ; that works for 15 % - 20 % of the cases , but only buys another few months .
We have confirmed the CT scan diagnosis via blood markers and a needle biopsy ; the diagnosis is undeniable .
So What Happens Now ?
My wife , Jai , and I have had a long time to consider this possibility , and we believe it will be best for my wife and our children to be near family in Virginia , just south of Norfolk .
Our plan is to head down over Labor Day weekend , so Dylan can start Kindergarten there Sept 4th .
We can't close on a house that fast , but we will rent a beach house nearby as interim housing .
This is obviously not how I wanted things to turn out , but my wife and I have no regrets ; we did everything I could to maximize my odds .
And we want to thank everyone who has so graciously helped us .
The really weird part of all this is that I 'm not depressed .
I 'm not in denial ( I assure you , I am fully aware of what is going to happen ) , nor am I whistling in the dark , but after having felt crappy and sick for 11 months , to finally be fully healthy again is so exhilarating that it's a wonderful emotional buoy .
So I am going to enjoy each day very fully , and play hard with my kids until I can't .
I apologize to those of you I was n't able to share this news with in person .
Since many people have asked me the same questions , I have taken the liberty of answering them straightforwardly here :
What will happen to the Entertainment Technology Center ( etc.cmu.edu ) ?
I actually stepped down from the ETC in January of 2006 , and Don Marinelli has been solely in charge since then , so there 's absolutely no impact there .
What will happen to the Alice project ( www.alice.org)?
I have been the public face of the project for a long time , but the truth is that it had already grown to be a collaboration between several universities , with four or five main PIs .
The Alice team is fully committed to the project , and to releasing Alice v3.0 ( including teaching with Java and using the Sims characters ) in 2008 .
I have met with Peter Lee , Dan Siewiorek , Randy Bryant , and Jared Cohon , all of whom have expressed how committed Carnegie Mellon is to ensuring the Alice project continues smoothly .
Are you leaving Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon for good ?
Absolutely not .
We are relocating the family quickly so we can start Dylan on the first day of Kindergarten , but I will be making trips back to Carnegie Mellon , and I am on email and reachable by phone .
In fact , I 'm scheduled to give a talk at Carnegie Mellon on Sept 18th .
What should we not do ?
The experts have counseled us that we should not yet tell our children , so please keep that in mind if you see us in person , leave messages on our answering machine , etc .
I want to close by once again thanking everyone at Carnegie Mellon , our church , and our friends and family , who have been so wonderful to us .
We are very grateful , and we are sorry this story does n't have a happier ending .
July 23 , 2007 : Done with Johns Hopkins Vaccine On Monday , I got the last dose of the vaccine at Johns Hopkins .
Just like the previous two inoculations , I got six injections ( two per thigh and two on my left arm ) , and they have swelled up like massive bee stings ( 8 inch wide welts ) .
But no real pain ; just a little itching .
I 'll go back in every six months for a booster shot , but that 's a long ways off .
Interestingly , this marks the last thing I can do to help myself , which is a little unnerving .
I 'm channeling that anxiety into starting to hit the gym with real vigor - building my body up in case there are more surgeries or chemo down the road ....
July 9 , 2007 : The Folks who are keeping me alive I thought you might like to see some photos of the folks who are working overtime to keep me alive .
Here is my surgeon , Dr. Herb Zeh .
He has performed hundreds of Whipple surgeries , and based on my experience , really knows what he 's doing .
Just as important , he gave me his email and cellphone info , and said to call him anytime , which he 's honored .
In addition to surgery , he conducts research on vaccine - based approaches , which could really make a difference : to support that research , please contact Kambra McConnel in the Development Department for the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute at ( 412 ) 623-4700 or email her at mcconnelk@upmc.edu .
Donations also may be made payable to “ UPCI / Pancreatic Cancer Research / Liver Pancreas Institute ” ( in the “ memo ” section of the check , if applicable , please note that your gift is given in my honor and for support of Dr. Zeh ’s research ) and mailed to : Development Dept. , UPMC Cancer Pavilion , Suite 1B , 5150 Centre Avenue , Pittsburgh PA 15232 .
July 9 , 2007 : The Folks who are keeping me alive , part II This is Dr. Robert Wolff , my primary oncologist and the person I met with regularly at MD Anderson .
He also responds to email , and has the wonderful property that he does n't sugar - coat anything .
His medical experience mitigating side - effects and helping provide emotional perspective on the whole experience were invaluable .
( My five year old was very curious " Why Dr. Wolff was n't an animal doctor . :-)
June 28 , 2007 : Second Round of Johns Hopkins vaccine Yesterday I received the second round of the Johns Hopkins vaccine .
No drama , no pain ; just six needle sticks that are slowly growing into 8 - inch across painless welts on my arms and legs - kinda cool , actually .
Does n't hurt a bit .
June 6 , 2007 : Enough emotional roller coasters ; how ' bout real ones !
After all the recent emotional roller coaster rides , we decided it was time for some real ones , so off we went to Kennywood , Pittsburgh 's classic roller coaster park .
Today was special because it was the first roller coaster ride for our middle child , Logan ( 2 1/2 years old ) .
Of course , you can't really see his face in this picture , as he's ( naturally ) got his hands in the air .
A more complete set of photos of our day is here .
One of my quirkier hobbies is winning stuffed animals at amusement parks , and it was comforting to see the cancer has n't diminished my skills too much .
In answer to your next two questions : 1 ) By tossing a softball into a milk can 2 ) It took four tries , at $ 2 a try .
June 1 , 2007 : It 's a Cyst !
And I get the vaccine ...
Yesterday 's MRI confirmed that what they had seen on the CT scan ( see : Dodging Bullets , below ) was definitely a cyst .
( The MRI also showed that the other small lesion was highly unlikely to be cancerous ) .
Whew !!
I got the vaccine yesterday : six injections ( two per leg , and two on my left arm ) , and a small carving of flesh for a biopsy on my right arm , big enough to require two stitches ..
No significant pain or side effects .
I go back once a day for 4 days for them to draw blood to measure how the vaccine is being absorbed .
My Mom lives near Johns Hopkins and our entire family is visiting this weekend .
The Johns Hopkins folks have been amazingly accommodating .
Barbara Biedrzycki , the researcher , is coming into work on Sunday so I do n't have to stay all next week .
I have met so many wonderful people on this journey .
May 30 , 2007 : Dodging Bullets Yesterday I went to qualify for the Johns Hopkins Vaccine .
I knew this involved another CT scan , which is always a chance to get bad news .
Only this time I actually got bad news .
For details , click here .
( it 's a good story ) .
Fortunately , this ended up being yet another false positive .
These moments ( there were two in Houston ) , are probably even harder than the chemo and radiation .
As I said to my wife , Jai , I do n't know how many more bullets I can dodge ...
This delays my starting on the vaccine by a few days , but it also reminds me how much I value every day with my family .
May 25 , 2007 : I guess the stitches are holding ...
My lovely wife Jai and I just spent 48 hours , sans kids , celebrating our 7th wedding anniversary at Nemacolin , where they have a zip line .
I sent a copy of this photo to my surgeon , with the tagline " I guess the stiches are holding up okay " ...
May 22 , 2007 : Gained enough weight to wear my wedding ring again !
When this all began , I was 182 pounds .
At my low point , I was down to 139 , a 43 - pound loss .
One of the most depressing things about this was that I had to stop wearing my wedding ring , as it kept falling off and I was afraid I 'd lose it .
I 'm now back up to 168 ( and I really only want to get back to 175 , not 182 ) , and my wedding ring stays on again - yeah !
May 15 , 2007 : My life as a coin toss ...
To the best I can know , my odds of 5 - year survival are 45 % , so I often refer to myself as a " coin toss . "
A good friend of mine , Peter Farquar ( who is the only person I know who had a cooler Sabbatical than the one I did at Walt Disney Imagineering ) , is a magician .
He sent me the following , with a note that said " Remember to CALL HEADS ! "
Boy , did that make my day !
Press the Green Play Button to see the video ...
May 6 , 2007 : Playing Flag Football !?!?!
Six days after being unhooked from the chemo , I was back on the field with my rec-league flag football team .
First play of the game , I caught a 25 - year pass over the middle .
Granted , I was sucking wind the whole game , but damn it 's good to be back on the field .
May 4 , 2007 : DONE WITH TREATMENT !!!!
On Monday , I completed my chemotherapy !
They removed my PICC line , and it feels so good to have it gone !
My family had a great celebration for me : here are the boys with the balloons .
Chloe celebrated by taking some of her first steps !
I have started exercising again , starting with bike riding .
I have no stamina , but that will come back with time .
My last CT scan was clear , and my CA19 - 9 is 19 , well within the normal range .
Meaning that - for now - there 's no detectable sign of cancer in my body .
I am still a looooong way from winning the battle , but every day I do n't lose is a day closer to achieving long - term victory .
I 'm still somewhat weakened by the six months of chemo , but by June 1 , I should be back to full health .
I have already regained 18 of the 43 pounds I had lost .
My long - term odds remain 45 % , but I am highly optimistic that I am going to win the coin toss .
One more Rabbit out of the Hat ... April 18 , 2007 ...
The Johns Hopkins Vaccine ...
When I first looked into my treatment options last September , there were two clear possible choices : the Virginia Mason protocol , and a vaccine developed by Johns Hopkins .
I went with Virginia Mason because they were producing better results , and had done so on a larger number of people .
However , I have just learned that Johns Hopkins will allow me to receive the vaccine after doing the Virginia Mason protocol .
( sort of " have your cake , and eat it , too " ) .
Since the vaccine uses a different approach than the chemoradiation , there 's some reason to believe that doing both treatments will help my odds .
The vaccine also has no real side effects .
I am scheduled to start the vaccine treatment at Johns Hopkins on May 29th .
This is officially the last rabbit in the hat .
But it 's a good one .
There 's no way of knowing , but perhaps this will improve my 45 % survival odds by a few points , and at these stakes , every little bit matters ... ( thanks to Angela Love for this terrific artwork ! )
Virginia Mason Protocol gets Replicated !!!!!
When I had to pick a course of treatment after my surgery , the " standard of care " chemotherapy had a 15 % 5 - year survival rate ( or an 85 % death rate , if you prefer ... ) .
I gambled on the highly toxic " Virginia Mason protocol , " which was getting about 45 % of people to live to 5 years ... but those results were based on only 100 people , all at the Virginia Mason Hospital .
As a scientist , we do n't like climbing out on those kinds of limbs .
But in this case , as Janis Joplin sang , " Freedom 's just another word for nothing left to lose . "
So imagine how thrilled I was when I discovered that Washington University in St. Louis had replicated these results !
It 's a great comfort to know that I bet on the right horse ... as toxic as this treatment has been , it would have really been awful if I were to find out that it was n't really a better approach .
Now , it appears clear that it is .
April 25 2007 : limping across the finish line ...
Well , the mantra for this week is " chemo is cumulative . "
My energy level is down , and we also had our first - ever medical scare .
Oon Monday , I experienced sudden nausea , hot flash , and stabbing chest pains .
Fortunately , this happened at the doctor 's office and they quickly ruled out serious stuff like heart problems .
Near as we can tell , it was a nasty episode of heartburn ; it happened again Monday night , but nothing since then .
( Both times , antacids and rest made the pain quickly go away ) .
In retrospect , this was the first " Oh My God What Is Happening " sort of event that we'd had -- given the complexity of my surgery and the extent of the chemo , we 've been astoundingly lucky to not have had more episodes like this .
And it would be my luck to have it happen at the doctor 's , where we could quickly handle it !
The GOOD NEWS : Next Monday , April 30th , at 2:30 pm , I will be DONE with all treatment , and they will remove the PICC line I 've had in my arm for 6 months .
Then , it will take about a month for my body to restore itself to normal strength / energy / health .
I can't wait !!
-------------------
April 17 2007 : an email I wanted to share ...
Through all of this , I 've tried very hard to stay positive , but it 's very hard to know how one is really doing in situations like these .
I received the following email , which gave me hope that - at least during the moment described - I am managing to enjoy life through all this ...
... I happened to have been behind you for a few blocks as you were driving from campus last night ( Monday ) .
Before I recognized it was you , I found myself thinking , " Gee that guy is really enjoying the moment ..... driving down the road on a warm , early spring evening , top down , wind blowing through his hair , with a smile on his face ..... probably headed home to a wife and maybe a little one or two ...... that 's the way to live life . " .
And then you turned left and I recognized it was you .
I then found myself thinking , " It 's Randy !
He looks so happy !
And , in this most private of public moments ( alone in his car , yet on the road for anyone to observe ) , I can't imagine anyone who IS living life more .
No one is more deserving ! " .
Thanks for sharing your happiness / your life so fully with so many of us ....... on campus and in your car .
You can never know how that glimpse of you tonight made my day , reminding me of what life really is all about ...
April 16 2007 : another fine meeting with oncologist
Only 2 weeks to go and then I 'm done - everything is going smoothly .
-------------------
March 30 , 2007 : fine meeting with oncologist
More good news ... all blood work fine , and my doc and I feel that we 're just " running out the clock " on getting the last month of the chemotherapy done .
Most importantly , he has cleared me for flag football , water parks , and scuba diving once I 'm done with the chemotherapy ( apparently , these are n't questions he often gets from his patients ! )
-------------------
March 26 , 2007 : all systems still " go "
A week ago , I started the last 6 weeks of 5 - FU chemo .
I had blood work done today , and my WBC ( white blood cell count , which indicates ability to fight off infection ) , hemoglobin ( basically , the blood 's ability to deliver oxygen ) , and magnesium levels were all acceptable .
Most importantly , I 've been gaining a little weight , and I 'm up to 148 pounds .
The doctor gave me megestrol , an appetite stimulant , which seems to be working .
Although it 's very strange to each like a pig all day and still barely gain weight , which is due to the fact that my body does n't process food very efficiently right now .
That will improve when I 'm done with the chemo .
-------------------
March 17 , 2007 : A note on staying positive
Many things have helped keep me going throughout this process , mostly knowing how many people have been rooting for me .
When I was first diagnosed , I was told that the overall odds for surviving for 5 years were only 3 % .
My immediate reaction was : " I do n't believe in the no-win scenario . "
( Star Trek fans will recognize this quote from the second movie , Wrath of Kahn .
In the film , Star Fleet cadets are faced with a simulated training scenario called the Kobayashi Maru where - no matter what they do - their entire crew is killed .
When Kirk was a cadet at the academy , he reprogramming the simulation , because " he did n't believe in the no-win scenario . "
So imagine how uplifting it was when I received the following while at MD Anderson , just as things were getting rough : if you can't read the handwriting , it says " To Randy -- I do n't believe in the no-win scenario -- My best , Bill Shatner "
Bill had actually visited our lab a number of year ago , while doing research on I'm Working on That a book he and Chip Walter wrote regarding what science fiction from Star Trek had actually come to pass .
He visited our lab and experienced a bunch of Virtual Reality .
-------------------
March 13 , 2007 : Clean CT Scan !
My wife Jai & I just returned from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston where a CT scan showed no sign of cancer recurrence yet .
There was also no elevation of CA 19 - 9 in my bloodwork .
In other words , a clean bill of health .
This hardly means I 've " won , " but it means I certainly have n't lost yet !
My 5 - year survival odds are still 45 % , but this means we 're still " on the path " to winning .
The tough part about these scans , of course , is that I need a " perfect record " - if the cancer re-appears , it 's game over and I 'll die , probably within months .
So I will require some luck , but I done a lot of things at longer odds in my life than 45 % .
I have six more weeks of chemo ( 5 - FU ) here in Pittsburgh .
The drug fatigues me substantially ( I lie down several hours each day to rest ) , but I can " be me " for short bursts of time -- all I really lack is long - term stamina .
I routinely meet with people on campus , and I am doing a lot of work from home , and I read email throughout the day .
I even traveled to Cincinnati to give a presentation on the Alice system at the SIGCSE conference last week .
( Kudos to the Alice team , who are doing a fantastic job while I 'm operating at 1/2 speed ) .
Keeping up with the kids ( Dylan , Logan , and Chloe ) is exhausting , but I play with them 10 minutes at a time , and then go rest , then iterate .
The kids continue to hold up amazingly well , which is a testament to how hard my tremendous wife Jai has been working to keep things seeming normal through all this .
By June 1 ( about a month after the chemo ends ) , the doctors say I will regain my normal energy level .
Emotionally , the wonderful thing about this news is that it 's the first time we 've been able to point to a calendar and say " Randy will be back to his normal self , and we can plan activities for then . "
Even a small window of anticipated normalcy is a tremendous gift .
My next scan will be approximately 4 or 5 months from now ( normally , it 's every 3 , but the research study - for whatever reason - has a long gap at this point between scans -- personally , I find that somewhat merciful ! ) .
Jai &
I have elected to not publicize the exact scan dates in advance , since that just increases the number of people who know to worry , which does n't seem productive .
We will post the results after each scan .
Thanks again to everyone who has been so supportive ; it has truly been inspiring how much people have been willing to do to help us .
It is a very happy day in the Pausch household !

update from Randy on March 1 :
Continued good news : I was disconnected from the 5 - FU today .
I get 2.5 weeks off , then another 6 weeks of 5 - FU then all treatments are done !
On Monday , my bloodwork was good : hemoglobin , white blood cell , and magnesium levels were all acceptable .
Fatigue is still making me move at 1/2 speed , and the GI problems ( mostly intestinal pain and diarrhea ) persist , but these are both well known side effects of 5 - FU , so we hope they 'll go away starting in May ( the 2.5 weeks break is probably not long enough to my body to " bounce back " in this regard ) .
Oh , and it appears our kids have pink - eye .
Fortunately , that 's not a big deal , even if I get it .
-----------------------------------------------------
February 19 , 2007 - Update
Today 's news is all good - both my white blood cell count and my hemoglobin count went * up * in the last week , so my body is working hard to repair itself , even while I 'm still undergoing the 5 - FU chemo .
In 9 days , I will be done with the first 5.5 week session of 5 - FU .
Then , I get 3 weeks off , with no fannypack or tube ( which means I can wrestle much more aggressively with the kids ! ) .
Fatigue goes up and down wildly on a day - by - day basis - last Friday I worked a full day , which felt really good , but spent much of the weekend resting horizontally .
Today I am strong enough that Jai & I will be going away for an overnight mini-vacation , so she can get a tiny break from having to take care of me and three kids .
And it 's sunny !!
----------------------------------
Update from Randy Pausch 2/9/2007
I 've been getting feedback from Cleah that people want more frequent updates , so I 'll try to provide Cleah with an update each week .
This week brings great news - both my overall energy level and GI tract have noticeably improved , which has been fantastic .
I am spending less and less time in bed resting , and more time sitting in a chair working from home , or even venturing outside the house for trips .
I am still nowhere near " normal , " but I am getting out of the house each day .
The whole family made a brief appearance at last night 's SCS event at UMPC SportsWorks .
Today , I was able to go out to breakfast with my wife Jai and eat a fairly normal meal , and not have intense gut pain afterward , which is new , and greatly appreciated .
So it appears that I am still healing up from Houston more than I am being broken down by the 5 - FU chemo I 'm currently on .
Pittsburgh has been bitterly cold , but uncharacteristically sunny the last week , and the sunshine has been most welcome !
Oh , and in a stunning example of " kick 'em while they 're down , " while I was in Houston , my domain registration for www.randypausch.com expired , and somebody in Slovakia grabbed it an held it for ransom .
Thanks to Gabe
Yu for his help in my getting it back .
Like all of us , I was saddened to hear the news of Ken Kennedy 's passing from pancreatic cancer ( http://tinyurl.com/yudcpn), and of Jim Gray 's presumed loss at sea ( http://tinyurl.com/2hshgw).
Jim Gray was on my thesis committee and was truly one of the most exceptional people I have ever met .
I , like all of us , are hoping against hope that he will still be found .
----------------------------------
Update from Randy on Jan 31 , 2007 :
It 's now been a month since I finished the Houston - based ( MD Anderson Cancer Center ) portion of the treatment .
The hardest part is over !
I want to thank * everyone * who has been so helpful , in so many ways , to me and my family : the encouragement and logistical support has made it possible to undertake this very challenging path , and we are very grateful .
Being home with the family has been wonderful , although my fatigue ( see below ) has been a challenging match with 3 pre-school aged kids and their energy levels !
Here 's a picture of the little rascals ...
Nine days ago I started the Pittsburgh - based chemotherapy that lasts until the end of April ( 5.5 weeks of a drug called Fluorouracil , or " 5FU " , 3 weeks off , then 5.5 weeks of it ) .
[ Nerd factoid : this is delivered as " continuous infusion , " via a pump I wear in a fannypack .
The pump was invented by Dean Kamen , who later invented the segway scooter ] .
This portion of the treatment is not nearly so bad ( in Houston , I had this drug , plus interferon , plus cisplatin , plus daily radiation ) .
In fact , I am still recovering more from the Houston experience than suffering from the chemo they are giving me now - the Houston chemo / radiation depleted my blood ( specifically , my hemoglobin and magnesium ) , so I 'm still very tired much of the time - I sleep 9 - 10 hours / night , and spend some portion of each day lying in bed .
My digestive track is still partially road - kill , but the pain from that is subsiding slowly .
Blessedly , the 24/7 nausea , which lasted a full 3 weeks after Houston , finally went away , and I 'm ( very slowly ) starting to put weight back on : I am now up to 147 , from a low point of 140 .
For the next few months , I 'll be relatively weak , but after that I should return to full health ( modulo the minor structural changes to my GI track from the surgery itself - I 've permanently lost 1 /3rd of my stomach , a few feet of intestines , my gallbladder , and 1 /3rd of my pancreas -- so you 'll be seeing me eat * real * carefully from now on ! ) .
The good news is that the Houston chemo / radiation , while grueling , in most cases does not do long - term damage to the body .
The crucial part of all this is that I have been able to stay " on schedule " with all the treatments so far , and that is the key to increasing my long - term chances .
Right now , there 's every reason to believe that I have a roughly 50 - 50 chance of surviving to 5 years ; while they 'll never used the word " cured " for me , when I make it to 5 years , the odds of re-appearance really drops .
50 - 50 odds are much better than most folks with pancreatic cancer ever get to , and I know which way I 'm betting !
Thanks again to everyone for all your help and support .

Randy is to begin his chemo this Monday , January 22 , 2007 .

December 30th , 2006
Cards can be sent to their home address .
4932 Ellsworth Ave. Pittsburgh , PA 15213 Update on Randy Pausch from Randy as of January 2 , 2007 I can very proudly say I have completed the treatment .
There is a ceremonial bell one rings and I have attached a photo ( I ’m a lot skinnier ; down from 182 to 147 ) .
As for the experience itself , well , let ’s just say that passing the theory qualifier in 1985 is now the * second * hardest thing I ’ve ever done …
I return to Pittsburgh ( December 30th ) today .
The side effects ( fatigue that keeps my bedridden , and constant nausea ) will persist another 2 weeks or so as the chemo and radiation slowly work their way out of my system .
But the key part is that I was able to * receive * all the treatment ( many patients have to have it suspended or terminated due to the toxicity ) .
So that means I ’ve maximized the odds off getting the benefits of the treatment .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Update : December 20 , 2006
Randy will be finished with his treatment December 29 or 30th .
He will be returning to Pittsburgh where he will continue treatment and focus on recovery .
Jai will be returning with the children December 30th
---------------------------------------------------
November 28 , 2006
Randy is almost at the half way point .
This Friday he will have completed his first half of the chemo treatments .
After his treatment on Friday he will take Saturday to recuperate and then on Sunday head to Norfolk to spend a week with his family .
He then returns on the 9th of December and begins the second regiment .
He is having the usual side effects from the chemo but the Doctors are trying different things to help him feel better and keep weight on .
November 22 , 2006 Yesterday proved to be not such a great day .
The treatment made Randy quite ill .
He spent lots of time sleeping but also his body was sent into deep chills where he could just not get warm .
His body just shook .
It was not a restful day or night .
November 21 , 2006
Randy is continuing to do well .
Tomorrow he will be half way through his treatment .
He has been able to handle the chemo reasonably well with few side effects .
He really appreciates your cards and notes .
Each one brighten his day .
He has been able to get on line and read email so much Jai is worried that his computer may start smoking .
Keep him in your thoughts .

Day three of the chemo and Randy is doing well .
He had a unrestful night but is able to rest during the day .
He and Jai are just taking it one day at a time .
Their book of how to play cards is coming in handy .
They have learned a couple of games to pass the time .
---------------------------------------------------
November 14 , 2006 Yesterday evening Randy underwent his first round of chemo the treatment began around 6 pm and finished around 1:30 am .
It was a late night !
Today Randy is feeling good , was able to eat breakfast .
He was reading and responding to email when I talked to Jai .
The nurses told them that it takes a little while before the effect of the chemo begin .
So the first day is finished and Randy is in good positive spirits and actually feeling pretty good .
Stay tuned for updates .

Nov 7th update from Randy :
My chemo / radiation was supposed to start yesterday ( Nov 6th ) , but has been delayed a week and will start Nov 13th .
As a result , I 'll now be here through Dec 30th ( or longer , if there is schedule slip , which can happen ) .
The reason for the delay is that twice in the last 10 days , I was told “ we ’re seeing a mass on a scan , and it ’s possible that your cancer has already spread . ”
The first time was a spot on the lung .
The second time was on a spot on the liver .
Fortunately , in both cases subsequent tests showed that my cancer did * NOT * spread .
The good news is that I ’m now the most scanned man in America , so we * really * know it has n’t spread yet .
If the cancer had spread to another organ , there ’s no hope for cure , and I ’d probably have 3 - 9 months to live .
So you can imagine that going through two rounds of " waiting for confirming tests " was a little ... um ... stressful .
Although emotionally exhausting , these detailed tests are just another indication of the thorough , high quality treatment I 'm getting here at MD Anderson .
This place really deserves its reputation , and the doctors and staff have all been knowledgeable , accessible , and incredibly humane .
Plus , they have wifi throughout the hospital , so I 'll be able to work on the laptop * while * receiving chemotherapy -- how cool is that !
I 'm spending this week resting and trying to gain as much weight back as possible before the chemo / radiation ( and its inevitable weight loss ) kick in .
I started this all at 182 , and I 'm now 157 .
Livable , but heavier would be better .
Thanks again to everyone who has expressed concern on my behalf : that has been a great source of comfort and inspiration for me .

Update from Randy Pausch on Oct 27th
Dear Friends and Colleagues ,
First , I want to say how touched I have been by the outpouring of help and sentiment since my diagnosis .
Words alone fail to express how grateful my wife Jai & I are to all of you .
My surgery went very well ; they got all of the tumor .
Most importantly , I have found a better option for post - surgical treatment .
When I was first diagnosed ( original message below ) , I was told I would have only a 10 - 20 % chance of 5 - year survival , even with a successful surgery that removed all the tumor .
Researching like crazy , I found an experimental treatment that is achieving 45 % 5 - year survival rates : a true breakthrough .
On Oct 31st , I leave for MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston , where I will be receiving treatment until Christmas .
Then , the last 5 months of treatment will be administered back in Pittsburgh .
The treatment in Houston is a seven week regimen of * extremely * toxic chemotherapy / radiation .
The phrase " take you to the brink " has been used by several doctors describing the process .
While not pleasant , this seems like a small price to pay for the increased survival odds .
My wife Jai will be with me in Houston during my treatment , while our three kids are with her family in Norfolk , Virginia .
The five months of treatment once I ’ m back in Pittsburgh is relatively tame , and I can resume a somewhat normal lifestyle in January .
From Nov 1st through Dec 22nd , I can be sent physical mail at :
Randy Pausch
Rotary House
1600 Holcombe Blvd
Houston , TX
77030
I will also be on email .
Thanks again to all who have been so supportive in so many ways as I continue this battle , which I fully intend to win !
-- Randy
-------- CONTEXT : MAIL SENT IN EARLY SEPTEMBER -------------
Dear Friends and Colleagues ,
I apologize for this mass email , but I know in situations like this that rumors and misinformation spread quickly and a mass email is the best way to ensure correct information for everyone .
I have recently been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer ( adenocarcinoma ) .
The good news is that I 'm one of the 20 % of pancreatic cancer patients who are viable for surgical removal of the tumor , and I 'm scheduled for surgery
on Tuesday , Sept 19th at UPMC Shadyside .
It 's a major surgery , where they will remove the tumor ( which is about 3 mm in diameter ) , my gallbladder , part of my pancreas , part of my small intestine , and possibly part of my stomach .
I will be in the hospital 2 - 3 weeks , and then another 4 weeks of bed rest at home .
At that point , I 'll be physically 100 % again .
If the surgery removes every last cancer cell , I win .
Otherwise , eventually the cancer will recur .
Statistically , the long - term prognosis is not rosy ; only 10 - 20 % of people who have the surgery survive to five years .
Needless to say , I intend to be one of the lucky ones who sticks around !
The median age for this disease is 66 and so there is some reason to believe my odds will be better than the typical patient 's ( I'm 45 and in good physical shape ) , so they can hit me with more aggressive chemo and / or radiation after the surgery .
My wife Jai and I are focusing right now on the logistics of taking care of our children ( Dylan , 4 ; Logan , 2 ; and Chloe , 4 months ) during the 2 months that I am sidelined .
This is obviously not good news , but I wanted people to hear this from me , and to have accurate information .
I have only 6 days remaining to do a ton of logistics before the surgery , so please understand if I 'm unable to respond to email or phone in the short term .
Please feel free to share this message with anyone you see fit .

As of Friday afternoon … …
Randy is looking and feeling much better .
He got his hair washed ,
shaved and spent more time walking around and sitting in the chair then
in his bed .

easier to get around .
His progress is outstanding .

Monday , September 25
Randy is doing very well .
He is in good spirits , sitting up , and doing laps up and down the corridor .

PS : This eating has not worked out so well .
He had a very bad night ( Sunday ) .
Monday , September 25 - 4:00 PM
Randy 's not doing too well today .
His stomach is not dumping fluids fast enough , so the doc put a tube down to his stomach through his nose and is pumping the fluid out to keep him from vomiting .
They 've reinserted the morphine iv to give him pain relief .
All in all , it 's been a rough 24 hours for him and he 's wiped out .
They might insert a feeding tube into his small intestines to give him some calories so he does n't lose too much weight .
We 'll find out tomorrow if that 's the way they 'll go .
MONDAY - September 25
This is a VERY VERY VERY Important update .
NO VISITORS !!!!!!!!
Visitors may be harmful to his recovery .
I know the updates on his progress have been positive but it is NOT OK to visit .
He is not ready .
He does have good days but if he gets too tired he then suffers greatly .
The family will let me know when visitors are allowed .
Randy is doing well but still has a very long road to recovery .
Remember NO VISITORS means even you .
If you want Randy to know you are thinking of him send a card or note to my attention and I will make sure his wife gets it .

He says thanks to everyone !
Remember at this point in time NO VISITORS .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday , September 28th
Today when Jai arrived at the hospital Randy 's room was being cleaned and he was nowhere in sight .
She found him walking down the hall doing his laps .
This is good !
The Nasogastric tube or NG that was removing the contents of the stomach is out but he remains connected to the IV for liquids .
He also still has a morphine drip or PCA ( patient - controlled analgesia ) for pain .
He is now allowed to have liquids by mouth .
Today he seems better and to have a little more energy .
He still tires easily .
The family still ask that no one visit .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friday , September 29th ......
An eye witness account .....
An eye witness account .....
Randy looked really great today .
He 's not as tired and he is able to walk 8 to 10 laps around the floor at a time .
But , his GI track is still off and he is still on a clear liquid diet .
He 's been limiting his intake to keep his stomach from backing up .
The surgeon came by and said Randy was making good progress and instructed Randy to increase his fluids .
He said that this GI complication only occurs in 10 % of the cases and always resolves .
He said there is a good chance the GI issue will resolve by Monday .
There are also other things they are watching like sugar and hemoglobin levels .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday , October 2 , 2006
Sunday afternoon the NG tube was removed from Randy 's stomach .
The liquids are not backing up and things seem to be working better .
He has been able to eat some solid foods .
Randy is being released from the hospital and going home this afternoon .
Other good news is that the biopsy done on the tissue around the repair came back as NEGATIVE .
This is more wonderful news .
The doctors say his is right on track .
The family still request not visitors .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday , Oct 3 rd .
Here is an email I just received from Randy :
I am very pleased to announce that I am home from the hospitall !
First , I want to deeply thank all those who have shown such concern for me , and especially to those who have offered help to Jai , who has been absolutely * amazing * dealing with 3 small kids and a hospitalized husband .
She is an amazing woman .
My surgery has gone well , but it will be another 6 weeks until I am fully recovered ; in the meantime , I will be resting heavily at home ( I can only tolerate being out of bed 1 - 2 hours a day , and walking up a flight of stairs completely exhausts me ) .
I ’ m not allowed to lift anything heavier than 5 pounds ( thank God I got the 4.5 pound ThinkPad ;-) , but I am allowed to have the kids on my lap if somebody else puts them there .
They are very glad to have Daddy home !
I appreciate the restraint of everyone who did not come by to visit , and I think we ’ ll need to keep the “ no visitors ” plan going for at least the next 1 - 2 weeks .
I *am * in good spirits , just very , very tired most of the time .
Thanks again to all those who have sent cards or otherwise expressed concern and / or offered to help ; having such a large community of friends has been invaluable in helping me through this ordeal .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
October 9th , 2006
Randy continues to rest and recuperate at home .
He is able to walk around , go up and down stairs .
Most importantly he is resting and healing .
This week he has a Dr's appointment so I may know more later in the week .
October 10 , 2006
Randy is getting stronger each day .
He is able to take short walks .
Rumor has it he has been seen walking on the sidewalk .
He still get tired and need rest but each day he is improving .
I also understand he spends some time emailing and even answering questions .
-------------------------------------------------------------------
October 13 , 2006
Randy had his first post - operative appointment with his oncologist on Thursday , October 12th .
The recovery from the surgery is going well .
It is advised that no longer then 12 weeks pass after surgery before the chemotherapy begin .
Within the next few weeks Randy and Jai will decide their next move to battle the cancer .
Randy , of course , went well prepared with a ton of research studies and they discussed various treatment options with the Doctor .
More to come ......
October 18 , 2006
Yesterday and today the Pausch family moved back to there home from temporary quarters .
Many friends volunteered their time to help with the unpacking .
As Randy reported today ...
we 're not quite " cardboard free , " but we 're close !
Stay tuned for more updates .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
October 25th , 2006
Randy has been accepted in to the MD Anderson protocol in Houston .
He will be leaving Monday October 30th for a week of preliminary tests .
the The following Monday he will begin chemotherapy .
He will be there for 6.5 weeks .
I am not sure exactly what the schedule will be there .
He and Jai are scrambling to find a workable situation so Jai can be with him and also be there for the children .
With the holiday coming up there will be lots of travel back and forth between home and Houston .
Check back for more updates .
I have discussed in the past the importance of setting and tracking goals and how it can affect your results on both a personal and financial level .
I wanted to take a moment to discuss in more detail how goal clarity combined with a positive attitude can help you achieve better things both personally and financially .
Goal Clarity
First , what is goal clarity ?
In essence it can be defined as your ability to set and reach specific goals .
The important part of this definition is the word specific .
A very broad or general goal wo n’t help drive you to success .
If your goal is to get up and go to work in the morning , that is not a well - defined goal .
It may be easy to achieve and a very important thing to succeed at , but it really has no strong emotion behind it .
Instead a goal should be clear , concise and worth achieving in which a specific outcome is reached .
Unfortunately , we are less likely to consistently set such specific or high goals because of many self - limiting thoughts .
People generally tend to stick to the safe and secure status quo and try not to get out of their comfort zone by nature .
To further illustrate the importance of setting high and specific goals I want to take a piece out of the book Integrity Selling for the 21st Century by Ron Willingham .
He describes the various emotional stages you feel once you set these higher and more specific goals as :
Initial excitement – the thrill of new possibilities can be intoxicating until you realize how much extra effort is usually required before change can take place .
Conflict – you might wonder , “ Can I actually achieve this new goal ?
What if I try and fail ? ”
Doubt – focusing on the difficulties or roadblocks , and wondering whether you can overcome them .
Resistance to change - the idea of changing your habits , beliefs and routines become uncomfortable .
Commitment – a renewed sense of dedication to whatever work , education or effort it might take to reach your goals .
Acceptance – finally believing deep down that you ’re capable of reaching your new goals .
The problem most people have comes after the first few stages of emotions take place .
The initial excitement gives way to conflict and doubt and if your focus is on the negatives and not the positives you will abandon the goal .
Setting Attainable and Intermediate Goals in Order to Achieve the Ultimate Goal
There is nothing more discouraging than setting a a lofty goal and then failing .
We do n’t like to fail and we do n’t want others to see our failures .
This fear of failure is what causes people to avoid setting higher or more specific goals .
There is a fine line between setting a lofty goal that is attainable and one that is simply out of reach .
For example , if I set a goal right now that said I wanted to make $ 250,000 by the end of the year , it would be a great goal that I ’d love to reach , but the chances of reaching that goal is slim to none baring an unexpected inheritance or lottery jackpot .
This is not the type of goal you should be setting .
Think of your ultimate goal as a game of baseball .
Every batter that comes to the plate does n’t go up there and try to hit a home run .
A game of baseball is long and requires strategy and finesse to reach the end result of a win .
Yes , hitting a home run is a great thing to accomplish but the probability of hitting one every time is very small .
Instead , the team focuses on smaller and more reasonable goals that will hopefully add up to reaching the ultimate result .
Some batters will go up looking to just get on base , another may follow up and bunt , or the team may have to sacrifice an out to score a run .
If the team can reach these important , yet manageable goals the likelihood of success is much higher than trying to rely on knocking one out of the park every at bat .
The goals you set are no different .
Maybe you want to retire at age 50 .
Ok , that is a great goal to try and reach but it is not well - defined and without hitting a home run it might be difficult to achieve .
Maybe in order to retire at age 50 you need to tackle some credit card debt or put a child through college first .
Or maybe you need to increase your income or save more money to help you reach that goal .
Whatever the ultimate goal is there are many small goals you can set that lead up increasing the probability of success .
Think of paying off your credit card goal as a base hit on your way to retiring early and finally getting your kid through college is a sacrifice fly to advance one of the runners home .
Emotional Response Determines the Outcome
Looking back to the six stages of emotions above it should be clear that you have to overcome the first four in order to have a chance at success .
If your goal is too broad or easy to accomplish you will breeze through the series of emotions quickly with very few negative thoughts or apprehension .
At the same time , if your goal is too high or incredibly specific you are likely to stall out after reaching number two or three on the list and never reach the goal .
If you can overcome the conflict , doubt and resistance to change you will find a sense of commitment and acceptance that you really can reach the goal you ’ve set for yourself .
If you let negative feelings take over , either because the goal is virtually impossible to complete on its own or there is no motivation to achieve it , you are setting yourself up for failure which in turn brings you back to sticking with the status quo .
Take Action Today
As an example let ’s assume one of your big goals you ’ve had for a while has been to pay off about $ 15,000 worth of credit card debt in 3 years .
Clearly you understand the importance of reaching this goal yet you find that you are n’t making much progress .
The reason you are n’t making good progress is that it is a bit overwhelming without understanding what it takes to get there .
The first thing you should do is determine what it will take to pay off that debt .
Generally speaking this would require :
Earning more money to accelerate payments , or Find more money you currently have to accelerate payments
Now that you have determined what it will take to reach that goal you can begin to set more specific goals .
For instance , maybe you think finding additional income is a good way to achieve this goal .
So , now you can set an intermediate goal that will increase your likelihood of paying off that balance .
You may set a new goal to find a way to make $ 50 / month by doing some sort of side work , or maybe you set a goal to have a garage sale or sell a bunch of items on eBay to generate some more money .
Whatever the case may be , these new goals you set are easier to reach than simply saying you need to knock out $ 15 k of debt in three years , yet these smaller and more concise goals will help you reach it without feeling a sense of failure .
Take a look at some of the goals you have set for yourself and consider why you are having a difficult time reaching them .
Are your emotions getting in the way or have you simply set a goal that is extremely difficult or too broad ?
If you can identify the reasons why you are having a difficult time with a goal you can then take the action required to overcome the obstacles and improve the likelihood of achieving that goal .

Artist Brian Springer spent a year scouring the airwaves with a satellite dish grabbing back channel news feeds not intended for public consumption .
The result of his research is SPIN , one of the most insightful films ever made about the mechanics of how television is used as a tool of social control to distort and limit the American public 's perception of reality .
Take the time to watch it from beginning to end and you 'll never look at TV reporting the same again .
Tell your friends about it .
This extraordinary film released in the early 1990s is almost completely unknown .
Hopefully , the Internet will change that .
Note :
We have posted excerpts of this film .
You can find these excerpts by going to the " Spin " section of Brasscheck TV .
Palestinians today formed a human chain in protest at Israel 's blockade of Gaza as Israel deployed thousands of troops and police officers along the border .
About 5,000 people , many of them women , schoolchildren and university students , joined the chain outside the town of Beit Hanoun , about four miles from the border .
The crowd hoisted banners in English and Arabic , saying " End the siege of Gaza now " , and " Your siege will not break our will " .
One of the organisers , an independent MP , Jamal al - Khoudary , said the protesters did not plan violent action .
" This is a peaceful event aimed to send a message to the world that the people of Gaza want to live in freedom , " he said .
Organisers had hoped to form a chain running the length of the 25 - mile Gaza strip , but turnout was well below expectations .
After the protest some 2,000 Hamas loyalists marched to a checkpoint several kilometres away from Erez .
However , Hamas police blocked the main road leading to the Erez checkpoint and called on loyalists to obey the law .
Hamas organised the event to protest at chronic shortages of vital supplies in Gaza because of Israeli restrictions .
The group said the event would be peaceful and marchers would not reach the border .
Israel took no chances and deployed troops and police to prevent any repeat of scenes that occurred recently at the Gaza - Egypt border .
" I hope that , ultimately , they understand that we are deployed and ready , that this will not be a repeat of what happened in the Philadelphi Corridor ( Egypt border ) a few weeks back , " the deputy defence minister , Matan Vilnai , told Israel Radio .
Hamas blew open Gaza 's border wall with Egypt last month , allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to cross into Egypt and stock up with food , petrol and other basic necessities .
But Israel voiced fears the flood of people included Islamist militants intent on carrying out attacks , and Egyptian security forces rounded up hundreds of suspects .
" We do n't plan to fool around in this regard , " Vilnai said .
" We will use measures in the way we deem necessary to prevent people breaking into the state of Israel 's territory . "
Israeli radio and TV stations devoted their morning news coverage to the event , warning of a mass exodus of Gazans .
" It 's absolutely clear that among them will be people with explosive charges , there will be those among them who will be ready at any moment to blow up the border fence , " an ultra-nationalist MP , Effie Eitam , told Israel Radio , reflecting a widespread sense of alarm .
" Suddenly there will be a big hole in the fence somewhere , there will be explosions , injured soldiers and the mob will stream into our territory .
If that happens it will be the end of the state of Israel . "
Last month , Israel tightened the blockade on Gaza , home to 1.5 million Palestinians , limiting supplies of fuel and other goods in response to cross - border rocket fire by militants .
Militants say the attacks are in response to Israeli raids and would stop if Israel lifted Gaza 's blockade .
Hamas is treated as a political pariah by Israel and the west for not recognising Israel .
It has , however , offered Israel a conditional , long - term ceasefire .
Some Palestinians have advocated a strategy of non-violent resistance to Israel similar to the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa , and the worldwide impact of Gazans rushing into Egypt appears to have prompted Hamas to try and replicate such tactics on Gaza 's border with Israel .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A California company said on Thursday it used cloning technology to make five human embryos , with the eventual hope of making matched stem cells for patients .

Stemagen Corp. in La Jolla , California , destroyed the embryos while testing to make sure they were true clones .
But the researchers , based at a fertility center , said they believed their ready source of new human eggs would make their venture a success .
Other experts were skeptical about the claims , published in the journal Stem Cells .
If verified , the team would be the first to prove they have cloned human beings as a source of stem cells , the master cells of the body .
There are several types of stem cells .
Embryonic stem cells , made from days - old embryos , are considered the most powerful because they can give rise to all the cell types in the body .
The Stemagen team said they got five human embryos using skin cells from two adult men who work at the IVF center .
They said they had painstakingly verified that the embryos were clones of the two men .
“ We hope it is a bit of a turning point for many more studies , ” Andrew French , who led the research , said in a telephone interview .
They used a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer , or SCNT , which involves hollowing out an egg cell and injecting the nucleus of a cell from the donor to be copied -- in this case , the skin cells from the men .
It is the same technique used to make Dolly the sheep in 1996 , the first mammal to be cloned from an adult .
Researchers hope to use the technique to create tailor - made transplants of cells , tissue or organs for patients , treating injuries and diseases like juvenile diabetes .
“ Since a significant percentage of couples undergoing fertility treatments appear willing to participate in this type of research , we believe the method described to obtain donated oocytes is a viable and ethically acceptable strategy , ” the researchers wrote .
MOST SUCCESSFUL SO FAR
Some cloning experts said the work appeared to be genuine .
“ This is the most successful description so far of the use of the cloning techniques with purely human material .
However , it is still a long way from achieving the goal of obtaining embryonic stem cells , ” said Robin Lovell - Badge of Britain ’s Medical Research Council ’s division of stem cell biology .
“ I hope that the authors have the opportunity to continue their work and derive embryo stem cell lines , ” Ian Wilmut , who led the team that cloned Dolly and who is now at the University of Edinburgh , said in an e-mail .
The field is controversial for several reasons .
President George W. Bush opposes the use of human embryos to make stem cells and has vetoed bills from Congress that would expand federal funding of this research .
South Korean scientist Hwang Woo - suk made headlines when he was found to have faked key parts of a report that his team had used cloning technology to make human embryos in 2004 .
“ We need to be ultra-cautious after the Hwang scandal and not make the same mistake all over again , ” said Dr. Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technology , a Massachusetts company that is also trying to make human embryonic stem cells .
“ I ’d really like to believe it , but I ’m not sold yet , ” Lanza said .
Other teams have made stem cells they believe are similar to embryonic cells using a variety of techniques , including reprogramming a human egg cell alone , reprogramming ordinary skin cells into what are called induced pluripotent stem cells , or by taking one cell from a human embryo without harming the embryo .
But most stem cell experts agree it is important to continue trying to make stem cells from embryos too .

The as - yet - unnamed material - a form of artificial rubber - is made from vegetable oil and a component of urine .
The substance , described in the journal Nature , produces surfaces when cut that retain a strong chemical attraction to each other .
Pieces of the material join together again as if never parted without the need for glue or a special treatment .
This remarkable property comes from careful engineering of the molecules in the material .
The French researchers are already making kilogramme quantities in their Paris laboratories and say the process is almost completely green , and could be completely so with a few adjustments .
' Tiny hands '
The secret of the substance lies in how the molecules are held together .
A piece of normal rubber , says Dr Ludwik Leibler , who headed the research , is actually a single molecule with billion upon billions of smaller units chemically welded together to form a giant tangled network .
Children are always breaking their toys .
Would n't it be nice if you could put them back together so easily ?
Ludwik Leibler
But break a rubber ( or most other solids ) , and the chemical welds - known as covalent bonds - are also broken .
These can not be remade .
Nor can a piece of rubber be remoulded or reshaped .
" We wanted to see if we could make a rubber - like material using small molecules , " Dr Leibler of the Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution ( ESPCI ) in Paris told the BBC's Science In Action programme .
The trick was to replace the covalent bonds in rubber with weaker connections known as hydrogen bonds .
These are like hands on neighbouring molecules that can clasp together , but let go when broken .
Dr Leibler quickly realised that this meant not only that the new rubber could be recycled and remoulded many times over , but that if separated by a cut or break , the chemical hands at the fresh surfaces would still be waving about ready to bind again .
Child 's play
François Tournilhac , who runs Dr Leibler 's laboratories , demonstrated the healing to me .
Using a razor blade he severed a thin strand of the yellowish material ( the colour of corn oil ) , showed me the clean square faces , and then pressed them together .
Almost immediately , the grip was strong enough for him to hold the sample just at one end .
Within an hour the bonds had rebuilt themselves so thoroughly that it was possible to stretch the strand to twice its length without any sign of weakness where the cut had been made .
One obvious use , says Dr Leibler , is for self - healing seals .
Puncture a seal in a compression joint with a nail , and the hole would automatically repair itself .
He also has more playful suggestions .
" Why not use it to make children 's toys ?
Children are always breaking their toys .
Would n't it be nice if you could put them back together so easily ? "
The material was developed with the support of the French company Arkema , which is already investigating whether it can be turned into a commercial product .
Monster Cable is fighting back against critics of its overpriced cables , responding to a Consumerist expose of profit margins .
Monster issued a long , rambling denunciation of the criticisms therein .
Here 's a Valleywag - esque 100 - word version :
• Making a fuss over the high markups on our cables is misleading , because all brick - and - mortar stores aim for similar margins on every type of product .
It 's much worse on clothing , jewelry and furniture .
• So what if the retailers are ripping you off ?
That 's the retailers ' fault , not Monster Cable's .
• Monster makes the world 's highest quality cables .
" Our customers know what they 're paying for . "
• The idea that digital transmissions suffer no signal loss is nonsense .
• Different HDMI cables are rated to different bandwidth capabilities .
This means that you 'll have " the best possible digital picture " with a higher - rated cable .
A few reflections :
• The claim that " digital cables , by definition , have no signal loss " is indeed false .
It 's only true if the transmission is error - corrected , for example by using a protocol like IP .
Without error correction , the stream of ones and zeroes can lose integrity en-route just like an analog wave .
DVI and HDMI are not error corrected .
• Monster does n't address the well - understood fact that at normal cable lengths , there 'll be no perceptible difference , even without error correction , between their cables and cheap alternatives .
• Monster 's discussion of bandwidth increases between successive
HDMI specs obfuscates the fact that you only need as much bandwidth as the data you 're transmitting requires .
Other companies also sell the higher - rated cables cheaply .
We get it , lasers are awesome .
You know , you can burn things and blind people and stuff , what 's not to like ?
But at some point -- let 's say the $ 3 k mark , for the sake of argument -- you 're just starting to look silly , that 's all we 're saying .
The Hercules 400 Laser happens to hit just such a price point , with 400 mW of power that 's capable of burning through cardboard and thick plastic .
Back in our day we had to use ingenuity and a magnifying glass to set things on fire , but we would 've sold our family into slavery for a shot at one of these , so the point is kind of moot .

DIGG THIS
In eighteenth - century France the saying laissez faire [ let people do or make what they choose ] and laissez passer [ let pass or go ] was the formula into which some of the champions of the cause of liberty compressed their program .
Laissez faire does not mean :
Let soulless mechanical forces operate .
It means :
Let each individual choose how he wants to cooperate in the social division of labor ; let the consumers determine what the entrepreneurs should produce .
Planning means :
Let the government alone choose and enforce its rulings by the apparatus of coercion and compulsion .
The alternative is not between a dead mechanism or a rigid automatism on one hand and conscious planning on the other hand .
The question is whose planning ?
~ Ludwig von Mises
As I interact with fellow believers in the logic of radical libertarianism and the societal condition to which it leads — market anarchy — I find that many of the same debates come up over and over .
All of us who believe strongly in a voluntary society are well aware that statists and even those sitting " on the fence " with regard to anarcho - capitalism tend to ask the same questions , particularly in their initial contacts with radical libertarian theory .
I admit , however , that I was surprised at how often the same debates come up even among those who might already be termed " true believers . "
Ironically , not only are these objections typical between proponents of market anarchy , but many of the debates within which they are raised are just as sharp as one might expect between staunch libertarians and the most statist champions of neocon - dom , if not more violent .
Why do people raise the same objections to anarchy over and over ?
Why can't someone answer these incessant points once and for all and have them go away ?
Why does it seem so difficult to " get to " anarchy ?
As Mises so eloquently states , the only question is " whose planning ? "
From my perch , anarchy appears to be a nebulous , desperately out - of - reach ideal because even among anarchists there are a couple of basic misunderstandings that are both pervasive , subtle , and apparently damned - near immortal as well .
One :
We occasionally , and far too often , speak of an anarchic society as if it was some hallowed final destination , inherently very far away , or some mysterious state of being that will require incredible changes — in the most basic qualities of mankind — to be realized .
Two :
We sometimes forget , and more importantly , we allow those with whom we interact to forget , that almost every service currently provided by the State — with the possible exception of a standing army — was provided successfully , efficiently , effectively and without heavy - handed coercion , via private means before the state subsumed it .
Anarchy : Far Away ?
Aside from the fact that anarchy is not a place , despite our tendency to refer to " places " such as Ancapistan or Libertopia , it might still seem that a just , peaceful , thriving society based upon the premises of market anarchy is far away .
The reasons for this are several - fold .
First and foremost , even the supposed believers often speak of it in these terms .
Sometimes , when one examines the challenges presented by the current statist society , they seem insurmountable .
Additionally , we often speak of previous societies as if they were composed of people who somehow understood freedom more deeply and practiced liberty more completely .
While this may be arguable , it is still overly pessimistic .
Why ?
It is pessimistic because of one unassailable fact : Anarchy is all around us all the time .
This fact can be discovered via two rather pedestrian methods of investigation : 1 — being awake ; and , 2 — looking around .
The overwhelming majority of all our interactions with each other are anarchic .
As I mentioned in my " Attack of the 50 - Foot Minarchist " essay :
Even if one completely ignores the example of Iceland , where an anarchic society existed for something like 300 years ( yes , three hundred years ) , he does n't have to look all that far [ to find anarchy ] .
If one wants other examples of stable anarchy , he only has to look in one place — everywhere ! …
All government hierarchies eventuate with people “ at the top ” who answer to no one but themselves .
All societies are composed of people who interact based upon unwritten laws that almost everyone , with a few notable exceptions , seems to follow without enforcement .
I went on :
What rules govern how you treat the many people with whom you interact daily ?
Do police and other “ law givers ” follow you around to make sure you act in a way that supports an orderly society ?
Of course the answer is no !
Each of us has hundreds , if not thousands , of interactions with other people daily and seldom do we need any final arbiter to keep the peace .
As one would expect , I am not the first person to make this observation .
Shaffer makes a similar observation in " What Is Anarchy ? " when he says :
I am often asked if anarchy has ever existed in our world , to which I answer : almost all of your daily behavior is an anarchistic expression .
How you deal with your neighbors , coworkers , fellow customers in shopping malls or grocery stores , is often determined by subtle processes of negotiation and cooperation .
Social pressures , unrelated to statutory enactments , influence our behavior on crowded freeways or grocery checkout lines .
If we dealt with our colleagues at work in the same coercive and threatening manner by which the state insists on dealing with us , our employment would be immediately terminated .
We would soon be without friends were we to demand that they adhere to specific behavioral standards that we had mandated for their lives .
We can only confuse people when we allow the concept of a truly voluntary society to be treated as a far - away fantasy .
This is particularly true since it 's already here .
Services : Who Will Provide
Them ?
People learn to accept the State as it is , seldom questioning what it should be or what it used to be .
Lora and I touched upon this issue in our " Socialism Leads to Stupidity " essay when we said :
Richard Hammer speaks to this process in “ Gateway to an Altered Landscape ” when he describes this process of the state becoming a state of mind .
He uses four stages to illustrate :
Before the state takes over a function , most people in a society will be comfortable with the existing institutions in which the function is performed privately .
For example , most Americans are now comfortable with the ideas that parents can decide for themselves how many children to bear , and that people can decide for themselves what qualities are necessary in a spouse .
Shortly after the state takes over a function , most people in the society will probably agree with state control of that function , but almost all of them will remember that there had been a debate , and some will acknowledge that there had been plausible arguments against state takeover .
For example , the regulation of what tobacco companies say in their advertisements .
A few generations after state takeover of a function , probably 80 % or more of the population will assume that the state must perform that function , and only libertarians will be aware that there had ever been a debate .
For examples , compulsory schooling and zoning of land in cities .
Hundreds of years after state takeover of a function , virtually everyone in the society will assume without question that the state must perform that function .
Even the history of private performance of the function will be forgotten by all but a few academics .
Examples of functions in this category are : streets , criminal law , and defense from external attack .
Many a libertarian theorist — from Hoppe , in " The Private Production of Defense " to Sennholz , in " Why Is Medical Care So Expensive ? " — has outlined how and why services are not only cheaper when supplied by private enterprise but better as well .
Hypothesizing about how private industry might meet the needs of society is one of the most fertile areas of thought among libertarians .
Some might argue , quite effectively , as does Lora in , " Libertarians Are Not … Omniscient or Specialists in Everything " that it 's a little too fertile !
To wit :
Thus , I am puzzled when I hear questions , even by fellow libertarians , that take the following form : “ In a libertarian society , how would X work ?
How would problem Y be solved ?
What guarantees would there be that Z would / would not happen ? ” …
The problem starts when the “ viability ” of freedom becomes contingent upon the “ answer ” to those questions .
That is , if the “ right ” and fully satisfactory answer is not achieved ( ignoring that no such answer could ever be 100 % correct ) , then somehow the desire for liberty is lessened and statism creeps back in .
As Lora conveys , the fact of the matter is this .
No one really knows exactly how the market would supply every service currently supplied by the State .
So what ?
For example , as a commuter , one might ask how his life would change if all the roads he used to get to his place of employment were suddenly < Gasp > privately - owned and operated ?
Certainly this makes for interesting debate fodder .
But let me posit another alternative .
What if the whole paradigm surrounding one 's work life was different under market anarchism ?
What if the fact that we have — in the US anyway — long stretches of relatively pristine paved roadways joining the suburbs and the city is a direct result of the existence of a coercive state ?
Who is to say that without a government central planning we'd have ended up with the current set - up for our working lives ?
What if , instead of driving great distances , which requires roads and cars , our society had kept the paradigm wherein those who worked someplace also lived near that location , close enough to walk or ride a bike ?
I work in transportation , so I have often pondered the differences in travel paradigm in Europe and the US .
Simply put , there are trains in Europe and lots of them .
In the US , not so much , except in densely populated areas such as the Northeast Corridor , the stretch of land between New York City and the Washington , DC , inclusive .
Why is airline travel so ubiquitous relative to train travel in the US ?
Certainly population density and travel distance plays a part , but my colleagues and I also have a truism :
Whatever the government subsidizes always looks better to the consumer .
( Too bad the consumer pays for it either way ! )
The State is a primary reason air travel " works " in the States .
Take away all that tax money for airports and all that tax money bailing out virtually one airline every week and the commercial transportation landscape would look very different .
For all I know , there would n't be any " major " airlines , just a bunch of smaller outfits servicing geographic regions .
I do know this :
If people wanted to fly there would be companies offering it .
The people who did n't want to fly just would n't also be paying .
A similar effect would probably happen in every industry , including automobiles .
But I 'm still just guessing .
Fortunately we do n't have to know all those answers , no matter how interesting the debate upon them might be .
It is sufficient to know but one thing .
If theft is immoral when conducted by an individual for his purposes , then theft by a government — known as taxation — is also immoral , even if supposedly conducted on behalf of those deemed worthy .
As such , the fact that one cannot a priori determine exactly how private enterprise would supply such items as airport construction or highway maintenance is irrelevant , if interesting .
Conclusion
One of my de facto mentors in the concept of anarchy recently said , in an e-mail exchange in which I was fortunate enough to be part , that anarchy is " a process " and not " a place . "
Wise words indeed !
That process has been underway for about as long as there have been people .
With every successive generation we further ingrain the logic of voluntary interaction among the citizenry .
Unfortunately , we also ingrain the expectation that an over - arching body can , while supposedly lubricating that interaction , provide necessary — required for the " public good " — services for everyone .
Call me crazy , but I 'll take my chances with the market .
If you do n't want to do so , I 'm okay with that too , but please do n't require me to help assuage your fearfulness with my life , my liberty , and my property .
The Best of Wilton Alston
Obama considerably less popular among 19 Democratic superdelegates who are under the age of 36 .
Young superdelegates stay cool toward Obama
Few demographic groups are more enamored of Sen. Barack Obama than the young .
Yet among the youthful voters who might end up mattering most to his campaign — the 19 Democratic superdelegates who are under the age of 36 — Obama appears to be considerably less popular .
According to a Politico analysis , just six of the 19 youngest superdelegates favor Obama .
Sen .
Hillary Clinton has support from four of these superdelegates , with 9 others remaining uncommitted .
Advertisement
Figures compiled by Politico show that , in the overall superdelegate count at the moment , Clinton leads Obama with 242 superdelegates to his 160.5 .
There are 318.5 uncommitted superdelegates .
( Some superdelegates only receive a half - vote . )
Obama ’s softness among the youngest of superdelegates is unusual given his popularity with young voters in general — he has captured the under - 30 youth vote in all but three states so far .
In a closely - divided nominating contest that might be decided by the more than 700 Democratic superdelegates , the loss of even a few could prove costly , not to mention ironic if those superdelegates came from one of Obama ’s demographic strongholds .
Young superdelegates have n’t exactly rejected Obama .
Rather , many of them are proving to be politically savvy when it comes to leveraging their influence .
A number of these superdelegates said in interviews that they believe they can better affect the way campaigns approach young voters if they stay above the fray and refrain from endorsing either candidate .
The two top officers of the College Democrats of America , for instance , are both superdelegates and neither are taking sides .
“ My priority is working with both campaigns on youth outreach , ” explained Awais Khaleel , 23 , the CDA vice president .
“ Long before anybody was talking about superdelegates I had been in touch with senior staff members of the campaigns to make sure they keep young people as part of their campaign infrastructure . ”
That position was echoed by another member of a key Democratic youth group .
“ I saw my role , being one of two women under 30 on the [ Democratic National Committee ] , to advocate for young voters , ” said undeclared superdelegate Crystal Strait , 28 , national committeewoman for the Young Democrats of America .
“ It ’s crucial to understand what they think real investment in general election in the youth vote will be .
Neither has come forward with that . ”
Likewise , the youngest superdelegate of all , 21 - year - old Marquette University junior Jason Rae , is remaining neutral for now .
Despite his tender age , Rae is something of a veteran :
He was elected as a Wisconsin DNC delegate in 2004 at the age of 17 , though he was too young to actually vote that year .
Having run on a platform of increasing youth representation in party leadership , Rae emphasizes youth outreach in deciding between the candidates .
He says his top priority in picking a candidate is “ to make sure the campaign is making an effort to reach out to young people and include youth in political process . ”
Both Rae and Young Democrats ’ President David Hardt , 31 , who lives in Texas , say they are so torn that they may continue to withhold their formal support even after they have cast a ballot in their states ’ respective upcoming primaries .
Not all the young superdelegates have been struggling with the decision .
Francisco Domenech , a 28 - year - old from Puerto Rico , the YDA national committeeman , has pledged to support Clinton .
He points to what he says is Clinton ’s superior youth program as well as her support for issues of importance to Puerto Rico and Latinos .
“ The targeted youth outreach of the Obama campaign was 18 - to 22 - year - olds , ” said Domenech .
“ YDA represents 18 - to 36 - year - olds .
We need to go beyond college - age young people for all young people .
I do n’t think [ the Obama campaign ] targets young mothers and fathers or young working professionals .
Hillary does . ”
Though Domenech says he will “ wholeheartedly ” support Obama if he is the nominee , he plans to support Clinton “ until she gets the nomination or decides to bow out . ”
District of Columbia superdelegate Jeffrey Richardson , 29 , cites the enthusiasm that Obama has generated among young people as one of the chief reasons he supports him .
“ The Democratic Party has an opportunity , with the groundswell of support Sen .
Obama has built in his campaign with independents and young people , to expand the party long - term , ” said Richardson .
Both the Clinton and Obama campaigns have put considerable effort into appealing to these superdelegates , with calls from the candidates themselves and from high - profile surrogates .
But in interviews , the youthful superdelegates suggest that the Clinton ’s outreach efforts might be a bit more aggressive — which could help explain why she fares almost as well as Obama among young superdelegates .
“ The Clinton campaign has been much more serious in their delegate outreach , ” said Crystal Strait .
“ Sen. Clinton and Chelsea Clinton have called me .
Obama had [ Arizona ] Gov. [ Janet ] Napolitano call me . ”
As the superdelegate angle has become a staple of news coverage , Strait says she has received even more attention , now mainly from those who are lobbying her from outside the campaigns .
After a Feb. 11 appearance on National Public Radio , she was inundated with messages from young supporters of the two candidates .
“ I had 63 Facebook messages yesterday and 42 new ‘ friends ’ [ on Facebook ] , ” Strait said on Tuesday .
“ They are young people from around the country , like Stephanie from Utah telling me about women ’s issues , how she is moved by Senator Clinton .
[ And ] a young man in Chicago telling me about disability rights and how Obama would be a better advocate for those issues , ” she said .

Once again , I find myself having a socially inappropriate response to the news .
This time it involves the two inmates who tunneled their way out of jail .

If all they had done was tunnel to freedom , I would have been impressed with their work ethic and creativity .
But these guys took it one step further and left a note thanking a guard for helping them escape .
Pure evil genius .
I think everyone including the warden realizes it is highly unlikely the guard actually helped in the escape .
But the authorities still have to look into it .
At the very least , it made that guard consider that he might end up on the other side of the bars .
I know it is wrong to admire the creativity of criminals .
But I blame them for doing such an admirable job of being evil .
WASHINGTON  Republican front - runner John McCain accused Barack Obama on Wednesday of waffling on a pledge to accept public financing for the fall presidential campaign .
McCain says he will accept public money in the fall and stick to spending limits if his Democratic opponent does the same .
Obama agreed to do so last fall if he became the Democratic nominee , in response to a questionnaire from the Midwest Democracy Network , a non-partisan civic group .
Obama proposed in a column published Wednesday on USA TODAY 's opinion page that McCain agree to refuse fundraising help from outside groups , that they limit the spending by their own parties and that McCain agree to spending limits " while the Democratic primary contest continues . "
" The campaign - finance laws are complex and filled with loopholes that can render meaningless any agreement that is not solidly constructed , " Obama wrote .
McCain , speaking in Ohio , said the Illinois senator is engaging in " doublespeak . "
McCain , a senator from Arizona , wrote the 2002 law restricting campaign spending .
He said he and Obama both made the same pledge and it is " not any more complicated than that . "
" I think the American people would expect him to hold that commitment , especially if we want to bring about change , " he said , using one of Obama 's campaign themes .
McCain said he'd re-evaluate his pledge if Obama or Hillary Rodham Clinton did not make the same commitment .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton noted McCain did not take public money or adhere to any spending limits for the primaries , despite the senator 's role in shaping campaign - finance law .
" John McCain is in no place to question anyone on pledges , " Burton said .
Clinton has not agreed to accept public money if she becomes the Democratic nominee , and her campaign has criticized Obama for not reaffirming his pledge .
If candidates accept public financing , they would receive about $ 84.1 million after their nominating convention , according to Bob Biersack of the Federal Election Commission .
McCain and Obama dueled as campaign - finance reports for January were filed with the FEC on Wednesday .
McCain reported raising about $ 11.7 million in donations last month .
He began January as an underdog in the Republican primaries but ended last month with victories in New Hampshire , South Carolina and Florida .
McCain took out about $ 1 million in loans to pay for TV commercials , on top of about $ 3.9 million in loans from last year , his report said .
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , who trails far behind McCain in GOP delegates , reported raising about $ 4 million and spending about $ 5 million in January .
Obama 's report showed he raised $ 36 million last month .
He finished the month with $ 25 million cash on hand , but $ 7 million is specifically for the general election .
Clinton raised nearly $ 14 million last month , according to her report , including about $ 1 million for the general election .
Counting her debts , including $ 5 million she lent her campaign , Clinton ended January with about $ 1.5 million .
The Obama and Clinton campaigns spent about $ 1 million a day — $ 28.5 million for the month by Clinton , $ 30.5 million for Obama .
Among candidates who have ended their campaigns , Republican Rudy Giuliani reported spending about $ 7 million last month .
The former New York City mayor ended his bid after finishing third in Florida .
He raised $ 3 million last month , according to his report .

I am , of course , talking about the " Perfect Storm " Bubble .
Has anyone else noticed this ?
It seems that the people who babble endlessly in the financial media have grabbed hold of the world 's most facile description of what 's going on in the global credit markets .
Yep , you guessed it :
It 's a perfect storm .
My colleague Seth Jayson pointed out that Washington Mutual 's ( NYSE : WM ) CEO , Kerry " do n't call me Kittles " Killinger , called the housing market 's condition the result of a " perfect storm " of delinquencies , declining liquidity , and sunspots ( or somesuch ) .
Seth was dead - on in his commentary : Sure -- the situation in housing is horrid and deplorable .
But it 's not a " perfect storm . "
That implies that it was also a surprise or was otherwise unforeseeable .
A monkey could tell you that lending huge amounts of money to large numbers of people with poor credit histories at a 2 % teaser rate would end badly .
Many monkeys did just that .
They could n't say when it would happen .
But if ?
No problemo .
It 's a storm !
And it 's perfect !
And , it 's a storm !
The " perfect storm " bromide insinuates that the victims are blameless .
Reality suggests that such thinking will relieve your conscience but do nothing to refill your wallet .
Nor will it help you avoid the next " perfect storm " that is n't .
The failures and maimings of American Home Mortgage , New Century , NovaStar ( NYSE : NFI ) , Accredited Home Lenders ( NASDAQ : LEND ) , WCI ( NYSE : WCI ) and a host of other lenders and builders was caused by the " perfect storm " of idiotic lending standards -- nothing more .
See how easy an explanation that is ?
Credit crunch ?
Perfect storm .
Falling dollar ?
Perfect storm .
Bad hygiene ?
Perfect storm .
World 's tallest man ?
Perfect storm .
Carrot Top 's nearly inexplicable career ?
Perfect storm .
Michigan losing to Appalachian State ?
OK , no perfect storm .
No way that ever gets old , though .
Oh , wait
Never mind .
Michigan 's loss was a " perfect storm . "
Kudos to the folks from Ohio for sticking the boot in .
Storms as far as the eye can see
Killinger is n't the only person pointing to a perfect storm , and housing is n't the only place that is being lauded for its perfection .
A quick perusal of the headlines from the past few days shows perfect storms in :
Technology : eBay's ( NASDAQ : EBAY )
Skype blamed a " perfect storm " for its wide - scale service outage in August .
The Alberta pork industry : Its very existence is threatened .
By a perfect storm .
Moving on .
Gold :
Hey look !
The gold " perfect storm " is a good thing !
Who knew ?
Must be another part of the conspiracy .
Asthma : Specifically , Canadian asthma .
Wheat : Prices have hit all - time highs .
Apparently it 's due to a " perfect storm . "
Apparently , also , that storm did n't even include the fact that the American government has encouraged farmers to turn thousands of acres of cropland over to growing corn as an overpriced source of fuel .
Not perfect .
The great Atlanta golf grass perfect storm : Starring " The great Atlanta golf grass perfect storm . "
If you 're getting the feeling that I 'm mocking the perfect storm of " perfect storm " overuse , then you 're smarter than the average bear .
This term is a zeitgeist whose zeit has come .
You could always blame Canada
The trouble I have with the perfect storm Killinger mentions is that it lets a whole lot of people off the hook for their own actions .
The financial market is unforgiving to those who know not what they do .
There is no doubt in my mind that thousands of people were put into home loan products without their consent .
But their numbers pale in comparison to those who used lax lending standards to speculate on a booming housing market -- and the same folks are being buried under their debts today .
Just the same , neither the lenders that made the loans -- like Countrywide ( NYSE : CFC ) -- nor the investors who pushed for them and bought securities by the boatload in chase of yield -- like the now - kaput funds at Bear Stearns ( NYSE : BSC ) -- deserve to be bailed out .
The key word is n't " perfect . "
It is n't " storm . "
It 's " speculate . "
And sometimes speculation comes with a price that must be paid in full .
I 'd call it the " perfect storm of reaping what you sow . "
But I won't .
For further related Foolishness :
Google on Wednesday said it has seen 50 times more search requests coming from Apple iPhones than any other mobile handset — a revelation so astonishing that the company originally suspected it had made an error culling its own data .
" We thought it was a mistake and made our engineers check the logs again , " Vic Gundotra , head of Googleâs mobile operations told the Financial Times during this week 's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .
Should other companies follow in Apple 's footsteps by making web access commonplace on their mobile handsets , Gundotra believes the number of mobile searches could outpace fixed internet search " within the next several years . "
That of course means big increases in incremental advertising revenues for the Mountain View , Calif . - based search giant .
Though Google 's primary revenue driver remains online advertising , the company has never separated out its mobile revenues from those of traditional computer - based browsers .
Gundotra , however , told the Times that the mobile segment was growing âabove expectationsâ , both in terms of usage and revenues .
" The world is changing .
Users want an internet without fences .
They know how to type in Google.com if they want to get to it , " he said .
" Two years ago the operators were still playing the role of gateÂ­keepers but that is no longer the role for them . "
The mobile boss also reiterated a long - running company position on the mobile handset market , which is that Google is unlikely to build its own mobile hardware despite widespread speculation to the contrary .
" We want every phone to be a Google phone , " he said .
" We are ultimately talking about thousands of devices .
The best way to do this would beÂ to get Googleâs mobile operating system , Android , deployed on as many types of handsets as possible . "

BBC News , Beijing
Mao Zedong is still highly respected by many Chinese people
Mao persecuted thousands of writers , along with other artists and intellectuals , for their Western , capitalist ideas .
But at the same time he had a steady income from his own writing - a sum now believed to be more than 130 million yuan ( $ 17.6 m , £ 8.8 m ) .
A recently - published article in a Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) magazine has reignited a debate about who should inherit this fortune .
Millions of books containing Mao's essays , poems and thoughts have been published around the world .
Perhaps the best known publication is Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong , also known as the Little Red Book .
As the title suggests , the book is a collection of comments from Mao , on subjects such as class struggle and serving the people .
Nearly one billion copies were printed in the Cultural Revolution , a chaotic period in which Mao sought to transform Chinese society .
Schoolchildren , workers and soldiers were all required to study the book , whose wisdom was thought to be useful in almost any situation .
Family refused
The Little Red book remains a popular purchase in China
The Little Red Book and other publications continue to produce royalties for Mao's estate more than 30 years after his death .
An article published in the magazine Literary World of Party History laid out just how much Mao has earned from his writing .
It said that in 1967 he was worth 5.7 million yuan ( $ 780,000 , £ 400,000 ) from books printed in Chinese , English , Russian , French , Spanish and Japanese .
But that figure , including interest , had risen to 130 million yuan ( $ 17.6 m , £ 8.8 m ) by 2001 .
The article did not say how much the estate is worth now .
There has long been a debate within the higher echelons of the party about who should inherit this vast sum of money .
Jiang Qing , Mao's fourth wife and loyal supporter during the Cultural Revolution , apparently asked for the money on five occasions before her death in 1991 .
The CCP made it possible for Mao to earn royalties in enormous quantities
Prof Roderick MacFarquhar
Jiang , also known as Madam Mao , even brought the subject up with China 's former leader before he died in 1976 .
If he was in a good mood , Mao promised he would leave her some money , according to the article .
If he was in a bad mood , Mao would accuse her of wanting him to die early so she could get her hands on his cash .
Two of Mao 's children also asked for the money to be given to them .
Their request , along with Madam Mao's , was refused .
' Collective wisdom '
Many see no contradiction in Mao's accumulation of wealth
This issue came up again in 2003 following the publication of a new edition of Mao 's collected works , according to the new article .
It arose because party leaders were apparently unsure whether or not Mao 's royalties should be taxed and so asked the country 's cabinet for advice .
It decided to uphold an earlier decision not to give the money to Mao 's relatives because his writings were not his own , but the " crystallisation of the party 's collective wisdom " .
Over the last few weeks there has been debate in China 's media about the legality , as well as the morality , of this viewpoint .
Should Mao's estate be considered a private or a public fortune ?
Harvard University Prof Roderick MacFarquhar , who has written extensively about Mao , makes another point - the chairman 's conflict of interest .
Mao was a genuine leader , not like those in charge today
Liu Tieying
" The real issue is that the CCP made it possible for Mao to earn royalties in enormous quantities by projecting his cult and prescribing his works , " he told the BBC .
" Since Mao was chairman of the party , it could be suggested that there was a conflict of interest . "
But many Chinese people see no inherent contradiction in a radical , left - wing revolutionary earning millions of dollars in book royalties .
They point out that Mao supposedly gave away much of this money to loyal friends , those who worked with him and the poor .
Liu Tieying , a 55 - year - old former journalist , speaks for many of his generation when he says Mao did not become a leader to make money .
" Mao was a genuine leader , not like those in charge today , " he said .
" He sent his own son to die in the Korean War .
He gave up everything for the revolution . "
January yields debt for HRC , cash for Obama
Hillary Rodham Clinton ended January with $ 7.6 million in debt — not including the $ 5 million personal loan she gave to her campaign in the run-up to the critical Super Tuesday elections , according to financial reports released Wednesday .
In contrast , Democratic rival Barack Obama ’s campaign ’s finances continued to be robust .

He reported raising nearly $ 37 million and spending nearly $ 31 million .
His cash balance was $ 25 million , of which roughly $ 20 million can be spent on the primary .
He reported a comparatively small $ 1 million in debts , owed largely to just three vendors .
The January monthly financial disclosure reports glimpse a behind - the - scenes imbalance that has had a significant impact on the primary contest — one that continues in the days leading up to the critical March 4 primaries in Texas and Ohio .
As the Clinton campaign scrambles for cash , Obama appears on track to raise more than $ 30 million again in February .
Phil Singer , a Clinton spokesman , downplayed the disparity .
“ Thanks to an enormous outpouring of support , we will raise more money this month than in any other so far .
We have all the resources we need to compete and win , ” he said .
But the Clinton report paints a picture of a one - time front - runner under enormous pressure after miscalculating that she would wrap up the nomination before or on Feb .
5 .
According to the reports , Clinton raised about $ 20 million in January , including her loan .
She spent nearly $ 29 million during the month .
She reported a cash balance of $ 29 million .
But more than $ 20 million of that is money dedicated to the general election .
Her personal loan accounts for more than half of the remaining approximately $ 9 million , leaving just about $ 4 million in cash raised from donors .
But even that money is illusionary when measured against the reported $ 7.6 million in debts .
More than $ 2 million of the red ink is owed to chief consultant and adviser , Mark Penn .
But the lengthy laundry list of IOUs also includes unpaid bills ranging from insurance coverage , phone banking , printing and catering at events in Iowa , New Hampshire and California .
Clinton ’s strapped financial situation in late January meant she could n’t invest in all of the Super Tuesday states , particularly the expensive ground operations required in caucus states .
Obama won every one of those caucus contests on Feb. 5 , opening up a critical lead among pledged delegates .
He was also able to launch television advertising earlier than Clinton in subsequent primaries in Virginia , Maryland and Wisconsin and other key states , which ultimately stretched his lead and fueled his momentum today .
The fundraising woes of the Clinton camp have marked a stark turnabout in the historic primary .
The New York senator launched her campaign a year ago with much of the party ’s establishment and financial muscle behind her .
The Illinois senator , meanwhile , built a grass - roots fundraising operation reliant on small givers that continue to fuel him today .
The chink is Clinton ’s financial armor actually predates the latest reports .
Clinton ’s 2007 year - end report showed her owing more than $ 5 million to vendors ranging from phone bank firms and pollsters to charter airline operators and telephone companies .
Her campaign last month dismissed those debts as a matter of bookkeeping .
" These are not true debts accruing by the campaign , but simply unpaid invoices , " said spokesman Blake Zeff .
Zeff pointed out the campaign at the end of 2007 had enough money in the bank to pay off its debts ( it finished the year with $ 13 million on hand after subtracting the debt and contributions earmarked for the general election ) .
" Sometimes invoices are not paid immediately because we need additional information for our records , or to verify expenses , " said Zeff .
But campaign finance experts said the unpaid bills filled a dual strategic purpose : freeing up cash for important up - front expenditures including advertising time , and superficially boosting the campaign 's cash on hand to impress donors and pundits .
This year ’s compressed primary calendar contributed to Clinton ’s financial crunch .
But December ’s debt was evidence of " a cash flow crunch , " said Michael Toner , a former Federal Election Commission chairman who served as general counsel for Republican Fred Thompson 's aborted presidential campaign .
" Nobody fails to pay bills just because they do n't have time .
These are strategic decisions , " Toner said , adding " you put off paying bills when you 've got obligations that require liquidity . "
Not surprisingly , some of Clinton ’s biggest debts are to her top consultants , said Massie Ritsch , a spokesman for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
“ I 'm sure that they 're willing to extend some credit for a time , " said Ritsch .
" Even if she is n't the nominee , she 'll still be a senator and has shown that she can raise plenty of money for her Senate campaigns and can pay off the debt .
But in the short term , you need as much cash as possible . "
The poll on Dec. 2 is being viewed as a referendum on President Vladimir Putin 's popularity .
With Putin 's future plans unclear and the Kremlin recently striking an aggressive international posture , particularly toward the United States , many pundits have speculated that Russia might be bidding to re-establish itself as a global superpower .
But Russia 's military might today does n't remotely compare to the power wielded by the Soviet Union .
German experts on Russia said there 's little reason to worry about a return to the Cold - War - era stand - off between Russia and the West .
" Superpower is the wrong word , " said Hans - Henning Schröder , a professor of eastern European history and politics at the University of Bremen .
" Big power would be more accurate .
The US is in another dimension entirely , and that 's clear to the Russian leadership under Putin as well .
But Russia would like to reach the level of influence of , say , Germany or Great Britain . "
Adherents of the current President have been taking to the streets to show support
Christoph Zürcher , professor of political science at the Free University of Berlin , agreed that it did not make sense to put Russia and the US in the same league .
" Russia is trying to show presence on the international stage , but it's hard to take the idea of bipolarity between Russia and the US very seriously , " he said .
" It would be nice if there were a multi- polar counterweight to American influence in the world .
But that 's not what Russia stands for right now .
They 're pursing national interests . "
Energy plays limited role
Russia 's gas reserves give it power -- especially over its immediate neighbors
Russia 's vast natural resources , particularly natural gas and oil , will give the country increased leverage in coming years .
But the experts do n't think Europe is necessarily overly dependent on Russian energy .
" The role of energy is foreign relations is over - dramatized , " said Alexander Rahr , the director of the Russian - Eurasia Program at the German Council on Foreign Relations .
" Germany only gets 30 percent of its natural gas from Russia ; France only 10 percent .
The lone nations who are truly dependent are Russia 's direct neighbors . "
Schröder agreed that countries such as Georgia , the Baltic republics and Poland could feel pressure from Russia , which in turn could create a problem for the EU .
But " Russia has roughly the same economic power as Italy so it 's actually a fairly small country in this respect , and countries like Germany do n't need to worry too much about possible developments , " he added .
Lack of middle class is biggest problem
The economy is driven by natural resources , while technology lags
Russia is getting richer and currently boasts annual growth rates of up to 7 percent .
But the experts disagreed as to how strong the Russian economy really is -- and how much it may need to diversify from energy production .
" Russia can assume it wo n't be suffering any financial crises in the next 10 years , especially as the energy needs of countries like China are also sure to rise , " Rahr said .
" The biggest problem is the destruction of the middle - class -- that was a mistake that needs correcting . "
Shakespearean drama ?
Russian opposition parties say the election is a farce
There is complete consensus that Sunday 's election is about Putin -- and whether he can retain significant power despite constitutional restrictions .
But the experts stressed that that issue -- at least in the short term -- has more to do with Putin 's relationship with Russia , and vice versa , and less with Putin or Russia 's plans vis -a - vis the world .
" Russia has become arrogant enough to flout international decorum , for instance , by refusing to allow international monitoring , " Zürcher said .
" That 's not so terrible for the rest of the world .
What 's terrible is that Russia is on its way to becoming an unpleasant , semi-authoritarian system . "
" The problem is that all the power is concentrated in the hands of the president , and when he gives up this power and passes it on to his successor , he 's in effect at his successor 's mercy , " Schröder said .
" What Putin is doing is trying to position himself so that he 's unassailable . "
" It 's almost like a Shakespearean drama , " Rahr said .
" A historic figure who is still very popular has to go because of the constitution , but the system requires a strong leader at the top .
That 's also thrown the state into an internal dilemma . "

Support Robert ’s Campaign Against Self - Funded Opponent
Dear Friends ,
It has been a great honor to serve a Democratic Congressman from Palm Beach and Broward Counties .
I have been proud to be at the forefront of so many important battles .
But in fighting these battles , I have also earned my fair share of enemies .
This year I am facing my most difficult re-election campaign ever .
My opponent has pledged to spend one million dollars to defeat me and has already begun using his considerable personal resources to air ads on network television and cable television
He is touring my district making speeches , issuing nasty press releases , and attacking my record in newspaper advertisements and direct mail .
Your contribution will make a crucial difference in my campaign .
Your $ 25 contribution sponsors five Wexler yard signs , $ 50 pays for a letter to 250 voters , $ 100 funds a radio advertisement , and $ 250 will pay for a television advertisement .
With your help , I will return to Congress to continue to be a loud and unyielding voice in support of progressive causes including my recent call for impeachment hearings for Vice President Cheney , finally delivering universal health care , improving education and Medicare , fixing the prescription drug benefit , combating global warming , and finally bringing our troops home from Iraq .
I will also continue to use my position on the Foreign Affairs Committee to advocate for the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel , and protect Israel 's right to security and self defense .
And now , four years after I began my fight for election reforms , I have delivered a paper trail for every vote cast in Florida , and have introduced legislation to take these reforms nationwide .
In addition , Speaker Nancy Pelosi has named me to the Financial Services Committee , where I will focus on finding solutions to the skyrocketing costs of homeowner 's insurance in Florida .
With your help I can continue my work in Washington on the issues we all care so much about .
Please consider supporting my campaign .
With warm regards ,
Robert Wexler
BIOGRAPHY
Robert Wexler is a spirited Democratic Congressman who has developed a national reputation as an aggressive proponent of progressive issues and a bitter critic of President George W. Bush and the war in Iraq .
Wexler is currently serving his sixth term in the United States House of Representatives , where he has proudly represented Florida 's 19th Congressional District since 1996 .
In the past ten years , he has become one of the most articulate and influential Members of Congress , advocating passionately for issues such as improving removing our troops from Iraq , delivering universal heath care coverage , fighting for a meaningful Medicare prescription drug plan for America 's seniors , and working to ensure the safety and security of Israel .
In recent years Wexler has been one of the strongest anti-war voices in the House of Representatives .
During General Petreus ’ September 10th testimony before Congress , Wexler was one of the only Democrats to challenge Administration claims of success in Iraq while pointedly asking Petreus “ how many more men and women will have to be sacrificed ? ” in this misguided war .
Congressman Wexler has voted to deny funding to President Bush for the war in Iraq and in 2005 Wexler was on of only three Members of Congress to vote for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq .
Congressman Wexler has introduced legislation on a wide array of issues , ranging from strengthening gun control , freezing President Bush 's 2001 tax cuts to pay for a Medicare prescription drug plan , comprehensively reforming Florida 's electoral system , ensuring that reservists receive adequate compensation while fighting overseas , and protecting the environment , to calling for an investigation into pre-war intelligence regarding Iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
One of Wexler ’s recent legislative initiatives is to legalize poker and other skill games on the Internet .
In one of the final acts of the GOP controlled Congress , Republicans snuck through legislation that banned many forms of gambling online .
Wexler ’s legislation would undue part of this ban by allowing Americans to once again play poker – a true national pastime – online safely and legally .
Congressman Wexler has advocated his progressive agenda at both the local and national level , including appearances on numerous television programs such as Larry King Live , NBC's Meet the Press and the Today Show and ABC's Nightline .
Congressman Wexler 's reputation as a " rhetorical warrior " and active lawmaker earned him the title of " 50 Most Effective Legislators in Congress " by the influential magazine Congressional Quarterly .
Directly following the aftermath of the 2000 Presidential election , Congressman Wexler initiated comprehensive election reforms nationwide and was a leading sponsor of legislation that would modernize Florida 's election system ; he helped to increase resources for training poll workers and enhanced voter education .
Wexler has worked closely with Florida Governor Charlie Crist to deliver new law in 2007 that guarantees a paper trail for all votes cast in Florida .
Congressman Wexler also serves as Chairman of the Europe Subcommittee on the Committee on Foreign Affairs , and is a co-founder and co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on U.S. - Turkish Relations , the Congressional Taiwan Caucus and the Indonesia Caucus .
He is also an active member of the India Caucus and the Serbia Caucus .
Congressman Wexler has traveled extensively throughout Europe , Asia and the Middle East in an effort to deepen America 's economic , military and political alliances throughout the world .
He also serves on the Taskforce on Anti-Semitism and has been one of the most influential members of Congress in urging the European Union to fight anti-Semitism and promote an atmosphere of religious tolerance in all EU Member States .
Congressman Wexler has also been actively involved in the Middle East and Israel , where he has been a strong supporter of U.S. engagement in the region as a means of finding a lasting and sustainable peace .
As the only Member of the House to attend the signing of the Wye River Peace Agreement and one of two U.S. lawmakers to travel to the International Court of Justice at The Hague , Congressman Wexler has been an outspoken advocate of Middle East peace and Israel 's right to self - defense .
Congressman Wexler serves on the House Judiciary Committee as well as the Internet and Intellectual Property Subcommittee .
He is the co-founder and co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Intellectual Property and Piracy Prevention , and serves as one of the leading voices in Washington for combating piracy and intellectual property violations domestically and abroad .
Wexler was also recently appointed by Speaker Pelosi to serve on the House Financial Services Committee where he will focus on finding solutions to the insurance crisis occurring in Florida .
Prior to being elected to Congress , Wexler served as a State Senator in the Florida Legislature for six years .
He moved to South Florida with his family at 10 years of age from Queens , New York .
Wexler has a B.A. in Political Science from the University of Florida and earned his law degree from George Washington University .
Congressman Wexler and his wife , Laurie , have three children .
~~~~~
An aside : My parents were big supporters of Congressman Wexler .
They happened to live in the same gated senior community in Boca Raton as his mother - in - law .
Needless to say they were surprised when he resigned from Congress , a year before the end of his seventh term , but were excited that he was going to become president of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation , where he would devote his time to working on a resolution of differences between Israel and the Palestinians .
Now , more than a decade later , Israel and the Palestinians are no closer to a resolution of their differences and we are in the midst of a deadly pandemic with an upcoming election between an impeached president and Joe Biden , two vastly different men , a Black female vice president nominee , Black Lives Matter protests , the list goes on and on .
I do n't think my parents would recognize what the US has become if they were still alive .
I sometimes sit here in NYC having a conversation with my mother who was very opinionated about everything .
Recently I called up Agara Rug Cleaning NYC to come pick up several of the antique Oriental carpets I inherited after my parents ' passing .
Normally I get them cleaned each spring , but this spring was cerrtainly not normal here in NYC .
I think my mother would have approved of my choice in carpet cleaners .
The two Isreali brothers who now run the family owned business are meticulous in their treatment of cleaning and restoring antique oriental rugs .
I 've had several of the rugs repaired and you would never know where they were rewoven .
New fring has also been added .
I think they look better than when they were in Florida , but I would never admit that to my departed mother during my imaginary conversations !
I am just glad that Agara Rug Cleaning NYC is still in business .
NYC was really hard hit at the beginning of the Covid 19 pandemic .
Just a note before I finish my " aside " : The Honorable Robert Wexleris still President of the Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation .

ISSUES
WITHDRAWL FROM IRAQ
While I strongly support the brave American soldiers risking their lives in Iraq , I strongly opposed the manner in which President Bush led this nation to war because it weakened the strategic interests and security of the United States .
President Bush stubbornly refuses to end the war in Iraq , and Congress now must step forward and bring our troops home immediately .
I do not believe the United States is more secure in a post - Saddam era , and I blame the President 's lack of post - war planning for the current quagmire threatening American troops , Iraqi citizens and the stability of the Middle East .
Additionally , I am deeply concerned that the Administration 's unilateral , arrogant and hasty approach to war has lessened America 's credibility in the eyes of the world and caused irreparable damage to our international alliances , which has in turn weakened our reconstruction efforts in Iraq and our ability to deter the spread of international terror .
Finally , I am deeply disturbed by the fact that President Bush took America to war on false pretenses , on the basis of fabricated or grossly exaggerated intelligence claims .
I am proud to have been one of the few Democrats willing to take on General Petreus ’ during his September 10th testimony before Congress .
Unfortunately the General failed to answer my question about “ how many more men and women will have to be sacrificed ” in this misguided and tragic war .
I will continue to vote to deny funding to President Bush for the war in Iraq unless a withdrawal in also mandated .
Enough blood has been spilled in this tragically misguided war .

HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE CRISIS
The cost of homeowners insurance has reached crisis proportions and action must be taken at the state and federal levels to bring these costs under control and to make the cost of living in Florida livable for working families .
Although it is true that Florida faces more hurricanes than any other state , this cannot bar Floridians from affording reasonably priced homeowners insurance .
Speaker Pelosi recently added me to the House Financial Services Committee , that has jurisdiction over insurance , so I can focus directly on the Florida insurance crisis .
With that in mind I am working with Speaker Pelosi and Reps.
Ron Klein and Tim Mahoney on federal legislation that will reduce premiums by 30 percent or more .
The plan would be to establish a National Catastrophic Insurance Program that would limit the amount any one insurance company would bear after a large storm .
We would essentially spread the risk of natural disasters over many states cap the insurance industry 's liability .
The savings produced by these changes will be passed on directly to homeowners and the costs of insurance will fall .

PROTECTING OUR HOMELAND
America faces two challenges : how to prevent terrorists from attacking , and how to minimize the loss of life in a terrorist attack .
Both of these involve investing at the local level .
Our police and firefighters - the true front line in our war on terrorism - have been shortchanged for years by President Bush and the previous Republican - led Congress .
Under the new leadership in Congress , Democrats are delivering much needed federal assistance to first responders and other essential personnel and infrastructure that will be required to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks .
Ensuring that our seaports are secure is one of the most pressing security challenges that we face .
Experts acknowledge that an attack from the sea is the most likely avenue of future terrorist efforts .
Democrats in Congress will provide an increase in essential port security funding to better ensure that we can prevent seaborne attacks .

PRO - WOMAN , PRO - CHOICE
From the moment George W. Bush became President ; reproductive freedom has been under constant assault .
More than ever before , the critical 1973 Roe v.
Wade decision is vulnerable due to the recent appointments of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito to the Supreme Court .
Already in April of 2007 , the Supreme Court significantly undermined the constitutional guarantees of Roe v. Wade in the recent Federal Abortion Ban cases .
This decision has essentially given states the freedom to attack safe , legal abortions , without considering the impact on the health of the woman .
I am strongly and loudly pro-choice .
I am proud to have a NARAL Pro-Choice America voting record of 100 percent .
I will continue to be a leader on the House Judiciary Committee in working to pass the Freedom of Choice Act , which would codify Roe v.
Wade into federal law .
In addition , I will speak out against any nominee to the Supreme Court who does not recognize the fundamental right of a woman to have control over her own body .

TAX FAIRNESS FOR ALL AMERICANS
There has been nothing more shameless in modern American history than President Bush 's giveaways to the very wealthy at the expense of working families .
His $ 1.35 trillion tax cut in 2001 and $ 349.7 billion in 2003 have not stimulated the economy , have not created jobs and have not been any appreciable help to most Americans .
However , his tax cuts have pushed the national debt beyond the astronomic level of $ 7 trillion , and will force our children and grandchildren to pay for the greed of this Administration 's high - roller cronies .
The egregious portions of the Bush tax cuts must be rolled back immediately .
+++
AN EDUCATION FOR ALL CHILDREN
The No Child Left Behind Act ?
What an ironic name .
The Bush Administration and the previous Republican majority in Congress have repeatedly under - funded education while putting strict mandates on our schools .
If the federal government is going to hold our hard - working teachers accountable for the performance of students , then Congress must give them the assistance promised in the legislation .
Every child in America deserves access to a top quality education in a public school system .
I will continue to press for sufficient federal funding for those programs that help our communities meet the needs of all children .
Only then will future generations of Americans be able to compete in the 21st Century .

ISRAEL
Since being elected to Congress , one of my top priorities has been to deepen and enhance the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel .
I strongly believe that the United States ’ historic partnership with Israel is critical to stability in an increasingly volatile Middle East , and it is essential that Congress support “ unequivocally ” Israel ’s right to self - defense .
At this difficult time for both nations , I am committed to ensuring that America and Israel stand shoulder - to - shoulder in our common struggle against terror and in pursuit of lasting security and peace .
The United States must speak forcefully in support of Israel in the face of terrorism and rocket attacks ; I was proud to be a cosponsor of House Resolution 921 that reaffirmed the support of the United States for Israel and strongly condemned Hamas and Hezbollah for engaging in their unprovoked attacks on Israel .
As Chairman of the Europe Subcommittee , I recently held a hearing that advocated that Hezbollah be added to the European Union ’s ( EU ) terrorist list .
I also wrote a letter to EU High Representative Javier Solana , signed by 215 Members of Congress , calling on the EU to add Hezbollah to this list , thereby essentially ending the group 's ability to function , organize , and fundraise throughout Europe .
Additionally , in response to the deadly attacks on Israeli city of Sderot , I cosponsored a House Resolution 951 condemning the ongoing Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians by Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist organizations .
I believe the United States and Israel must continue to work jointly to thwart and destroy the terrorist infrastructure of Hezbollah and Hamas .
We must also work hard to counter the destructive policies of the leading state sponsors of terrorism , Syrian and Iran .
Last September , I introduced House Resolution 674 expressing the unequivocal support of the House of Representatives for Israel 's right to self defense in the face of an imminent nuclear or military threat from Syria .
As Israel continues to face significant challenges , the United States must be prepared to support our most important ally in the Middle East .
In working towards that goal , I have cosponsored House Concurrent Resolution 322 recognizing the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel and reaffirming the bonds of close friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel .
My commitment to the US - Israeli partnership will never waiver , and I will lead efforts from my position on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs to ensure that America stands with our closest and most vital ally .

CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS AND ENSURING A PAPER TRAIL
For over five years , I have been aggressively advocating for a paper trail for every ballot cast in the state of Florida and throughout the nation .
This battle led me to file suit against the State of Florida in both State and Federal Court in order to guarantee that all Floridians were treated equally under the law .
My fight to bring a paper trail has succeeded and by the 2008 Presidential election the voting systems in Florida will be a model for the nation .
As you likely know , Governor Charlie Crist recently signed into law a bill that mandates that all Florida voters use optical scan machines that produce a voter verified paper trial .
I am proud that Governor Crist has repeatedly cited my efforts as the primary reason for his support of a paper trail , and I am thankful that the Governor acted in the interest of all Floridians and finally delivered a paper trail for our voters .
Florida has now gone from the disastrous butterfly ballot of 2000 to standing today as a model for the nation in terms of transparency and legitimacy of our elections systems .
Every citizen in Florida can now vote with confidence that their vote will be counted - and counted accurately .
A paper trail was achieved in Florida through constructive cooperation between Republicans and Democrats , the Federal and State governments , citizen activists and government officials .
This is an example of how government should work .
On the federal level , I worked hard to provide significant resources to states , including Florida , to fund elections equipment through the Help America Vote Act .
The law also enacted minimum elections standards and ensured access for disabled voters .
In addition , I am a sponsor of the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility
Act that requires a paper trail on a national level , mandates higher standards for meeting the needs of disabled voters , and enhances the auditing requirements of voting systems and recounts .
If enacted , these vital reforms will be in place before the 2008 Presidential election .

STOPPING DISCRIMINATION OF GAYS AND LESBIANS
It should come as no surprise that George W. Bush is dividing Americans instead of uniting us .
What is surprising is the depths to which he is sinking .
I adamantly oppose his blatantly self - serving support of an amendment to the Constitution defining marriage .
Discrimination should never be part of federal law , let alone our founding document .
To begin classifying some citizens as more free than others is not only a dangerous precedent , but is simply un-American .
All citizens should be free to share their life with the partner of their choice , and all states should be free to determine the civil aspects of that union without interference of the federal government .
I will speak loudly against any attempt in Congress to usurp these rights .
In addition , I will continue to be a sponsor of legislation important to the gay and lesbian community , including the Hate Crimes Prevention Act , the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and the Permanent Partners Immigration Act .

CHENEY IMPEACHEMENT HEARINGS
When there is evidence of abuse of power and illegal actions , it is Congress ' duty to investigate .
I strongly believe that , in the case of the Vice President , there is such evidence and I am pushing for formal hearings to learn the truth .
America expects us to ask hard questions of our leaders , and history shows that we must .
+++
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE
Every American should have access to affordable and heath care coverage .
I strongly support enacting universal heath care coverage .
There is no excuse for the fact that in the richest nation on earth millions of our citizens go without health care .
This a moral burden that we must overcome and should we enact such a system , health care costs will actually go down for all Americans .
It is a true tragedy that more than 47 million Americans go without insurance each year .
Last Congress , I was proud to lend my name in supporting the Universal Health Care bill ( H.R. 676 ) , which would provide health coverage to all Americans .
I am supporting the legislation again this year but the truth is – so long as George Bush remains in the White House the goal of universal heath care remains elusive .
While I look forward to a Democrat in the White House in the year 2008 who will make universal heath care a reality , I am focusing on other ways to provide heath care to uninsured Americans .
For example I have been actively supporting the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) – that provides health insurance to poor children - which the President tragically vetoed .
I have recently sponsored several measures to extend coverage to the uninsured .
These measures help working parents afford heath care and allow uninsured individuals aged 55 to 64 years to buy into Medicare and provides enrollees a 75 percent refundable , advanceable tax credit .
+++
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT
Our obligations to our children do not end at stemming the pace of global warming - we must also work to implement better environmental protections and begin to undo the damage caused by this administration 's willful neglect .
Our air , groundwater , rivers , and oceans are becoming increasingly toxic .
The long - term effects of our polluting are daunting .
As new industries like nano - technology and genetic engineering mature , Congress must stay vigilant and play an active regulatory role to ensure that we avoid the catostrophic environmental mistakes of the past .

LEGALIZATION OF ONLINE POKER AND GAMES OF SKILL
Poker is an uniquely American game , where your hand is determined by chance but winning is determined by your skill .
Presidents and Senators , Members of Congress – we all enjoy Poker .
It is played in the White House and on kitchen tables throughout the country .
Whether you 're playing at home or in cyberspace , Poker is a game won and lost based on the skill of the players .
It is estimated that over seventy million American play poker , and until recently millions pitted their skill against competitors online .
Regrettably , with the passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ( UIGEA ) in September 2006 , playing poker online is now illegal .
It is unfathomable that poker , an American pastime and game of true skill , should be banned for the millions who enjoy playing responsibly .
Poker is not a crime .
This basic fact has gotten lost in a larger battle over the future of online gaming .
Rather than forcing poker players to enjoy this pastime in unregulated websites offshore , we should create a reasonable , controlled system to regulate online poker in much the same way we regulate state lotteries .
I have introduced legislation to restore this reasonable treatment .
My bill , the Skill Game Protection
Act would create a separate definition for games of skill , such as , poker , mah - jong , bridge , chess .
Any game where players compete against each other not “ against the house ” will be legal and regulated .
Americans that are simply playing poker , chess , and other games online are not committing a crime .
They are engaging in a competitive and recreational pastime that does not warrant prohibition .

Wexler Votes to Pay Doctors Fairly for Care of Medicare Patients
House Passes Legislation Improving Medicare
( Washington , DC ) In June , Congressman Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) voted for the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 , which prevents cuts to doctors who serve Medicare patients and ensures that seniors and the disabled have continued access to medical care .
This July , physicians are facing a 10.6 % payment cut for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries , threatening the ability of many patients to afford visits to the doctor .
This legislation stops these upcoming cuts , provides a modest increase for 2008 , and makes several long overdue improvements to Medicare .
“ Forty - four million seniors and disabled individuals depend on Medicare ; and , if this physician payment cut is enacted , the ability of these Americans to simply see a doctor will be in jeopardy .
That is not a risk I am willing to take , ” said Congressman Wexler .
“ As our nation faces significant economic challenges and healthcare costs continue to skyrocket , it has never been more crucial for Congress to ensure that doctors who treat Medicare beneficiaries receive proper compensation for the treatment they provide . ”
In 1997 , Congress passed legislation to control Medicare costs , including payment reductions to physicians .
As healthcare costs have exploded , this formula has mandated deeper cuts in payments to doctors each year .
The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 stops the next scheduled cuts and instead implements a modest increase .
In addition to preventing these cuts , the bill contains several provisions to improve Medicare , including coverage for preventative services , parity for mental health treatments , and more affordable services for low - income seniors and disabled individuals that need extra help to afford even basic care .
H.R. 6331 passed by a vote of 355 to 59 .

Congressman Wexler has been cited as one of the six members of Congress from Florida to receive a 100 % rating from Environment Florida , and environmental advocacy group .

In the 110th Congress they successfully fought to keep our beautiful coasts free of off - shore oil drilling , defend protections for endangered species like the polar bear and the recently recovered bald eagle , and make polluters pay to clean up contaminated groundwater , ” said Environment Florida Field Director Holly Binns in a release .

Wexler attacked for stances on Impeachment , Iraq war
Draws two self - funded challengers into November 's race
Congressman Robert Wexler 's stands in favor of Impeachment Hearings for President Bush and Vice President Cheney as well as his advocacy for ending the war in Iraq have drawn two self - funded challengers who hope to defeat him in November .
Wexler 's Republican opponent has advocated Wexler 's " removal " from office based on his Impeachment movement .
The Independent in the race ( a former - Democrat who left the party during this campaign ) has criticized Wexler 's push to begin withdrawals from Iraq .
The area 's largest newspaper , the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel has also criticized Wexler 's call for hearings , arguing , " it 's nobody 's sworn duty to take up any time to go after a badly battered president with only a few months left in office . "
In response , Congressman Wexler wrote a letter to the Editor that stated , " The Sentinel says impeachment is the wrong " remedy " for this litany of crimes .
What then is the proper remedy ?
A harsh lecture ?
A strongly worded editorial ?
Or how about doing absolutely nothing in the face of these outrageous abuses of power ?
Impeachment hearings need not distract us from other important priorities such as the economy , gas prices and bringing the troops home from Iraq .
Congress can and should address all important issues - including safeguarding our constitutional rights and obligations . "

Wexler Opposes FISA Compromise
Legislation Threatens Constitutional System of Checks and Balances
6/20/2008
( Washington , DC ) Today , Congressman Wexler ( D - FL ) issued the following statement regarding H.R. 6304 , the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 :
" I am strongly opposed to H.R. 6304 .
There is simply no way to get around three simple facts about this bill .
One , it creates a path for surveillance requests to avoid court review , and it is naïve to assume that if court review is optional , that courts would ever be a meaningful part of the process .
Two , with minimal protections for over - broad searches outside the US , we are virtually guaranteed that Americans citizens in the US – with no connection to terrorism whatsoever – will be included in the surveillance .
And three , the judicial review of lawsuits against telephone and Internet companies is written to create no possibility of a legitimate review and ensure that the immunity sought by the President is a predetermined outcome .
" I greatly respect the earnest efforts of Members to find common ground on this most critical issue , but I respectfully believe that Congress is better off not acting if the only way to find common ground is by digging the grave of our Constitution .
" The March 14th House bill preserved court review without bogging down surveillance requests or somehow hampering our nation ’s intelligence operations .
" We need to remember that under FISA , surveillance requests go to a specially designed court ( FISC ) with over 30 years of experience .
The FISC should be allowed to keep full and appropriate review of the particular circumstances in each case as it has since 1978 .
I do not understand how a court could make any meaningful determination for a whole surveillance programs and the minimization procedures without considering who , what or where will be tapped – as H.R. 6304 would allow .
" It is perfectly possible for a court to examine surveillance requests in a timely manner , and there have always been allowances made for urgent surveillance .
There is no need to allow the Administration to skip that by unilaterally declaring that “ without immediate implementation of an authorization , intelligence important to the national security of the United States may be lost or not timely acquired . ”
" Essentially , H.R. 6304 restores the oversight that has been missing in the President ’s illegal wiretapping program -- and with the same pen destroys it completely . "

The site moderator of waffles .fm , the invite - only replacement to OiNK , on Friday tells THREAT LEVEL that the illicit music - sharing site already has some 1,700 exclusive members in less than 24 hours of sporadic operation .
Thousands of invitees are waiting in the wings , as registration is tentatively closed because of server capacity , says site moderator Dead1 , who in an exclusive interview with THREAT LEVEL spoke on condition that his real name not be published .
" We ’ve closed invites due to the extreme amount of traffic , " Dead1 says .
Many of those invited were former members of OiNK , he says , and thousands of torrents are being uploaded and seeded .
" We were getting upwards of 100 torrents a minute uploaded , " Dead1 says .
The site , running on servers in Amsterdam ’s Ripe Network Data Center , was the subject of a denial of service attack following its initial launch Thursday , says Dead1 .
The DoS attack was at 90 MB / s per second , he says .
" That ’s pretty big .
Whoever did it was pretty pissed off , to put it politely , " Dead1 says .
" They said they were upset they were n’t sent an invite . "
The response to waffles from the BitTorrent community has been overwhelming , he says .
When the site went live Thursday , it crashed after its servers were clogged by a barrage of 300 registration requests a minute .
" It ’s unbelievable , " Dead1 says .
The music - sharing - only site , launched nearly two weeks after British authorities raided and shuttered its predecessor OiNK , is a non-profit operation run by a network of 10 people in their twenties or younger , Dead1 says .
" It ’s purely a hobby , " he says .
" It ’s for fun . "
" Most of the staff is in Europe .
A couple are in America .
A few are in Canada , " he adds .
" They ’re scattered everywhere . "
Dead1 says waffles will attempt to follow in OiNK ’s footsteps and is not affiliated with any other torrent - tracking site .
" When the link went down , everybody was pretty pissed , " he says .
The site is looking to upgrade its servers again , Dead1 says .
For now , the site runs off two server boxes , each with 3 gigahertz , dual core Pentium processors , and 4 GBs of RAM , he says .
" We ’re not doing this for the pirated material .
You can get that anywhere , " Dead1 says .
" We ’re doing it to increase the popularity of artists everywhere no matter who they are . "

Paulo Coelho , the best - selling author of " The Alchemist " , is using BitTorrent and other filesharing networks as a way to promote his books .
His publishers were n't too keen on giving away free copies of his books , so he 's taken matters into his own hands .
Coelho ’s view is that letting people swap digital copies of his books for free increases sales .
In a keynote speech ( embedded below ) at the Digital , Life , Design conference in Munich he talked about how uploading the Russian translation of “ The Alchemist ” made his sales in Russia go from around 1,000 per year to 100,000 , then a million and more .
He said :
In 2001 , I sold 10,000 hard copies .
And everyone was puzzled .
We came from zero , from 1000 , to 10,000 .
And then the next year we were over 100,000 . [… ]
I thought that this is fantastic .
You give to the reader the possibility of reading your books and choosing whether to buy it or not . [… ]
So , I went to BitTorrent and I got all my pirate editions …
And I created a site called The Pirate Coelho .
He ’s convinced â€ ” and rightly so â€ ” that letting people download free copies of his books helps sales .
For him the problem is getting around copyright laws that require him to get the permission of his translators if he wants to share copies of his books in other languages .
So is Coelho just seeding torrents of his books ?
That ’s just the beginning .
He took it one step further and , as quoted above , set up a WordPress blog , Pirate Coelho , where he posts links to free copies of his books on filesharing networks , FTP sites , and so on .
He says it had a direct impact on sales :
Believe it or not , the sales of the book increased a lot thanks to the Pirate Coelho site …
In his speech he talks about how the Internet is changing language and books , and how online “ piracy ” and BitTorrent have helped him not only be more widely read , but also sell more books !
It ’s a must watch .

You Say 9/11 Was an Inside Job ?
There ’s Nothing I Can Do About
It . . . or Is There ?
Most people I talk to believe 9/11 was an inside job .
I talk to everyone , cab drivers , limo drivers , phone solicitors , etc. etc .
The overwhelming majority think 9/11 was an inside job perpetrated by our government .
HOWEVER , almost as many shrug and give me comments along the lines of “ it does n’t matter what I do . ”
Let me tell you a story about what one person can do .
A few months after 9/11 I began to learn a lot about the failures of the US Air Force and FAA to do their job on 9/11 while four commercial jet liners flew over the most protected airspace in the human history crashing planes into buildings ; US Army training of the alleged hijackers ; insider stock trades against American and United Airlines the day before 9/11 by a CIA connected financial institution ; etc. etc .
I began collecting emails for every fire department and firemen 's union , all their officers , etc. etc. and emailing these 9/11 questions out to firemen across the US , Canada , and beyond .
I then began standing outside a Unity church in Kansas City on Sundays , and on a busy city corner during the week , with a poster reading , “ What is Bush Hiding About 9/11 ?
Stop the 9/11 Cover Up ! ”
One day a Kansas City Fire Department hook and ladder truck honked at me , and all the Firemen cheered , and gave me a thumbs up .
One day a woman stopped and joined me .
Then another woman , I ’d never met , joined me .
Today one of those women is the executive director of 911 Truth.org .
Together we invited 9/11 widow Ellen Mariani and her attorney Phil Berg ( former Deputy Atty . General of Pennsylvania ) to speak at four churches in Kansas City on their lawsuit accusing members of the Bush admin .
with complicity in the 9/11 attacks , under a RICO racketeering lawsuit .
We were covered by all the major media that day , and spoke at several churches including an event with nearly 1,000 attendees .
The Kansas City police said they ’d monitored our website , and saw so much activity that they sent a police escort to follow us all day long .
I also began emailing 9/11 facts out .
One day I woke up to several hundred emails from angry Canadians wanting more information about 9/11 , because they ’d read my email address in a major Canadian newspaper regarding 9/11 as an inside job .
The Canadian ’s were n’t angry at me , they were angry that the US government had lied them into sacrificing their brothers , sons , and fathers into a war in Afghanistan .
With these email addresses , which I collected , I began sending out “ 9/11 truth action alerts ” via email .
My list grew to thousands , and many of them had lists which reached perhaps hundreds of thousands of others .
We began sending out 9/11 truth facts along with email addresses to thousands of media contacts worldwide , encouraging all to email the media demanding 9/11 questions be asked and answered .
One day I got an email from an Australian newspaper begging to be taken off the media list , because they were getting hammered by emails from people worldwide demanding they investigate 9/11 .
We began sending out 9/11 truth facts to everyone we knew with a list of every United Nations permanent mission for every country in the world .
A few days later when Bush addressed the UN to sell his endless war on terror , one of the first things he said to the UN members , was , “ do n’t believe these outrageous conspiracy theories . ”
Ashcroft warned us after 9/11 they ’d be reading our emails .
Apparently he was n’t lying .
Because of my emails , etc. , a Seattle peace group invited me to speak on 9/11 in Seattle .
I flew up and spoke .
There I met a man who ’s birthday was on 9/11 , and because of that , after the attacks he smelled that the US would use that date as a war propaganda tool , so he bought up a bunch of urls related to his birthday , including www.Septembereleventh.org .
With that we began National 911 Visibility , which soon became International 911 Visibility .
We pioneered a website where local groups could connect with other groups to fight for 9/11 truth on a local and global scale .
It 's become borderline amusing , though I scurry to stress the borderline angle .
We have in the White House either a dangerous moron or a heinous liar , or perhaps he 's even a twofer .
And that seems to be the Great Debate of Era :
Is our president an epic halfwit , or Nixon squared , or some fantastic combination of the two not seen since Nero ?
Yet whichever of those limited possibilities his character happens to be , the joke 's on us .
Our Great Debate -- or what should be a great debate , one leading to a great resolution -- is nothing but a piddling parlor game .
We and our elected representatives sit and ponder and at times even chuckle over Mr. Bush 's increasingly tangled and twisted lies , delivered with decreasing competency , and repeatedly conclude that he 's too stupid or too corrupt to sit at the apex of power .
While we 're doing that , however , Mr. Bush is collapsing in incredulous joy and relief that there quite obviously is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- he can do that will lead Congress to the water of serious investigations and , consequently , and , inescapably , impeachment .
In short , while we and Congress are laughing our asses off at his vile stupidity , he 's laughing his ass off at our vile timidity .
The latest presidential spectacle will someday have historians in stitches .
From the bowels of the Bush 43 Presidential Library , one will hear the raucous laughter of researchers , interrupted only by disbelieving giggling and the occasional , " And this idiot really got away with this crap ?
Two friggin entire terms of this friggin insanity ? "
Insanity , indeed .
And yes , he got away with it .
And yes , the joke was on us -- and on any remnants of systemic checks and balances and legislative oversight and investigative doggedness and all that other tedious constitutional stuff .
The latest spectacle to which I painfully refer with a touch of amusement was and is , of course , Mr. Bush & Staff 's laughable contortions over what he knew , with epistemological verifiability , and when he knew it -- with some emphasis on the additional question of what he 's capable of knowing .
The president first would have had us believe that his grimly somber director of national intelligence just happened to pop by the Oval Office one morning in August and just happened to mention a " great discovery " about the supposedly greatest threat to our national survival since the development of TV sitcoms like " My Mother the Car , " yet the idiot of the first part did n't happen to say , " Huh ? "
But , even after lo these many years of much - ballyhooed presidential incuriosity , that failed to pass the laugh test .
Questions were asked .
Inquiries were made .
Is , was , he really that intellectually catatonic ?
So White House fax machines whirled in defensive clarification and somebody wound up misspokeswoman Dana Perino .
The machines spewed no , no , no , the DNI had , in fact , informed the clueless one that " Iran does in fact have a covert weapons program , but it may be suspended , " meaning Iran does have a weapons program , except maybe it does n't .
Meanwhile the automaton of Ms. Perino spewed that the DNI had cautioned the president that " the new information might cause the intelligence community to change its assessment of Iran 's covert nuclear program , but the intelligence community was not prepared to draw any conclusions at that point in time , and it would n’t be right to speculate until they had time to examine and analyze the new data . "
And what the DNI meant by that , implicitly according to Ms. Perino , was that it was wholly acceptable for the president to then go out and draw the conclusion based on his own speculations that Iran 's probably nonexistent nuclear weapons program threatened us all with the nuclear apocalypse of a World War III .
Got it .
Thanks for clearing that up .
Now , one might think that Congressional types might be all over this public - policy oddity like Oprah on Obama , but -- drumroll -- they are n't .
Here we had a president of these here United States thrashing about , frightening church ladies and thrusting right wingers into bellicose orgasms , spewing personal speculations about a thermonuclear war that was as fantastically unbelievable as the dire and global threat of Saddam Hussein -- and it was , of course , all buncombe .
And he knew it .
But , responds Congress , that 's the way it goes .
It 's just Mad Ludwig at it again .
Heaven forfend we should take this dangerous idiot down , and out .
Our electoral prospects are of much greater concern than the launching of proper constitutionalities , or even the very real prospect that this profoundly dangerous idiot could yet transmogrify into something even more tangibly dangerous -- again .
The joke is indeed on us -- the Great Debate that never was ; fellatio is a national crisis , while manufactured hysteria over a manufactured war is not -- although I doubt the Founders are laughing .

David Sirota has catalogued just how petrified the GOP punditocracy is of Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee 's populist rhetoric , especially now that it appears to have * gasp * appeal to Republican voters .
And he was right , because they 're now on the attack :
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
On Friday 's Countdown , Keith spoke to WaPo's EJ Dionne about the rising rhetoric to get Huckabee to toe the party line of indifference to the poor and tax cuts for the very , very wealthy .
The press focuses on his appeal to the evangelical voters , ignoring that Huckabee is also saying the things that matter to the average Republican .
What irony .
The GOP has spent the last sixty years trying to disenfranchise the common man from feeling like they have any importance on a national platform and reinforcing that corporations supercede the individual citizens , culminating in their perfect Manchurian president GWB and this is the thanks they get ?
A populist Republican ???
Do n't look now , but Mike Huckabee looks in line to get a few more delegates today when Wyoming Republicans hold their non-RNC - sanctioned primary .
Several blog posts ago , I observed that many popular songs have nonsense lyrics .
So I asked readers to submit random lyrics that could be strung together to create a hit song that means absolutely nothing .
German band RIVO DREI took it one step further by putting the best random lyrics together , writing the music , and performing it .
Now the final piece falls into place .
Dilbert Blog reader Jem8472 , who wishes to be otherwise anonymous , has created the music video and posted it to youtube .
http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=TiH9dbAsAp0
The funniest thing about this whole exercise is that it works .
You can convince yourself the lyrics mean something to someone , they sound great put to music , and the music video is completely entertaining .
If you know any musicians , send them a copy so they can see how it is done .
Science courses nearly extinct in elementary grades , study finds
Time constraints and demands of testing force teachers to give subject less attention , study says
The third - graders looked puzzled when asked what they liked best about science .
No answer .
OK , then , next question : " What is science ? " a visitor asked the children in a hallway at Bessie Carmichael Elementary School in San Francisco .
" Science is like art , " said Manuel , 7 , who let that cryptic response hang in the air as he ducked away .
He might have meant that both can open the heart to beauty .
Or maybe he was saying that science , like art , is something students do n't get much of these days in elementary school .
If it were the latter , a new survey of 923 Bay Area elementary school teachers would agree .
About 80 percent of those teachers said they spent less than an hour each week teaching science , according to researchers from the Lawrence Hall of Science at UC Berkeley and from WestEd , an education think tank based in San Francisco .
In contrast , a national study seven years ago found elementary school science instruction averaged more than two hours per week , said Rena Dorph , the lead researcher on the new study .
" It 's alarming because it 's a very short amount of time per week dedicated to a subject that 's considered a core subject in schools , " said Dorph , who is director of the Center for Research , Evaluation and Assessment at the Lawrence Hall of Science .
Understanding science helps children learn to think and solve problems while questioning the world around them , Dorph said .
There is also evidence that people who go into scientific fields generally learned to love science as children , she said .
And as a practical matter , colleges require applicants to have taken science in high school .
" And how are you going to understand high school science if you have n't had it before fifth grade ? "
Dorph asked .
Her research team - reviewing responses from more than 80 Bay Area school districts as well as the teachers - made other sobering findings about elementary science instruction in Bay Area schools :
-- About 16 percent of the elementary teachers said they spent no time on science at all .
( Most taught at schools that had missed the reading and math benchmarks of No Child Left Behind and were trying to catch up . )
-- Most kindergarten to fifth - grade students typically had science instruction no more than twice a week .
--
Ten times as many teachers said they felt unprepared to teach science ( 41 percent ) than felt unprepared to teach math ( 4 percent ) or reading ( 4 percent ) .
-- Fewer than half of Bay Area fifth - graders ( 47 percent ) scored at grade level or above on last spring 's California Standards
Test in science .
( Only fifth - graders are tested in science at the elementary level . )
" The demands of No Child Left Behind have made it almost impossible to devote enough time to science , " said Melinda Dart , a fourth - grade teacher at Wilson Elementary School in Daly City 's Jefferson Elementary District .
Dart was not among the anonymous hundreds surveyed by the researchers .
But she agrees with the findings .
Dart is planning a field trip to the Exploratorium in December and is preparing her students by teaching them about electricity and magnets .
In one lesson , she had them rub balloons with various materials so they would see the effects of positive and negative charges .
But she has had time for only three 30 - minute science lessons since the semester began .
" It 's very rushed , " she said .
" In order to develop a scientific way of thinking , the thing you need most is time .
And in our test - driven schools today , time for experimenting and exploring is what we have the least of . "
In San Francisco , Principal Jeffrey Burgos of Bessie Carmichael Elementary agreed - but said teachers can find ways to be creative beyond the limited time already set aside for science .
" You do n't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that you can't get everything into one day , " which is about five hours of instructional time , he said .
So you shoehorn it in , sneaking science into reading and math lessons .
Second - grade teacher Bernadette Ison is a master at that .
Her classroom at Bessie Carmichael is filled with children who are learning English and who come from lower - income families - just the kind of challenges that policymakers say is why basic reading and math should trump science and social studies .
" So we integrate science into our literacy , " Ison said .
" Our reading curriculum is called " Nature Walk , " and we have a theme called " Animals . "
On Friday , the students will take a nature walk around Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park .
Afterward , they 'll write an essay on what they saw and learned , Ison said .
This year , the California Board of Education has purchased new elementary science textbooks and materials that are just now reaching classrooms .
The reviews have been mixed .
Some teachers said the materials were clearer than what they replaced , though they covered less ground .
Others said they were overwhelming .
One teacher counted 1,199 pages in the teachers ' edition science workbooks , as well as flip charts , four large boxes of materials , vocabulary and concept cards , CDs and DVDs .
Perhaps it 's no wonder that teachers have little time to teach it all .
They barely have time to learn it themselves .
The other day , the textbook company came to the Jefferson Elementary District in Daly City to show teachers how to use all the new stuff , said third - grade teacher Janet Harrison .
The textbook instructors stayed 90 minutes , Harrison said .
And then they were gone .

One frustrating aspect of the Radiohead pay - what - you - want experiment is the lack of definitive numbers — yet .
ComScore says this , Radiohead says that , the record industry says this , the artists say that .
The Radiohead experiment is now old news , but that does n’t mean others will not attempt their own experiments .
Following in the footsteps of Radiohead , Steve Hofstetter , an up and coming comedian with a strong Internet following among high school and college - age kids , has released his latest album “ The Dark Side of the Room ” on his Website .
He ’s believed to be the first comedian to take a pay - what - you - want approach .
Hofstetter ’s last CD , “ Cure For the Cable Guy ” , reached No. 20 on the Billboard comedy charts , and he ’s performed on VH1 , Showtime , ESPN , and others , as well as his work being available at his Website and on YouTube .
He ’s extremely popular on MySpace and Facebook with hundreds of thousands of friends .
Hofstetter is no Radiohead , mind you , but it ’s interesting to see all sorts of known , somewhat - known , and unknown artists experiment with the pay - what - you - want model .
What ’s nice is that Hofstetter has provided real numbers :
He currently is averaging about $ 6 an album , including freeloaders .
That ’s more than triple what his royalty would be if this we released by a label .
He currently is averaging about $ 6 an album , including freeloaders .
That ’s more than triple what his royalty would be if this we released by a label .
The most common price paid is $ 9.95 , what the album would cost on iTunes .
Unlike Radiohead , Hofstetter has his fans choose between various payment levels — 1 cent ( I wish it were free ! ) to $ 4.95 ( a bargain ! ) to $ 8.95 ( save a buck ) to $ 29.95 ( big tipper ! ) and everything in between .
Only the $ 9.95 and up sales count towards charting .
Even with that , Hofstetter says , he expects to reach between # 10 and # 15 on the comedy charts in the first week .
In the first two days of sales , Hofstetter says he has made more money than he did in the first two weeks of his last album .
Hofstetter tells his fans , “ I have always been thankful for the way the Internet has allowed me to reach people , and for the support those people have given me .
So pay what you want for my new album , all the way down to one penny .
Figure out what it ’s worth to you — and I hope it can be that quality product that you ’re looking for . ”

The study said the syndrome affects more men than women
The findings , published in the Hong Kong Medical Journal , were based on 23 cases of people who suffered mahjong - induced seizures .
The report 's four authors , from Hong Kong 's Queen Mary Hospital , said the best prevention - and cure - was to avoid playing mahjong .
The study led the doctors to define mahjong epilepsy as a unique syndrome .
Epileptic seizures can be provoked by a wide variety of triggers , but one cause increasingly evident to researchers is the playing - or even watching - of mahjong .
This Chinese tile game , played by four people round a table , can involve gambling and quickly becomes compulsive .
Demanding
The game , which is intensely social and sometimes played in crowded mahjong parlours , involves the rapid movement of tiles in marathon sessions .
The doctors conclude that the syndrome affects far more men than women ; that their average age is 54 ; and that it can hit sufferers anywhere between one to 11 hours into a mahjong game .
They say the attacks were not just caused by sleep deprivation or gambling stress .
Mahjong is cognitively demanding , drawing on memory , fast calculations , concentration , reasoning and sequencing .
The distinctive design of mahjong tiles , and the sound of the tiles crashing onto the table , may contribute to the syndrome .
The propensity of Chinese people to play mahjong also deserves further study , the doctors say .
What is certain though , is that the only sure way to avoid mahjong epilepsy , is to avoid mahjong , which for many people is easier said than done .
America is a success - minded nation .
Perseverance is practically a national resource .
Posters of mountain climbers that read “ Winners Never Quit , and Quitters Never Win ” might as well be state - mandated signage in grade - school classrooms .
But new research suggests that success — or more specifically , the persistence required to achieve hard - to - reach goals — may not be worth it .
In a paper published in the September issue of the journal Psychological Science , Gregory Miller of the University of British Columbia and Carsten Wrosch of Concordia University found that teenage girls who are unable to disengage themselves from trying to attain hard - to - reach goals exhibited increased levels of the inflammatory molecule C- reactive protein ( C.R.P. ) , which in adults is linked with diabetes , heart disease and early aging .
“ There ’s this traditional idea in Western culture and science literature that being persistent is good , that if you work hard , you can achieve anything , ” says Miller , who has published several papers with Wrosch on the psychology of quitting .
“ Our take is that persistence is good , but there are times where the most adaptive thing is to say , ‘ This goal is not going to work out . ’ ”
At the outset of their experiment , Miller and Wrosch asked each teenage subject what would count for her as adversity and what would count as success .
Then the researchers tracked how the young women dealt with their own setbacks and adversity over the course of a year .
What mattered , it turned out , was not whether the subjects achieved success but what they had to endure to get there .
“ We found that the girls who were best able to disengage when a goal became difficult or unattainable are those who have constant levels of C.R.P. , ” Miller says .
Teenagers who persisted — even if they eventually attained their goals — had significantly elevated levels .
“ Success in some cases is going to be costly , ” he adds .
None of this is to say that persistence is a bad thing — just that too much of it can be unhealthy .
“ The million - dollar question , ” Miller says , “ is where that exact tipping point is . ”

In George Lucas ’ film THX 1138 ( 1970 ) , the police in a futuristic state make citizens compliant by shocking them with “ pain prods . ”
After seeing the movie , I remember thinking that if the police were ever allowed to use implements such as these , we would rapidly move into a police state .
This has now happened with tasers .
Tasers are electro - shock weapons that are currently used by more than 11,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States .
Designed to cause instant incapacitation by delivering a 50,000 - volt shock , tasers are hand - held electronic stun guns that fire two barbed darts .
The darts , which usually remain attached to the gun by wires , deliver a high voltage shock and can penetrate up to two inches of clothing or skin .
The darts can strike the subject from a distance of up to 35 feet , or the taser can be applied directly to the skin .
Although a taser shot is capable of jamming the central nervous system for up to 30 seconds , it can disable the subject for even longer .
And because tasers can be aimed anywhere on the body , they can immobilize someone more easily than pepper spray , which must be sprayed in the face .
Taser manufacturers and police agencies insist that tasers are a safer alternative to many conventional weapons typically used to restrain dangerous individuals .
This may be true in situations where tasers are used as an alternative to other impact weapons that can cause serious injury , such as batons or lethal force .
However , research shows that in many police departments , officers routinely use tasers primarily as a substitute for low - level force weapons such as pepper spray or chemical spray .
Tasers have become a prevalent force tool , often used against individuals who pose no serious danger to themselves , the officers or others .
Amnesty International reports that in instances where tasers are used , 80 % of the time they are used on unarmed suspects .
In 36 % of the cases , they are used for verbal non-compliance , but only 3 % of the time for cases involving “ deadly assault . ”
Since 2001 , over 300 cases indicate that tasers exacerbate health issues and accelerate death .
In November 2003 , a mentally disabled man was tasered by Georgia police a total of six times for violating a home detention order .
Hours later , he died in jail .
Incredibly , police officers have tasered pregnant women , even when they are fully aware of their pregnancies .
In 2001 , Cindy Grippi was tasered in the back for entering her house against the instructions of police officers , despite the fact that she was not engaging in any truly disruptive or criminal behavior .
As a result , Grippi fell onto her stomach and recounts that she “ felt a sharp pain in her abdomen as the taser struck her . ”
Hours later , doctors diagnosed Grippi with “ fetal demise , ” and she delivered a stillborn child .
Tianesha Robinson was tasered by police officers in 2006 for resisting arrest during a traffic stop .
Days later , she suffered a miscarriage .
In Colorado , a man was repeatedly tasered in the genitals for “ resisting ” after being handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car .
In 2003 , an imprisoned African - American woman was asked to remove all her jewelry .
When she asked for a mirror to help remove her eyebrow ring , she was pepper sprayed and tasered .
The tasering caused her to “ fall to the ground and lose control of her bladder .
While on the ground , a male officer forcibly removed her eyebrow ring with pliers .
She was left in her urine for several hours without being given anything to clean herself with . ”
In August 2007 , a man was tasered while holding an infant–causing him to drop the child on its head .
Police using tasers are supposedly trained to press the trigger lightly to guarantee that the shock lasts no longer than five seconds .
However , there are numerous cases in which police officers have continued to press down on their triggers in hopes of elongating the shot and maximizing pain .
In other cases , police officers have continued to shock individuals repeatedly , despite the fact that the first shock achieved their goal of thoroughly immobilizing the target .
In 2003 , an elderly blind woman , who was also extremely hard of hearing , was struck by a taser three times for failing to respond to police officers .
As a result of the taser shocks to her back and the pepper spray to her face , the woman ’s prosthetic right eye was ultimately dislodged from its socket .
The use of tasers by police raises a number of concerns for the protection of human rights .
Portable and easy to use , with the capacity to inflict severe pain at the push of a button without leaving substantial marks , tasers are obviously open to abuse by officers .
Their use often violates standards set out under the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials , which requires that force be used as a last resort and that only the minimum amount necessary be used .
Taser International , the company that manufactures and sells the stun guns , has sold them primarily to law enforcement agencies .
The company has sold several hundred thousand to such agencies nationwide .
However , since 1994 , slightly less powerful tasers have been sold to the general public .
This development is truly alarming .
Silent and instantly crippling , the taser is an ideal weapon for criminals to assist them in robbery , rape , abduction , etc .
An attacker can now carry his own personal victim - paralyzing device , powerful enough to instantly incapacitate the victim and give the attacker complete control .
Tasers are also ripe for sadistic use .
For example , in January 2008 , a man in Albany , N.Y. , was sentenced to 46 months in prison and 24 months of probation for using a 30,000 - volt stun gun on his 18 - month - old son during a game of peek - a - boo .
He claimed that he “ wanted his child to be tough …to be the toughest cage fighter ever . ”
It is impossible to remain untroubled by these words , as well as the image of a father purposefully torturing his defenseless child .
The Social Services caseworker who investigated the situation said , “ The look in the child ’s eyes will not easily be forgotten . ”
Clearly , the use of tasers should be suspended immediately –or at least until a comprehensive medical study can be conducted proving they are safe to the general public when used by police officers .
And the police must by law be severely restricted in their use .
Otherwise , we are opening the door for rampant abuse and police state tactics .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is set to join hedge - fund firm Paulson & Co. as an adviser , The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday .
New York - based Paulson , with assets of $ 28 billion , is set to make the announcement on Tuesday , the report said .
Greenspan has been criticized by some for keeping the trendsetting federal funds rate at a low 1 percent from June 2003 through June 2004 , which some say contributed to a housing bubble that is now bursting .
Until late October , the accepted explanation about the Sept. 6 Israeli air strike in Syria , constructed in a series of press leaks from U.S. officials , was that it was prompted by dramatic satellite intelligence that Syria was building a nuclear facility with help from North Korea .
But new satellite evidence has discredited that narrative , suggesting a more plausible explanation for the strike : that it was a calculated effort by Israel and the United States to convince Iran that its nuclear facilities could be attacked as well .
The narrative promoted by neoconservatives in the George W. Bush administration began to unravel in late October with the release by a private company of a series of satellite images showing that the same square , multistory building that was hit by Israeli planes Sept. 6 had been present on the site four years earlier .
Although the building appears to be somewhat farther along in the August 2007 image , it showed that the only major new developments at the site since September 2003 were what appears to be a pumping station on the Euphrates and a smaller secondary structure .
Media reports based on leaks from administration officials had suggested that the presence of a water pump indicated that the building must have been a nuclear reactor .
But Jeffrey Lewis , a specialist on nuclear technology at the New America Foundation , pointed out in an interview with IPS that the existence of a water pump cannot be taken as evidence of the purpose of the building , since other kinds of industrial buildings would also need to pump water .
The campaign of press leaks portraying the strike as related to an alleged nuclear weapons program assisted by North Korea began almost immediately after the Israeli strike .
On Sept. 11 , a Bush administration official told the New York Times that Israel had obtained intelligence from " reconnaissance flights " over Syria showing " possible nuclear installations that Israeli officials believed might have been supplied with material from North Korea . "
The Bush administration officials leaking this account to the press , obviously aligned with Vice President Dick Cheney , were hoping to shoot down the administration ’s announced policy , pushed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , of going ahead with an agreement to provide food and fuel aid to North Korea in exchange for the dismantling of its nuclear program .
They had lost an earlier battle over that policy and were seeking to use the Israeli strike story as a new argument against it .
The officials did not want the intelligence community involved in assessing the alleged new evidence , suggesting that they knew it would not withstand expert scrutiny .
Glenn Kessler reported in the Washington Post Sept. 13 that the " dramatic satellite imagery " provided by Israel had been restricted to " a few senior officials " and not disseminated to the intelligence community , on orders from National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley .
The intelligence community had opposed a previous neoconservative effort in 2002 - 2003 to claim evidence of a Syrian nuclear program at the same site .
A senior U.S. intelligence official confirmed to the New York Times on Oct. 30 that U.S. intelligence analysts had been aware of the Syrian site in question " from the beginning "  meaning from before 2003  but had not been convinced that it was an indication of an active nuclear program .
In 2002 , John Bolton , then undersecretary of state for arms control and international security , wanted to go public with an accusation that Syria was seeking a nuclear weapons program , but the intelligence community rejected the claim .
A State Department intelligence analyst had called Bolton ’s assertion that Syria was interested in nuclear weapons technology " a stretch " and other elements of the community also challenged it , according to a Senate Foreign Relations Committee report .
The attack on the site was an obvious demonstration of Israel ’s military dominance over Syria , generally considered a vital ally of Iran by Israeli and U.S. officials .
It was also in line with the general approach of using force against Syria that Cheney and his allies in the administration had urged on Israel before and during the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon in summer 2006 .
During the war , Deputy National Security Adviser Elliott Abrams told a senior Israeli official that the Bush administration would not object if Israel " chose to extend the war beyond to its other northern neighbor , " leaving no doubt he meant for Israel to attack Syria , IPS reported last December .
David Wurmser ’s wife , Meyrav Wurmser , director of the neoconservative Hudson Institute ’s Center for Middle East Policy , told Israel ’s YNet News in December 2006 that " many parts of the American administration believed that Israel should have fought against the real enemy , which is Syria and not Hezbollah . "
She said such an attack on Syria would have been " such a harsh blow for Iran that it would have weakened it and changed the strategic map in the Middle East . "
Both Israeli and U.S. officials dropped hints soon after the Israeli raid that it was aimed at sending a message to Iran .
Ten days after the raid , Israeli military intelligence chief Amos Yadlin declared to a parliamentary committee , " Israel ’s deterrence has been rehabilitated since the Lebanon war , and it affects the entire regional system , including Iran and Syria . "
Although he did not refer explicitly to the strike in Syria , the fact that the Syrian raid was the only event that could possibly have been regarded as restoring Israel ’s strategic credibility left little doubt as to the meaning of the reference .
That same day , Reuters quoted an unnamed U.S. Defense Department official as saying that the significance of the strike " was not whether Israel hit its targets , but rather that it displayed a willingness to take military action . "
On Sept. 18 , former United Nations ambassador John Bolton was quoted by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency as saying , " We ’re talking about a clear message to Iran  Israel has the right to self - defense  and that includes offensive operations against WMD facilities that pose a threat to Israel .
The United States would justify such attacks . "
On Oct. 7 , Washington Post columnist David Ignatius , who enjoys access to top administration officials , quoted an unnamed official as providing the official explanation for the Israeli attack as targeting " nuclear materials supplied to Syria by North Korea . "
But then , without quoting the official directly , Ignatius reported the official ’s description of the raid ’s implicit message : " [ T ] he message to Iran is clear : America and Israel can identify nuclear targets and penetrate air defenses to destroy them . "
The official ’s suggestion that the strike was a joint U.S. - Israeli message about a joint policy toward striking Iran ’s nuclear sites was the clearest indication that the primary objective of the strike was to intimidate Iran at a time when both Israel and the Cheney faction of the Bush administration were finding it increasingly difficult to do so .

It is the second such Turkish air strike in one week
Fighter planes attacked positions held by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) in a 35 - minute raid , the army said .
Similar air strikes last Sunday were followed two days later by an incursion into Iraq by Turkish troops .
Iraq 's Kurdish regional government condemned those raids , but Turkey says it has a right to defend itself from PKK attacks on its territory .
Operations ' to continue '
In a statement on its website , the Turkish military said : " Turkish Air Force warplanes struck important targets of the PKK / KONGRA - GEL terror group in northern Iraq ... between the hours of 14:25 - 15:00 ( 1225-1300 GMT ) .
MOUNTING BORDER TENSION 7
Oct PKK rebels kill 13 Turkish troops near Iraqi border 17 Oct - Turkish MPs allow military operations in Iraq 21 Oct - 12 Turkish troops die in PKK ambush near Iraqi border 30 Nov - Turkish cabinet backs PKK pursuits in Iraq 13 Nov - Turkey shells PKK targets in Iraq , Baghdad says 1 Dec - Turkish army targets rebels in Iraq , inflicting " heavy losses " 16 Dec - Turkish jets bomb PKK targets in Iraq for the first time 18 Dec - Some 300 Turkish troops cross over into northern Iraq 22 Dec - Turkish planes bomb PKK targets in Iraq for the second time
The air strikes were followed by shelling from inside the Turkish border , army officials said .
Ten planes were involved in the raid , senior military sources told Reuters news agency .
Officials did not disclose the location of the raids , although Iraqi Kurdish authorities said the target was in a mountainous region north of the town of Dohuk .
The US administration confirmed that it had been informed of the attacks in advance .
No casualties were reported by authorities in northern Iraq .
" The aerial bombardment did n't result in any people killed because the area is almost deserted because of fear of aerial and mortar attacks from the Turkish side , " Reuters news agency quoted Jabbar Yawer , an Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga spokesman as saying .
Turkish military officials pledged to continue operations " no matter how the conditions are " , the Associated Press news agency quoted the army statement as saying .
Stability threat
Turkish officials said the PKK " suffered heavy losses in terms of its infrastructure and its human resources , " during the military operation earlier this month .
Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Levent Bilman told the BBC the United States " supplied actionable intelligence " for that operation .
The US is opposed to any major cross - border incursion into the only relatively stable region of Iraq but has agreed to share intelligence with Turkey - a vital strategic ally - on the PKK .
The PKK - which is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey , the US , and the EU - is thought to have about 3,000 rebels based in Iraq .
Seven years ago , Robert Hanawalt ditched a sales career in Washington to move to Prague , where he quickly realized that he could live indefinitely without official paperwork .
He taught English illegally for four years on 90 - day tourist visas .
The trick ?
Quick trips over the border , which reset the clock with a fresh passport stamp .
" I did that , " Mr. Hanawalt says .
" But after the first few times I thought , ' Why even bother ?
Nobody is checking these things . ' "
But as nine countries , including the Czech Republic , join the European Union 's borderless Schengen zone Friday , Brussels is now ordering member states to get tough on visa policy .
That could spell trouble for an unlikely class of illegal immigrants : American expats .
Attracted by English teaching jobs , the low cost of living , and societies just waking up to the possibilities of Western tourism , thousands are estimated to be living and working illegally in central and eastern Europe .
Prague quickly became an expatriate magnet .
Today , 5,000 Americans are registered with the US Embassy here , though there 's no official tally of the total number of Americans living in the Czech Republic .
Local media estimate it to be nearly 20,000 .
Brussels is taking aim at such visa riders .
Now , Americans and Canadians can initially travel visa - free to Schengen countries for up to 90 days .
But if at the end of that time they want to stay , they must go somewhere outside the zone – Ukraine or Montenegro , for example – to apply for a long - term visa .
Many expats are wondering what to do now , having set down roots here .
" There is definitely some panic about Schengen , " says Evan Rail , a travel writer who has lived in Prague for eight years , but has been " riding a tourist visa " for the last two .
Hanawalt has gotten a valid residency permit and runs a business helping other Americans in Prague negotiate the country 's immigration bureaucracy and get legal themselves .
Mark Wright , who has been teaching English illegally in Prague for two years , found another teaching job at a language school that says it will help him obtain a visa .
Other Americans are applying for Czech business licenses , another avenue to obtaining a residency visa .
But some are taking their chances .
" Unfortunately one can't go up to a government official and ask exactly how much harder it will be to live here illegally in the new year , " says Mr. Wright .
" It 's possible enforcement might not change at all , and I know some expats who are banking on it . "
The Czech interior ministry is promising increased enforcement .
Spokesman Vladimir Repka wrote in an e-mail this week that in 2007 more than 4,000 people were deported for visa violations , though he did not know how many were Americans .
Schengen 's expansion is affecting others as well .
Ukrainians , long accustomed to unfettered travel to Poland , now need a visa even for day trips .
Slovenia is closing down unmanned footbridges along its border with Croatia .
Not every American in Prague is greeting Schengen coldly .
" As someone living here legally , I think it 's only fair that some of the permanent tourists here be made to do the same thing , " says Mark Anderson , who moved here six years ago and started his own cleaning business .

That is the " loser , " and I eat the inferior one immediately .
The winner gets to go another round .
I have found that , in general , the brown and red M&Ms are tougher , and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior .
I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack - food world .
Occasionally I will get a mutation , a candy that is misshapen , or pointier , or flatter than the rest .
Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness , but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength .
In this way , the species continues to adapt to its environment .
When I reach the end of the pack , I am left with one M&M , the strongest of the herd .
Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well , I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars , A Division of Mars , Inc. , Hackettstown , NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A. , along with a 3x5 card reading , " Please use this M&M for breeding purposes .
" This week they wrote back to thank me , and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms .
I consider this " grant money . "
I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament .
From a field of hundreds , we will discover the True Champion .
There can be only one .
Andy Bathie works as a firefighter
Andy Bathie , 37 , from Enfield , north London , claims he was assured by the couple he would have no personal or financial involvement for the children .
He donated his sperm as a friend rather than go through a fertility clinic .
The CSA said only anonymous donors at licensed centres are exempt from being treated as the legal father of a child born as a result of their donation .
Mr Bathie , a firefighter , said he cannot afford to have children with his own wife due to the financial implications .
Shock , anger and despair
The lesbian couple , who approached the couple five years ago after they married in a civil ceremony , have a boy and a girl .
Mr Bathie said he reacted with " shock , anger and despair " , when he was contacted by the CSA in November .
He said : " I do n't have any particular ill will .
It 's the fact that I still even now do n't see why I should have to pay for another couple 's children . "
A spokesman for Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ( HFEA ) said : " The law says that men donating sperm through licensed fertility clinics are not the legal father of any child born through that donation .
" Men giving out their sperm in any other way - such as via internet arrangements - are legally the father of any children born with all the responsibilities that carries . "
Fertility reforms
A spokeswoman for CSA said : " Unless the child is legally adopted , both biological parents are financially responsible for their child - the Child Support Agency legislation is not gender or partnership based . "
Ministers have drawn up fertility reforms giving equal parenting rights to same - sex couples who " marry " in a civil partnership .
This means they will be recognised as the legal parents of children conceived through sperm donation .
The change comes too late for Mr Bathie , although he is now pushing for an amendment to make the laws retrospective .
Cannabinoids may suppress tumor invasion in highly invasive cancers , according to a study published online December 25 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
Cannabinoids , the active components in marijuana , are used to reduce the side effects of cancer treatment , such as pain , weight loss , and vomiting , but there is increasing evidence that they may also inhibit tumor cell growth .
However , the cellular mechanisms behind this are unknown .
Robert Ramer , Ph.D. , and Burkhard Hinz , Ph.D. , of the University of Rostock in Germany investigated whether and by what mechanism cannabinoids inhibit tumor cell invasion .
Cannabinoids did suppress tumor cell invasion and stimulated the expression of TIMP - 1 , an inhibitor of a group of enzymes that are involved in tumor cell invasion .
“ To our knowledge , this is the first report of TIMP - 1 - dependent anti-invasive effects of cannabinoids .
This signaling pathway may play an important role in the antimetastatic action of cannabinoids , whose potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of highly invasive cancers should be addressed in clinical trials , ” the authors write .

Speaker Pelosi , President Bush could have achieved his goal of “ regime change ” in Iraq quickly and without the violence of war .
Saddam Hussein offered , weeks before his country was invaded , to leave Iraq and go into exile .
President Bush withheld this offer from public view — and refused it .
Nor did the President need to invade Afghanistan to apprehend Osama bin Laden .
On five different occasions , George Bush refused a standing offer from the Taliban to surrender Osama bin Laden — three times before 9/11 and twice thereafter , again without public disclosure .
No , the military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan are not directed against terrorism .
They are territorial in nature .
Mr. Bush intended from his first days in office to invade the two countries : as early as late January , 2001 , his Administration was developing the decisions and beginning the preparations for both military incursions .
9/11 was in the distant future , so the conflicts cannot be exercises in counter - terrorism , as the Bush Administration frequently and dishonestly insists .
They are premeditated wars of unprovoked conquest and occupation .
Madam Speaker , if you know this , and if you continue refusing impeachment , then you are a criminal accomplice in violating the trust of the American people — and in violating both U.S. and international law .
If you do not know this truth about the wars , Madam Speaker , you must learn its details and embrace it , and then you must seek with dispatch and justice to impeach George Bush and Richard Cheney .
You claim you do n’t have the votes .
But to say that is to canvass the jury before the trial begins , before the evidence is presented and scrutinized .
When the hideous truth of these wars is finally exposed — as it will be in the impeachment process — you will have the vote of every honest and patriotic member of the House of Representatives , Democrat and Republican alike .
Why is n’t the truth already widely known ?
There are two reasons .
The Bush Administration is infamous for its pathological lying and secrecy : they have done everything in their power to distort or suppress the truth .
And the mainstream press has become an engine of entertaining , not informing the American people : it is indifferent to the truth .
But the truth is always there , and it can be discovered in foreign news outlets , in the domestic alternate press , in book - length treatises , and in the passion for truth and unconstrained inquiry displayed by people posting to the Internet .
These are the sources for the exposition to follow .
Madam Speaker , if you will not impeach , then you must refute this history , if you can .
THE WARS ARE NOT ABOUT TERRORISM
The Bush Administration ’s Curious Behavior
Hours after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , President Bush told the world the United States would take the fight directly to the terrorists and the states that harbored them .
Thus the Bush Administration ’s “ War on Terror ” was born .
Less than a month later , on October 7 , Mr. Bush launched a savage aerial bombardment of Afghanistan .
He had the support of a shocked American citizenry and a sympathetic world , all of whom expected justice to be delivered soon to the terrorist Osama bin Laden and the harboring state embodied in the Taliban .
The incursion into Afghanistan was sold as the first action in the “ War on Terror . ”
It was a brilliantly executed charade .
Flashback to October 12 , 2000 , a year earlier .
The USS Cole , an American Navy destroyer in the Yemeni port of Aden , has suffered heavy damage from a terrorist attack , perpetrated by Osama bin Laden ’s al Qaeda .
Three weeks later officials of the Clinton Administration met with theTaliban in the Sheraton Hotel in Hamburg , Germany .
To avoid a violent retaliation of furious bombing , the Taliban offered the unconditional surrender of Osama bin Laden .
Before the details of the transfer were completed , however , a Supreme Court ruling gave George W. Bush the White House , and the message was passed : the actual handover of bin Laden will be deferred until the Bush Administration is sworn in .
Once in office , the new Administration asked the Taliban to delay the handover of Osama bin Laden at least until February .
As winter faded into spring , and spring into summer , the Administration demurred twice more .
Then Osama bin Laden struck again , on September 11 , 2001 .
On September 15 , Taliban officials were flown in U.S. Air Force C-130 aircraft to the Pakistani city of Quetta , where the deal was sweetened .
The standing offer of surrendering Osama bin Laden was renewed , but now the Taliban would also oversee the closure of bin Laden ’s bases and training camps .
This time the White House simply rejected the offer out of hand .
It did so again when the offer was repeated several weeks later , and days after that President Bush ordered the violence to begin .
The invasion of Afghanistan was something vastly different than a quest to apprehend a terrorist .

The War in Afghanistan
The commitment to invade Afghanistan was made long before 9/11 .
The Bush Administration wanted to secure for American energy companies — notably the Enron and Unocal Corporations — the strategic pipeline route across Afghanistan to the Caspian Basin .
But the Taliban had signed a contract in 1996 with the Bridas Corporation of Argentina , preempting the route .
Scarcely settled in Washington in early 2001 , the Bush Administration immediately pressed the Taliban to rescind the Bridas contract , and undertook planning for military intervention should negotiations fail .
Administration officials and the Taliban met for talks three times throughout the spring and summer , in Washington D.C. , Berlin , and Islamabad — but to no avail .
At the last session , in August , 2001 the Administration threatened a “ carpet of bombs ” if the Taliban did not comply .
The Taliban would not .
Soon thereafter — still weeks before September 11 — President Bush notified Pakistan and India he would attack Afghanistan “ before the end of October . ”
Then 9/11 .
Then two more refusals of Osama bin Laden ’s head .
Then , on October 7 , the Bush Administration looses the carpet of bombs .
Since then Afghanistan has been supplied with a puppet government , the Bridas contract is history , and the country is dotted today with permanent U.S. military bases in close proximity to the pipeline route .
It was a war of conquest and occupation .
Counter - terrorism is scarcely visible .
Osama bin Laden remains at large , the yield of “ terrorists ” to date consists of several hundred iconic and badly treated wretches in Guantanamo Bay , and terrorism in the Middle East has intensified , not diminished .

THE WARS ARE ABOUT AMERICAN HEGEMONY —
AND OIL
The War in Iraq
The template for the invasion of Iraq was crafted in 1992 , in Richard Cheney ’s Defense Department during the first Bush Administration .
It was a document advocating a U.S. posture of singular global dominance in economic , diplomatic , and military power .
The authors were Paul Wolfowitz , Zalmay Khalilzad , and Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby .
Their document spoke explicitly about the need to secure “ ... access to vital raw materials , primarily Persian Gulf oil , ” and Iraq was in the crosshairs .
In 1996 , the Project for the New American Century was created , touting the term “ global hegemony , ” and seeking to maintain America ’s status as the world ’s only superpower , using preemptive war if necessary .
Among the founders of the PNAC were the earlier advocates of world dominion : Richard Cheney , Paul Wolfowitz , Zalmay Khalilzad , and Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby .
Donald Rumsfeld , and Jeb Bush were founding members as well .
In a 1998 letter to President Clinton the PNAC people once again sought the invasion of Iraq .
Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , Zalmay Khalilzad , and 15 others signed the letter .
In September of 2000 the Project for the New American Century once more advocated the overthrow of Saddam Hussein .
Then four months later , Richard Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , Zalmay Khalilzad , Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby — and 24 others from the PNAC — moved into top positions in the Bush Administration .
The commitment to invade Iraq was made at the first meeting of President Bush ’s National Security Council in January of 2001 .
The rationale was ideological , apparently : by means of a preemptive war , to take an initial step toward global hegemony .
A more tangible objective would soon emerge .

Regime Change
In December of 2002 , 3 months before his country was invaded , Saddam Hussein invited the Bush Administration to send U.S. troops into Iraq to search for weapons of mass destruction , and he said he could prove Iraq was not involved in 9/11 .
His entreaty was turned aside by President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
Two months later Hussein promised unlimited access to the FBI to search for WMD ’s , support for the US position on Israel and Palestine , and even some limited rights to Iraq ’s oil .
All this was rejected .
Finally , in desperation Saddam Hussein offered personally to depart Iraq for exile in Egypt or Saudi Arabia .
Once again he was refused by the White House , and soon thereafter cruise missiles pounded Baghdad and U.S. tanks rolled across the border from Kuwait .
Regime change was not the objective : that could have been achieved bloodlessly with Saddam Hussein ’s exile .
Combating terrorism could n’t possibly have been the objective , either : when President Bush invaded Iraq , there was no sign of al Qaeda in the country at all .
There had to be some other purpose .

Oil
Within weeks of taking office the Bush Administration was studying maps of the Iraqi oil fields , pipelines , refineries , tanker terminals , and undeveloped oil exploration blocks .
A National Security Council document dated February 3 , 2001 spoke of “ … actions regarding the capture of new and existing oil and gas fields . ”
Later in the year the Bush State Department undertook the “ Future of Iraq Project , ” in one element of which Administration bureaucrats and oil company representatives planned the postwar deconstruction of Iraq ’s nationalized oil industry .
It would be replaced by a clever form of privatization , hugely favoring American and British oil companies .
This planning was underway in October of 2001 , exactly a year before Congress authorized military force in Iraq .
The State Department ’s plan was codified in a model “ hydrocarbon law ” drafted during Paul Bremer ’s Coalition Provisional Authority , with direct participation of the American and British oil companies .
The law was not translated from English into Arabic until elections had been held ; then Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s cabinet approved the law on February 15 , 2007 and submitted it to Parliament for passage .
The hydrocarbon law when passed will grant immensely profitable access for international oil companies to an estimated 81 % of Iraq 's undeveloped crude oil reserves .
The favored companies are Exxon / Mobil , Chevron / Texaco , Royal Dutch / Shell , and BP / Amoco .
Enactment of the hydrocarbon law was proposed as a mandatory “ benchmark ” by President Bush in a speech on January 10 , 2007 .
The benchmark was made statutory when the Democratic Congress passed the Iraq Accountability
Act a short time later .
The tangible objective for invading and occupying Iraq was suspected early by the war ’s opponents and it is now confirmed : to secure access to the country ’s immense oil and gas resources .
Evidence of success is everywhere .
Iraq now has a puppet government and five permanent American “ mega - bases ” to house 100,000 troops for 50 years .
The American embassy in Baghdad is ten times larger than any other U.S. embassy in the world .
And in November , President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki signed a document called The Declaration of Principles , to assure an “ enduring relationship ” between their governments .

And so , Speaker Pelosi , here we are after six years of fraudulence , engaged in two wars of conquest and occupation the Bush Administration orchestrated in defiance of honesty , decency , morals , and law .
Half a million lives and half a trillion dollars have been poured into the cesspool of their lies and deceit .
Truth and justice are the bedrocks of our existence as a nation .
The Bush Administration has trampled truth .
We cannot tolerate the withholding of justice as well .
Madam Speaker , you must impeach .
Or can you refute this history ?

All too often , the phrase " corporate free press " is something of an oxymoron .
Whether to maximise sales , to attract advertisers , or simply to promote the interests of their wealthy owners , the mass media open strange , self - serving and grossly distorted windows onto the world .
This website is another window .
Here you 'll find documentaries , lectures and interviews following a different editorial line .
MORAL PSYCHOLOGY AND THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF RELIGION
I study morality from every angle I can find .
Morality is one of those basic aspects of humanity , like sexuality and eating , that can't fit into one or two academic fields .
I think morality is unique , however , in having a kind of spell that disguises it .
We all care about morality so passionately that it 's hard to look straight at it .
We all look at the world through some kind of moral lens , and because most of the academic community uses the same lens , we validate each other 's visions and distortions .
I think this problem is particularly acute in some of the new scientific writing about religion .
When I started graduate school at Penn in 1987 , it seemed that developmental psychology owned the rights to morality within psychology .
Everyone was either using or critiquing Lawrence Kohlberg 's ideas , as well as his general method of interviewing kids about dilemmas ( such as : should Heinz steal a drug to save his wife 's life ? ) .
Everyone was studying how children 's understanding of moral concepts changed with experience .
But in the 1990s two books were published that I believe triggered an explosion of cross - disciplinary scientific interest in morality , out of which has come a new synthesis — very much along the lines that E. O. Wilson predicted in 1975 .
The first was Antonio Damasio's Descartes ' Error , in 1994 , which showed a very broad audience that morality could be studied using the then new technology of fMRI , and also that morality , and rationality itself , were crucially dependent on the proper functioning of emotional circuits in the prefrontal cortex .
The second was Frans de Waal 's Good Natured , published just two years later , which showed an equally broad audience that the building blocks of human morality are found in other apes and are products of natural selection in the highly social primate lineage .
These two books came out just as John Bargh was showing social psychologists that automatic and unconscious processes can and probably do cause the majority of our behaviors , even morally loaded actions ( like rudeness or altruism ) that we thought we were controlling consciously .
Furthermore , Damasio and Bargh both found , as Michael Gazzaniga had years before , that people could n't stop themselves from making up post - hoc explanations for whatever it was they had just done for unconscious reasons .
Combine these developments and suddenly Kohlbergian moral psychology seemed to be studying the wagging tail , rather than the dog .
If the building blocks of morality were shaped by natural selection long before language arose , and if those evolved structures work largely by giving us feelings that shape our behavior automatically , then why should we be focusing on the verbal reasons that people give to explain their judgments in hypothetical moral dilemmas ?
In my dissertation and my other early studies , I told people short stories in which a person does something disgusting or disrespectful that was perfectly harmless ( for example , a family cooks and eats its dog , after the dog was killed by a car ) .
I was trying to pit the emotion of disgust against reasoning about harm and individual rights .
I found that disgust won in nearly all groups I studied ( in Brazil , India , and the United States ) , except for groups of politically liberal college students , particularly Americans , who overrode their disgust and said that people have a right to do whatever they want , as long as they do n't hurt anyone else .
These findings suggested that emotion played a bigger role than the cognitive developmentalists had given it .
These findings also suggested that there were important cultural differences , and that academic researchers may have inappropriately focused on reasoning about harm and rights because we primarily study people like ourselves — college students , and also children in private schools near our universities , whose morality is not representative of the United States , let alone the world .
So in the 1990s I was thinking about the role of emotion in moral judgment , I was reading Damasio , De Waal , and Bargh , and I was getting very excited by the synergy and consilience across disciplines .
I wrote a review article called " The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail , " which was published in 2001 , a month after Josh Greene 's enormously influential Science article .
Greene used fMRI to show that emotional responses in the brain , not abstract principles of philosophy , explain why people think various forms of the " trolley problem " ( in which you have to choose between killing one person or letting five die ) are morally different .
Obviously I 'm biased in terms of what I notice , but it seems to me that the zeitgeist in moral psychology has changed since 2001 .
Most people who study morality now read and write about emotions , the brain , chimpanzees , and evolution , as well as reasoning .
This is exactly what E. O. Wilson predicted in Sociobiology : that the old approaches to morality , including Kohlberg 's , would be swept away or merged into a new approach that focused on the emotive centers of the brain as biological adaptations .
Wilson even said that these emotive centers give us moral intuitions , which the moral philosophers then justify while pretending that they are intuiting truths that are independent of the contingencies of our evolved minds .
And now , 30 years later , Josh Greene has a paper in press where he uses neuroscientific evidence to reinterpret Kantian deontological philosophy as a sophisticated post - hoc justification of our gut feelings about rights and respect for other individuals .
I think E. O. Wilson deserves more credit than he gets for seeing into the real nature of morality and for predicting the future of moral psychology so uncannily .
He 's in my pantheon , along with David Hume and Charles Darwin .
All three were visionaries who urged us to focus on the moral emotions and their social utility .
I recently summarized this new synthesis in moral psychology with four principles :
1 ) Intuitive primacy but not dictatorship .
This is the idea , going back to Wilhelm Wundt and channeled through Robert Zajonc and John Bargh , that the mind is driven by constant flashes of affect in response to everything we see and hear .
Our brains , like other animal brains , are constantly trying to fine tune and speed up the central decision of all action : approach or avoid .
You ca n't understand the river of fMRI studies on neuroeconomics and decision making without embracing this principle .
We have affectively - valenced intuitive reactions to almost everything , particularly to morally relevant stimuli such as gossip or the evening news .
Reasoning by its very nature is slow , playing out in seconds .
Studies of everyday reasoning show that we usually use reason to search for evidence to support our initial judgment , which was made in milliseconds .
But I do agree with Josh Greene that sometimes we can use controlled processes such as reasoning to override our initial intuitions .
I just think this happens rarely , maybe in one or two percent of the hundreds of judgments we make each week .
And I do agree with Marc Hauser that these moral intuitions require a lot of computation , which he is unpacking .
Hauser and I mostly disagree on a definitional question : whether this means that " cognition " precedes " emotion . "
I try never to contrast those terms , because it 's all cognition .
I think the crucial contrast is between two kinds of cognition : intuitions ( which are fast and usually affectively laden ) and reasoning ( which is slow , cool , and less motivating ) .
2 ) Moral thinking is for social doing .
This is a play on William James ' pragmatist dictum that thinking is for doing , updated by newer work on Machiavellian intelligence .
The basic idea is that we did not evolve language and reasoning because they helped us to find truth ; we evolved these skills because they were useful to their bearers , and among their greatest benefits were reputation management and manipulation .
Just look at your stream of consciousness when you are thinking about a politician you dislike , or when you have just had a minor disagreement with your spouse .
It 's like you 're preparing for a court appearance .
Your reasoning abilities are pressed into service generating arguments to defend your side and attack the other .
We are certainly able to reason dispassionately when we have no gut feeling about a case , and no stake in its outcome , but with moral disagreements that 's rarely the case .
As David Hume said long ago , reason is the servant of the passions .
3 ) Morality binds and builds .
This is the idea stated most forcefully by Emile Durkheim that morality is a set of constraints that binds people together into an emergent collective entity .
Durkheim focused on the benefits that accrue to individuals from being tied in and restrained by a moral order .
In his book Suicide he alerted us to the ways that freedom and wealth almost inevitably foster anomie , the dangerous state where norms are unclear and people feel that they can do whatever they want .
Durkheim did n't talk much about conflict between groups , but Darwin thought that such conflicts may have spurred the evolution of human morality .
Virtues that bind people to other members of the tribe and encourage self - sacrifice would lead virtuous tribes to vanquish more selfish ones , which would make these traits more prevalent .
Of course , this simple analysis falls prey to the free - rider problem that George Williams and Richard Dawkins wrote so persuasively about .
But I think the terms of this debate over group selection have changed radically in the last 10 years , as culture and religion have become central to discussions of the evolution of morality .
I 'll say more about group selection in a moment .
For now I just want to make the point that humans do form tight , cooperative groups that pursue collective ends and punish cheaters and slackers , and they do this most strongly when in conflict with other groups .
Morality is what makes all of that possible .
4 ) Morality is about more than harm and fairness .
In moral psychology and moral philosophy , morality is almost always about how people treat each other .
Here 's an influential definition from the Berkeley psychologist Elliot Turiel : morality refers to " prescriptive judgments of justice , rights , and welfare pertaining to how people ought to relate to each other . "
Kohlberg thought that all of morality , including concerns about the welfare of others , could be derived from the psychology of justice .
Carol Gilligan convinced the field that an ethic of " care " had a separate developmental trajectory , and was not derived from concerns about justice .
OK , so there are two psychological systems , one about fairness / justice , and one about care and protection of the vulnerable .
And if you look at the many books on the evolution of morality , most of them focus exclusively on those two systems , with long discussions of Robert Trivers ' reciprocal altruism ( to explain fairness ) and of kin altruism and / or attachment theory to explain why we do n't like to see suffering and often care for people who are not our children .
But if you try to apply this two - foundation morality to the rest of the world , you either fail or you become Procrustes .
Most traditional societies care about a lot more than harm / care and fairness / justice .
Why do so many societies care deeply and morally about menstruation , food taboos , sexuality , and respect for elders and the Gods ?
You can't just dismiss this stuff as social convention .
If you want to describe human morality , rather than the morality of educated Western academics , you 've got to include the Durkheimian view that morality is in large part about binding people together .
From a review of the anthropological and evolutionary literatures , Craig Joseph ( at Northwestern University ) and I concluded that there were three best candidates for being additional psychological foundations of morality , beyond harm / care and fairness / justice .
These three we label as ingroup / loyalty ( which may have evolved from the long history of cross - group or sub - group competition , related to what Joe Henrich calls " coalitional psychology " ) ; authority / respect ( which may have evolved from the long history of primate hierarchy , modified by cultural limitations on power and bullying , as documented by Christopher Boehm ) , and purity / sanctity , which may be a much more recent system , growing out of the uniquely human emotion of disgust , which seems to give people feelings that some ways of living and acting are higher , more noble , and less carnal than others .
Joseph and I think of these foundational systems as expressions of what Dan Sperber calls " learning modules " — they are evolved modular systems that generate , during enculturation , large numbers of more specific modules which help children recognize , quickly and automatically , examples of culturally emphasized virtues and vices .
For example , we academics have extremely fine - tuned receptors for sexism ( related to fairness ) but not sacrilege ( related to purity ) .
Virtues are socially constructed and socially learned , but these processes are highly prepared and constrained by the evolved mind .
We call these three additional foundations the binding foundations , because the virtues , practices , and institutions they generate function to bind people together into hierarchically organized interdependent social groups that try to regulate the daily lives and personal habits of their members .
We contrast these to the two individualizing foundations ( harm / care and fairness / reciprocity ) , which generate virtues and practices that protect individuals from each other and allow them to live in harmony as autonomous agents who can focus on their own goals .
My UVA colleagues Jesse Graham , Brian Nosek , and I have collected data from about 7,000 people so far on a survey designed to measure people 's endorsement of these five foundations .
In every sample we 've looked at , in the United States and in other Western countries , we find that people who self - identify as liberals endorse moral values and statements related to the two individualizing foundations primarily , whereas self - described conservatives endorse values and statements related to all five foundations .
It seems that the moral domain encompasses more for conservatives — it 's not just about Gilligan 's care and Kohlberg 's justice .
It 's also about Durkheim 's issues of loyalty to the group , respect for authority , and sacredness .
I hope you 'll accept that as a purely descriptive statement .
You can still reject the three binding foundations normatively — that is , you can still insist that ingroup , authority , and purity refer to ancient and dangerous psychological systems that underlie fascism , racism , and homophobia , and you can still claim that liberals are right to reject those foundations and build their moral systems using primarily the harm / care and fairness / reciprocity foundations .
But just go with me for a moment that there is this difference , descriptively , between the moral worlds of secular liberals on the one hand and religious conservatives on the other .
There are , of course , many other groups , such as the religious left and the libertarian right , but I think it 's fair to say that the major players in the new religion wars are secular liberals criticizing religious conservatives .
Because the conflict is a moral conflict , we should be able to apply the four principles of the new synthesis in moral psychology .
In what follows I will take it for granted that religion is a part of the natural world that is appropriately studied by the the methods of science .
Whether or not God exists ( and as an atheist I personally doubt it ) , religiosity is an enormously important fact about our species .
There must be some combination of evolutionary , developmental , neuropsychological , and anthropological theories that can explain why human religious practices take the various forms that they do , many of which are so similar across cultures and eras .
I will also take it for granted that religious fundamentalists , and most of those who argue for the existence of God , illustrate the first three principles of moral psychology ( intuitive primacy , post - hoc reasoning guided by utility , and a strong sense of belonging to a group bound together by shared moral commitments ) .
But because the new atheists talk so much about the virtues of science and our shared commitment to reason and evidence , I think it 's appropriate to hold them to a higher standard than their opponents .
Do these new atheist books model the scientific mind at its best ?
Or do they reveal normal human beings acting on the basis of their normal moral psychology ?
1 ) Intuitive primacy but not dictatorship .
It 's clear that Richard Dawkins ( in The God Delusion ) and Sam Harris ( in Letter To A Christian Nation ) have strong feelings about religion in general and religious fundamentalists in particular .
Given the hate mail they receive , I do n't blame them .
The passions of Dawkins and Harris do n't mean that they are wrong , or that they can't be trusted .
One can certainly do good scholarship on slavery while hating slavery .
But the presence of passions should alert us that the authors , being human , are likely to have great difficulty searching for and then fairly evaluating evidence that opposes their intuitive feelings about religion .
We can turn to Dawkins and Harris to make the case for the prosecution , which they do brilliantly , but if we readers are to judge religion we will have to find a defense attorney .
Or at least we 'll have to let the accused speak .
2 ) Moral thinking is for social doing .
This is where the scientific mind is supposed to depart from the lay mind .
The normal person ( once animated by emotion ) engages in moral reasoning to find ammunition , not truth ; the normal person attacks the motives and character of her opponents when it will be advantageous to do so .
The scientist , in contrast , respects empirical evidence as the ultimate authority and avoids ad hominem arguments .
The metaphor for science is a voyage of discovery , not a war .
Yet when I read the new atheist books , I see few new shores .
Instead I see battlefields strewn with the corpses of straw men .
To name three : a )
The new atheists treat religions as sets of beliefs about the world , many of which are demonstrably false .
Yet anthropologists and sociologists who study religion stress the role of ritual and community much more than of factual beliefs about the creation of the world or life after death .
b ) The new atheists assume that believers , particularly fundamentalists , take their sacred texts literally .
Yet ethnographies of fundamentalist communities ( such as James Ault 's Spirit and Flesh ) show that even when people claim to be biblical literalists , they are in fact quite flexible , drawing on the bible selectively — or ignoring it — to justify humane and often quite modern responses to complex social situations .
c ) The new atheists all review recent research on religion and conclude that it is an evolutionary byproduct , not an adaptation .
They compare religious sentiments to moths flying into candle flames , ants whose brains have been hijacked for a parasite 's benefit , and cold viruses that are universal in human societies .
This denial of adaptation is helpful for their argument that religion is bad for people , even when people think otherwise .
I quite agree with these authors ' praise of the work of Pascal Boyer and Scott Atran , who have shown how belief in supernatural entities may indeed be an accidental output of cognitive systems that otherwise do a good job of identifying objects and agents .
Yet even if belief in gods was initially a byproduct , as long as such beliefs had consequences for behavior then it seems likely that natural selection operated upon phenotypic variation and favored the success of individuals and groups that found ways ( genetic or cultural or both ) to use these gods to their advantage , for example as commitment devices that enhanced cooperation , trust , and mutual aid .
3 ) Morality binds and builds .
Dawkins is explicit that his goal is to start a movement , to raise consciousness , and to arm atheists with the arguments they 'll need to do battle with believers .
The view that " we " are virtuous and our opponents are evil is a crucial step in uniting people behind a cause , and there is plenty of that in the new atheist books .
A second crucial step is to identify traitors in our midst and punish or humiliate them .
There is some of that too in these books — atheists who defend the utility of religion or who argue for disengagement or détente between science and religion are compared to Chamberlain and his appeasement of Hitler .
To my mind an irony of Dawkins ' position is that he reveals a kind of religious orthodoxy in his absolute rejection of group selection .
David Sloan Wilson has supplemented Durkheim 's view of religion ( as being primarily about group cohesion ) with evolutionary analyses to propose that religion was the conduit that pulled humans through a " major transition " in evolutionary history .
Dawkins , along with George Williams and most critics of group selection , acknowledge that natural selection works on groups as well as on individuals , and that group selection is possible in principle .
But Dawkins relies on Williams ' argument that selection pressures at the individual level are , in practice , always stronger than those at the group level : free riders will always undercut Darwin 's suggestion that morality evolved because virtuous groups outcompeted selfish groups .
Wilson , however , in Darwin's Cathedral , makes the case that culture in general and religion in particular change the variables in Williams ' analysis .
Religions and their associated practices greatly increase the costs of defection ( through punishment and ostracism ) , increase the contributions of individuals to group efforts ( through cultural and emotional mechanisms that increase trust ) , and sharpen the boundaries — biological and cultural — between groups .
Throw in recent discoveries that genetic evolution can work much faster than previously supposed , and the widely respected work of Pete Richerson and Rob Boyd on cultural group selection , and suddenly the old consensus against group selection is outdated .
It 's time to examine the question anew .
Yet Dawkins has referred to group selection in interviews as a " heresy , " and in The God Delusion he dismisses it without giving a reason .
In chapter 5 he states the standard Williams free rider objection , notes the argument that religion is a way around the Williams objection , concedes that Darwin believed in group selection , and then moves on .
Dismissing a credible position without reasons , and calling it a heresy ( even if tongue in cheek ) , are hallmarks of standard moral thinking , not scientific thinking .
4 ) Morality is about more than harm and fairness .
In Letter to a Christian Nation , Sam Harris gives us a standard liberal definition of morality : " Questions of morality are questions about happiness and suffering …
To the degree that our actions can affect the experience of other creatures positively or negatively , questions of morality apply . "
He then goes on to show that the Bible and the Koran , taken literally , are immoral books because they 're not primarily about happiness and suffering , and in many places they advocate harming people .
Reading Harris is like watching professional wrestling or the Harlem Globetrotters .
It 's great fun , with lots of acrobatics , but it must not be mistaken for an actual contest .
If we want to stage a fair fight between religious and secular moralities , we can't eliminate one by definition before the match begins .
So here 's my definition of morality , which gives each side a chance to make its case : Moral systems are interlocking sets of values , practices , institutions , and evolved psychological mechanisms that work together to suppress or regulate selfishness and make social life possible .
In my research I have found that there are two common ways that cultures suppress and regulate selfishness , two visions of what society is and how it ought to work .
I 'll call them the contractual approach and the beehive approach .
The contractual approach takes the individual as the fundamental unit of value .
The fundamental problem of social life is that individuals often hurt each other , and so we create implicit social contracts and explicit laws to foster a fair , free , and safe society in which individuals can pursue their interests and develop themselves and their relationships as they choose .
Morality is about happiness and suffering ( as Harris says , and as John Stuart Mill said before him ) , and so contractualists are endlessly trying to fine - tune laws , reinvent institutions , and extend new rights as circumstances change in order to maximize happiness and minimize suffering .
To build a contractual morality , all you need are the two individualizing foundations : harm / care , and fairness / reciprocity .
The other three foundations , and any religion that builds on them , run afoul of the prime directive : let people make their own choices , as long as they harm nobody else .
The beehive approach , in contrast , takes the group and its territory as fundamental sources of value .
Individual bees are born and die by the thousands , but the hive lives for a long time , and each individual has a role to play in fostering its success .
The two fundamental problems of social life are attacks from outside and subversion from within .
Either one can lead to the death of the hive , so all must pull together , do their duty , and be willing to make sacrifices for the group .
Bees do n't have to learn how to behave in this way but human children do , and this is why cultural conservatives are so heavily focused on what happens in schools , families , and the media .
Conservatives generally have a more pessimistic view of human nature than do liberals .
They are more likely to believe that if you stand back and give kids space to grow as they please , they 'll grow into shallow , self - centered , undisciplined pleasure seekers .
Cultural conservatives work hard to cultivate moral virtues based on the three binding foundations : ingroup / loyalty , authority / respect , and purity / sanctity , as well as on the universally employed foundations of harm / care and fairness / reciprocity .
The beehive ideal is not a world of maximum freedom , it is a world of order and tradition in which people are united by a shared moral code that is effectively enforced , which enables people to trust each other to play their interdependent roles .
It is a world of very high social capital and low anomie .
It might seem obvious to you that contractual societies are good , modern , creative and free , whereas beehive societies reek of feudalism , fascism , and patriarchy .
And , as a secular liberal I agree that contractual societies such as those of Western Europe offer the best hope for living peacefully together in our increasingly diverse modern nations ( although it remains to be seen if Europe can solve its current diversity problems ) .
I just want to make one point , however , that should give contractualists pause : surveys have long shown that religious believers in the United States are happier , healthier , longer - lived , and more generous to charity and to each other than are secular people .
Most of these effects have been documented in Europe too .
If you believe that morality is about happiness and suffering , then I think you are obligated to take a close look at the way religious people actually live and ask what they are doing right .
Do n't dismiss religion on the basis of a superficial reading of the Bible and the newspaper .
Might religious communities offer us insights into human flourishing ?
Can they teach us lessons that would improve wellbeing even in a primarily contractualist society .
You can't use the New Atheists as your guide to these lessons .
The new atheists conduct biased reviews of the literature and conclude that there is no good evidence on any benefits except the health benefits of religion .
Here is Daniel Dennett in Breaking the Spell on whether religion brings out the best in people : " Perhaps a survey would show that as a group atheists and agnostics are more respectful of the law , more sensitive to the needs of others , or more ethical than religious people .
Certainly no reliable survey has yet been done that shows otherwise .
It might be that the best that can be said for religion is that it helps some people achieve the level of citizenship and morality typically found in brights .
If you find that conjecture offensive , you need to adjust your perspective .
( Breaking the Spell , p. 55 . )
I have italicized the two sections that show ordinary moral thinking rather than scientific thinking .
The first is Dennett 's claim not just that there is no evidence , but that there is certainly no evidence , when in fact surveys have shown for decades that religious practice is a strong predictor of charitable giving .
Arthur Brooks recently analyzed these data ( in Who Really Cares ) and concluded that the enormous generosity of religious believers is not just recycled to religious charities .
Religious believers give more money than secular folk to secular charities , and to their neighbors .
They give more of their time , too , and of their blood .
Even if you excuse secular liberals from charity because they vote for government welfare programs , it is awfully hard to explain why secular liberals give so little blood .
The bottom line , Brooks concludes , is that all forms of giving go together , and all are greatly increased by religious participation and slightly increased by conservative ideology ( after controlling for religiosity ) .
These data are complex and perhaps they can be spun the other way , but at the moment it appears that Dennett is wrong in his reading of the literature .
Atheists may have many other virtues , but on one of the least controversial and most objective measures of moral behavior — giving time , money , and blood to help strangers in need — religious people appear to be morally superior to secular folk .
My conclusion is not that secular liberal societies should be made more religious and conservative in a utilitarian bid to increase happiness , charity , longevity , and social capital .
Too many valuable rights would be at risk , too many people would be excluded , and societies are so complex that it 's impossible to do such social engineering and get only what you bargained for .
My point is just that every longstanding ideology and way of life contains some wisdom , some insights into ways of suppressing selfishness , enhancing cooperation , and ultimately enhancing human flourishing .
But because of the four principles of moral psychology it is extremely difficult for people , even scientists , to find that wisdom once hostilities erupt .
A militant form of atheism that claims the backing of science and encourages " brights " to take up arms may perhaps advance atheism .
But it may also backfire , polluting the scientific study of religion with moralistic dogma and damaging the prestige of science in the process .
Introduction
Just in case you wondered why there are so many frameworks in Python land , here ’s a basic server ( including a request dispatch mechanism ) in only 50 lines of code ( syntax highlighted code here ) .
The source code structure is as follows :
1 bbox33 : servera $ find .
- type f - name \\*. py 2 ./modules/__init__.py
3 ./modules/admin/__init__.py
4 ./modules/admin/disk.py
5 ./rhbase.py 6 ./server.py
Here ’s a brief demo :
1 bbox33 : servera $ python server.py 2 ** 2007-05-30 00:15:18,628 INFO - starting server .. 3 !!
please type in a req in HTTP - GET format ( or ' q ' to quit ) 4 >>>
http://xyz.net/admin/disk/purge?path=/tmp
5 ** 2007-05-30 00:15:34,889 INFO - do_purge ( ) called for params : ' path=/tmp ' 6 ** 2007-05-30 00:15:34,889 INFO - S : http://xyz.net/admin/disk/purge?path=/tmp
7 !! please type in a req in HTTP - GET format ( or ' q ' to quit ) 8 >>>
http://xyz.net/admin/disk/list?path=/usr
9 ** 2007-05-30 00:15:48,791 ERROR - no ' do_list ' function in '< class ' modules.admin.disk.ReqH '>'
10 ** 2007-05-30 00:15:48,791 INFO - F : http://xyz.net/admin/disk/list?path=/usr
11 !! please type in a req in HTTP - GET format ( or ' q ' to quit ) 12 >>> q 13 ** 2007-05-30 00:15:51,695 INFO - server terminated
And here ’s what actually went on :
the server is invoked ( line 1 ) and is given a request URI ( line 4 ) to serve based on the request URI path ( / admin / disk / purge ) an appropriate request handler is loaded dynamically ( modules.admin.disk ) the request handler ’s dispatch ( ) function is called by looking at the last segment of the request URI path ( purge ) the dispatch function guesses that the request should actually be handled by a method called do_purge ( ) do_purge ( ) is invoked , logs the request parameters ( line 5 ) and returns with a value indicating success ( zero ) after the request was handled the server logs the URI and the outcome ( line 6 ( ‘ S’ stands for success ) ) on line 8 the user typed in another request URI but this time no handler function could be found ( resulting in the error logged on line 10 ( ‘ F ’ stands for failure ) )
The server
The server is meant to operate on HTTP GET style requests .
The serve ( ) method ( on line 9 ) accepts a req string parameter that contains a HTTP GET style URI .
The dfuncs dictionary ( defined on line 7 ) is a request handler function cache .
The key is the path portion of the request URI .
The value holds the corresponding request handler function .
The scheme + authority portion of the URI are ignored by the dispatch mechanism .
Any URIs with identical path portions map to the same request handler module and function .
For example the following URIs both map to the module modules.admin.disk , class ReqH , method dispatch ( ) :
The last segment of the URI ’s path portion is taken to be the request action ( i.e. sleep in the URI path above ) .
Serving of requests
1 #!/usr/bin/env python 2 # encoding : utf - 8 3 import logging , urlparse 4 5 class Server ( object ) : 6 def __init__ ( self ) : 7 self.dfuncs = dict ( ) 8 self. modules = dict ( ) 9 def serve ( self , req ) : 10 result = - 1 11 req_path = urlparse.urlsplit( req ) [ 2 ] 12 if req_path in self.dfuncs : dfunc = self.dfuncs[req_path ] # in cache 13 else : dfunc = self.load ( req_path ) # handler function not in cache 14 if dfunc : result = dfunc ( req ) 15 return ( result )
The server first checks whether the handler function for a request is already in its cache ( line 12 ) .
If this is not the case ( line 13 ) , the load ( ) method is called in order to load the appropriate request handler module and function .
The request handler function — if available — is invoked on line 14 .
Please note that a zero is returned in case of success and any non-zero return value indicates a failure .
Dynamic code loading
The load method below constructs the name of the request handler module ( line 19 ) and tries to import it ( line 23 ) .
For more detail on dynamic code loading in Python
see Mark Pilgrim ’s Dynamically importing modules or
go the Python Cookbook , scroll down to chapter 15 and click on the “ Importing from a Module Whose Name Is Determined at Runtime ” heading
16 def load ( self , req_path ) : 17 logging.debug ( " load ( ) called for ' %s ' " % req_path ) 18 m = dfunc = None 19 mpath = ' modules .
%s ' % ' . '.join ( filter ( None , req_path.split(' / ' ) [ : - 1 ] ) ) 20 # already have the module needed ?
21 if mpath in self .
modules : m = self.modules [ mpath ] # yes ! 22 else : # no , try import 23 try : m = __import__( mpath , globals ( ) , locals ( ) , [' ReqH '] ) 24 except ImportError , e : logging.error( str(e ) ) 25 else : self.modules[m.__name__ ] = m # cache it
If the request handler module was imported successfully , the loading logic checks whether the module has a ReqH class ( line 28 ) and whether the latter has a dispatch attribute that may be called ( line 30 ) .
If all checks succeed the dispatch attribute is returned as the request handler function ( line 34 ) .
26 if m : 27 # got the module , does it have a ' ReqH ' class ?
28 if hasattr( m , ' ReqH ' ) : 29 # yes , does the ' ReqH ' class have a dispatch function ?
30 if hasattr( m.ReqH , ' dispatch ') and callable ( m.ReqH.dispatch ) : 31 self.dfuncs[req_path ] = dfunc = m.ReqH.dispatch 32 else : logging.error ( " no dispatch function in ' %s ' " % mpath ) 33 else : logging.error ( " no request handler class in ' %s ' " % mpath ) 34 return dfunc
Logging setup
A proper server needs to log errors as well as any requests received .
A StreamHandler ( logging to stderr by default ) is set up as the root logger .
For more detail on Python logging see
35 if __name__ == ' __main__ ': 36 logf = logging .
Formatter ( ' ** %( asctime )s %( levelname ) s - %( message )s ') 37 lcon = logging .
StreamHandler ( ) 38 lcon.setFormatter(logf ) 39 logging.getLogger ('').addHandler(lcon ) 40 logging.getLogger ('').setLevel(logging.INFO ) 41 logging .info(' starting server .. ')
Minimum scaffolding
The section of code below is a minimal input loop facilitating the experimentation with the server .
42 server = Server ( ) 43 while 1 : 44 req = raw_input ( " !!
please type in a req in HTTP - GET format " \\ 45 " ( or ' q ' to quit ) \
>>> " ) 46 if req == ' q ' : break 47 result = server.serve( req ) 48 if result == 0 : logging.info(' S : %s ' % req ) 49 else : logging .info(' F : %s ' % req ) 50 logging .
info(' server terminated ')
As noted above , a zero return value is taken to be an indication of success ( line 48 ) whereas a non-zero value signifies failure ( line 49 ) .
Request handling
It is an established practice to split the back - end logic into a number of modules that are loaded by the server on demand ( as shown above ) .
In our example each request handler module needs to have a dispatch ( ) method that takes the URI string as its only argument .
In order to factor out the boiler plate code , a request handler base class that takes care of the request action dispatching is put into place .
Please note that the dispatch ( ) method is a class method i.e. it receives a class object as its implicit first argument ( lines 7 - 8 below ) .
This is different from a static method that receives no implicit first argument whatsoever .
1 #!/usr/bin/env python 2 # encoding : utf - 8 3 4 import logging , urlparse 5 6 class ReqHBase ( object ) : 7 @ classmethod 8 def dispatch ( cls , req ) : 9 result = - 1 10 targetf = ' do_%s ' % urlparse.urlsplit( req ) [ 2].split (' / ' ) [ - 1 ] 11 12 try : handler = getattr( cls , targetf ) 13 except AttributeError : 14 logging.error ( " no ' %s ' function in ' %s ' " % ( targetf , str( cls ) ) ) 15 else : # is it a function ?
16 if callable ( handler ) : 17 try : result = handler ( req ) 18 except Exception , e : logging.exception( str(e ) ) 19 else : 20 logging.error ( " ' %s ' not callable in ' %s ' " % ( targetf , str( cls ) ) ) 21 return ( result )
The dispatch code above takes the last segment of the URI path ( i.e. the request action ) and expects to find a static method called do_< last_segment > ( line 10 )
The expected target function must both be present and callable to be invoked .
Otherwise the corresponding error messages are logged ( line 14 and 20 ) .
Example request handler module
What follows is a “ minimalistic ” request handler module .
It is derived from the ReqHBase class and hence inherits the latter ’s dispatch ( ) method .
Please note : more sophisticated request handler modules may be derived from object and implement their own dispatch ( ) methods as needed .
1 #!/usr/bin/env python 2 # encoding : utf - 8 3 4 import logging , urlparse 5 from urlparse import urlsplit 6 from rhbase import ReqHBase 7 8 class ReqH ( ReqHBase ) : 9 do_nothing = 1 10 @ staticmethod 11 def do_purge ( req ) : 12 logging.info( " do_purge ( ) called for params : ' %s ' " % urlsplit ( req ) [ 3 ] ) 13 return ( 0 )
In conclusion
The server presented in this article is quite simple ( it handles all requests in serial fashion , no threading is used etc. ) .
Nevertheless , it clearly demonstrates the potency and the productivity of the Python programming environment .
A little code goes a long way 🙂

Latest Iowa poll shows ongoing shake - up
Most of the polls out of Iowa from the last two weeks point to two general trends : Barack Obama inching towards the lead among Democrats , and Mike Huckabee inching past Mitt Romney among Republicans .
With this in mind , the latest poll from Newsweek reinforces the prior , and exaggerates the latter .
The most dramatic result to come out of the poll , which is based on telephone interviews with 1,408 registered Iowa voters on Dec. 5 and 6 , is Huckabee ’s emergence from the shadows of the GOP race into the front runner ’s spot in just two months .
The ordained Southern Baptist minister now leads Romney by a two - to - one margin , 39 percent to 17 percent , among likely GOP caucus - goers .
In the last NEWSWEEK survey , conducted Sept. 26 - 27 , Huckabee polled a mere 6 percent to Romney ’s 25 percent , which then led the field .
Huckabee has also opened up a wide margin over the next three leading candidates , who all show signs of fading in Iowa : Rudy Giuliani , who dropped from 15 percent in the last survey to 9 percent in the current one ; Fred Thompson , who fell from 16 percent to 10 percent ; and John McCain , who slipped from 7 percent to 6 percent .
“ You rarely see anything like [ Huckabee ’s surge ] , ” says Larry Hugick , who directed the polling for Princeton Survey Research Associates .
Given that no other recent poll shows this kind of dramatic lead for Huckabee , Newsweek ’s poll certainly feels like an outlier , but if it ’s even close to being accurate , I suppose the religious right activists have coalesced their choice .
Indeed , for months , the GOP has a had something of a vacuum — there was no traditional , consistently conservative candidate George Allen was supposed to capture in this race .
Romney tried to shore up this vote , but this is constituency that does n’t like Mormons .
Thompson was poised to win them over , but has proven to be a lackluster candidate .
Huckabee is filling the void .
What ’s more , the Newsweek poll also found that one in six ( 16 % ) Iowa Republicans admit they are less likely to support Romney because he is a Mormon — and the actual number is probably higher , but people are embarrassed about admitting it to the person conducting the poll .
As for the Dems , the Newsweek poll shows that it ’s still anybody ’s race .
Unlike the GOP race , standings in the Democratic campaign have not changed dramatically since the September NEWSWEEK poll in Iowa .
However , Barack Obama has gained some ground , moving to within a point of Hillary Clinton among all Democratic voters ( 29 percent vs. 30 percent ) , with John Edwards in third place at 21 percent .
Among those most likely to attend the caucuses , Obama has moved substantially ahead of Clinton , 35 percent to 29 percent , while Edwards falls back a bit , to 18 percent .
Obama also gets more support from those who say they will “ probably ” attend a Democratic caucus ( 40 percent vs. 27 percent for Clinton ) .
While the Illinois senator ’s lead among Democratic caucus - goers in this poll is not large enough to be statistically significant , things seem to be trending his way , Hugick said .
“ It ’s evolving into a two - person race , with Edwards hanging on , ” he said .
The close duel between Obama and Clinton depends a great deal on the way their competing strengths are perceived , the survey shows .
Obama is much more likely than Clinton to be viewed as the candidate best able to bring about change ( 42 percent vs. 28 percent for Clinton ) and as more personally likable ( 41 percent vs. 18 percent ) .
Clinton , however , is viewed far more as the candidate with the right experience for the job ( 48 percent vs. 15 percent for Obama ) and as the person most likely to defeat the GOP nominee ( 36 percent vs. 27 percent ) .
One potential trouble sign for Hillary , however , is that in contrast to the 2004 Iowa caucuses , when John Kerry leaped into the lead on the basis of his electability , only about one quarter ( 23 percent ) of likely Democratic caucus - goers say they are inclined to support a candidate with the best chance of defeating the GOP nominee .
Stay tuned .
U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said yesterday they are still tracing 15 million of the 143 million pounds of beef involved in the nation 's largest - ever meat recall , but the meat industry appears to be pressing the agency to scale back the recall .
Just days after the recall was announced , industry representatives were talking with federal food - safety regulators about narrowing its scope , according to a legal memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal .
The USDA has said much of the recalled beef , which was produced by Hallmark / Westland Meat Packing Co. , of Chino , Calif. , probably has been consumed .
No illnesses from the meat have been reported .
In two conference calls this week , industry and USDA officials discussed the possibility of excluding from the recall Hallmark / Westland beef that was mixed with other suppliers ' meat and sent to retail and wholesale customers , according to a memo written by an employee of Olsson Frank Weeda Terman Bode Matz PC .
The Washington law firm represents several food companies .
The department appears to have since decided against narrowing the scope .
It was n't clear how much meat such an exemption might involve .
The recall , announced Sunday , came about three weeks after the Humane Society of the United States released an undercover video showing workers at Hallmark / Westland 's Chino plant forcing sick or injured cows into slaughter by kicking them or ramming them with forklifts .
Cows that can't walk or stand on their own are generally banned from the food supply .
As of Sunday , the official line on the destruction of the CIA ’s torture tapes was that the agency had been warned to preserve the videos .
The White House , in particular , was at least tacitly aware of the videos ’ existence , and the White House counsel ’s office urged the CIA to keep them intact .
So , who exactly was involved in identifying incriminating evidence and giving the order to destroy it ?
The NYT reports today that CIA lawyers “ gave written approval in advance ” of the 2005 video destruction .
The former intelligence official acknowledged that there had been nearly two years of debate among government agencies about what to do with the tapes , and that lawyers within the White House and the Justice Department had in 2003 advised against a plan to destroy them .
But the official said that C.I.A. officials had continued to press the White House for a firm decision , and that the C.I.A. was never given a direct order not to destroy the tapes .
“ They never told us , ‘ Hell , no , ’ ” he said .
“ If somebody had said , ‘ You cannot destroy them , ’ we would not have destroyed them . ”
Kevin Drum summarized just how weak the latest version of events from the Bush administration really is : “ The White House had been in the loop for two years .
The CIA had received letters from both the Justice Department and congressional leaders arguing that the tapes should n’t be destroyed .
The CIA ’s top lawyer had been involved for the entire time .
And yet we ’re supposed to believe that , in 2005 , a mid-ranking agency lawyer suddenly decided the tapes could be destroyed and the head of the clandestine branch then gave the order to do so without anyone else being involved ?
Really ?
Does anyone actually believe this story ? ”
No , not if they ’re paying attention they wo n’t .
Oliver Willis ’ observation was quite apt : " The # 1 Rule for the Bush Administration :
If they say something , do n’t believe them . ”

Ancient light absorbed by neutral hydrogen atoms could be used to test certain predictions of string theory , say cosmologists at the University of Illinois .
Making the measurements , however , would require a gigantic array of radio telescopes to be built on Earth , in space or on the moon .
String theory - a theory whose fundamental building blocks are tiny one - dimensional filaments called strings - is the leading contender for a " theory of everything . "
Such a theory would unify all four fundamental forces of nature ( the strong and weak nuclear forces , electromagnetism , and gravity ) .
But finding ways to test string theory has been difficult .
Now , cosmologists at the U. of I. say absorption features in the 21 - centimeter spectrum of neutral hydrogen atoms could be used for such a test .
" High - redshift , 21 - centimeter observations provide a rare observational window in which to test string theory , constrain its parameters and show whether or not it makes sense to embed a type of inflation - called brane inflation - into string theory , " said Benjamin Wandelt , a professor of physics and of astronomy at the U. of I .
" If we embed brane inflation into string theory , a network of cosmic strings is predicted to form , " Wandelt said .
" We can test this prediction by looking for the impact this cosmic string network would have on the density of neutral hydrogen in the universe . "
Wandelt and graduate student Rishi Khatri describe their proposed test in a paper accepted for publication in the journal Physical Review Letters .
About 400,000 years after the Big Bang , the universe consisted of a thick shell of neutral hydrogen atoms ( each composed of a single proton orbited by a single electron ) illuminated by what became known as the cosmic microwave background .
Because neutral hydrogen atoms readily absorb electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of 21 centimeters , the cosmic microwave background carries a signature of density perturbations in the hydrogen shell , which should be observable today , Wandelt said .
Cosmic strings are filaments of infinite length .
Their composition can be loosely compared to the boundaries of ice crystals in frozen water .
When water in a bowl begins to freeze , ice crystals will grow at different points in the bowl , with random orientations .
When the ice crystals meet , they usually will not be aligned to one another .
The boundary between two such misaligned crystals is called a discontinuity or a defect .
Cosmic strings are defects in space .
A network of strings is predicted by string theory ( and also by other supersymmetric theories known as Grand Unified Theories , which aspire to unify all known forces of nature except gravity ) to have been produced in the early universe , but has not been detected so far .
Cosmic strings produce characteristic fluctuations in the gas density through which they move , a signature of which will be imprinted on the 21 - centimeter radiation .
The cosmic string network predicted to occur with brane inflation could be tested by looking for the corresponding fluctuations in the 21 - centimeter radiation .
Like the cosmic microwave background , the cosmological 21 - centimeter radiation has been stretched as the universe has expanded .
Today , this relic radiation has a wavelength closer to 21 meters , putting it in the long - wavelength radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .
To precisely measure perturbations in the spectra would require an array of radio telescopes with a collective area of more than 1,000 square kilometers .
Such an array could be built using current technology , Wandelt said , but would be prohibitively expensive .
If such an enormous array were eventually constructed , measurements of perturbations in the density of neutral hydrogen atoms could also reveal the value of string tension , a fundamental parameter in string theory , Wandelt said .
" And that would tell us about the energy scale at which quantum gravity begins to become important . "

ALL LARGELY ABOUT OIL …. Bob Woodward plucks a sentence from Alan Greenspan ’s forthcoming memoir :
Without elaborating , he writes , “ I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil . ”
Now that ’s a statement that could use some elaboration , is n’t it ?
I guess Greenspan has n’t quite given up his Sphinx - like pose entirely .
( So what ’s Greenspan ’s point ?
I do n’t think he ’s suggesting that we invaded Iraq because we wanted to seize control of their oil fields and hand them over to ExxonMobil .
More likely , he ’s making the unexceptional argument that we would n’t care much about the Middle East in the first place if it did n’t have all that oil .
But it does , and our economy depends on it , and we long ago decided that protecting our access to that oil was an essential element of our national interest .
The Iraq war , as Greenspan notes , is pretty obviously bound up in all of that . )

People everywhere want the war to end , but Washington has failed to take decisive action .
With each passing month , the Iraq disaster claims the lives of nearly 100 service people and countless Iraqis as it drains 12 billion of our tax - dollars .
Our communities are neglected and suffer the consequences .
Today , an amazing and powerful story is unfolding in this country .
We ’ve all known for some time that most people want the war and occupation in Iraq to end .
For the first time , people from all walks of life will have an opportunity to be counted as part of a national , public protest without having to travel to Washington , DC , or New York City .
People are responding , and looking forward to speaking with one voice to demand an end to this outrageous war .
Kiva.org
Over the last few months , some visitors to the Web site of Kiva , a nonprofit that lets users make interest - free “ microloans ” to entrepreneurs in low - development ( that is , poor ) countries all over the world , were greeted with a surprising message .
“ Thanks Kiva Lenders ! ” it began .
“ You ’ve funded EVERY business on the site ! ! ”
Has a charity ever announced that it had enough money ?
Would - be lenders were dumbstruck , says Kiva ’s public - relations director , Fiona Ramsey : “ They ’re stunned for a second  ‘ Here I am , I have money , I want to help someone , and you ’re telling me that I can ’t ? ’ ” The note encouraged the visitor to check back soon , as a new batch of loan - seeking entrepreneurs will often appear mere minutes later .
But still , Kiva is a philanthropic organization facing an extremely unusual challenge : maintaining adequate supply ( people who need help ) to meet demand ( people who want to give it ) .
“ We do n’t want people coming to the Web site who want to make a loan and there ’s no one to loan to , ” Ramsey says .
Kiva has attracted more than $ 19.5 million worth of loans , from more than 220,000 individuals .
You may already be familiar with the project , which has received a phenomenal amount of glowing attention  and that ’s one reason demand is so high .
The site presents a photo of each loan seeker and a short summary of who and where they are and what they want the money for .
A restaurant owner in Nigeria needs $ 450 ; a small farmer in Samoa needs $ 330 .
With a few clicks you can help someone on the other side of the world and play a part in solving the problems of global inequality that so often seem insurmountable .
While it can be hard for charitable givers to really know where their money goes and whom it helps , Kiva lenders receive updates from the loan recipients .
And they almost always see their loans repaid .
( The default rate to date is 0.16 percent . )
The venture started in 2005 , a time when skepticism about , for example , whether the huge sums donated to tsunami relief efforts were doing any good .
It also dovetailed with an increased interest in a more capitalistic version of philanthropy that felt more like investing than simply giving .
Add to this a drumbeat of high - profile attention and endorsements  from the PBS series “ Frontline / World , ” the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof , Bill Clinton  and you get spikes in demand normally associated with limited - edition luxury products .
After Kiva was featured on “ Oprah ” this past September , for instance , “ we sold out , ” as Ramsey puts it .
Since the holidays , individual loans have been capped at $ 25 , to give as many people as possible the chance to participate .
Sometimes frustrated visitors to the site write in to demand an explanation for the dearth of needy people to help .
Kiva ’s 23 - person staff works with 77 “ field partners ”  microfinance institutions on the ground in 39 countries , who line up potential borrowers .
About 250 volunteer translators and editors around the world post new requests as quickly as they can  which can mean gluts as well as shortages .
“ We could keep , for lack of a better word , a stockpile of entrepreneurs , ” Ramsey says .
“ But these are real people .
We ’re not looking at them as inventory . ”
It can take a while to vet potential borrowers .
For example , a Sudan - based organization expressed interest in a partnership at a microfinance conference last August , and it took a couple of months of research , conversations and looking at financial statements before Kiva agreed to work with it .
Even when that process was finally complete , Kiva had to help acquire the digital cameras to take pictures of borrowers ; the organization is expected to start posting loan requests soon .
MSNBC and Me
So . . .
That really happened .
On Tuesday night , after an important and historic victory in the Wisconsin Presidential Primary by Senator Barack Obama , I appeared on the MSNBC post-election program .
“ Hardball ” host Chris Matthews ( who is , it turns out , as ferocious as they say ) , began grilling me on Senator Obama ’s legislative record .
And my mind went blank .
I expected to be asked about the primary that night , or the big one coming up in Texas on March 4 , or just about anything else in the news .
When the subject changed so emphatically , I reached for information that millions of my fellow Obama supporters could recite by heart , and I could n’t summon it .
My most unfortunate gaffe is not , in any way , a comment on Senator Obama , his substantial record , or the great opportunity we all share to elect him President of the United States .
Had I not lost my mind , here are the accomplishments I would have mentioned :
Senator Obama ’s fight for universal children ’s health care in Illinois .
His success bringing Republicans and Democrats together ( a huge selling point for me in general ) on bills such as the one in Illinois requiring police interrogations and confessions to be videotaped .
His leadership on ethics reform in Washington ( the bill that lobbyists and special interests are complaining about right now has his name on it ) .
His bill to make the federal budget far more transparent and accessible to Americans via the Internet – we could use that openness in Texas .
And his vital work with Republicans to lock down nuclear weapons around the world .
Of course , it would have helped to remember all of this last night .
I encourage anyone who wants to know more ( especially Mr. Matthews ) to log onto texas.barackobama.com .
In the meantime , let ’s not lose focus on what ’s important in this election .
It ’s not my stunning televised defeat in “ Stump the Chump . ”
Thankfully , it has nothing at all to do with me .
What ’s important is the direction our country is headed .
What ’s important are the priorities , methods , and , yes , accomplishments of those seeking the highest office in the country .
Senator Obama has a vision for this nation , and we would be fortunate to fulfill it .
He has the commitment to work with everyone from across the political and demographic spectrum to achieve it .
And he has the strength to defend us , our security , and our values against all who will challenge them .
But most of all , he has the record to prove that all of this is possible .
It ’s something no one should forget .
. . .
Even though I did .
. . .
On national television .
The human body is one of the most incredible organisms in the known universe , but all that awesomeness carries some pretty weird and hard - to - explain baggage .
We are here to help shed light on some of those body mysteries in the hopes you 'll have something intelligent to say if you get stuck in an intense debate about the pee shakes or the white thing you just coughed up .
Read on , get educated and help identify those unknown moments when it appears your body is rebelling against you .
If you 're lucky your questions will be answered here , if they are n't ... brain tumor .
Falling In Your Sleep ( aka The Hypnic Jerk )
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
What 's that ?
This is that falling sensation and sudden jolt you sometimes feel just as you 're falling asleep .
Scientifically named hypnagogic myoclonic twitch , it 's also the third leading cause for embarrassment on sleepovers , behind bed - wetting and sleep farting .
The muscle spasm may be light enough to be misinterpreted as a dream or it can be so jarring it physically shakes you awake .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
It 's fairly common ( studies say around 70 percent of you have experienced it ) .
The likelihood is increased if a person is exhausted or is sleeping in an uncomfortable position .
That means the working poor and the homeless are probably more likely to experience a hypnic jerk , though scientists would probably rather not bother asking them .
As far as recognized members of society , the muscle twitch is a normal and well - documented event .
What causes it ?
Like any good freakish event , the experts can't agree on what causes it .
Most researchers feel that when muscles begin to slack while preparing for sleep the brain senses and misinterprets the relaxation signals , and assumes the body is falling .
A little presumptuous on the brain 's part to go around " assuming " you 're falling while lying down .
Then again it 's nice to know the most important organ is on the lookout for trapped doors with mattresses on top .
If you want to experience this feeling at your desk just lean back in your chair , a little past the point of no return .
Once gravity reminds you who 's boss your body enters that frenzied states of " lost - balance / I hope that girl I like is n't watching . "
The sensations are so physically comparable that the brain analyzes them the same .
« The South Carolina Debate | Main | On Electability » Meanwhile , There 's a War Going On
by Turkana
Anyone still paying attention knows that one of the keys to the relative decrease in violence , in Iraq , has been the unilateral six - month cease - fire , called by Moqtada al Sadr .
And he had been indicating that he would continue the cease - fire , when it expires , next month .
That could be changing .
As the McClatchy Newspapers reported : A police raid Saturday on an extremist Shiite Muslim mosque thought to be the headquarters of an extremist cult capped a weekend of violence in southern Iraq , while elsewhere tensions between Iraq 's Shiite - led government and renegade Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr continued to escalate .
Iraq 's national security advisor said he was briefly taken hostage Saturday in a Baghdad mosque and implied that his captors were Sadr supporters .
Mowaffak al Rubaie was released only after Iraq 's interior minister , who oversees the police , intervened .
In an e-mail to McClatchy , Rubaie said that Sadr 's followers " used the same tactics that they used before on Abdul Majid al Khoei . "
Sadrists were accused of fatally stabbing Khoei , a moderate young Shiite cleric who was considered a rival to Sadr , in 2003 .
A warrant for Sadr was issued in 2004 , but it 's never been executed , and he 's denied any involvement .
On Friday , a spokesman for Sadr warned that the cleric might not extend a six - month cease - fire by his Mahdi Army militia , which U.S. officials say has contributed to the reduction in violence in Iraq .
In a statement , Salah al Obeidi charged that rival Shiite militias have infiltrated Iraq 's security forces and that some senior security officials remain in their jobs although they 've been charged with human rights offenses .
" This will force us to reconsider the decision to extend the cease - fire despite repeated public statements in the past that we will , " Obeidi said .
In other words , all the happy talk about the " surge " working may soon come to an end .
But it 's all been lies , anyway .
As Joe Conason recently wrote :
As America marks the first anniversary of the troop escalation in Iraq , at least one thing has become clear .
Although the " surge " is failing as policy , it seems to be succeeding as propaganda .
Even as George W. Bush continues to bump and scrape along the bottom of public approval , significantly more people now believe we are " winning " the war .
What winning really means and whether that vague impression can be sustained are questions that the war 's proponents would prefer not to answer for the moment .
Their objective during this election year is simply to reduce public pressure for withdrawal , which is still the choice of an overwhelming majority of voters .
Conason points to the recovery of John McCain 's presidential campaign , which would not have been possible without the corporate media 's propaganda campaign on behalf of the " surge . "
The promotion of Bill Kristol from The Weekly Standard and Faux News to the less disreputable New York Times is highlighted as " proof that being hideously wrong is no obstacle to scaling the heights of American punditry . "
What has fallen far more sharply than the casualty statistics in Iraq is the standard for success there , as defined by neoconservatives like Mr. Kristol .
In the original promotional literature produced by these individuals and their associates , and recited by the president , this war was supposed to remake the Middle East into a showcase for democracy , with ruinous consequences for our terrorist enemies and cheaper oil for us -- and all for free because the Iraqi petroleum industry would cover all the costs .
Then came defining victory down .
The " surge " was supposed to give the Iraqis enough breathing room to resolve many of their differences .
Benchmarks .
Laws on fair distribution of oil revenues and political power .
In a recent Washington Post article , Thomas Ricks and Karen DeYoung had this interesting explanation :
In the year since President Bush announced he was changing course in Iraq with a troop " surge " and a new strategy , U.S. military and diplomatic officials have begun their own quiet policy shift .
After countless unsuccessful efforts to push Iraqis toward various political , economic and security goals , they have decided to let the Iraqis figure some things out themselves .
Which was an incredible tacit admission of what 's really going on in Iraq .
Bush and company decided to allow the Iraqis to solve their own problems , meaning they previously had n't allowed them to .
Meaning that the whole " sovereignty " thing was just a sham ?
As if anyone had n't known .
But it was interesting to get it so explicitly stated .
And , of course , the Iraqis have n't been solving anything .
The mess Bush has made in Iraq is not easily solved , and centuries - old rivalries are not easily resolved !
As Conason continued : Even those minimized objectives have yet to be met .
The oil - sharing statute is stalled in the Iraqi parliament , while Kurdish regional authorities make their own separate deals with foreign oil companies .
The Sunni militia organizations that we have armed to fight al - Qaida have been rejected by the Shiite central government .
The statute passed by the Iraqi parliament last week to reduce sanctions against former members of the Ba'ath Party , which was supposed to mollify the Sunni leadership , appears only to have alienated them further because they consider it fraudulent .
Worst of all , despite the undoubted courage and commitment of our troops , violence in Iraq has increased since the new year began .
Killings of civilians by car bombs and snipers averaged more than 50 per day during the first two weeks of January , and U.S. military deaths are averaging slightly more than one per day , or nearly 50 percent higher than last month .
So , things are maybe not going quite as well as the propaganda suggests .
Keith Olbermann recently interviewed Ricks , who is also the author of Fiasco : The American Military Adventure in Iraq : OLBERMANN :
If the goal of the surge was — as stated a year ago tonight — to prevent American blood being shed in Iraq , obviously , we could have accomplished that by never going there .
Likewise , the fictional Iraqi WMD was that phrase about the solutions for Iraqi problems rings oddly historically .
The problems that Mr. Bush caused here , Al - qaeda in Iraq , does not the concessions to Iraqi solutions amount to a declaration of surrender on the economic and political that the president claimed was worth thousands of American lives ?
RICKS : It certainly is a way of , kind of , moon walking away from those goals while still giving them a head nod and saying , “ Look , if this is not going to happen , let ‘s at least have these guys cobble together something so we can get out of here eventually . ”
OLBERMANN : So , a year later , when Senators Lieberman and McCain get all choked up how the surge has worked , are they apt or , at least , getting close to that old morbid joke about the doctor telling the family , “ Well , the operation was a success but , I ‘m afraid , I have to tell you the patient died ? ”
RICKS : Well , from their perspective , perhaps , the surge is a success .
As you said in the introduction , Iraq is no longer on the front pages everyday .
For some politicians , that might be exactly the definition of success they were looking for .
But , yes , judged on the terms in which the president presented it , the surge has not worked .
The purpose of the surge was to improve security .
But , to improve it to lead to a political breakthrough .
And that political breakthrough has not happened .
It was supposed to happen by last summer .
That was the theory of the surge .
So , the theory of the surge is now demonstrably false .
We ‘re in 2008 and it has n‘t happened .
So , there ‘s a big question : OK , if the breakthrough does n‘t happen , what do we do next ?
OLBERMANN : Do the Iraqis think it has worked ?
RICKS : I think , Iraqis recognize that large parts of Baghdad are more peaceful than they were .
But , violence is basically back to 2005 levels .
And , that was no picnic -- 2005 .
It ‘s just that 2006 was pure hell .
And now al Sadr is considering ending his cease - fire .
Which means pure hell may soon be returning .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States has reached a deal with the European Union , Japan and Canada to keep its Internet gambling market closed to foreign companies , but is continuing talks with India , Antigua and Barbuda , Macau and Costa Rica , U.S. trade officials said on Monday .

“ We are pleased to confirm that the United States has reached agreement ... with Canada , the EU and Japan , ” Gretchen Hamel , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative ’s office , said in a statement several hours after the EU had announced details of the deal it had reached with Washington .
The decision is a disappointment for European online gambling companies who hoped a case brought by Antigua several years ago at the World Trade Organization gave them a foothold to get back in the U.S. market after being kicked out by Congress last year .
In an April 2005 victory for Antigua , the WTO said a U.S. law allowing only domestic companies to provide horse - race gambling services discriminated against foreign firms .
But rather than open up the U.S. online horse - race gambling market , Congress tightened restrictions on other forms of Internet gambling last year by making it illegal for banks and credit card companies to make payments to online gambling sites .
The Bush administration also announced in May that it was retroactively excluding gambling and betting services from market - opening commitments it made as part of the 1994 world trade agreement , saying that U.S. trade negotiators had made a mistake by not expressly excluding them at the time .
That opened the door for the European Union and other trading partners to seek compensation from the United States in the form of increased access to another U.S. service market .
Hamel said the deal reached with the EU , Japan and Canada “ involves commitments to maintain our liberalized markets for warehousing services , technical testing services , research and development services and postal services relating to outbound international letters . ”
European gambling companies had argued the EU was entitled to as much as $ 100 billion in compensation for being denied access to the U.S. market .
But EU officials never publicly embraced that amount and U.S. official called it an exaggerated figure .
Hamel declined to say on Monday how much the deal was worth .
“ We ’re not going to get into that , ” she said .
For those of us who make a habit of predicting the future , the recent demise of HD - DVD was an inevitability .
Press reports indicated that a mere 600,000 standalone units had been sold to consumers .
My notes from last year ’s SXSW festival indicate that half a million total HD - DVD / Blu- Ray players were in the market — obviously , sales did n’t skyrocket .
After all the fanfare and hype , the consumer shrugged .
Of course , the consumer — or that portion of consumers who invested in HD - DVD technology — lost .
This does not bode well for the motion picture industry , and you ’ve got to wonder who will be fired for failing to gauge the mood of the DVD - purchasing public .
Just as many people predicted the disaster of the Iraq war , many of us saw how this made - up DVD format war would end .
When the home video market was in its infancy , the idea of renting or buying movies for home viewing was novel .
Formats jostled for supremacy : Laserdisc , Betamax , and VHS .
Eventually , VHS reigned supreme , and those who’d bet their libraries on other formats had to suck it up and repurchase the media or forego elements of their library .
DVD arrived with promises of near - viewing magic ; better , it heralded a cheaper - to - produce , cheaper - to - distribute media .
DVD marked a dramatic shift in consumer behavior .
The video rental market waned while the sell - through market ( where consumers were the final purchasers ) waxed .
Believing in the superiority of the format ( not to mention the more compact packaging ) , consumers turned their libraries over again .
VHS had a serious flaw : the product degraded over time .
DVDs did n’t ( seem to ) have that problem .
With VHS , there seemed to be a slower pace of product releases .
With DVD , more product hit the market at a greater pace .
This breathed new life into titles that were n’t selling in the various televisions markets .
Old series that did n’t work in syndication could be made available on DVD .
Movies that suffered from the necessary cutting for commercials and time were reborn as full - length features .
Disney , which had previously made a fortune on rereleasing library classics ( they were famous for “ retiring ” releases , making certain product unavailable for the foreseeable future ) , found that this more permanent format cut into library sales .
Disney also discovered that they could create a robust direct - to - video market to ease some of the pain that came from losing repeated sales of ” Robin Hood ” ( my family went through a good three copies of the VHS version during the youngest sister ’s obsessive RH period ) .
Disney ’s lesson soon resonated throughout the industry : library product was starting to lose value as the market grew saturated .
BluRay and HD - DVD were the next generation of DVDs for consumers .
More capacity , better pictures , all those lovely extras…how could the customer say no ?
You could blame the Internet and the promise of downloadable media for the lack of interest in the new formats , but I ’d suggest it ’s something much more logical : consumers had no appetite for investing in a format that might disappear in cloud of smoke tomorrow .
Making this even more teeth - gnashing for the motion picture studios was the fact that consumers had no need to reinvest in home entertainment product .
DVDs do last longer than VHS tapes .
The players are relatively cheap , and , I ’m going to be opinionated here , the extras that pack the disks are interesting , but not necessarily that interesting .
They do n’t really add all that much to the overall purchasing decision .
Sure , there are some exceptions .
There are always some exceptions .
HD - DVD was an extremely expensive experiment that showed what happens when there ’s no consumer demand , no consumer need , and no consumer trust .
That the studios and manufacturers could n’t work out their differences demonstrates how far removed both parties are from reality .
If you doubt me , just focus your attention on the ways online video is being treated .
If there are ways to make the experience less consumer - friendly , I ’m interested to learn how .
BluRay will continue to trudge along .
As consumers upgrade to new home entertainment systems , a Blu - Ray player will be considered as part of the package ( Jim laid out his thoughts on this shift so I do n’t have to ) .
Blu - Ray will also continue to find happiness as part of the PlayStation package and the go - to choice for personal computers .
Microsoft has pulled the plug on its own HD - DVD business and is now looking at possible next steps ( you can imagine the frustration at being forced to buy into technology created by the parent of its chief gaming rival ) .
Embracing of downloadable video will happen , though the potential exists for the studios to make a royal hash of that experience .
One thing remains certain : consumer trust of video technology wo n’t be easily regained .
SAN ANTONIO ( Reuters ) - Rising Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee risked his standing with Catholic voters on Sunday by courting his evangelical base at the church of a controversial preacher accused of disparaging Catholics .

There are a few remnants of anti-Catholicism among evangelical Christians in the South but the two sides have found much common political ground over the past three decades in their strident opposition to abortion and gay marriage .
But the visit to Cornerstone , pastor John Hagee ’s imposing “ mega - church ” in the Texas city of San Antonio , was fraught with political perils for Huckabee given his efforts to woo conservative Catholics .
Huckabee , a folksy former Arkansas governor and former Baptist preacher , has had a meteoric rise in opinion polls in recent weeks , largely because he has connected with the Republican Party ’s influential evangelical wing .
This puts him in serious contention with less than two weeks before the January 3 nomination battle in Iowa , which starts the state - by - state process to pick the Republican and Democratic candidates for November ’s presidential election .
Religion plays a big role in politics in the United States , where levels of belief and church attendance are much higher than in Europe .
Evangelicals number around 60 million in the country of 300 million people , while the Catholic population has been put at close to 70 million .
Taking a break from the Iowa campaign trail , Huckabee delivered a Christmas season sermon at Cornerstone about Christ ’s birth and embraced Hagee , calling him “ one of the great Christian leaders of our nation . ”
Hagee is a fiery preacher best known for his writings on the Middle East , where he reads contemporary events as unfolding Biblical prophecy .
He is staunchly pro-Israel , saying that God had made his love for the land and its people clear .
The Catholic League says Hagee is virulently anti-Catholic -- a charge he denies -- and it is getting the word out that Huckabee is rubbing shoulders with an anti-Vatican figure .
Huckabee ’s campaign insisted his visit to Hagee ’s church should in no way be taken as a slight to Catholics .
“ Three members of the senior leadership of the campaign are Catholic , including our national chairman .
Gov. Huckabee is committed to being a leader of all Americans , ” said Charmaine Yoest , one of his senior advisers .
CATHOLIC ANGER
But some Catholics were angry about the visit .
“ Hagee has a history of denigrating the Catholic religion , ” said Bill Donohue , president of the Catholic League , the largest Catholic civil rights group in the United States .
In his recent book “ Jerusalem Countdown , ” Hagee wrote : “ Most readers will be shocked by the clear record of history linking Adolf Hitler and the Roman Catholic Church in a conspiracy to exterminate the Jews . ”
In the same book , Hagee did applaud the late Pope John Paul II ’s efforts to reach out to Jews .
But Catholic bloggers on the Internet were mostly critical about Huckabee ’s visit .
The Catholic News Agency ran the headline : “ Mike Huckabee to speak at strongly anti-Catholic preacher ’s church . ”
One Catholic blogger said while Huckabee was an eloquent spokesman for the “ culture of life ” -- code for the anti-abortion cause -- his visit to “ a church pastored by a raving anti-Catholic bigot ” was deeply troubling .
At Cornerstone , Huckabee ’s appearance went down well with the crowd of several thousand worshipers , who frequently interrupted his remarks with loud applause .
“ I think he is a good and godly man , ” said Suzanne Ramirez .
But asked whether she planned to vote for Huckabee in the Texas primary in March , Ramirez said she had not made up her mind .
Huckabee said earlier on Sunday on the CBS show “ Face the Nation ” that he was running to be president of the entire United States , not just the Christian community .
“ That ’s how I served as governor , ” he said .
“ People look at my record and they did n’t see that I put a tent out on the capital grounds and had healing services and I did n’t replace the dome with a steeple . ”
In a speech to US war veterans in Reno , Nevada , Mr Bush renewed his accusations that Tehran has provided training and weapons for extremists in Iraq .
Earlier , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned that US authority in the region was rapidly collapsing , and Iran would help fill the void .
" Soon , we will see a huge power vacuum in the region , " Mr Ahmadinejad said .
" Of course , we are prepared to fill the gap , with the help of neighbours and regional friends like Saudi Arabia , and with the help of the Iraqi nation . "
' Murderous activities '
In his speech to the American Legion , Mr Bush hit back , accusing Iran 's Revolutionary Guards of funding and arming insurgents in Iraq .
Iran 's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere
President Bush
US ' seizes Iranian group in Iraq '
And he said Iran 's leaders could not avoid some responsibility for attacks on coalition troops and Iraqi civilians .
" I have authorised our military commanders in Iraq to confront Tehran 's murderous activities , " he said .
The BBC's Justin Webb , in Washington , says this looks like a conscious effort by the White House to elevate the tension between Washington and Tehran to a new level .
Such an effort might be designed to avoid the need for armed conflict or might equally be an effort to bring that conflict about , our correspondent says .
The Iranian authorities have consistently denied accusations that they are helping militants in Iraq .
Shortly after Mr Bush made his address , Iranian officials reported that seven Iranians working for the country 's electricity ministry had been arrested in Baghdad by US forces .
' Nuclear threat '
In a wide - ranging speech , Mr Bush also tackled the issue of Iran 's nuclear ambition - which Tehran insists is solely to provide power , but the US believes may be used to develop weapons .
HAVE YOUR SAY Lots of accusations , but absolutely no evidence to support them .
He 's not even taking the trouble to make any evidence up this time !

" Iran 's active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust , " he said .
" Iran 's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere .
" We will confront this danger before it is too late . "
It was Mr Bush 's second major speech on foreign policy in a week .
Correspondents say he is seeking to rally support for the so - called surge strategy of sending more troops to Iraq .

Can Trivia & Facts
The steamboat Bertrand was heavily laden with provisions when it set out on the Missouri River in 1865 , destined for the gold mining camps in Fort Benton , Mont .
The boat snagged and swamped under the weight , sinking to the bottom of the river .
It was found a century later , under 30 feet of silt a little north of Omaha , Neb .
Among the canned food items retrieved from the Bertrand in 1968 were brandied peaches , oysters , plum tomatoes , honey , and mixed vegetables .
In 1974 , chemists at the National Food Processors Association ( NFPA ) analyzed the products for bacterial contamination and nutrient value .
Although the food had lost its fresh smell and appearance , the NFPA chemists detected no microbial growth and determined that the foods were as safe to eat as they had been when canned more than 100 years earlier .
The nutrient values varied depending upon the product and nutrient .
NFPA chemists Janet Dudek and Edgar Elkins report that significant amounts of vitamins C and A were lost .
But protein levels remained high , and all calcium values " were comparable to today 's products . "
NFPA chemists also analyzed a 40 - year - old can of corn found in the basement of a home in California .
Again , the canning process had kept the corn safe from contaminants and from much nutrient loss .
In addition , Dudek says , the kernels looked and smelled like recently canned corn .
The canning process is a product of the Napoleonic wars .
Malnutrition was rampant among the 18th century French armed forces .
As Napoleon prepared for his Russian campaign , he searched for a new and better means of preserving food for his troops and offered a prize of 12,000 francs to anyone who could find one .
Nicolas Appert , a Parisian candy maker , was awarded the prize in 1809 .
Although the causes of food spoilage were unknown at the time , Appert was an astute experimenter and observer .
For instance , after noting that storing wine in airtight bottles kept it from spoiling , he filled widemouth glass bottles with food , carefully corked them , and heated them in boiling water .
The durable tin can -- and the use of pottery and other metals -- followed shortly afterwards , a notion of Englishman Peter Durand .
Soon , these " tinned " foods were used to feed the British army and navy .
The canned food principle that won Nicolas Appert his prize of 12,000 francs has endured over the years .
What might surprise Appert , however , is how his discovery is making food shopping and storing easier for the 20th century consumer .
Those who order coffee at fast food restaurants now also are served canned half - and - half , which has been transported and stored without concern about refrigeration .
Hikers can take flexible pouches of canned food on backpacking trips without having to worry about saving water to reconstitute freeze - dried meals .
And , in this society of microwave owners , Americans who do n't have time to prepare a well - balanced meal can pick up a plastic container filled with a canned , nutritious dinner .

An implementation of Relax NG schema validation written in Common Lisp , including support for compact syntax , DTD Compatibility , and the XSD type library .
cxml-rng was written by David Lichteblau and is designed as an add - on library for Closure XML .
It is available under an X11 - style license .
Please send bug reports to cxml-devel@common-lisp.net ( list information ) .
Download and Installation
Download a cxml-rng tarball .
cxml-rng needs Closure XML , CL - PPCE , CL - Yacc , parse - number , and cl- base64 .
ASDF is used for compilation .
Register the .asd file , e.g. by symlinking it , then compile cxml - rng using asdf: operate .
$ ln - sf `pwd`/cxml-rng.asd / path/to/your/registry / * ( asdf:operate ' asdf:load-op : cxml-rng )
Implementation - specific notes
At this point , cxml-rng is written to work with Lisp strings ( as opposed to runes and rods ) , and is meant to be used on Lisp implementations with Unicode support .
Documentation
API documentation is available .
Example
Use cxml-rng : parse - schema to parse a Relax NG schema file .
The resulting schema object is a representation of a simplified schema using Lisp objects , which has gone through simplification as described the Relax NG specification .
cxml -rng : serialize - schema can be used to write a Relax NG file in XML syntax for this grammar .
In order to validate XML against a schema , create a validation handler for the grammar using cxml - rng : make - validator .
The validation handler processes SAX events and can be used with any function generating such events , in particular with cxml : parse - file .
( cxml : parse - file " example.xml " ( cxml-rng : make - validator ( cxml-rng : parse - schema # p" example.rng " ) ) )
The validator accepts another SAX handler as an optional second argument .
For example , to parse XML into DOM while also validating it , use the validator like this :
( cxml : parse - file " example.xml " ( cxml- rng : make - validator ( cxml-rng : parse - schema # p" example.rng " ) ( cxml - dom : make - dom - builder ) ) )
When using the klacks parser , create a validating source .
( klacks : with - open - source ( s ( cxml-rng : make - validating - source # p" example.xml " ( cxml-rng : parse - schema # p" example.rng " ) ) ) ( loop for key = ( klacks : peek - next s ) while key do ( print key ) ) )
DTD Compatibility processing ( basically , checking of IDs and addition of default values ) is done using a DTD Compatibility handler .
You can use this handler together with a validator or by its own .
( cxml : parse - file " example.xml " ( cxml- rng : make - dtd- compatibility - handler ( cxml-rng : parse - schema # p" example.rng " ) ( cxml - dom : make - dom - builder ) ) )

Use of the interrogation technique known as " waterboarding " was approved by the White House and gets results , a former CIA agent admitted yesterday .
The technique - which simulates drowning - was used against Al Qaeda captives with success , John Kiriakou told a U.S. TV network .
The one - time CIA interrogator is the first to speak out about the " torture " methods that have earned President George Bush 's administration worldwide condemnation .
Scroll down for more ...
The White House has denied torture is used on terror suspects , but Mr Kiriakou said waterboarding " broke " one stubbornly silent Al Qaeda recruiter after just 35 seconds .
Waterboarding involves wrapping plastic or fabric around a detainee 's face then pouring water over the top until it is forced up the nose and down the throat to simulate drowning .
Suspects are told they will die if they do not talk .
And although the technique is supposed to be low - risk , critics say it can result in long - lasting psychological damage , injury to the lungs and even , in extreme cases , death .
Mr Kiriakou told the ABC network that he had fought an " intellectual battle " in his mind over the use of waterboarding , and had concluded that it is justified as it saves lives by preventing terror attacks .
" This is n't something done willy - nilly , " he added .
" This was a policy made at the White House , with concurrence from the National Security Council and Justice Department . "
Scroll down for more ...
Mr Kiriakou told how waterboarding was used on Zayn Abu Zubaida , the first high - ranking Al Qaeda member captured after the September 11 attacks in 2001 .
Abu Zubaida was seized in a gun battle in Pakistan in the spring of 2002 .
For weeks he refused to talk and remained ideologically zealous , defiant and unco-operative .
Then he was flown to a secret CIA prison - believed to be in Afghanistan - and strapped to a board with his feet in the air .
Cellophane was wrapped around the Al Qaeda man 's face and water was forced up his nose and into his throat to make him think he was drowning .
The suspect lasted only 35 seconds before he broke .
" It was like flipping a switch , " said Mr Kiriakou .
" From that day on , he answered every question .
The threat information he provided disrupted a number of attacks , maybe dozens of attacks .
" Like a lot of Americans , I 'm involved in this internal , intellectual battle with myself weighing the idea that waterboarding may be torture versus the quality of information that we often get .
" I struggle with it .
" At the time , I felt that waterboarding was something that we needed to do . "
Mr Kiriakou said he did not interrogate Abu Zubaida , but learned the details from colleagues .
His account came as the U.S. Congress began questioning CIA director Michael Hayden yesterday about why the agency destroyed at least two videotapes of controversial interrogations .
Many senators believe it was done to hide evidence of illegal torture that could have been used against CIA agents in a war crimes tribunal .
General Hayden , speaking to the closed - doors Congress hearing yesterday was expected to say that CIA lawyers ruled that the interrogations were legal and the tapes were destroyed in 2005 to protect the identities of CIA employees who appear on them .
The torture scandal is likely to become a major issue in next year 's presidential election .
Abu Zubaida - who says he was coerced into making false confessions - was eventually moved to the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where he is now held in solitary confinement .
He is likely to be tried next year on terrorism charges and the CIA expects that he will spend the rest of his life in custody .
Mr Kiriakou , a 14 - year veteran of the CIA who worked in both the analysis and operations divisions , left in 2004 and works as a consultant for a private Washington - based firm .
Although there is unquestionably much left to be discovered about life on Earth , charismatic animals like mammals are usually well documented , and it is rare to find a new species today — especially from a group as intriguing as the elephant - shrews , monogamous mammals found only in Africa with a colorful history of misunderstood ancestry .
Like shrews , these small , furry mammals eat mostly insects .
Early scientists named them elephant - shrews not because they thought the animals were related to elephants but because of their long , flexible snouts .
Ironically , recent molecular research has shown that they are actually more closely related to elephants than to shrews .
Members of a supercohort called Afrotheria that evolved in Africa over 100 million years ago , their relatives include elephants , sea cows , and the aardvark .
Until recently , only 15 species of elephant - shrews , also called sengis to avoid confusion with true shrews , were known to science .

In March of 2006 , Galen Rathbun of the California Academy of Sciences , Francesco Rovero of the Trento Museum of Natural Sciences , and a team of collaborators confirmed the existence of a new species that lives only in two high - altitude forest blocks in the mountains of south - central Tanzania .
“ This is one of the most exciting discoveries of my career , ” said Rathbun , who has studied the ecology , social structure , and evolution of sengis for more than 30 years .
“ It is the first new species of giant elephant - shrew to be discovered in more than 126 years .
From the moment I first lifted one of the animals into our photography tent , I knew it must be a new species — not just because of its distinct coloring , but because it was so heavy ! ”
The new species , which has been named the grey - faced sengi Rhynchocyon udzungwensis , weighs about 700 grams ( 1.5 pounds ) , which is more than 25 percent larger than any other known sengi .

The new sengi was first caught on film in 2005 , when Francesco Rovero of the Trento Museum of Natural Sciences in Italy set up camera traps inside the remote Ndundulu Forest in Tanzania ’s Udzungwa Mountains , where he was surveying the region ’s forest mammals .
When the cameras recorded an elephant - shrew that looked unfamiliar , he sent the photos to Rathbun for identification , who determined that the colorful animal appeared to be a new species .
In March of 2006 , they embarked on a two - week expedition with a team of colleagues to search for specimens to confirm the discovery .
Although it was supposed to be the dry season , the rains came early , and the traps they had brought with them turned out to be too small for the surprisingly large sengis .
But with perseverance and the help of some traditional twine snares , they were able to capture four animals and make 40 observations , confirming the presence of a new species .
Its unique features include a distinctive grey face and a jet - black lower rump , as well as a large body size .
So far , the new giant sengi ( Rhynchocyon udzungwensis ) is known to exist in only two populations that cover about 300 square kilometers ( 115 square miles ) of forest in Tanzania .
The other three species in the genus Rhynchocyon are also rare due to restricted and fragmented forest habitats — one is listed as endangered by the IUCN , another is listed as near - threatened , and the third is on the vulnerable list .

The Udzungwa Mountains are part of a series of ancient and isolated mountain blocks stretching from southern Kenya to south - central Tanzania .
The age , isolation and fragmented nature of the forests in these mountains have combined to produce high levels of biodiversity , including many species that cannot be found anywhere else on Earth .
In recent years , a number of other new species have been found there , including the Udzungwa partridge , the Phillips ’ Congo shrew , a monkey known as the kipunji , and several amphibians and reptiles .
“ This new discovery highlights how exceptionally important the Udzungwa Mountain rain forests are , and how little we know about them , ” said Rovero .
The newly discovered grey - faced sengi is just one of many species in need of protection in the Udzungwa Mountains , which serve as an important dry - season refuge for many animals from adjacent areas .
A recent survey suggests that the few remaining wildlife corridors linking the mountains to surrounding protected areas are critically threatened , and will be lost by the end of 2009 without intervention .

Recent conservation efforts have resulted in the establishment of the Kilombero Nature Reserve , raising hopes for enhanced long - term protection of some important forests , including Ndundulu where the new sengi was found .
Still , without more funding , the legal protection afforded by the reserve will be difficult to enforce .
“ We hope that new discoveries like ours will help bolster efforts to conserve this spectacular ecosystem , ” says Rathbun .
Additional collaborators and expedition members included Andrew Perkin of Oxford Brookes University , Trevor Jones of Anglia Ruskin University , David Ribble of Trinity University , and Nike Doggart , Charles Leonard and Ruben Mwakisoma of the Tanzania Forest Conservation Group .
Funding was provided by the National Geographic Society , the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund and the Trento Museum of Natural Sciences , Italy .

Microfluidics
Shrinky Dink Devices
Children 's toy simplifies fabrication of molds for microfluidic devices
A new method makes fabricating microfluidic devices almost as easy as child 's play .
Michelle Khine and her coworkers at the University of California , Merced , and UC Berkeley , use the children 's toy Shrinky Dinks to construct molds for microfluidic devices ( Lab Chip , DOI : 10.1039/b711622e ) .
Khine and coworkers have used the method to make a functional microfluidics - based gradient generator and are working on other devices .
When Khine , an assistant professor of engineering , arrived at UC Merced a year ago , she did n't have the equipment set up to do standard photolithography , which is currently used to make microfluidic devices .
" I 'm not a very patient person , so I did n't want to wait around for all the equipment to be set up before my lab got up and running , " she says .
Playing around in her kitchen at home , she realized that she might be able to make channels by using Shrinky Dinks , which had been her favorite toy as a young child .
Lab Chip © 2007 TOY TECHNIQUE Shrinky
Dinks were used to fabricate the mold for this gradient generator , made of polydimethylsiloxane and filled with food dye .
Khine 's team makes those channels by printing patterns for microfluidic devices on the polystyrene thermoplastic Shrinky Dinks using a standard laser - jet printer .
When heated to 163 ??C for three to five minutes , the printed features shrink approximately 63 % .
At the same time , the height of the features increases fivefold .
The researchers then use the shrunken features as a rigid mold for soft lithography .
The shrunken Shrinky Dinks replace commonly used silicon wafer molds , which must be made by photolithographic patterning .
The microfluidic devices Khine and coworkers make have channels as narrow as 65 µm and as deep as 80 µm .
The entire fabrication process from design to finished device takes less than half an hour .
Khine thinks that the resolution could be improved by using a better printer .
The thermoplastic molds are faster and cheaper to make than are ones made with standard photolithography .
Also , Khine can buildup multiple feature heights on the same device by reprinting some channels and not others , whereas different channel heights are time - consuming to create by standard photolithography .
And the thermoplastic technique intrinsically creates rounded channels , which are necessary for microfluidic pneumatic valves .
Standard photolithographic techniques tend to produce rectilinear features .
The new fabrication method " opens up the microfluidics field to an even wider range of research groups , " says Noo Li Jeon , associate professor of biomedical engineering at the UC Irvine .
" Anyone with a laser printer can now make microfluidic chips . "
This post started life as an email .
John Gabriele wrote me after a one - liner comment in which I recommended Git to him in a thread on use .
perl , asking why I chose it over various other DVCS s. I did n’t have plans to write a novel , but things just kept coming to me .
I did n’t need to edit much either , it mostly came out in this form – I guess I had more to say than I knew .
So , why did I ?
Among the systems I did look into , there are really just two contenders : Git and Mercurial .
All the other systems track metadata ; Git and hg just track content and infer the metadata .
By tracking metadata I mean that these systems keep a record of what steps were taken .
“ This file had its name changed . ”
“ Those modifications came from that file in that branch . ”
“ This file was copied from that file . ”
Tracking content alone means doing none of that .
When you commit , the VCS just records what the tree looks like .
It does n’t care about how the tree got that way .
When you ask it about two revisions , it looks at the tree beforehand and the tree afterwards , and figures out what happened inbetween .
A file is not a unit that defines any sort of boundary in this view .
The VCS always looks at entire trees ; files have no individual identity separate from their trees at all .
As a consequence , whether you used VCS tools to manipulate your working copy or regular command line utilities or applied a patch or whatever is irrelevant .
The resulting history is always the same .
Another consequence , at least with Git , is that it can track the movement of things smaller than a file , e.g. a single function being moved from one file to another .
And that sub - file level tracking in Git is an example of how , if the VCS is improved and its tracking becomes more intelligent , your entire repository instantly benefits from this .
A metadata tracking system ca n’t do that because the old part of your repository did n’t have the necessary metadata recorded .
A file - based VCS ca n’t do that because it does n’t have an innate understanding that there are interrelationships between files .
So that ’s why the only contenders are Git and Mercurial .
And between the two , Git has the better repository format – it ’s much more robust ( designed to make changes inherently atomic ) and despite all this , is simpler than the repo format of any other VCS .
It ’s also efficient – an entire repository with all of the project history will often take less space than a Subversion checkout .
( But Git needs periodic , manually - initiated vacuuming , say every couple of weeks or so , else it will grow as you work ; Mercurial ’s repo format is slightly more efficient and it does n’t have that issue .
But it ’s not inherently robust , and observing a repository while changes are under way will reveal inconsistent data . )
Another reason for me to choose
Git is that it ’s rapidly gaining popularity .
Among the DVCS s , it ’s probably the most popular , followed closely by Mercurial .
( Git is used by the Linux kernel ( of course ) and Freedesktop.org ; Mercurial was chosen by the Mozilla Foundation and Sun Microsystems . )
The rest are stragglers .
Lastly , the thing that really swayed me is git-svn .
This is an integration tool that lets you check out from and push back to a Subversion repository , while working in a Git repository on your own machine .
The integration with Subversion is incredibly slick .
This means you can use
Git rather than SVK ( which is a castle built on sand ) to get your DVCS y goodness when working on a project that uses Subversion .
But I do n’t do any fancy stuff with my VCS
You do n’t have to use Git for anything fancy to appreciate it .
Have you ever run into the situation that you were working on something , and noticed that there was a small unrelated change you ’d also like to make ?
What to do – dirty the current checkin by including an unrelated change ?
Make a note and wait until after you ’re done with the current work ?
Make a patch from the current changes , revert them , fix the small thing , commit , and reapply the patch ?
Continue working and use some kind of patch cherry - picking tool to untangle the changes later ( hoping that no hunks will contain bits of both changes ) ?
It ’s a pain .
Fear no longer , though , for Git makes this easy : “ git stash ” puts away your current changes and reverts your working copy .
You fix the little thing , commit , then “ git stash apply ” and “ git stash clear ” .
Voilà !
You can go back to working on the big change without any of the hassle – awesome .
By the way , notice how “ git stash apply ” and “ git stash clear ” are separate steps ?
That ’s because you can stash away multiple changesets on top of each other , should you need to .
It ’s brilliant .
You may be wondering : this is a nice feature and all , but what in particular does it demonstrate ?
The answer to that is that it ’s only possible in the form it takes in Git because Git is a DVCS and as such concentrates on making it easy to merge branches .
What you do with “ git stash ” is internally a branch and merge , though a lightweight one with a very simple user interface – something that Subversion cannot trivially emulate , simple as it may seem ( whereas Mercurial has a very similar feature , called Mercurial Queues ) .
Another nice thing for which you do n’t have to want to do anything fancy : because pushing your commits to your central project repository is a conscious act in a DVCS , not something that happens automatically for every commit , you can rewrite history with wild abandon as long as you have n’t published it for the world to see .
You can easily remove or fix commits where you made a mistake .
I occasionally forget to tell the VCS about all new files , f.ex. , so some go missing from the commit ( no matter how diligently I use “ $vcs status ” to check whether I forgot anything ) .
Git in particular makes that sort of thing very easy to fix , which is fabulously handy .
There is more – more than I can think of off the top of my head right now .
DVCS will make your life easier in tons of little ways even if you are n’t looking to work in a highly decentralised manner with lots of branches , and Git is rapidly picking up features to let you exploit the advantages of a DVCS in this low - key , everyday , get - out - of - the - way manner .
( F.ex. , that stash feature ?
New in 1.5 which has only been out for a little while . )
Is n’t Git just something Linus cooked up for the kernel ?
The story started there , but a few pages have been turned since .
Linus wanted a system that could support the kernel process , which in many respects is an order of magnitude ( or several ) more demanding than that of most other libre software projects .
So he concentrated on writing a system that he would want to use , which meant setting down a rock solid foundation without regard for how easy it was for other people to pick up .
The first cut was rough to use as first cuts are wont to be , which established its reputation .
By virtue of it being used for the kernel , though , Git got a large community very quickly .
They have since been improving the software at breakneck speed , so today it is no longer any harder to understand or use than any other DVCS .
Its rock solid foundation , in contrast , remains .
Internally it has n’t changed much since that very first cut .
So it is now a viable system for anyone .
Well , almost – there ’s no good native Windows port yet .
However , see above with regard to breakneck pace .
Work is progressing , and I expect msysgit to be eminently usable within a couple months .
F ull - time freelancing : 10 things learned in 180 days
~ 28 November 2005 ~
This Friday will welcome two special events : 1 ) the birthday of my beloved wife ( Happy B- day Suzanne ! ) and 2 ) the 6 - month mark of freelancing full - time .
The first was an extremely solid decision — gratitude overflows at the thought of her saying ‘ yes ’ more than 7 years ago .
The second , however , was a veritable leap of faith .
I was physically and mentally tired from several years of doing the day job / side work thing , I ’m the sole provider for our family , and our fourth son was to be born just 2 days after making the leap .
Somehow it ’s all worked out .
We ’ve continued to pay the bills .
There ’s no shortage of requests for work .
And I ’ve enjoyed recapturing my evenings and Saturdays , filled with family and personal time .
Thus , here are 10 things learned over the last 6 months .
This topic has been exhausted elsewhere by many others , so I hope I ’ve avoided duplicating what ’s already been said .
1 . Err on the side of abundant contact .
If choosing among infrequent contact vs. abundant contact with clients , always offer more than less .
Currently only 2 of my clients reside in Utah .
The rest are scattered abroad .
That typically means a remote working environment , in which email , IM , and phone replace traditional face - to - face or in - house interaction .
Do whatever each project requires to ensure clients feel cared for and attended to .
I ’ve even held daily phone calls with clients over an extended period of time when it meant keeping a project on task .
2. Care for the future .
It ’s extremely easy to get caught up in client work in the present and fail to give proper attention to the marketing of one ’s business in the future .
Roughly 90 % of my work comes as a result my site , and I ’d be foolish to fail to author articles or other fresh content .
However , my writing has slowed at times because of workload , and it ’s a constant battle to ensure I keep a fresh presence .
Set aside at least one - half day a week to promoting your business , whether that means cold calling , blogging , direct marketing , or other forms of self - promotion .
3 . Care for the present .
A charge to care for the future comes only with the harsh reality of caring for the present .
It ’s impossible to be concerned about future business without first successfully executing what ’s already on the table .
Work in progress is by far the better revenue stream when compared to potential prospects that may or may not pan out , so treat existing clients with care .
4. Avoid Monday deadlines .
A while back I asked many of you to test 37 signal ’s newly launched Writeboard by answering the question , “ Mondays : Excellent or lousy for deadlines ? ”
( You can still access the board here by entering the password “ authentic ” . )
I ’m not certain this is the best use of Writeboard , but the exercise was worth the effort .
Some of you argued for Monday deadlines , others against .
My take ?
Unless the thought of spending your weekend behind a PC gets you giddy , you ’d be wise to avoid Monday .
I , for one , made the leap to freelance precisely to avoid working the weekends .
A Monday deadline is anything but elusive of weekend client work .
Sure , I ’ve had to work my share of Saturdays since making the leap — it ’s inevitable at times .
But when I have any say in a deadline or the preparation thereof , I avoid Mondays at all costs .
5 . Be cautious responding to emails outside business hours .
Though I typically check email on Saturdays and evenings , I tend not to respond unless urgent .
I ’m cognizant of the fact that if I respond on a Saturday at 2 pm or a Wednesday evening at 9 pm , that gives every reason for others to assume I work any and all hours of the day .
Again , I made the leap to avoid hectic work schedules , and I make every attempt to let others know that my availability comes without restriction during normal business hours but on a limited basis after hours .
6. Say ‘ no ’ as often as you say ‘ yes ’ .
I quoted Michael Porter in my ALA article and I ’ll do so again here : “ The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do . ”
Realize that every project you say ‘ yes ’ to inevitably locks up time that may or may not be better spent elsewhere in terms of project revenue , portfolio depth , and overall work satisfaction .
It ’s a game of opportunity cost , so be sure you ’re choosing those projects that maximize a ) the talent you offer clients and b ) what you take home at the end of the day .
7 . Make project expenses justify themselves .
Often a project requires expenses for “ raw ” materials ( e.g. stock photography ) or additional contractor assistance .
When these occasions arise , do your best to anticipate these expenses when bidding , and disclose them accordingly .
Should they arise halfway through a project , discuss them with the client to see if a bid addenda is warranted .
If not , evaluate the necessity of the expense , if it ca n’t be included aside from other allocated costs ( your time , taxes , etc. ) , consider alternatives .
Do n’t rob Peter ’s up - front payment on Project X to pay for Paul ’s raw materials on Project Y .
It ’s simply good business practice to force each expense to be paid for by the project it ’s tied to .
8. Beware the inevitable check delay .
Though I ’d been doing side work for over 5 years before making the leap , I do n’t know that I was as prepared as I could have been to deal with check delays .
Think about it :
You submit an invoice .
Your contact submits the invoice for payment .
The check is cut .
The check is mailed .
You deposit the check .
Your bank may or may not place a hold .
The cash is finally available .
Typical , right ?
Well , it ’s not so bad when it ’s side work , but when it ’s your sole income , you better prepare accordingly .
I ’ve had the invoice to cash - in - hand cycle take up to 60 days before , regardless of net 30 , late fees , or other terms I ’ve assessed .
Have enough cash in the bank to fill in gaps between cycles , or consider alternative payment methods ( e.g. PayPal ) .
9 . Be chummy with your point of contact .
Speaking of potential client point - of - contacts , if you do n’t a ) get along well with him or her and b ) think he or she is web savvy , you might avoid the project altogether .
I ca n’t stress how crucial a good point - of - contact is in determining the outcome of a project .
I ’ve been fortunate to have stellar contacts for the duration of my freelancing .
Be sure it ’s someone you can establish a good relationship with and someone you can confide in driving the project forward wisely and timely .
10 .
Do n’t leap without solid footing .
Some of you have sent emails in recent months , most of which began like this : “ I ’ve been thinking about going solo … ”
If I did n’t say it in my response to you , I ’ll say it here :
Do n’t make the leap until you ’ve got the necessary experience and exposure to make it all happen .
I said earlier that my leap was one of faith , and though it was , I was also quite confident the timing was right .
I had the necessary experience ( portfolio , client roll , variety of projects ) and exposure ( Google search , incoming links , readership ) to leave the ground with solid footing , as ironic as that sounds .
Had I made the leap a year earlier , I imagine I ’d be back at a day job by now .
So leap when you ’re confident you ’ll land smoothly .
Hope that helps some of you aspiring to full - time contract work .
Here ’s to another solid 6 months .
