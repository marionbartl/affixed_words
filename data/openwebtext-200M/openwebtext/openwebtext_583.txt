[ Update : The attack was made - up ! ]
The Smoking Gun found the Twitter stream of the John McCain campaign volunteer who reported being attacked by a Barack Obama supporter earlier tonight .
The volunteer , Ashley Todd , was blogging just before and after the incident , and her Twitter posts were available to the public up until a few hours ago , when she set them to private .
That 's probably prudent : a presidential campaign trying to peel working - class voters away from the Democrats probably does n't want people getting the wrong idea about what it means when one of its volunteers calls Little Italy " the wrong side of Pittsburgh . "
Todd surely meant she was on the " wrong " side of town because it was the opposite of where she wanted to be , geographically .
Not because she was scared of bitter poors and so forth .
Right ?
Because Bloomington , where Todd was attacked , is described by a historian ( cited on Wikipedia ) not as a ghetto but as " a feast , as rich to the eyes as the homemade tortellini and cannoli in its shop windows are to the stomach . "
Judging from the ShoppingBloomfield.com website , that description sounds like it remains accurate to this day , what with the gourmet bistro , art gallery , antique store and farmer 's market .
Google Maps has a street - level panoramic picture of the intersection where the attack occurred ( click the white arrows to move around ) .
The ATM is across from a church and some nice - looking houses and next to a sports supplements store , clothing shop and Italian - themed cafe .
Across the street is a Thai place .
Does n't look like too bad a neighborhood .
But one never knows when and where a random act of violence might occur !
Although you would think the political revolutionary thugs would be more at home in , say , Philadelphia .
Maybe they dispatch the dyslexic , backwards - " B " carving ones to Pittsburgh ?
UPDATE : As Wonkette , reports , you can still see the Twitter stream here .
And as one of our commenters points out , even Michelle Malkin is n't buying the story .

Police did n’t have to look for some Knox County drug suspects during a roundup Monday .
Several turned themselves in early .
A grand jury indicted 23 people in a five - month investigation Friday .
The names of those indicted were read in open court , a standard way to handle grand - jury returns .
What happened next was n’t exactly standard , though .
According to some of those indicted , employees at the courthouse called to let them know they ’d been charged , said Dan Smoot , law enforcement director with Operation UNITE .
Some suspects apparently left town .
Others came to the courthouse to post bond before being arrested .
By late Monday afternoon , 11 people had been arrested in the case .
Of those , seven had turned themselves in , said Karen Engle , president and CEO of UNITE .
That meant police could n’t look for evidence during surprise searches at their homes or try to interview people during searches to get additional information .
Having suspected drug dealers know police were likely coming for them also was potentially dangerous to officers , Engle said .
“ It ’s very disappointing that this information was made available ahead of time , ” she said .
Police will consider changes for potential future roundups .

John McCain , Republican candidate for US President , has joined his Democratic opponent Barack Obama in explaining how his administration would tackle science , technology and the environment .
McCain has previously distanced himself from fellow Republican George Bush on scientific issues .
He thinks the US should do more to combat climate change , wants more research done on embryonic stem cells , and opposes drilling in Arctic nature reserves .
But the selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate raised questions over his pro-science credentials .
The Alaskan governor promotes the teaching of creationism in schools , and her church believes it is possible to ' convert ' homosexuals to heterosexuality .
She claimed that the " jury 's still out " on whether humans cause climate change , and McCain himself has now changed his mind on offshore drilling , backing the right of individual states to explore for oil .
Although Obama answered a list of questions posed by leading figures in American science two weeks earlier , McCain 's supporters will hope that his belated response can answer some of his critics .
The full list of answers from both candidates can be found on www.sciencedebate2008.com.
The website is a grass - roots initiative led by a number of scientists , and it received more than 38,000 questions for the candidates from members of the public , from which 14 were chosen .
These are some of the highlights from their answers .
To tackle climate change , McCain says he will introduce a cap - and - trade system with the target of a 60 % reduction from 1990 levels by 2050 .
However , that figure falls short of the 80 % recommended by the IPCC – which Obama says he would meet , using the same methods .
On energy , McCain wants market - driven renewable energy sources , and a huge ( unrealistic ? ) expansion in nuclear power .
Obama , while also backing nuclear power , has impressed the green lobby by saying he will invest in cleaner energy to the tune of $ 150 bn over 10 years .
Both candidates support overturning President Bush 's ban on creating new cell lines for stem cell research , but make clear that they favour the use of unwanted eggs from fertility clinics for the research .
Obama may have disappointed many scientists by not explicitly saying he will allow the use of eggs specifically created for such research , but some were concerned by McCain 's hints that he would criminalise the practice .
Obama claims that the nation 's space programme is important , particularly for confronting scientific and technical problems here on Earth .
McCain , though , is noticeably more enthusiastic .
He wants NASA to begin a " new era " of human space exploration , and is very keen on completing the US lab on the International Space Station .
Still , given his antagonism towards Russia and China , his motivations in " ensuring the US remains a leader " in space exploration could reflect concerns over those countries ' extra-terrestrial activities , rather than scientific endeavour .
For now , Obama seems to be slightly more progressive on the issues .
But the real praise must go to the citizen - driven ScienceDebate2008 website , for making both candidates engage with science so comprehensively .
Sept. 25 , 2008 -- A piece of dark chocolate a day -- a very small piece -- keeps the doctor away .
An Italian study shows that dark chocolate can significantly reduce the inflammation that leads to cardiovascular disease .
The ideal amount is 6.7 grams per day ( 0.23 ounces ) .
A typical Hershey chocolate bar weighs about 43 grams .
That means eating one dark chocolate bar over the course of 6 1/2 days to get 6.7 grams per day .
Milk chocolate does n't appear to offer the same benefits .
The study was conducted by Research Laboratories of the Catholic University in Campobasso and the National Cancer Institute of Milan and has been published in the Journal of Nutrition .
The data come from an epidemiological study called the Moli-sani Project , which selected men and women at least 35 years old randomly from city hall registries in southern Italy .
For the chocolate study , researchers identified 4,849 people in good health without risk factors for cardiovascular disease , such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure .
These participants were asked about their dark chocolate consumption .
Chronic inflammation can lead to heart disease , so keeping inflammation under control is a major part of preventive treatment .
Research has shown that patients who have a low amount of C - reactive protein in their blood have lower levels of inflammation .
People who eat dark chocolate regularly , in small servings , have significantly lower levels of C reactive protein , according to the study .
This holds true even after accounting for any other potential confounding factors ( such as differences in other dietary practices ) .

It is a stiflingly hot summer day in Atlanta .
Scientist and physician Philip Kennedy has a packed schedule , so he suggests that I interview him while he drives to the tiny town of Bowdon , Georgia , just east of the Alabama line .
It ’s a journey he takes every Memorial Day to a small cemetery .
We park behind the redbrick Sandy Flat Baptist Church .
The sun is blazing overhead , the glare from the white gravel parking lot almost blinding .
But Kennedy knows exactly where he ’s going .
He quickly walks through the simple graves carpeted by carefully tended grass , then stops and bends down .
Visibly moved by private thoughts , the scientist touches a simple headstone and leaves beside it a tribute he wrote for the man buried here , a man he calls a hero .
Johnny Ray , who died on this date six years ago , was Kennedy ’s patient , his research subject , and the world ’s first human cyborg , fitted with brain implants that allowed him to communicate directly with a computer .
Kennedy is the chief scientist of Neural Signals , a company he founded in 1987 to develop a brain - computer interface , or BCI , though he prefers the term “ neural prosthetics . ”
By any name , the devices created by Kennedy and a handful of others can decode the conscious intentions conveyed by neural signals .
For those who are missing a leg or who have a broken spine , the signals can control computers , wheelchairs , and prosthetic limbs .
For those suffering from “ locked - in syndrome , ” their bodies so immobilized by catastrophic disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) or brain stem stroke that they are unable to speak or communicate their needs , the devices can translate neural signals to spell out words on a computer screen .
Spoken language through a voice synthesizer is coming soon .
Although his current work is aimed at the severely disabled and locked - in , Kennedy believes neural prosthetics will have applications for the well - bodied , too .
In fact , he awaits a new , technologically driven stage of evolution that will qualify cyborgs for a branch on the human family tree .
“ By connecting intimately with computers , we will take the human brain to a new level , ” he says .
“ If we can provide the brain with speedy access to unlimited memory , unlimited calculation ability , and instant wireless communication ability , we will produce a human with unsurpassable intelligence .
We fully expect to demonstrate this kind of link between brain and machine . ”
Getting OutOriginally a physician from County Limerick in Ireland , Kennedy was so intrigued by the workings of the brain he decided to go back to school and train as a neuroscientist .
After earning a Ph.D. , he made his way to Emory University in Atlanta , where , as a postdoc , he began recording and studying neural signals from rats ’ brains .
He found the task daunting .
Unreliable and laborious , his research required sticking electrodes through holes in the rats ’ skulls , risking scarring and infection that could play havoc with data .
If the animals moved , the electrodes often slipped out of place .
In l986 while running a lab at Georgia Tech , Kennedy learned that Canadian scientists were spurring neuron growth in rats ’ brains by adding bits of sciatic nerve .
An idea took shape :
Why not create an implant that would spur the brain to grow into it ?
If the brain could meld with such a device , the nerve cells would hold it permanently in place and risks would drop .
To build his implant , Kennedy took a tiny glass cone , filled it with a mix of nerve growth factors , and ran two fine , coiled gold wires through .
Then he inserted it into a rat ’s skull , right over the motor cortex that controls movement .
Soon neural cells had grown through the implant , keeping it in place and ensuring a solid electrical connection .
The gold wires , meanwhile , conducted neural signals through the skull to the outside , where they could be amplified and analyzed .
Then Kennedy performed a simple study .
He implanted rats with electrodes in the part of the brain that receives input from the animals ’ long whiskers .
When he tapped on certain whiskers , he “ heard ” neural activity via the electrode , but other whiskers did n’t produce these signals .
The observation suggested , he says , that “ specific neurons were connected to the movement of specific whiskers . ”
Next he snipped off the hooked - in whiskers and tapped on the alternate whiskers again .
This time , to his surprise , the neurons previously assigned to the now - missing whiskers began to adapt , picking up the signals and even causing the remaining whiskers to move .
The brain , apparently , was able to compensate for a loss and adapt to fill a need ; in short , it was malleable and plastic .
Instructed by this discovery , Kennedy ’s vision of a neural prosthesis took hold .
If neural activity corresponding to one body part could adapt and move another body part — in this case , whiskers — then perhaps it would be possible to reroute nerve signals on a larger scale , around an injured spine or into a prosthetic limb .
Moreover , if the brain ’s intentions for movement or language could be deciphered , there might be a way to create an interface between these nerve patterns and the outside world .
Kennedy patented his device ( called the Neurotrophic Electrode ) in 1989 and spent years testing it in monkeys .
Ultimately his increasingly sophisticated technology could amplify neural signals about 10,000 times , converting them to radio waves and transmitting them to an FM receiver .
That receiver , in turn , could broadcast the signals as radio waves to a nearby computer .
In 1996 the FDA gave Kennedy the go - ahead for human trials .
His first great triumph came with test subject Johnny Ray .
Photos reveal a man with smiling eyes set in a round , slightly chubby face .
He was what Southerners call a “ good ol ’ boy , ” a 53 - year - old drywall contractor and Vietnam veteran living in Douglasville , Georgia , who liked to play jazz guitar , have a few beers , and hang out with the guys .
But one day in the fall of l997 , while talking on the phone , he became one of more than 700,000 Americans each year who have a stroke .

“ He had high blood pressure and did n’t take his medicine , ” Kennedy says .
“ It was a catastrophic stroke of the brain stem . ”
In a coma for weeks , Ray finally woke up in the Atlanta VA Medical Center , his mind intact but his body unable to move or communicate except by the slightest quiver of a few muscles in his face , including his eyelids .
He was what doctors call “ locked - in . ”
Blinking twice for yes and once for no , he agreed to participate in Kennedy ’s study .
Kennedy and Emory neurosurgeon Roy Bakay implanted a Neuro­trophic Electrode near the part of Ray ’s brain that controlled his left hand .
The outer end was attached to an amplifier and radio transmitter on his skull under the scalp .
In the months that followed , Kennedy encouraged Ray to think about moving a computer mouse with his hand .
As Ray imagined moving the mouse , there was an increase in electrical activity among the neurons that would have controlled that action if his hand could move .
These brain impulses were transmitted to a receiver on his pillow , where they were deciphered and translated into digital commands sent to a nearby computer .
Over time , the computer began to obey Ray ’s neural signals .
Within six months
Ray was moving a cursor on the screen through intention alone , communicating by clicking on icons for phrases like “ I ’m cold . ”
Despite a host of excruciating health problems , including infections ( not related to the implant ) , Ray kept working with the researchers , although it clearly exhausted him .
After more months of practice , he could spell words and hold brief conversations .
When Kennedy asked what he felt when he moved the cursor , Ray spelled “ NOTHING . ”
It was a surprising , significant moment .
Ray had learned to control the cursor without thinking about moving his paralyzed arm .
Neural activity that had been linked to arm and hand movement had changed .
Now his brain was communicating directly with the computer .
“ The brain is very adaptable , ” Kennedy says in the Irish accent he has kept after almost three decades in the United States .
“ The brain ’s plasticity is the key thing to this whole field . ”
Telekinetic monkeys
The FDA does n’t readily approve radical procedures like brain implants , so most of Kennedy ’s colleagues have pushed the envelope not in humans but in other primates — for instance , a tiny owl monkey named Belle .
In 2000 Duke University neuroscientist Miguel Nicolelis trained Belle to move a joystick in sync with a light .
If she did the task correctly , she was rewarded with juice .
Belle wore a hat attached to about 100 wires as fine as human hairs .
The wires were implanted in Belle ’s motor cortex , the part of the brain that plans and initiates movement .
As she moved the joystick , her neural signals were picked up by the wires and sent to a computer in the next room .
The computer sent them on to a robotic arm , which precisely mimicked the action of Belle ’s arm .
At the same time , Nicolelis transmitted the brain signals over the Internet to the Touch Lab at MIT in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
There , 700 miles from Duke , the neural commands operated another robotic arm .
The virtual and physical world had merged .
In January 2008 , working with the Computational Brain Project of the Japan Science and Technology Agency , Nicolelis took another step forward , this time with Idoya , a rhesus monkey trained to walk upright on a treadmill for treats .
Electrodes were implanted in the part of Idoya ’s brain that controls leg movement ; these devices recorded the activity of 250 to 300 neurons that fired when her ankles , knees , hip joints , and feet moved or were about to move .
Fluorescent stage makeup allowed a special high - speed video camera to capture the details of her limb motions .
The video and neural signals were then combined to show which muscle movements resulted from which neuron firings and how the activity of the neurons appeared to anticipate movement .
In the end , computer analysis predicted Idoya ’s leg movements about a second before the animal actually carried them out .
As if all this were n’t enough , the system transmitted the predictions over a high - speed Internet connection to Kyoto , Japan , and into the actuators of a robot named CB - 1 ( for Computational Brain ) , which was designed to have a remarkably humanlike range of motion .
Idoya walked and so did CB - 1 , in perfect sync .
The 500 - pound , 5 - foot - tall robot was much larger than the 12 - pound , 32 - inch - tall monkey whose neural signals were directing it , and this underscored a simple yet remarkable point :
Implant technology could enable brainpower to control a huge object ( like a robot crane ) or a tiny one ( like a microscopic surgical tool ) just as easily as a life - size mechanical arm .
For the technology to truly aid humans , robot limbs will have to function in a lifelike way .
That ’s where neuroscientist Andrew Schwartz of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine comes in .
He recently implanted an array of electrodes about the size of a freckle in the motor cortex of two macaques .
The animals ’ arms were gently restrained and a mechanical arm with a grasping claw was strapped to their left sides .
The neural signals captured by the implant had been produced by the macaques ’ brains to direct their arm movements .
Instead the signals were shunted to a computer , which in turn directed the movements of the robotic arm .
The monkeys did n’t have to think about moving the robotic arm ; they simply reached out fluidly with the prosthetic limb as if it were part of them .
The success of this experiment was due in part to a computer capable of rapidly interpreting brain signals based on the monkeys ’ desire to move their limbs .
This “ advance warning system ” moved the robotic arm in just 150 milli­seconds , about the length of time it takes brain activity to spur real arm movement .
The rapid response helped the monkeys use the robotic arm in a natural way , reacting quickly if they were about to drop a piece of food , for instance , and refining movements in real time .
Work like this lends credence to the cyborg - maker ’s long - sought goal : the possibility , in the not - too - distant future , of helping the paralyzed walk , reach , and grasp .
Front and center in this effort is Northwestern University neuroscientist Lee Miller , who injects local anesthetic into a monkey ’s arm so that the limb is temporarily paralyzed .
Then , instead of sending neural signals from the animal ’s brain to a robot , he shunts them back into the muscles of the paralyzed arm , thereby bypassing the spinal cord .
“ The signals are going to a stimulator that is electrically stimulating those same muscles , ” Miller explains .
“ So essentially it allows the monkey to use his arm again , flexing the wrist and playing a video game all entirely voluntarily , despite the fact that the arm is actually paralyzed . ”
Merging man and machine
The spectacular successes of brain implants in primates has paved the way for new human trials , including one at Brown University , where neuroscientist John Donoghue is moving ahead with BrainGate , a minuscule array of tiny , spikelike electrodes implanted in the motor cortex .
Candidates are quadriplegics , with all four limbs paralyzed due to ALS , spinal cord injury , or brain stem stroke .
So far , three patients implanted with BrainGate can voluntarily modulate several dozen neurons sufficiently to type on a screen , move a prosthetic hand , or control a robotic arm .
“ Our goal is to help restore communication and independence , ” says Donoghue ’s colleague Leigh Hochberg , a neuroscientist with the Department of Veterans Affairs .
One patient , a 37 - year - old with ALS , died 10 months into the trial after his respirator was inadvertently disconnected .
His untimely death , and the progress he made while participating in the experiments , were especially moving to Hochberg .
“ He could demonstrate that his mental status was fully intact , ” Hochberg says .
“ He had great insight into his disease and the research we were doing and great humor as well . ”
Even with the limited number of subjects , the human research has already confirmed the monkey findings and answered important questions about how the brain works .
“ One thing we wondered was how a particular part of the brain functioned years after an arm and hand had n’t moved due to disease or injury , ” Hochberg says .
“ We found some insight thanks to one of our first participants , who had a spinal cord injury .
He was paralyzed , but the moment he thought about using his hand , we saw changes in neural activity in the specific part of the motor cortex associated with hand movement .
Different neurons fired at different rates depending on what he imagined performing . ”
What that means , Hochberg says , is that the brain signals that once controlled the subject ’s paralyzed hand and arm were still there and functioning — they just could not pass through the damaged spinal cord to allow the arm and hand to move .
He hopes devices like BrainGate will circumvent such damage and allow the brain to communicate with a prosthetic limb or even the actual one , in the manner of Miller ’s research .
“ If we can take those natural signals and send them to a functional electrical stimulation system placed in and around the muscles and nerves of an arm or a leg , ” Hochberg says , “ someone might be able to control their own limb again using neural technology rather than injured biology . ”
Another planned clinical trial involves a miniaturized neural electrode the size of a couple of kernels of corn , pioneered by neuroscientist Richard Andersen at Caltech .
Hoping to accomplish what some have compared to mind reading , Andersen wants to implant his device in the brain ’s higher - level sensory - motor areas , including the parietal lobe and premotor cortex , the seats of personal preference and intent .
From a practical perspective , the implant could empower patients to use their abstract thoughts and feelings to control a medical device — a nuanced form of biofeedback .
On another level , it could help physicians interpret thoughts that would normally control the patient ’s body .
“ The first thing a doctor often asks is ‘ How are you feeling ? ’ ? ”
Andersen says .
“ By looking at the decoded neural signals , the doctor could know . ”
Speaking His Mind Even better , says Philip Kennedy , would be giving the locked - in the gift of actual voice — and he ’s getting close .
Erik Ramsey became the first subject for this research after he suffered a horrible car accident .
Surgery repaired a host of broken bones and torn muscles , but Ramsey did n’t seem to wake up .
At first his doctors thought that the anesthesia was taking an unusually long time to wear off .
But eventually Ram­sey ’s father , Eddie , realized something was terribly wrong .
Ramsey had suffered a catastrophic brain stem stroke , appearing to doom him to a locked - in life at the age of 16 .
It might be odd to describe Ramsey as lucky , but in a way he is , because his condition was correctly di­ag­nosed .
No one knows how many others in the same state are incorrectly labeled as vegetative or semicomatose and warehoused , doomed to a nightmare world where they exist in a body that feels but cannot move , with a brain that is intact , hearing and seeing but unable to communicate a presence to others .
In one 1996 study published in the British Medical Journal , 17 of 40 patients originally diagnosed as vegetative turned out to be locked - in instead .
Ramsey found someone who could unlock him .
Ramsey , now 25 , has dark , almond - shaped eyes that hint of his mom ’s Filipino heritage .
He is big and broad - shouldered .
If he could get up out of his wheelchair , he ’d be well over 6 feet tall .
If he were mobile , he ’d have the physique of a football player .
His mind is fine but he cannot move , except for tiny eye gestures ( up for yes , down for no ) and occasional muscle spasms .
I ask him if coming to the lab is fun .
He looks down .
Is it more like work ?
He looks up .
He is an inner -space pioneer whose work holds the promise of freeing himself and others who are locked - in , at least to a degree , by eventually allowing them to have real - time conversations .
“ Developing a neural prosthesis for speech is extremely important to me , ” says Kennedy , who , as a neurologist , regularly sees patients with ALS and stroke .
There are some 30,000 ALS patients in the United States alone .
All will become locked - in eventually , and 5,000 to 6,000 each year are at the point where they must decide whether to spend the rest of their lives on a ventilator , unable to speak , or to refuse it and let themselves die .
If they knew they could continue to communicate as their disease progressed , they would undoubtedly more often choose to live , and they could even be productive .
“ People call my office all the time about a loved one who has had a brain stem stroke , lying in bed , unable to speak , ” Kennedy says .
“ I expect to be able to help these people with this research . ”
In the effort to unlock the door , Ramsey is treading where no one has gone before .
The brain ’s precise speech center varies from person to person , so to find Ramsey ’s target area — the place where an implant could discern the appropriate speech signals — Kennedy used a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan .
Showing Ramsey pictures , he told the young man to say to himself phrases like “ This is an elephant ” and “ This is a dog . ”
As Ramsey “ spoke ” internally , the MRI pinpointed neurons associated with speech , but the results were surprising .
The neural signals were not sparked by words or their meanings , per se , but instead by how the muscles of the lips , tongue , jaw , and larynx would move to produce the sounds — movements that Ramsey could only imagine .
In 2004 a neurosurgeon on Kennedy ’s team inserted an electrode in the part of Ramsey ’s cortex where the signals were most dense .
Then an amplifier and transmitter were screwed onto the top of Ram­sey ’s skull .
Ever since then , he has arrived at Kennedy ’s lab every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday afternoon .
Kennedy ’s team affixes an amplifier atop Ramsey ’s head to record speech signals from his motor cortex as he imagines physically moving his mouth , tongue , and jaw to make speech sounds , called phonemes .
Over the course of three years , Kennedy ’s group has recorded 41 distinct patterns from 56 neurons in Ramsey ’s brain .
Decoding the signals has been tricky and slow going .
But Kennedy collaborator Frank Guenther , associate professor of cognitive and neural systems at Boston University , and his colleague Jonathan Brumberg recently worked out a system that translates neural signals from Ramsey ’s implant into vocal form via a synthesiser that produces the corresponding sound .
In February , for the first time , Ramsey heard the synthesized vowels he was “ saying ” in his head ( consonants are harder and will come later ) played back in real time , as he was thinking them .
He heard the phonemes blare from computer speakers and , at the same time , could see his neural signals directing a cursor to the symbol for the sound ( like “ ooh ” or ? “ aah ” ) on the screen .
Guenther and Brumberg flew in from Boston for this groundbreaking experiment .
When the computer “ spoke ” for Ramsey for the first time , whoops of delight could be heard in Kennedy ’s lab .
“ It was incredibly exciting , ” Guenther says .
“ We finally all knew this was going to work . ”
Ramsey ’s brain is already changing as his neurons learn to fire in specific ways that better control the synthesizer .
“ We are now convinced we ’ll be able to give him rudimentary speech within not too many years , ” Guenther says .
The ultimate aim is not just speech but restoration of full bodily function .
If Kennedy has his way , someday the blind will see and the paralyzed will walk — and other researchers are racing him to make those things happen .
Miguel Nicolelis says his quadriplegic sub­jects will walk again — not in 10 or 20 years , but in just a few .
We are talking over the phone when he makes this grand statement from a restaurant in Brazil .
He is effusive on this call , pausing in a long conversation only once , to order sushi in his native Portuguese .
Nicolelis says he ’s confident he has solved most of the technical problems once dogging brain electrodes , and he ’s mostly ignoring naysayers who think it ca n’t be done .
“ They can go on saying what they want to , but I am just going ahead and doing it , ” he states .
Specifically , he is leading an international consortium based in Brazil called the Walk Again Project .
Other participating nations include the United States , Israel , Switzerland , Germany , Japan , and France , as well as a country in the Arab world and one in Africa he cannot yet announce .
Together they are aiming to do what sounds miraculous : help paralyzed quadriplegics walk again , not by fixing their lesions or broken spines but by creating wearable robotic exoskeletons controlled by neural signals .
The effort will be based at the Edmond and Lily Safra International Institute of Neuroscience of Natal .
Setting Our Brains Free
While the immediate future is filled with hope for the disabled , cyborg technology may soon spread , giving ordinary people extra­ordinary skills .
The possibilities are both terrifying and amazing : Brain implants might be the key to interspecies communication , for instance , and could offer true immortality as our brain patterns find new life in the belly of a machine .
From bloodless wars ( fought with cyborg - controlled robots ) to apparent mind reading , the cyborg age could change the meaning of being human and thrust us into another evolutionary realm .
It seems like our logical destiny , according to the futurist Ray Kurzweil .
“ We already have brain implants for people with Parkinson ’s disease and computerized implants for other conditions such as deafness and epilepsy , ” he says .
“ Some people may articulate an abstract opposition to the idea of merging with machines , but that is how we will get from where we are now to my conception of the future , through many steps , each one benign and useful . ”
Kennedy is convinced that neural implants will inevitably be used to download information into our brains , creating superintelligent humans .
He speculates that astronauts equipped with implants will tap into the massive amount of information they will need while colonizing the moon or exploring the universe .
He would also like to work with neural speech prostheses in great apes .
“ Already we know they can understand a lot of human language and sign language .
What if we could find a way to give them synthesized speech ? ” he asks .
“ What would we learn from them ? ”
The melding of man and machine appears inevitable , Kennedy believes .
“ It ’s not hard to imagine that eventually somebody ’s brain will be incorporated into a robotic body , ” he says .
“ It could grant humanity a kind of immortality and also make us redefine what a human is . ”
The U.S. Department of Defense is sponsoring research along these lines to help amputees injured in war , and the Army is investigating exoskeletons to give soldiers superstrength and resilience .
Are cyborg soldiers with machine - enhanced strength , endurance , and vision on the drawing board too ?
In a few generations , Nicolelis speculates , brain implants will be as socially acceptable as breast implants are today .
“ Implants will happen in normals when there is a benefit and they are safe , ” he states .
He agrees with others that the technology will shape the evolution of Homo sapiens , and his perspective is unmistakably philosophical .
Today , he says , we are all in a sense locked - in , but we wo n’t be for long .
“ With these experiments we ’ve accomplished something that nobody has noticed yet :
We have freed the brain from the body .
We have created a profound new paradigm for the brain — and not just the disabled brain — to enact its will without the limitations of the biological machinery that we call a body .
“ My children probably will see the day when they can sit physically on a beautiful beach in Brazil but at the same time control a rover on Mars , experience Mars , ” Nicolelis reflects .
“ Their bodies will be here , but their brains will be free . ”
Reading Minds From the Outside
To tap into the brain activity of his subjects , Klaus - Robert Müller , a computer scientist at the Technical University of Berlin , does not need to get inside their heads .
He just gives each a cap that is embedded with electrodes and stuck to the scalp using conductive gel .
Instead of collecting signals from direct contact with neurons , as Philip Kennedy and others do , Müller captures the cacophony of thousands of brain cells chiming in together , recorded noninvasively from the outside of the skull .
Müller uses a computer to track brain waves through a technology known as electroencephalography , or EEG .
One especially useful EEG signal , named the P300 , registers the brain ’s reaction to a novel event or a flash of recognition .
Here ’s how it works : Subjects wearing an EEG “ hat ” stare at a computer screen as letters are essentially illuminated one by one .
Their brains issue a P300 when and only when a desired letter appears .
Using computer software programmed to recognize the P300 , the paralyzed can be trained to “ type ” with the power of the brain alone .
For basic communication for the severely disabled , this system seems best to Jonathan R. Wolpaw , chief of the Laboratory of Nervous System Disorders at the Wads­worth Center of the New York State Department of Health in Albany .
Wolpaw has shown that a P300 - based device could help patients with advanced ALS communicate at a rate of one to four words a minute .
When the technology has been fully developed , he hopes , the locked - in “ should be able to move a cursor someplace ” and perform useful operations , “ just as we do when using a computer mouse . ”
Before he died , William F. Buckley Jr. put his young grandson on the firing line .
The intellectual conservative icon – renowned for his erudition and use of uncommon words – excluded his son ’s illegitimate child from his massive estate , insisting the kid was dead in his eyes .
“ I intentionally make no provision herein for said Jonathan , who for all purposes . . . shall be deemed to have predeceased me , ” Buckley ’s will says , according to the Hartford Courant .
The National Review founder and notable New Yorker instead left his entire estate – estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars – to his only child , Christopher Buckley , and Christopher ’s two older kids , Caitlin and William .
Jonathan , now 8 , is the product of an Christopher ’s affair with book publicist Irina Woelfle .
Caitlin , 20 , and William , 17 , are the author and former presidential speechwriter ’s children with his now - estranged wife , Lucy .
Woelfle currently works as a publicist in Florida , where she filed suit against Christopher , seeking more child - support money .
Christopher , 56 , author of the satiric novel “ Thank You for Smoking , ” pays $ 3,000 a month .
But Woelfle ’s petition says their son has special needs , and she ’s looking to put him into a private school near her Coral Gables home .
The suit , which was obtained by the Courant , pins the blame for some of the boy ’s behavioral problems on Christopher ’s complete lack of involvement .
“ The father is notably absent from the minor child ’s life , ” despite the mom ’s efforts to try to get him involved , the suit says .
“ As Jonathan gets older , he requires love , attention and a notable involvement in his life from his father , ” the suit says .
“ It is in Jonathan ’s best interest and welfare for this court to impose a contact and access schedule on the father , so that Jonathan can establish a relationship with his father and extended paternal family . ”
The filing says the boy has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and needs a school with a “ small , nurturing classroom setting . ”
The filing says Christopher should pay for the school , and makes note that “ there has been a substantial change in the father ’s income ” since they reached a child - support agreement in 2003 .
The Courant estimated the value of William Buckley ’s estate at more than $ 30 million .
Jonathan ’s grandfather was n’t alone in turning his back on the boy , the report says .
In his original settlement agreement with Woelfle , Christopher did not want visitation rights .
The deal prohibited Woelfle from contacting Christopher directly about Jonathan , and said all communication should go through their attorneys .
Christopher currently lives in Washington .
It is unclear when his father , who died in February at age 82 , wrote his will .
Woelfle and Christopher ’s lawyer did not return calls .

Richard Stallman is about as hi-tech as they come .
For decades he has been one of the world 's most famous computer programmers and holds a position as a research affiliate at the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
As founder of the free software movement in the 1980s , Stallman has been the inspiration for computer hackers around the world , and these days the 55 - year - old spends his time travelling the globe and speaking about his work .
But despite this hi-tech pedigree , he is one of a number of people who chooses to restrict his use of popular technologies in a way that may seem contrary .
As a privacy campaigner , for example , he refuses to carry a mobile phone .
And even though most of his work takes place on a computer , Stallman only sporadically connects to the internet and purposely avoids surfing the web .
" Very often I 'm on planes or buses , or in a place where there 's no internet , so I could n't possibly do my work if I could n't do it offline , " he told the Guardian from his office in Boston .
" Fortunately I have a powerful computer , and it 's capable of doing an awful lot without a web connection – something which many users do n't seem to know about any more . "
' I do n't do e-commerce '
Stallman said that he might surf the web " if I 'm visiting somebody 's house " , but says he refuses to indulge himself too much .
" I do n't identify myself , and I do n't do e-commerce , " he added .
Stallman 's approach is partly philosophical and partly about keeping on top of things .
He only checks his email after answering the existing messages , for example .
In this he is not alone .
Most of us know the feeling of dread when our computer pings and announces the arrival of yet another email , and research from the University of Glasgow has shown that 34 % of us feel overwhelmed by the number of messages they receive .
People working in the computer industry are often among those most affected by the weight of modern communications , since they frequently adopt the newest systems to help them stay always - on and constantly connected .
However , despite the lure of email , blogs and the internet , some of the most accomplished technologists react by choosing to severely limit their interaction with the hi-tech world .
Clifford Stoll , an astronomer who helped catch Soviet computer hackers in the 1980s , was an early internet sceptic and now campaigns against the introduction of computers in schools .
Stoll rarely uses the net , although he retains a website where he sells homemade glass bottles .
In the most extreme cases , technologists can become so disenchanted with the touted benefits of new systems that they end up disconnecting almost entirely .
Life without email
Retired professor Donald Knuth , like many 70 - year - olds , does n't use email , but his lack of involvement was the result of a conscious decision made nearly 20 years ago .
The computer scientist , who lives in a house on the campus of California 's Stanford University – the institution that has spawned giant technology corporations including Google , Hewlett Packard and Yahoo – says he simply does n't want to waste his time .
The hours he saves from not indulging in constant communication allow him to carry on work on his most famous book , The Art of Computer Programming – which has so far taken nearly 40 years to write , and he 's only reached volume four of seven .
" Email is a wonderful thing for those people whose role in life is to be on top of things , " Knuth says on the university 's website .
" But not for me : my role is to be on the bottom of things . "
The handful of high - technologists who have retreated from digital life are part of what Kevin Kelly , a founding editor of Wired magazine , has labelled the " Neo - Amish " .
Rather than succumb to hi-tech temptations , these highly competent engineers and programmers are choosing to drop out of the always - connected culture in favour of a better quality of life .
" Lots of people complain about being overloaded with email , blogs , Twitter , and so on , " he wrote on his website earlier this year .
" But very few who complain reach the ultimate logical solution : turn it all off . "
Such solutions may appear drastic , but the problem of information overload is remarkably common , according to Mark Hurst , author of Bit Literacy , a guide to keeping your digital life under control .
He believes that many people are crushed by the amount of communication they receive , even if they wo n't admit it .
" People are carrying enormous amounts of stress and anxiety over this , and most people do n't even understand how much it affects them , " he said .
" Untamed , this problem achieves gigantic proportions in their lives . "
Technology worship
Stallman believes the problem is that too many are in thrall to the promises made by new developments .
" It 's almost as if they worship technology and they do n't care about the social consequences of using it , " he said .
However , Hurst says that unlike Knuth , who has an assistant who brings him a new batch of messages every three months , or Stallman , who has the luxury of running his own organisation , not everybody is in a sufficiently privileged position to give up entirely .
" There are people on the extremes who can afford to do that .
If you 're extremely rich you can have an assistant , or if you live off the grid somewhere you might have little need for these technologies , " he said .
" But the vast majority of people have responsibilities that require them to be connected . "

Gospel Singer Ray Boltz Comes Out of the Closet
Gospel singer , who is divorced with four children , has publicly come out of the closet and admitted he is gay .
In an interview with Washington Blade , the 55 - year - old singer / songwriter says he came out to family and friends several years ago while sitting around the kitchen table at his daughter 's house on December 26 , 2004 , the day of the tsunami in the Indian Ocean .
" That day , with the tsunami , has become very symbolic in our family . " says Boltz .
His family 's reaction took time .
" I do n't want to downplay it like it was just , ' Oh , well that 's OK . '
It was a very tough time for them too , but the bottom line was they loved me and they still love me … it 's been an amazing journey of acceptance on their part …
I was offered support and love from each member of my family , including my wife . "
Boltz has been living quietly in Ft. Lauderdale , FL and says the decision to come out was personal .
“ This is what it really comes down to , ” he says .
“ If this is the way God made me , then this is the way I ’m going to live .
It ’s not like God made me this way and he ’ll send me to hell if I am who he created me to be … I really feel closer to God because I no longer hate myself . ”
WASHINGTON - White people - including children as young as 10 -- may avoid talking about race so as not to appear prejudiced , according to new research .
But that approach often backfires as blacks tend to view this " colorblind " approach as evidence of prejudice , especially when race is clearly relevant .
These results are from two separate sets of experiments led by researchers from Tufts University and Harvard Business School .
Their findings are reported in the October issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology and the September issue of Developmental Psychology .
Both journals are published by the American Psychological Association .
" Efforts to talk about race are fraught with the potential for misunderstandings , " said the studies ' lead author , Evan Apfelbaum , a PhD candidate at Tufts University .
" One way that whites try to appear unbiased is to avoid talking about race altogether , a tendency we refer to as strategic colorblindness . "
In one study , 101 white undergraduate students were paired with either a white or black female partner who pretended to be another participant .
The pairs were presented with 30 photographs of faces that varied in race , gender and background color .
Each white participant 's objective was to guess which of the photographs the partner was holding by asking as few yes - or - no questions as possible .
Even though asking about the race of the person in the photograph was a sound strategy for completing the task , white participants were far less likely to do so with a black versus a white partner .
Moreover , when the black partner was the first one to have a turn asking questions , whether she mentioned race had a dramatic effect .
White participants whose black partner asked about race mentioned race on their own turn 95 percent of the time .
When the black partner never asked about race , white participants only did so 10 percent of the time .
" There was clear evidence the white participants ' behavior was influenced by the precedent set by their partner , but especially when that partner was black , " said Samuel Sommers , assistant professor at Tufts and co-author of both papers .
" Whites are strategically avoiding the topic of race because they 're worried that they 'll look bad if they admit they notice it in other people . "
The researchers also wanted to see how outsiders interpreted such interactions .
In another experiment , 74 black and white college students evaluated videos of whites engaging in the photo task .
The results showed that whites ' effort to appear colorblind backfired .
Black observers rated whites ' avoidance of asking about race as being evidence of prejudice .
What 's more , when the researchers showed silent video clips of whites from the study to another group of individuals , those whites who avoided asking about race were judged as less friendly , just on the basis of their nonverbal behavior .
" The findings suggest that when race is clearly relevant , whites who think that it is a wise social strategy to avoid talking about race should think again , " said Apfelbaum .
Even children appear to adopt this strategically colorblind approach .
In another set of experiments , 101 white children between the ages of 8 and 11 were asked to perform a similar photo task .
The children were told that asking as few yes - or - no questions as possible would mean they would get a higher score on the task .
The results showed that the older children , ages 10 and 11 , avoided asking about race more than the younger children , even though this led them to perform less efficiently than their younger counterparts on the task .
In a control version where all the faces in the photos were white , the older children outperformed the younger children , as expected .
" This result is fascinating because it shows that children as young as 10 feel the need to try to avoid appearing prejudiced , even if doing so leads them to perform poorly on a basic cognitive test , " said Kristin Pauker , a PhD candidate at Tufts and co-author of this study .
The authors associated with both studies said their findings offer several important implications .
" Our findings do n't suggest that individuals who avoid talking about race are racists , " Apfelbaum explained .
" On the contrary , most are well - intentioned people who earnestly believe that colorblindness is the culturally sensitive way to interact .
But , as we 've shown , bending over backward to avoid even mentioning race sometimes creates more interpersonal problems than it solves . "

How fabulous that George Bush , whose every political instinct stems from annihilating socialism , should give approval to the biggest nationalisation programme since the Second World War .
By propping up the USA 's two biggest mortgage firms , more than half of American homes are now effectively owned by the state .
Who'd have imagined that when the most right - wing of neo -cons leaves office , 50 per cent of the Land of The Free will effectively be a council estate ?
" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 21 - Subset Types
subset Squares of Real where { . sqrt .
Int **2 == $ _ } ; multi sub square_root ( Squares $ x --> Int ) { return $ x.sqrt .
Int ; } multi sub square_root ( Real $ x --> Real ) { return $ x.sqrt ; }
Java programmers tend to think of a type as either a class or an interface ( which is something like a crippled class ) , but that view is too limited for Perl 6 .
A type is more generally a constraint of what a values a container can constraint .
The " classical " constraint is it is an object of a class X or of a class that inherits from X .
Perl 6 also has constraints like the class or the object does role Y , or this piece of code returns true for our object .
The latter is the most general one , and is called a subset type :
subset Even of Int where { $ _ % 2 == 0 } # Even can now be used like every other type name my Even $x = 2 ; my Even $y = 3 ; # type mismatch error
( Try it out , Rakudo implements subset types ) .
You can also use anonymous subtypes in signatures :
sub foo ( Int where { ... } $ x ) { ... } # or with the variable at the front : sub foo ( $x of Int where { ... } ) { ... }
Allowing arbitrary type constraints in the form of code allows ultimate extensibility : if you do n't like the current type system , you can just roll your own based on subset types .
It also makes libraries easier to extend : instead of dying on data that can't be handled , the subs and methods can simply declare their types in a way that " bad " data is rejected by the multi dispatcher .
If somebody wants to handle data that the previous implementation rejected as " bad " , he can simple add a multi sub with the same name that accepts the data .
For example a math library that handles real numbers could be enhanced this way to also handle complex numbers .
I have received a couple of letters since the last issue on two short subjects that I would like to address .
The first involves hiccupping in ferrets .
The writer noted that their ferret had hiccups frequently with no apparent relationship to any particular activity .
A hiccup as defined by Webster ’s dictionary is “ a sudden , involuntary contraction of the diaphragm that closes the glottis at the moment of breathing ” .
It is not completely understood what starts the hiccups , but we are all familiar with a variety of remedies that can stop it in humans .
In ferrets , it is relatively common , especially in younger animals .
It is frequently associated with excitement , but may occur spontaneously also .
It is really nothing to worry about and will go away on its own with no help at all .
Some people have reported that giving a sugary treat , such as a hairball laxative ( which is flavored with molasses ) , or raisins , or ice cream is helpful .
However , be extremely careful with these treats , because the ferret ’s pancreas is easily stressed with excessive sugar and the result can be diabetes .
There are certain diseases ( notably insulinoma ) that may require that sugary foods be given more frequently , but in the healthy animal keep them to a minimum ( hairball laxatives can be given in the amount of one inch every other day ) .
The other letter involved a young lady who had to return her already neutered and descented ferret to the pet store because her parents objected to the odor .
The animal was only 8 weeks old .
I have had a number of people that have complained about ferret odor and I have personally “ smelled ” the pet and noticed nothing offensive .
My conclusion is that there are some people who will probably find any animal odor offensive , no matter how small it is ( hence all the pet shampoos that aim at making the pet smell more like coconuts , apples , oranges or pine trees ) .
If one is to keep a pet , no matter what kind , one must be willing to accept all the features that come with it including hair shedding , cleaning up after it as well as its individual body perfume .
Personally , I find the “ odor ” of the ferret to be quite warm , earthy and friendly and not at all offensive , and I know many people who would agree with me .
So , by all means , do not get a ferret or any other pet if you will be spending a lot of time trying to make it smell like something else , or trying to make it act or look like something other than it is .
Two other brief notes …
Descenting a ferret does not automatically get rid of the odor , because 99 % of the ferret “ odor ” is coming from the oil glands in the skin .
Neutering the animal is all that is generally necessary to take care of the really strong body perfume .
There are those cases in which the ferret is “ spraying ” the anal gland material frequently , or when the anal glands become infected at which time we surgically remove them .
The other note I would like to make , is that if you have owned a ferret for a while and you notice a sudden change in its body odor ( particularly in ferrets 3 and older ) , have an examination done by a veterinarian .
Sometimes this noticeable change may be due to changes in the adrenal gland .
Well , as usual , give them all a hug and a kiss for me … and tell them you love them just the way they are !!!

But who prays for Satan ?
Who in eighteen centuries , has had the common humanity to pray for the one sinner that needed it most , our one fellow and brother who most needed a friend yet had not a single one , the one sinner among us all who had the highest and clearest right to every Christian 's daily and nightly prayers , for the plain and unassailable reason that his was the first and greatest need , he being among sinners the supremest ?

I have always felt friendly toward Satan .
Of course that is ancestral ; it must be in the blood , for I could not have originated it .
- Autobiography of Mark Twain
I have no special regard for Satan ; but I can at least claim that I have no prejudice against him .
It may even be that I lean a little his way , on account of his not having a fair show .
All religions issue bibles against him , and say the most injurious things about him , but we never hear his side .
We have none but evidence for the prosecution and yet we have rendered the verdict .
To my mind , this is irregular .
It is un-English .
It is un-American ; it is French .
Without this precedent Dreyfus could not have been condemned .
As soon as I can get at the facts I will undertake his rehabilitation myself if I can find an unpolitic publisher .
It is a thing we ought to be willing to do for anyone who is under a cloud .
We may not pay him reverance , for that would be indiscreet , but we can at least respect his talents .

Satan must have been pretty simple , even according to the New Testament , or he would n't have led Christ up on a high mountain and offered him the world if he would fall down and worship him .
That was a manifestly absurd proposition , because Christ , as the Son of God , already owned the world ; and besides , what Satan showed him was only a few rocky acres of Palestine .
It is just as if some one should try to buy Rockefeller , the owner of all the Standard Oil Company , with a gallon of kerosene .

Last night I watched and will again view a program with the interesting Title “ Animal Pharm . ”
The purpose of this continuing program is to show us the pros and cons of Genetically Modifying animals and plants for the benefit of humans both within the food and medical fields .
In the first program , it was clear that the information was straight from the source ie those using transgenetic and cross breeding to produce creatures whose very existance was for our benefit .
Well the images I saw were totally horrid .
I did take the initial stance of lets see what they have to say , whats this about and keeping an open mind , lets see what the buzz is about both for and against .
Well I was taken aback from the images shown and the scienctists attitude to the experiments forced onto these animals for example :
Cross Breeding cattle to give what they termed ‘ double muscle ’ beef .
Sounds odd yes , but picture a cow / bull with Mr Universe style muscle ..
The sight of this monsterous creature and the way its legs appeared to be meer stumps under its bulk , left me with a feeling of extreme pity .
Should we doing this ?
Do we have the right to treat animals like this ?
These creatures are being exploited .
It is true !
Yes they are for the most part being treated well , ie good food , shelter , etc but they are being exploited in ways far to extreme for many of us to comprehend .
From their very conception .
Their existance is being manipulated , their genetics , their DNA , the very things which make them them and none of these creatures actually have a say in the matter .
Why make Rabbits which Glow in the dark :
This is for medical research .
Once again animals are being used by humans , exploited for our own needs with no consideration of should we .
How about growing replacement body parts on animals .
This you may well think is the stuff of science fiction , but you would be wrong .
Designer parts , grown to order for your vanity needs .
I wonder what this mouse would say if only it could .
There comes a time when people and Scientists need to step back and ask themselves
SHOULD WE !
Is this ETHICAL ?
With all the Scientific and Technological advancements in modern times you would think we would have developed a more ethical approach to experiments after all that is what we are doing .
Taking a creature who has no real way of deciding , argreeing , consenting or understanding what is happening to it , and changing its DNA , its very cells , giving them diseases , making strange things grow off them , removing and adding body parts and using these creatures in everyway shape and form imaginable and I think in several ways we simply could not .
Here are a few questions for you , after all the experiments are said and done , what are the risks to us Humans ?
If we eat Genetically modified meat will in a few generations this in someway affect our children , grand children etc ?
If these genetically altered creatures get out into environment and somehow breed will we have mice with ears growing on their backs running around in sheds or glowing rabbits in our fields ?
These Questions I have yet to read , hear and see an answer too which convinces me it is safe .

THE war that raged in the Democratic Republic of Congo , mostly in the east of the country , between 1998 and 2003 , claimed millions of lives and sucked in plundering armies from Rwanda , Uganda , Zimbabwe , Angola and Namibia .
The scale of the misery caused by that conflict — and the importance of Congo 's massive mineral wealth — explains the anxiety among ordinary Congolese , diplomats , aid workers and others , following the advance this week of a Tutsi rebel army towards the town of Goma in eastern Congo .
If Congo falls apart again , the humanitarian cost would be enormous .
The United States and the European Union have sent senior diplomats to the region .
The UN Security Council has held a special session to discuss the situation .
That show of concern has seemed enough to halt , perhaps only briefly , the advance of the Tutsi rebels .
Their commander , Laurent Nkunda , has declared a ceasefire and promised a “ humanitarian corridor ” to allow the passage of food and other aid to displaced people .
That offers some comfort to the tens of thousands of Congolese on the run , thirsty and hungry , caught between Mr Nkunda 's forces and the demoralised and ill - disciplined Congolese government troops .
Some were heading for Goma , others for the Virunga National Park .
By some estimates , there are now 1 m people displaced in the green hills and diminishing forests of North Kivu , a region in the east .
Mr Nkunda claims to be fighting to protect Tutsis from Hutu militias that he says played a part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide , which saw perhaps 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus killed .
He is particularly incensed by what he sees as collusion between one of those Hutu groups , the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda ( FDLR , ) and the Congolese government .
The president of Congo , Joseph Kabila , for his part , is unhappy at the continued links between Mr Nkunda and the Tutsi - dominated Rwandan government .
Human Rights
Watch , an advocacy group , says it has evidence that Mr Nkunda is recruiting for his 4,000 strong force inside Rwanda , including from demobbed Rwandan soldiers .
UN officials involved in the 17,000 - strong peacekeeping operation in Congo believe that Rwandan troops have aided Mr Nkunda 's advance on Goma by firing on UN helicopter gunships .
This is bad news for the stability of the Great Lakes region and for those foreign donors , notably Britain , which poured money into Rwanda on the understanding that it did not repeat its previous brutal incursions into Congo .
Rwanda says that it has no wish to get sucked back in to its neighbouring country , but is fed up with the lack of leadership in Kinshasa .
Some senior Rwandan officials are dismissive of Mr Kabila 's ability to project any force in eastern Congo .
By contrast , diplomats in Kigali believe that tiny Rwanda , with its American - and British - trained army , could probably march all the way to Kinshasa unopposed .
What is unclear is the extent of the relationship between the Rwandan president , Paul Kagame , with Mr Nkunda .
Mr Kagame says he has no ties except that they are both Tutsis .
Analysts think that is untrue , but generally agree that Mr Nkunda is largely following his own agenda .
“ Think Serb and Bosnian Serb , ” says one .
The immediate question is whether the UN peacekeeping force , MONUC , can defend Goma should Mr Nkunda decide to attack .
The country is host to the largest peacekeeping force in the world , but this is already stretched to its limit .
MONUC 's head , Alan Doss , has asked for a temporary deployment of 2,000 more police and special - forces soldiers to shore up his defences .
France , sensing an opportunity to push on with its aim of creating an EU standing army , wants to deploy a rapid - reaction force of some 1,500 European troops but is so far being blocked by Germany .
That puts the UN in a dangerous position .
If atrocities begin to be documented the already desperate local population may turn on the blue helmets .
Already several compounds have been attacked and UN vehicles set ablaze .
Much will depend on the maturity of the Congolese army .
They have given little reason for hope , so far preferring to shoot up brothels and loot rather than protect the displaced in Goma .
Almost everyone agrees that reining in the various Hutu militias , especially the FDLR , is a necessary step if relations between Kigali and Kinshasa are to be improved .
But this can not be seen to happen only on Rwanda 's terms .
Mr Kagame will need to provide clear evidence of a break with Mr Nkunda and a commitment to preventing Rwandan citizens from fighting in his militia .
SB - CPU -AFFINITY #
hacking , October 29th 2008
Those wanting control over which CPUs threads run on ( and are also lucky enough to be running SBCL on Linux ) can give SB - CPU - AFFINITY a try .
Usage : ( asdf:oos ' asdf:load-op :sb-cpu-affinity ) ( use - package : sb- cpu-affinity ) ( with - cpu- affinity - mask ( mask ) ( print mask ) ) ( with - cpu- affinity - mask ( mask : save t ) ;; Remove all ( clear - cpu- affinity - mask mask ) ;;
Set CPU 0 . ( setf ( cpu-affinity - p 0 mask ) t ) ) ( with - cpu- affinity - mask ( mask ) ( print mask ) ) ( with - cpu- affinity - mask ( mask : save t ) ;;
Only odd CPUs in mask .
( dotimes ( cpu ( cpu-count ) ) ( setf ( cpu-affinity - p cpu mask ) ( oddp cpu ) ) ) ) ( with - cpu- affinity - mask ( mask ) ( print mask ) )
Caveat : memory malloc'ed for the CPU masks ( per call to GET - CPU - AFFINITY - MASK or WITH - CPU - AFFINITY - MASK ) is never released currently , as doing that causes glibc to complain about a double - free , and breaks SBCL .
That 's a leak of 128 bytes each time — but so long as you only set the affinity mask once per worker thread ( and use pooling ) , it should be a non-issue .
If someone has an insight as to why this is so , and what should be done about it ...
I 'd love to hear .

These photos from Mfuwe Lodge in the South Luangwa National Park , Zambia .
The lodge was unwittingly built on the elephant ’s traditional path to wild mango trees .
Once a year for about seven weeks at a stretch , a dozen or so elephants walk through the reception area at least twice a day to feed on the trees .
“ Just some elephants , ma’am .
No , that ’s fine …we know where the mangoes are . ”
Sometimes , things happen that make you happy to be alive to know they happened .

Hey guys ,
First , I want to thank you for the acute attention to detail and the Spartan level of expectation our most devoted BioShock fans hold us to , and how excited you are and attentive to the BioShock PS3 demo .
When we saw a post asking about issues found in the demo , we jumped on it immediately .
And you know what , you 're right .
The texture in the PS3 demo of the downed Big Daddy does not match our level of quality either .
This slipped by .
We admit it .
However , I want to assure you that this is an exception , and not a rule , and while I regret this oversight , we put a lot of love into making this game look amazing for the PS3 and I 'm sure that when you play the rest of the demo you will agree that the textures are not all like this one instance .
" Drill , baby , drill ! " " Sell out to the Japanese , baby , sell out to the Japanese ! "
The Republicans have just spent a month going completely frothy over the need to drill for oil and natural gas in every backyard in America , claiming it'll lower gasoline prices at the pump .
But did you know that in the meantime , they 've been preparing to secret all that natural gas out of the country and sell it to the Japanese ?
Sen. Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) did :
September 2 , 2008 The Honorable Samuel W. Bodman
U.S. Department of Energy
1000 Independence Avenue , SW
Washington , DC 20585 Dear Secretary Bodman , On June 3 , 2008 and July 30 , 2008 respectively , your Department issued and affirmed an order pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act that will allow two major integrated oil companies – ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil – to export 98.1 billion cubic feet of Alaskan natural gas to Japan and other Pacific Rim countries .
This order , which will allow the export of as much natural gas as is used by 1.4 million American families in a year , comes at a time when the President had demanded that the moratoria on oil and gas drilling along our environmentally - sensitive coastal areas be lifted and Americans are being warned that their winter heating bills are going to be dramatically higher .
The Administration is trying to have it both ways – arguing that we need to drill everywhere because we do n’t have adequate energy supplies , while finding that we have so much energy that big oil companies can export it overseas and keep prices here at home higher than they would otherwise be .
Well , well , well .
Energy prices going through the roof in the U.S. , supposedly because we 're not drilling enough , and the Republicans are selling what we are drilling out the back door !
Wish I could say this was a surprise .
And sakes alive !
Who'd have guessed it'd be Slick Sarah Palin and the Alaskans selling it off ?
We 're all paying through the nose for our energy needs down here , Republicans are wetting themselves over the supposed need for more drilling , and Slick Sarah and her cronies are hawking their America 's wares to overseas bidders .
Which , not coincidentally , has the effect of hiking the prices Reg'lar Hockey MomsTM pay to , say , heat the seats in their new boondoggle hockey rinks , and , it seems , boosting the dividend checks paid directly to ...
Alaskan families like Sarah Palin's , who received $ 3200 per head this year .
Wow !
I have n't seen a scam this blatant since yesterday , when we found out Slick Sarah was charging Alaska taxpayers $ 60 a day to sleep in and munch those mooseburgers in her own kitchen .
So they 're pumping up prices by selling off the gas they told you was ours to the Japanese , and then paying themselves bonuses when they do !
( Plus extra for cheating you from home ! )
Enough with the skimming already , you jerks !
What 's the difference between a Hockey MomTM and Enron ?
Yeah , it turns out that 's lipstick too .
Your phone says a lot about you , and if you are one of the testers of UCLA ’s Personal Environmental Impact Report , your phone is telling your friends how green you are .
Or are n’t .
Comparing uploads from users ’
Nokia GPS - enabled phones with info from public databases , Personal Environmental Impact Report ( PEIR ) calculates whether you are driving or walking to work , whether you stopped for fast food , how much you polluted near a hospital and how much smog you inhaled .
Then it lets you publish your report card on Facebook .
That does n’t make it a competition , according to Jeff Burke , the area lead for the Urban Sensing program at UCLA .
" Life is complex – lots of things go into people ’s transportation choices " Burke said .
" Our initial aim was conversation , not competition . "
The app is being demoed at the Wired NextFest future tech expo in Chicago ’s Millennium Park .
The free exhibit runs through October 12 .
Burke admits to driving a non - hybrid that gets low gas mileage , but says working on PEIR has an effect – even when he ’s too busy to upload his GPS data .
" Even just developing this has made us more cognizant of things we do daily , " Burke said .
PEIR users upload their GPS coordinates , which are taken at 30 second intervals .
Then PEIR tries to understand what mode of transportation a person traveled by using algorithms similar to those used in speech recognition ,
It ’s not as simple a problem as one might think , since walking in L.A. , though rare , can look much like traveling by car in the traffic - choked city when viewed by GPS coordinates only .
Since raw scores do n’t mean much , PEIR shows people their trends over time in each of the four categories : smog exposure , fast food exposure , carbon impact and sensitive sites impact .
PEIR developers plan to add a way to plot alternative routes and compare their scores before leaving the house and deciding whether to bring the car keys or the bus pass .
Currently the app is in a closed 30 - person beta in Los Angeles , and the group is looking to expand to testing with a group of high school students in the Bay Area –- though the eventual goal is global .
As in global warming .

John and Helen Taylor are the two of the world 's most fuel - efficient drivers , and to prove it they 've set off on an 8,000 - mile drive around the United States to set a new record for fuel economy .
The husband - and - wife team from Australia are the Lennon and McCartney of hypermiling , having racked up three - dozen fuel efficiency records in 26 years .
They 've already circumnavigated the globe on a record - setting 24 tanks of fuel and crossed Australia on just eight , getting 75 mpg along the way .
Now they plan to go coast - to - coast across America using no more than 12 tanks to beat the current cross-country fuel economy record of 51.8 mpg .
" It will be a great adventure to drive through the 48 U.S. mainland states , " Helen Taylor says .
" We want to educate the American public that by choosing the right car , using the right fuel and adopting fuel - saving techniques , everyone in the U.S. can save money , fuel and reduce carbon emissions . "
The pair set off from Chantilly , Virginia this morning in a new Volkswagen Jetta TDI .
The EPA rates the car at 29 city / 40 highway , but VW says independent tests by AMCI returned 38 city / 44 highway .
The Taylors believe they can improve that by avoiding sudden starts and stops , scrupulously following the speed limit , keeping their tires properly inflated and following other basic " fuel - stretch " techniques anyone can adopt .
The trip will take the couple counter - clockwise around the country with stops in Vermont , Ohio , Iowa , South Dakota , Montana , Nevada , California , Colorado , Oklahoma , Illinois and Louisiana .
They expect to arrive in West Virginia on Sept. 26 .
Topping the record should be a piece of cake .
The couple averaged 75 mpg earlier this year during a 25 - day , 9,060 - mile trek around Australia in a Peugeot 308 diesel .
Two years ago they set the Guinness world record for fuel efficiency for a ' round - the - world trip , slogging 18,467 miles through 25 countries in a Volkswagen Golf diesel that got 52.1 mpg .
A hardcore hypermiler on over - inflated tires could probably pulse - and - glide their way to better numbers , but until Guinness recognizes them for it , the Taylors hold the title .

In March , Microsoft announced that their upcoming Internet Explorer 8 would : " use its most standards compliant mode , IE8 Standards , as the default . "
Note the last word : default .
Microsoft argued that , in light of their newly published interoperability principles , it was the right thing to do .
This declaration heralded an about - face and was widely praised by the web standards community ; people were stunned and delighted by Microsoft 's promise .
This week , the promise was broken .
It lasted less than six months .
Now that Internet Explorer IE8 beta 2 is released , we know that many , if not most , pages viewed in IE8 will not be shown in standards mode by default .
The dirty secret is buried deep down in the « Compatibility view » configuration panel , where the « Display intranet sites in Compatibility View » box is checked by default .
Thus , by default , intranet pages are not viewed in standards mode .
How many pages are affected by this change ?
Here 's the back of my envelope :
The PC market can be split into two segments — the enterprise market and the home market .
The enterprise market accounts for around 60 per cent of all PCs sold , while the home market accounts for the remaining 40 per cent .
Within enterprises , intranets are used for all sorts of things and account for , perhaps , 80 per cent of all page views .
Thus , intranets account for about half of all page views on PCs !
Furthermore , web standards are discriminated against in IE8 by the icon that appears next to standards - compliant web pages :
The picture shows a broken page .
A broken page ?
Why is broken page icon shown next to standards - compliant pages ?
The idea , apparently , is to encourage users to escape standards - mode by clicking on the broken page .
There 's a dastardly logic here : showing a broken page may make users wonder if they are seeing pages correctly .
Authors are probably not too thrilled by having a broken page shown next to their pages , and the only way to avoid the icon is to not trigger standards mode .
The message is clear : do n't use standards !
I have a few suggested remedies .
First , I suggest that IE8 not introduce version targeting which only perpetuates the problem of non-compliant pages .
Instead , IE8 should respect the established conventions which do n't need manual switching between modes .
If Microsoft insists on displaying some kind of icon next to standards - compliant web pages , I suggest they use this image instead :
Microsoft has a long - standing tradition of saying the right things about standards , but shipping non-standard products .
IE8 could be different .
Microsoft have done the hard technical work .
They 've made a promise they can keep .
I call on them to make the right choice . ®
TORONTO ( Reuters ) - The Canadian dollar skidded to its lowest close in more than three years versus the U.S. dollar on Tuesday as the Bank of Canada cut its key overnight interest rate and suggested more rate cuts may be needed .
Bond prices finished comfortably higher across the curve as the likelihood of further Bank of Canada rate cuts and a slide in equity markets sparked another wave of demand for secure government debt .
The Canadian dollar closed at C$ 1.2137 to the U.S. dollar , or 82.39 U.S. cents , down from C$ 1.1937 to the U.S. dollar , or 83.77 U.S. cents , at Monday ’s close .
The Bank of Canada ’s decision to lower its key rate by 25 basis points fell short of the 50 - basis - point cut that many of Canada ’s primary securities dealers had expected , but the tone of the statement was enough to keep the Canadian dollar down .
Not only did the central bank suggest it would likely cut rates further , but it also slashed its projections for economic growth and inflation given the global economic downturn , financial markets in stress , and the fall in commodity prices .
“ It looks like rates will be going lower in Canada and that ’s not good for the ( Canadian ) currency , ” said Charmaine Buskas , senior economics strategist at TD Securities .
“ The Canadian dollar has also been hit by softening oil prices so that kind of one - two punch did n’t really provide much in the way of support for the ( currency ) today . ”
Lower oil prices often weigh on the Canadian dollar because Canada is a key supplier of oil to the United States .
The rate cut follows the Bank of Canada ’s unexpected 50 - basis - point cut on October 8 in a coordinated move with other central banks to help calm ailing financial markets .
The bank ’s key rate is now 2.25 percent .
The Canadian dollar got a short - lived boost to C$ 1.2023 to the U.S. dollar , or 83.17 U.S. cents , immediately after the rate announcement since it was less than the 50 - point cut many had been anticipating .
But the gain was quickly wiped out as the market started to sift through the details of the bank ’s statement .
The Bank of Canada will offer more details on its projection for the economy and inflation when it releases its Monetary Policy Report on October 23 .
“ What the market is really keying in on is the overt dovish sentiment that ’s been delivered in the communique , ” said Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at National Bank of Canada .
“ Nothing about the communique that I can see suggests that the bank is looking at anything other than potentially cutting rates going forward . ”
BOND PRICES RALLY
Canadian bond prices all finished higher due to a sharp selloff in equities and the likelihood of more rate cuts in Canada .
After big gains for Toronto Stock Exchange ’s main index on Friday and Monday , investors returned to their selling ways on Tuesday as the market fell 455 points , or 4.4 percent .
Bond prices hovered around the break - even level early in the morning but eventually moved higher across the curve after the Bank of Canada cut its overnight lending rate to its lowest level since September 2004 .
“ Some of the optimism we had seen on Friday and Monday is perhaps reversing and so money is flowing back into bonds , ” said Carlos Leitao , chief economist at Laurentian Bank of Canada .
“ And while today ’s rate cut was generally what was expected , people were expecting something a little more . ”
The two - year bond rose 5 Canadian cents to C$ 101.19 to yield 2.169 percent .
The 10 - year bond increased 21 Canadian cents to C$ 104.48 to yield 3.691 percent .
The yield spread between the two - year and the 10 - year bond moved to 154 basis points from 157 basis points at the previous close .
The 30 - year bond rose 71 Canadian cents to C$ 113.56 to yield 4.182 percent .
In the United States , the 30 - year Treasury yielded 4.212 percent .

Nothing the Clippers stars said to Steve Ballmer swayed him from his decision to move on from Doc Rivers .
We know what has happened to the Republican party in foreign policy .
Neoconservatism now has undisputed intellectual hegemony .
The campaign of John McCain , and the emergence of the blank slate of Sarah Palin ( a blank slate currently being filled in by AIPAC ) reinforces this view .
McCain is much , much more neoconservative than even Bush .
What this means is that those of us who still believe in a conservative foreign policy - reality - based , idealistic within clear realist boundaries , cognizant of America 's mounting fiscal collapse , aware of the fact that power politics never ends , chastened by the Iraq fiasco , concerned about reinforcing alliances and maintaining a solid military - have our work cut out .
The very promising new conservative online magazine , Culture 11 , is beginning the task of reconstructing a conservative foreign policy in the wake of the Bush - Cheney fiasco and McCain 's belligerence .
Here 's a great essay trying to re-think foreign policy from the perspective of America 's founders .
Money quote :
There are two Washingtonian principles which I believe should serve as the basis for a long overdue audit of U.S. foreign policy , certainly since the end of the Cold War .
The first is Washington ’s admonition that “ permanent , inveterate antipathies against particular nations , and passionate attachments for others , should be excluded . ”
The second ( and here perhaps the Address should be updated from merely referring to Europe to every region of the world ) is for the United States to reconsider the level of involvement in the affairs of others : “ it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities . ”
Are American interests served by involving the United States in a multitude of regional problems that do not touch directly on our affairs ?
And do we need to continue to divide the world into categories of “ friend ” or “ foe ” , into leagues of “ democracies ” versus “ the autocracies ? ”
Such is alien to the Washingtonian ethos .
The first president took as his guide the following : “ Harmony , liberal intercourse with all nations are recommended by policy , humanity and interest . ”

As the election heads to the finish line , the Conservative lunatic fringe are really losing it .
Remember when right wing radio talk show host Bill Cunningham viciously attacked Obama as he opened up for John McCain in Cincinnati ?
McCain had to repudiate him shortly after and then Cunningham attacked McCain in response .
The circle jerk just makes one dizzy .
Well , in his mind , not only do poor people lack values , morals , and ethics , but they also are fat and flatulent . "
JFK :
" You know , people are poor in America , Steve , not because they lack money ; they 're poor because they lack values , morals , and ethics .
And if government can't teach and instill that , we 're wasting our time simply giving poor people money . "
Earlier in the show , Cunningham had stated that " unlike many countries in the world , Steve , we have fat poor people .
We do n't have skinny poor people .
Ours are fat and flatulent . "
Our poor people are fat .
They are Cadillac Queens that eat great food which is paid for by you and me .
Digby then finds Rush Limbaugh saying that Obama is hypnotizing Americans .
No , really .
" I do remember reading that the highly educated are the most susceptible to being hypnotized , so that would put me in the risk group , ladies and gentlemen .
And yet , I 'm going to watch Obama tonight . "
" If you do watch Obama tonight , here 's the sign that I want you to make for your TV : ' Do not be hypnotized .
You are listening to a socialist . ' "
In case you 're wondering , the highly educated Rush is n't using " hypnotized " as a metaphor .
He means it literally .
It 's getting nuttier out there by the second .
This will be a long weekend .
We seem to be piggybacking off of each other here around Green Options lately – reading each others ’ posts and writing new posts based on them .
I just finished reading the post that Adam Williams wrote earlier today , World Naked Bike Ride : Is Anything Gained by Protesting Oil Dependency in the Buff ? , and in the post he mentions that Last week ExxonMobil reported a record - setting $ 11.7B in second - quarter profits .
These profits were gained , of course , at a time when Americans are paying more for gas at the pumps than they ever have in the past .
His post reminded me of something else I read earlier today , something else that had to do with ExxonMobil last week .
On August 1 , 40 local Dallas area high school students graduated from the 27th Annual ExxonMobil Green Team program .
According to ExxonMobil ’s website ,
The ExxonMobil Green Team Program is a summer youth employment program where students are paid to participate in cleanup , environmental and beautification projects , as well as construction projects in public parks and economically depressed neighborhoods throughout the United States .
Dallas is n’t the only place ExxonMobil sponsors this program .
It ’s currently run in 9 U.S. cities .
Students not only participate in environmental activities but they also work on basic academic skills in reading , math and writing and are taught the importance of education .
I love programs like this .
Education is one of the keys for youth in economically depressed communities to rise above what many expect from them .
And programs like these are not cheap to run .
It takes a lot of money to pull something like this together .
ExxonMobil works through non-profits and volunteer organizations in the individual cities to make the program happen .
In Dallas alone , the oil company has donated 6.1 million dollars for The Green Team program since 1981 .
I ’m also torn by programs like this .
I wonder , are they like the “ smoking is bad for you – do n’t do it ” campaigns that the tobacco companies are required to provide to youth which are pretty much a joke ?
Or do they come out of a genuine concern for trying to find solutions to our environmental woes and trying to help youth at the same time ?
ExxonMobile claims its concerned about the environment , but the majority of their profits come from a product that harms the environment .
It ’s a product that I use a lot less of than I used to , but still use it probably more than I need to .
And here , I ’m torn , too .
Should I be outraged by the profits that this company is earning ?
If consumers ( and I ’m one of them ) bought less of their product , their profits would be a lot less .
In a way , I ’m contributing to what many see as a problem .
I ’m left with a lot of questions and uncertainties this morning mulling around in my head and no definitive answers .
That ’s not unusual for me .
It often takes me a long time to work these things through .
For the next few days I ’ll be wondering , “ Can big oil companies also do good ? ”
But there is one thing I do n’t need to work through .
I ’m going to be happy for these 40 Dallas area students who had the opportunity to go through this program no matter who funded them .
They came in contact with adults who care about them and their future .
They got an education that they ca n’t get in the public school classroom – an education that may have changed their lives for the better .
Perhaps one of them caught the environmentalism bug and will end up studying it in college and go on to find the perfect solution for our energy problems .
Who knows ?

Some of the penguins are thought to have travelled 3,000 km
Hundreds of penguins have been returned to their native territory in the south Atlantic ocean by an air force plane after being found along Brazil 's coast .
Every year penguins make their way north from the colder waters near to Patagonia in search of food .
But the numbers and distances the penguins have travelled this year have amazed the authorities .
At least 1,000 birds are now said to have washed up on the coast of Brazil , some of which have died along the way .
Some are thought to have made a journey of more than 3,000 km ( 1,860 miles ) from the cold waters of Patagonia on the southern tip of South America .
Beach holiday Earlier this year the first reports of large numbers of penguins being found came in from southern Brazilian states such as Rio de Janeiro .
Now they are even being discovered in the far north of the country .
Some experts have said that penguin migration is closely linked to their need for food , and that the unusual journey the penguins are making suggests something has gone wrong with their normal fish supply .
Experts say it is not clear whether this is due to changes in water temperatures and ocean currents or man-made pollution .
Some of the birds were found covered in oil , while there has also been evidence that others were eating fish that are not part of their usual diet .
It is an annual task for the Brazilian air force to help return penguins to their native territory but it seems this year they are coping with higher numbers of their unusual passengers .
Hundreds of penguins were flown this week in a Hercules plane down to the southern tip of Brazil , where they are being released into the ocean - while some are to return on a navy vessel .
Other birds that were exhausted by their long journey are for the time being staying behind to enjoy the hospitable climate of Bahia - a Brazilian state known for its beautiful beaches and sunny weather .

Obama welcomes ' growing consensus ' on timeline
Speaking to reporters in Amman , Jordan , Barack Obama built on a week in which the Iraqi prime minister expressed explicit support for his timeline .
" I welcome the growing consensus in the United States and Iraq for a timeline , " Obama said , citing " the peril and the promise of this moment . "
Obama said the U.S. could strengthen the military , send troops to Afghanistan , and leave Iraq intact .
Asked about Iraqi officials who do n't think the country is ready for American troops to leave , Obama said they only oppose a " precipitous drawdown . "
" I have n't proposed a precipitous withdrawal . "
He also characterized his " terrific conversation " with General David Petraeus .
" His concern has to do with retaining as much flexibility as possible .
The focus of our conversation was not how precipitous my proposal was , " he said , saying they shared the goals of reducing violence , removing troops , and leaving a functioning government .
" What I emphasized to him is that , ' If I were in your shoes i'd probably feel the same way , ' " he said .
" My job as a candidate for president and a potential commander - in - chief extends beyond Iraq . "
ALSO : He condemned today 's terror attack in Jerusalem , calling it " a reminder of what Israelis have courageously lived with on a daily basis for far too long . "
WASHINGTON - Barack Obama and John McCain enter the final days of the presidential campaign amid dwindling cash reserves , with Obama hindered by a drop in fund - raising and McCain restrained by spending limits .
Democrat Obama spent more than $ 105 million during the first two weeks of October , according to new campaign finance reports , and reported raising only $ 36 million during that period , about half his pace in September when he brought in a record $ 150 million .
Obama had nearly $ 66 million in the bank as of Oct. 15 , and the Democratic National Committee and a joint Obama - party victory fund had another $ 31 million combined .
McCain and the Republican National Committee reported having a combined $ 84 million as of Oct. 15 to spend before Election Day .
McCain , who has accepted $ 84.1 million in public money , had spent all but $ 25 million as of mid-month .
The reports also showed Obama using his huge financial advantage .
He spent more than $ 80 million on media advertising , while McCain and the Republican National Committee spent a combined $ 38 million .
In seven key swing states - Colorado , Florida , Georgia , Missouri , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Virginia - Obama ran more than double the number of ads between Oct. 6 and Oct. 22 than McCain , 53,049 to 21,106 , Nielsen Media Research reported yesterday .
Obama has been most active on the airwaves in Florida , where he ran 15,887 ads during that period compared with 4,662 for McCain .
Obama , who opted out of public financing , is continuing to appeal to supporters to donate more .
McCain and his running mate , Sarah Palin , meanwhile , tried to douse a furor over how their side spent theirs .
The RNC came under scrutiny after reporting this week that it had spent about $ 150,000 in September on wardrobe and cosmetics after Palin joined the GOP ticket .
In interviews with the Chicago Tribune and Fox News Channel , Palin said the clothes bought for the Republican National Convention were not worth $ 150,000 and said most have not left her campaign plane .
" Those clothes are not my property , " she said Thursday night on Fox .
" They are either returned or they 're going to charity . "

Tonight , Sarah Palin will be nominated as the Republican Party ’s choice for vice president of the United States .
But back home , she has cheered the work of a tiny party that long has pushed for a statewide vote on whether Alaska should secede from those same United States .
And her husband , Todd , was a member of the party for seven years .
“ Keep up the good work , ” Sarah Palin told members of the Alaskan Independence Party in a videotaped speech to their convention six months ago in Fairbanks .
She wished the party luck on what she called its “ inspiring convention . ”
The Alaskan Independence Party , founded in 1978 , initially promoted “ the Alaskan independence movement . ”
But now , according to its website , “ its primary goal is merely a vote on secession . ”
McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said Tuesday that Palin did not support splitting Alaska off from the rest of the country .
He sidestepped the question of whether she favored a statewide vote on secession .
“ Gov. Palin believes that every American is entitled to their point of view , and their political beliefs , ” he said .
Bounds also did not directly answer the question of whether her husband supported the secession of Alaska .
“ I can tell you that Mr. Palin is a proud American , ” Bounds said .
“ And he ’s excited that his wife has joined John McCain to reform Washington and make government work more effectively for all Americans . ”
For all but two months from 1995 to 2002 , the governor ’s husband was registered as an Alaskan Independence Party member , according to the Alaska Division of Elections .
With McCain ’s campaign emphasizing patriotism -- his latest slogan is “ Country First ” -- the Palins ’ links to a party founded by the late secessionist gold miner Joe Vogler could prove awkward .
“ I ’m an Alaskan , not an American , ” Vogler is quoted as saying elsewhere on the party ’s website .
“ I ’ve got no use for America or her damned institutions . ”
The party supports a plebiscite on four options that it says Alaskans were entitled to vote on before becoming a state in 1959 : Form a sovereign nation of their own , become a state , accept commonwealth status similar to Puerto Rico ’s , or remain a U.S. territory .
Leaders of the party say many of its 13,681 registered members have joined out of frustration over restrictions that the federal government has placed on the use of its vast land holdings in Alaska .
Beyond the secession vote , the party also advocates gun rights , home schooling and abolition of property taxes .
A question - and - answer page on its website asks , “ Are n’t most Alaskan Independence Party members a bunch of radicals and kooks ? ”
“ The party has its share of individualists , in the grand Alaskan tradition , ” the answer says .
“ No longer a fringe party , the AIP is a viable third party with a serious mission and qualified candidates for elected offices . ”
Less than 3 % of the state ’s 479,721 registered voters are members of the party .
An AIP high point came in 1990 , when Walter J. Hickel -- a Republican governor of Alaska in the late 1960s -- won the job again as the Alaskan Independence Party ’s candidate .
But he returned months later to the GOP .
Palin and her husband attended the party ’s 1994 convention at a Best Western in Wasilla , Alaska , said former Chairman Mark Chryson , a computer repairman who is now the party ’s webmaster .
A former mayor of Wasilla , Palin also spoke to the party ’s convention in the same hotel in 2006 when she was running for governor , Chryson said .
Dexter Clark , an Alaskan Independence Party vice chairman , brought up Palin ’s ties to the group in videotaped remarks to the second North American Secessionist Convention in October in Chattanooga , Tenn .
“ She was an AIP member before she got the job as the mayor of a small town , ” Clark told the group .
“ That was a nonpartisan job .
But you get along to go along .
She eventually joined the Republican Party . ”
McCain ’s campaign distributed Palin ’s voter registration records Tuesday to show that she had never been a member of the AIP .
The Alaska Division of Elections confirmed that Palin had been registered as a Republican since 1982 .
McCain ’s campaign also slammed ABC News for posting a Web story saying that Palin had been a member of the party , calling the report a “ smear . ”

Heather Locklear 's 911 Tipster Under Investigation ( 911 Call Video )
informant
was arrested last Saturday , September 27th , for driving under the influence of a controlled substance .
New information has been uncovered about theconcerned citizen who phoned in the 911 call .
Access Hollywood is reporting that former US Weekly reporter turned paparazzomade the call .
When Ishkanian called 911 , she told the dispatcher that she had first seen Locklear at a local market and that she was drunk .
In hot pursuit of the actress , the pap gave a blow by blow description of what was happened .
The dispatcher told her to immediately stop following Locklear .
Whether she complied is up for debate .
Here is where things get interesting .
It turns out that Ishkanian is currently under investigation by the FBI for hacking into US Weekly computers in order to locate celebrities .
Now the question is , did she set up Locklear in order to create the story and secure the hot money shots ?
Jill Ishkanian 's attorney says that she was not staking out the actress or even working at the time .
He is reportedly furious with the allegations against his client .
" It 's defamatory in the extreme and it 's causing my client .... damage . "
We 're more inclined to be sympathetic toward Heather Locklear and would guess the courts will take a closer look at the whole mess before sentencing the actress - and rightly so .
Heather Locklear 's drug test results will not be available for a few weeks .
Check out photos of Ishkanian below as well as the 911 video recording .
PRINCETON , NJ --
With exactly three weeks remaining before Election Day , Barack Obama leads John McCain in the presidential preferences of registered voters by nine percentage points , 51 % to 42 % .
Gallup is also looking at the race according to two likely voter scenarios .
One , the traditional Gallup approach , takes into account voters ' intentions to vote in the current election as well as their self - reported voting history .
Among this group , Obama leads McCain by six points , 51 % to 45 % .
The other approach uses only voters ' self - professed likelihood to vote in 2008 , but does not factor in whether respondents have voted in past elections .
Among this expanded group , Obama leads by 10 points , 53 % to 43 % .
As noted in Tuesday 's report , between 50 % and 52 % of registered voters have favored Obama in each Gallup Poll Daily tracking report since Oct.
4 . Support for McCain has been a steady 41 % to 43 % across the same time period .
Thus , although the gap between the two candidates has varied from seven to 11 points in recent days , the preferences of registered voters have , in fact , been quite stable , with Obama averaging a nine - point lead .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
Today 's three - day rolling average , based on interviews conducted Oct. 11 - 13 , includes two days of interviewing following last week 's steep drop in the stock market , and interviewing on Monday night after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged a record 936 points .
It is unclear from the individual days ' tracking results whether these contrasting events have had any immediate impact on voter preferences .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 11 - 13 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,793 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,140 " traditional " likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention and past voting behavior ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 2,289 more broadly defined likely voters ( based on the model taking into account current voting intention only ) , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Reading through the corporate media in the wake the House passage of the Banker Takeover bill , I am struck by not only the sickening apologia of the supposed intelligentsia but the downright mean spiritedness , no doubt a likely result of nearly eight years of neocon rule .
It is now fashionable to kick the victims while they are not only down , but thrown under the bus .
Consider Steven Pearlstein , a scribe for the CIA ’s favorite newspaper , the Washington Post .
“ The basic problem here is that too many people do n’t understand the seriousness of the situation , ” writes Mr. Pearlstein .
“ Americans fail to understand that they are facing the real prospect of a decade of little or no economic growth because of the bursting of a credit bubble that they helped create and that now threatens to bring down the global financial system . ”
In short , the global financial system is going to hell in hand basket because of the little guy , not because of the Wall Street shysters and the banksters .
For scribbling such things , Mr. Pearlstein is a winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ And they will come around , reluctantly , to the understanding that the only way to get out of these situations is to have governments all around the world borrow gobs of money and effectively nationalize large swaths of the financial system so it can be restructured , recapitalized , reformed and returned to private ownership once the crisis has passed and the economy has gotten back on its feet . ”
Sounds more like socialism , and not any old garden variety socialism .
It sounds like National Socialism .
Call it fascism , what Mussolini deemed corporatism , if you must .
Nouriel Roubini , professor of economics at the Stern School in New York University , had something to say about this .
Roubini rejects the socialist comparison out of hand , saying “ calling it socialism ( even socialism for the rich , the well - connected and Wall Street ) is giving a bad name even to a failed experiment like socialism ; this is more akin to the creation of a corporatist state ( like the Italian fascism or the German Third Reich ) where private sector interests are protected ( gains privatized and losses socialized ) , where the government is taken over by corrupt and reckless private interests . ”
You know , the kind of interests that run newspapers like the Washington Post , the sort where Pulitzer Prize darlings excoriate the public for being suckered by snake oil salesmen wearing $ 5,000 Anderson & Sheppard suits as they angle to get their hands on your pension and 401 k so it can be pissed away in the Grand Casino of Speculation .
Curious thing is , Mr. Pearlstein is a liberal .
I guess that gives at least some idea of how the administration of Barack H. Obama will be run .
The Rise of the Fourth Reich
For the first time Jim Marrs has gathered compelling evidence that an effort has been underway for the past sixty years to bring a form of National Socialism to modern America , creating in essence a modern empire — or " Fourth Reich " !

McCain , Obama to participate in church forum
Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama will participate next month in a question - and - answer forum at Saddleback Church , Pastor Rick Warren said Monday .
Warren , who oversees the 22,000 - member congregation , will question the presidential candidates on Aug. 16 during the church 's Saddleback Civil Forum on Leadership and Compassion .
Joshua DuBois , Obama 's director of religious affairs , said the senator was " looking forward to going back to Saddleback with his good friend Pastor Rick Warren . "
Obama spoke at Saddleback in 2006 .
Warren said the candidates did n't want a debate format but rather the two - hour forum .
The candidates are expected to appear together briefly before each takes questions from Warren for about an hour .
A coin toss determined that Obama will go first .
Warren is the author of " The Purpose Driven Life . "
We ’ve heard a number of reports of Safari memory leaks , and we ’d like to fix a bunch of these .
This is a very important factor for usability of Safari and other WebKit apps .
You can help !
Here ’s how :
Finding Leaks
The Mac OS X Developer Tools include a very useful program for leak detection .
Here ’s how you can use it :
Get a fresh WebKit build , ideally a Development build as this turns off the various custom allocators in WebKit .
Set the MallocStackLogging environment variable to YES ( in bash , export MallocStackLogging=YES
, in tcsh , setenv MallocStackLogging YES ) .
Run Safari using run-safari Browse around a little From the command line , run leaks Safari
At this point , if you found memory leaks , the leaks program will tell you how many , and give stack traces for each .
You can file this report , along with a description of what steps you took to get the leak , in bugzilla .
Put “ LEAK : ” at the start of the title so these bugs are easy to find .
If you want to make an even better bug report , see if you can reproduce the leak by following some specific set of steps , and include that in the bug .
You can also look at the backtraces in the leak report and see if you can match up ones that look the same .
It ’s useful to file a separate bug report for each one that looks different , and to consolidate leaks on different sites that look like they have the same stack trace .
Fixing Leaks
Fixing memory leaks is a bit of a black art .
The leak checker will tell you where the leaked memory was allocated , but not why it was never freed .
Sometimes it will be obvious from code inspection that there is no free call to match a particular allocation .
Other times , things get trickier – especially when refcounting is involved .
In that case , you often know that some code is holding an extra ref without releasing it , but it can be very hard to tell what code .
Here ’s a trick I have often found useful for these situations .
Fire up the app in gdb .
Set breakpoints on the appropriate ref and deref methods .
Then , use the gdb commands feature to set commands of bt 10 ; cont for these breakpoints .
You ’ll get a 10 - frame backtrace for every ref and deref , and that ’s often enough to find the one that does n’t pair up .
Destroy All Leaks
In today 's Republican Party , it 's easy to win forgiveness for being wrong .
It 's being right that gets you into trouble .
Take Ron Paul , for example .
In the run-up to the Iraq war , the Texas congressman asked , " Are we willing to bear the economic burden of a $ 100 billion war against Iraq , with oil prices expected to skyrocket and further rattle an already shaky American economy ? "
And then when he made a run for the GOP presidential nomination earlier this year , Paul warned repeatedly of the dangers of funding that war and other out - of - control expenditures with dollars hot off the printing press .
That 's two for two .
But the Grand Old Party has been treating Paul like a pariah rather than a prophet ever since John McCain won the nomination .
McCain could have been magnanimous and offered Paul a speaking role at last month 's convention .
Instead , the GOP would n't even permit Paul to go on the floor without an escort .
Paul is now returning the favor by calling for Republican voters to reject McCain in favor of one of the third - party candidates to McCain 's right .
When I spoke to him on the phone the other day , Paul told me he is backing Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party .
But he also is telling voters to look at Bob Barr of the Libertarian Party , " just so they do n't vote for the establishment . "
As for McCain , Paul said , " The Buchananites and the libertarians have trouble getting along with him .
He 's really building his alliance with the Liebermans of the world . "
That would be Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , a Democrat who has a National Taxpayers Union rating of F compared with the straight - A rating of the physician - politician known as " Dr. No " for his habit of voting against spending bills .
Lieberman got a prime speaking spot at the convention and was even reported to be McCain 's first choice for the GOP vice presidential nomination .
That would have been the last straw for many conservative voters .
But I wrote off McCain after one of his encounters with Paul during the debates .
The subject was the Iraq war , which McCain had predicted would be " a short war - a month or two months . "
Instead of admitting he was wrong , McCain lashed out at Paul in one debate , saying , " We allowed Hitler to come to power with that kind of attitude . "
Has so much ignorance ever been expressed in so few words ?
" We " did n't allow Hitler to come to power .
The German people elected him , just as the Iranians elected McCain 's current designated Hitler , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
That 's why conservatives have traditionally been against the Wilsonian idea of spreading democracy by force .
" People are made uncomfortable when they 're being challenged on principle , " Paul told me .
" That was annoying to him .
I was sort of exposing him for his lack of credentials as a conservative . "
That lack of credentials was what led McCain to nominate Sarah Palin for the vice presidency , according to Paul .
" I guess it was sort of pandering to everybody , " he said .
It seemed to work at first .
But Palin quickly endorsed the worst of McCain 's ideas and even added a few of her own , though at this writing no one can tell just what those ideas are .
And then the economy collapsed for the reasons Paul had cited in the primary debates .
" They sort of mocked me for talking about the dollar , " he said of his GOP opponents .
Well , he who laughs last has to be rolling on the floor this October .
McCain 's dropping in the polls , with his prospects for a comeback resting on the hope that Palin can speak in sentences rather than in tongues at tonight 's debate .
If the Democrats do go on to win the White House , Paul said , one positive effect might be to restore Republicans to the conservative foreign policy positions they held when Bill Clinton was president .
" When Clinton was bombing Serbia and Kosovo , about 98 percent of Republicans were complaining , " he said .
So a McCain loss would n't be all bad for the party .
Meanwhile , a McCain victory could be a disaster if he goes on to start those vague " other wars " to which he has alluded .
The Republican Party is supposed to be a " big tent . "
And there was plenty of room in it for Lieberman , Mike " I Am Not a Primate " Huckabee and the beauty - contestant - turned - moose - hunter .
But somehow there was n't room for the guy whose views most closely mirror those of Barry Goldwater , the founder of modern conservatism and the man who once held McCain 's Senate seat .
I enjoy a circus as much as the next guy .
But this year there are just a few too many clowns under the big top .
Last month , actress Lori Loughlin was sentenced to two months in federal prison for her role in the college admissions scandal .
As it turns out , she gets to serve her sentence at the prison of her choice , and that did n’t sit well with NBA star LeBron James .
“ I ’m laughing cause sometimes you have to just to stop from crying ! ” said James in an Instagram post .
“ Do n’t make no damn sense to me . ”
Fans and non-fans alike agreed that James has a point .
Enlarge By Jeff Fusco , Getty Images Former presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton , seen here campaining for candidate Barack Obama in Scranton , Pa. , on Monday , says she probably will not run for president again .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton puts the chances of her running for president again at near zero — slightly higher than the chances she gives for becoming Senate majority leader or a Supreme Court justice .
In an interview aired Tuesday on Fox & Friends on the Fox News Channel , the Democrat was asked the chances , on a scale of 1 to 10 , that she would be the next majority leader in the Senate .
" Oh , probably zero , " she said .
" I 'm not seeking any other position than to be the best senator from New York that I can be . "
Being nominated to the Supreme Court ?
" Zero , " Clinton said .
" I have no interest in doing that . "
Running for president again ?
" Probably close to zero , " she said .
" There 's an old saying : Bloom where you 're planted . "
The former first lady , who was elected to the Senate in 2000 and re-elected in 2006 , said she looked forward to working as a senator with a Barack Obama administration .

Angela write : " As an Archaeologist , I wanted my first tattoo to be something related to culture .
The Ouroborus is an ancient symbol of a serpent biting its tail and has been a part of a number of cultures and beliefs including ( but not limited to ! )
Egyptian , Greek ( who " borrowed " it from the Phoenicians and gave it the name " ouroborus " meaning " tail - eater " ) , Norse , Chinese , Aztec , Hindu , and various Native American Indian mythologies .
The snake in my tattoo is a custom piece by my tattooist , but the writing is straight from the earliest - known drawing of the Ouroborus in the Chrysopoeia of Cleopatra drawn around 1600 BC .
The Ouroborus has carried a number of meanings ; the cyclical nature of the universe ( the serpent eating its own tail to sustain itself ) , infinity and eternal unity ( the text is translated as both " one is all " and " all is one " or even " the one , the all " ) , reincarnation , in Alchemy it is a purifying sigil , in Christianity it is a symbol of the confines of the physical world , and the serpent is often depicted with light and dark sides to it ( i.e. yin and yang ) .
In many myths , the serpent encircles the world - a myth that may have been inspired by those times of the year during which the Milky Way can be seen winding through the night sky , like a great snake .
I chose this for my first tattoo because I have always been fascinated by cross-cultural symbols and one that encompassed so many meanings was particularly interesting to me . "

Carbon Nanotube Manufacturing Breakthrough Could Mean Bye - Bye Steel
Carbon nanotubes have been popping on Giz for a while , touted as one of the next wonder - materials — but a new development in their manufacture means they may not remain “ future technology ” for long .
In fact the work of a team at CSIRO and the University of Texas at Dallas means that commercial - scale production of sheets of carbon nanotube “ textile ” is possible at up to seven metres per minute .
And these are no ordinary textiles either : they ’re transparent and way stronger than a sheet of steel .
The team ’s technique involves chemically - growing “ forests ” of nanotubes that self - assemble , and is reported in Science currently .
If it proves true we may see nanotube materials replacing metals like steel pretty soon — though I ’m not sure how many people would balk at flying in a plane with wings you can partly see through .

Clozure CL 1.2 is out now .
It runs on x86 - 64 and PowerPC processors , under Mac OS X , Linux , and FreeBSD .
( I continue to be surprised by how many people think it runs only on Macintosh systems . )
This is the first official release in over two and a half years .
Fast compiler , native threads , convenient FFI , Unicode , generational GC , etc. See http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl
One major feature that will be in Clozure CL 1.3 is support for the 32 - bit x86 platform .
In fact , an experimental 32 - bit lisp is already in the trunk for Darwin /x86 .
I worked on the 32 - bit Intel port .
It ’s probably a little unusual for software to be ported from x86 - 64 back to x8632 .
Anti-progress , as it were .
The existence of an x8664 port made the job quite a bit simpler : one major benefit was that there was already a working assembler ( and disassembler , too ) .
I was also able to use the existing low - level x86 - 64 assembly language code as a model for what the corresponding 32 - bit version should look like .
Another thing I had going for me was that the lisp already ran on the 32 - bit PowerPC , so the word size issues were mostly ironed out .
I did n’t really know ( or care to know ) the x86 architecture all that well before I started working on the port .
I think other architectures ( SPARC , MIPS , PowerPC , … ) are much nicer targets .
However , the hardware engineers at Intel and AMD are brilliant , and it ’s impossible to ignore the performance of the x86 chips that they build .
You just have to hold your nose , study the architecture manuals , and get on with it .
After doing the port , I find it funny that I look on x86 - 64 as some sort of Nirvana .
( I mentioned this on a private IRC channel , and got the reply “ It ’s not THAT bad .
Of the 8 or so architectures that I can think of that ’re still in use , it ’s in the top 7 . ” )
I ’m afraid that it might be a bit boring to read about issues that face the lisp implementer when targeting x8632 , but maybe I ’ll write a follow - on post with some more details if there ’s any interest .
Stock ownership is defined as company shares held directly by the executive , in addition to restricted stock or units .

Correction : September 23 , 2008
A chart on Sunday showing the change in the value of shares that chief executives held in their financial companies from January 2007 through Friday erroneously included one former executive .
Henry M. Paulson Jr. , who was chief executive of Goldman Sachs and is now the Treasury secretary , sold his holdings in Goldman upon joining the Bush administration in 2006 — a point The Times correctly reported on Saturday .
Mr. Paulson did not hold $ 523.5 million worth of the company ’s stock as of Friday .
Rarely has a vice - presidential showdown been packed with such political importance .
Ms. Palin ’s unsteady performances in recent interviews turned this debate into can ’t - miss television , but they have also raised questions  from conservatives , among others  about the soundness of Mr. McCain ’s judgment in picking a relative newcomer as his running mate .
Recent polls have suggested that his shifting statements on the economic bailout talks in Washington have not reassured some of these conservatives , raising the stakes for Ms. Palin to deliver steady , informed answers and repartee in the debate .
Mr. Biden ’s aides had their own concerns before the debate , worrying that a single gaffe by him could shift the onus off Ms. Palin .
They worried that even the slightest miscalibration of his tone , body language and mien could imply condescension or worse toward Ms. Palin and become the story of the night .
With both candidates keeping their cool and addressing each other politely with honorifics 
Mr. Biden said “ Sarah Palin ” at one point and then correct himself with “ Governor Palin ”  there was a certain symmetry to the debate .
Both candidates have a son preparing to serve in Iraq .
Every time Mr. Biden seemed to criticize Mr. Bush , Ms. Palin would mention “ mavericks . ”
And when Mr. Biden criticized the Bush administration at one point , Ms. Palin replied : “ Say it ai n’t so , Joe .
There you go again , pointing backwards again . ”
The two candidates have both faced personal challenges , too : Ms. Palin ’s baby son has Down syndrome , while Mr. Biden , in the 1970s , lost his wife and daughter in a car accident .
As he recalled that time and the near - death of one of his sons , Mr. Biden briefly choked up  the one moment of raw emotion in an otherwise stable debate between two fairly disciplined candidates .
“ The notion that , somehow , because I ’m a man , I do n’t know what it ’s like to raise two kids alone , I do n’t know what it ’s like to have a child you ’re not sure is going to make it , ” Mr. Biden said .
“ I understand as well as , with all due respect , the governor or anybody else , what it ’s like for those people sitting around that kitchen table .
And guess what ?
They ’re looking for help . ”
Our Congressional Representative James Walsh ( R - NY ) recently “ lashed out at Iraq . ”
Walsh , now in his tenth term , said Iraq should use its oil windfall sales to repay some of the $ 48 billion the United States has spent “ rebuilding ” there .
“ We have delivered democracy for them …
The least they could do is step up to the plate and help out , ” Walsh opined .
Let ’s not look too closely at that “ democracy ” we ’ve “ delivered . ”
Let ’s not ask to what extent bombed - out medical facilities have been restored .
Nor to what extent Iraqis , after five years of beneficent occupation , now have electricity and potable water .
Nor how many Iraqi jobs any U.S. reconstruction has generated .
Nor how much of that $ 48 billion lined the capacious pockets of Halliburton et al .
Nor how much of the “ re- building ” fund goes to building permanent U.S. military bases .
Nor need we ask who ’s going to pay to clean up Iraq ’s soil , air and water after their protracted exposure to depleted uranium — the toxic and radioactive substance used in the U.S. shells rained down on that liberated land ?
And let ’s not open that other can of worms : how will we compensate Iraqi families for the unnumbered kin we have killed ?
Instead let ’s take a more legalistic approach .
Let ’s look at precedent .
In 1990 when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait , no one thought to hold that victim responsible for the damage .
Nor did anyone claim that , because it had oil assets , Kuwait owed Iraq money .
No one – especially the UN Security Council — questioned that it was Iraq that had to reimburse losses and finance the rebuilding .
Indeed , since its Gulf War defeat , Iraq keeps paying billions in reparations .
But those billions are only a fraction of what Kuwait and the corporations doing business there still keep demanding .
Fast forward to the new century .
Now it ’s Iraq that ’s been ( illegally ) invaded ; it ’s Iraq that ’s been laid low .
In a classic case of “ charging the victim , ” Mr. Walsh and some of his Congressional colleagues , both Democrat and Republican , argue that Iraq must help pay for its own rebuilding .
Both common sense and common decency wince .
It is the invader , not the invaded , who is both morally and legally obligated to pay to restore a war - torn land .
And note : those billions Iraq has been paying Kuwait go to Kuwaitis and not to any Iraqi war profiteer .
Given adequate reparations , Iraq – a land of builders and engineers – is quite capable of repairing itself .
It needs no assist from the invader ’s avid corporations .
Those who perpetrated the U.S. invasion , besides being tried in a Nurnberg - like tribunal , should make financial amends .
Their shills — much of the U.S. mainstream media – also share responsibility .
But sorting out who should pay what would take the wisdom of Solomon .
In the case of Kuwait , a UN commission plays Solomon .
The case seemed simple enough : only Iraq invaded ; it was then vanquished .
Ergo , the Iraqi people — via their oil reserves — must be perpetually taxed to repair Saddam Hussein ’s folly .
Never mind that it was his western allies who helped militarize Saddam ’s regime .
Yes , some Iraqis also collaborated with Saddam .
But most were Saddam ’s victims .
Saddam frowned on dissent .
Many of his soldiers were conscripts .
Thousands of these — slaughtered from the air as they fled homeward – remain interred in desert sands .
Now , the U.S. - Iraq case is n’t quite parallel .
All too many U.S. people and our Congressional representatives enthusiastically supported “ Shock and Awe ” and the ensuing occupation .
Does it let us off the hook — at least a little — that Cheney - Bush and their shills persistently lied to us ?
Many U.S. Americans believed that our “ pre-emptive ” war had nothing to do with certain corporations cornering the world ’s oil supply .
Nor did it even occur to us that Saddam ’s move to switch from dollars to euros for oil payments helped trigger the wrath .
Was n’t the war about WMD and about somehow — never mind how — defending our borders against “ terror ” ?
Should U.S. wage earners be forced to pay for a war many might not have supported had they known the truth ?
Should they then also pay for what that war wrought ?
Maybe yes , maybe no .
One thing is certain : it was the Pentagon that maniacally demolished Iraq .
No , Mr. Walsh , it is n’t the Iraqi people who should devote their national wealth to rebuilding their desolated country .
Nor should the U.S. people , also variously victims and dupes of this war , be further taxed .
By all rights , the rebuilding fund should come out of our own oiligarchy ’s windfall profits and out of the Pentagon ’s obscenely bloated budget .
WASHINGTON —
In a step that could accelerate a shakeout of the nation ’s banks , the Treasury Department hopes to spur a new round of mergers by steering some of the money in its $ 250 billion rescue package to banks that are willing to buy weaker rivals , according to government officials .
As the Treasury embarks on its unprecedented recapitalization , it is becoming clear that the government wants not only to stabilize the industry , but also to reshape it .
Two senior officials said the selection criteria would include banks that need more capital to finance acquisitions .
“ Treasury does n’t want to prop up weak banks , ” said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity , because of the sensitivity of the matter .
“ One purpose of this plan is to drive consolidation . ”
With bankers traumatized by the credit crisis and the loss of investor confidence , officials said , there are plenty of banks open to selling themselves .
The hurdle is a lack of well - capitalized buyers .
A review of the best cloud storage services
I 've never owned an expensive computer such as IBM 5100 , which was launched in 1975 .
Yes sir , that computing beast , which was using a 1.9 MHz CPU and was weighing almost 50 pounds , had an inflation - adjusted price of over $ 40,000 .
And it 's interesting that some of those personal computer beasts continue to run fine even now !
Sadly , today 's computers are built to run for just a few years , and then they start to greet us with all sorts of weird error messages , often rendering our precious data useless .
So , no matter if you run a huge business or you work from home , you need to use a cloud - based storage service , because your computers ' hard drives will fail sooner or later .
Since I 've got a few terabytes of data that needed to be store safely , I tested several services .
And then , I thought that you could benefit from my research , so I decided to present the best solutions I 've found here .

The British National Archives has opened its UFO files to the public .
The online document , consisting of thousands of pages , is full of UFO data and information collected by the British military and includes several first - hand accounts , including those of two pilots who claim they were ordered to open fire at a UFO .
Anzeige
An American fighter pilot flying from an English air base at the height of the Cold War was ordered to open fire on a massive UFO that lit up his radar , according to an account published by Britain ’s National Archives on Monday .
The fighter pilot said he was ordered to fire a full salvo of rockets at the UFO moving erratically over the North Sea – but that at the last minute the object picked up enormous speed and disappeared .
The account , first published in Britain ’s Daily Star newspaper more than 17 years ago and to this day unverified by military authorities , was one of many carried in the 1,500 pages the archives made available online .
The unnamed pilot said he and another airman were scrambled on the night of May 20 , 1957 to intercept an unusual " bogey “ on radars at a Royal Air Force Station Manston , an airfield at the southeastern tip of England about 75 miles ( 120 kilometers ) from central London .
Anzeige
" This was a flying object with very unusual flight patterns , “ the pilot said , according to a typed manuscript of his account mailed to Britain ’s Ministry of Defense by a UFO enthusiast in 1988 .
" In the initial briefing it was suggested to us that the bogey actually was motionless for long intervals . “
Ordered to fly at full throttle in cloudy weather , the pilot said he was given the order to fire a volley of 24 rockets at the mysterious object .
" To be quite candid I almost ( expletive ) my pants ! “ the pilot said , saying he asked for confirmation – which he received .
Anzeige
Retired U.S. airman Milton Torres told Britain ’s Sky News on Monday that he was the pilot and has spent 50 frustrating years attempting to uncover the truth of his mid-air encounter .
Speaking from his home in Miami , Florida , Torres said he never saw the UFO with his naked eye , but watched in awe as it appeared on his jet ’s radar and sped off before he had chance to fire .
" All of a sudden as it was coming in , it decided to take off and leave me behind ...
The next thing I know it was gone , “ Torres told Sky News .
" It was some kind of space alien craft .
It was so fast , it was so incredible ... it was absolutely death defying . “
Anzeige
In the newly published government file , the U.S. airman said the UFO appeared impossible to miss .
" The blip was burning a hole in the radar with its incredible intensity , “ the pilot said .
" It was similar to a blip I had received from B - 52’s and seemed to be a magnet of light .
... I had a lock on that had the proportions of a flying aircraft carrier . “
As he closed in on the object to prepare for combat , however , the object began to move wildly before fading off his radar .
The target gone , the mission was called off , and he returned to base to an odd reception .
" I had not the foggiest idea what had actually occurred , nor would anyone explain anything to me , “ the pilot said .
He said he was led to a man in civilian clothes , who " advised me that this would be considered highly classified and that I should not discuss it with anybody not even my commander . “
" He disappeared without so much as a goodbye and that was that , as far as I was concerned , “ the pilot said , according to the account .
Britain ’s military said it had no record of the incident , according to the files .
Neither did the U.S. military .
The second pilot ’s account , also included in the files , paints a somewhat different picture of events , saying there were not one but several " unknowns “ and that he did not remember being contacted by anyone about staying quiet .
He did not mention the targets ’ size .
" I know this is not a very exciting narrative but it is all I can recall , “ the second pilot said .
Anzeige
His name , like his colleague ’s , was redacted from the files .
David Clarke , a UFO expert who has worked with the National Archives on the document release , said it was one of the most intriguing stories he had culled from the batch of files released Monday .
He said that the CIA once had a program intended to create phantom signals on radar – and that this may have been an exercise in electronic warfare .
Whatever the case , Clarke argued that " there ’s no doubt something very unusual happened . “
Clarke said the batch of files released Monday – which include witness accounts , investigations , and sketches – was part of a three to four year program intended to make a total of 160 UFO - related files available to the public .

DUBLIN ( Reuters ) - Ireland ’s biggest bookmaker said on Thursday it would pay out more than 1 million euros ( $ 1.35 million ) on bets that Barack Obama will be the next U.S. president , three weeks before the election .

Dublin - based bookmaker Paddy Power said it made the “ unprecedented decision ” to pay on bets taken so far , following Wednesday ’s final campaign debate between Obama and his Republican rival John McCain , which polls judged the Democrat to have won .
“ We declare this race well and truly over and congratulate all those who backed Obama , ” Power said in a statement .
“ Although he seemed a little out of sorts in last night ’s final debate we believe he has done more than enough to get him across the line on November 4 . ”
The bookmaker said the overall betting trend had shown “ one - way traffic ” for the Illinois senator since the start of the summer , with odds shortening to 1 - 9 , meaning a bet of 9 euros is required to make 1 euro profit .
The odds on McCain winning are 5 - 1 .
Power said it had taken more than 10,000 bets on the 2008 U.S. presidential election , the majority in support of Obama .
In June a wager of 100,000 euros was placed on Obama to win at odds of 1 - 2 , it added .
However , the bookmaker does not always get it right .
In June it paid out more than 80,000 euros in bets that Irish voters would back the European Union ’s Lisbon treaty in a referendum shortly before the electorate returned a resounding “ no . ”
But Mr. Warden said the government could prove that Mr. Mohamed was being properly held without evidence of that plot .
Military prosecutors have said they will file new charges against Mr. Mohamed with the Guantánamo war crimes tribunal , but they have not said whether the bomb plot will be among those charges .
The government claims Mr. Mohamed confessed to the plot and to attending Qaeda training camps .
But Zachary Katznelson , a lawyer for Mr. Mohamed , said in court Thursday that all his confessions were made after “ he was tortured again and again and again until he just parroted what his torturers wanted him to say . ”
In Morocco , Mr. Katznelson said , Mr. Mohamed was beaten and repeatedly cut with razor blades on his genitals and elsewhere .
Mr. Mohamed ’s lawyers have laid out a detailed argument that he was subjected to the government ’s program of rendition to other countries .
They say evidence shows that American intelligence agents transferred him to Morocco .
The documents Judge Sullivan directed the government to turn over concern Mr. Mohamed ’s treatment during the two years he was held in Pakistan , Morocco and Afghanistan after he was first detained at the airport in Karachi , Pakistan , in 2002 .
Mr. Katznelson said evidence of torture would prove that Mr. Mohamed had never voluntarily admitted to the dirty - bomb plot or any other involvement with Al Qaeda .
The government has said Mr. Mohamed ’s claims of torture are not credible .
A Moroccan consular official , Karim el - Mansouri , said in an interview that he had no details on Mr. Mohamed ’s case but that Morocco protected human rights .
Paul Gimigliano , a spokesman for the Central Intelligence Agency , said : “ The C.I.A. does not conduct or condone torture .
Nor does it transport individuals anywhere for the purpose of torture . ”
Last week , a British court ruled that 35 documents in British intelligence files concerning Mr. Mohamed ’s treatment should be turned over to his lawyers .
The court said the documentation “ lends some support to his claim that the confession was obtained after a period of two years incommunicado detention during which he was tortured . ”
The material Judge Sullivan has now ordered the government to turn over would be any additional information about Mr. Mohamed ’s treatment .
The British court had said it would wait to order the actual release of the 35 documents , to give Judge Sullivan an opportunity to rule on the issue first .
By the time they arrived in court Thursday , however , Justice Department lawyers had turned over those documents .
That followed a letter Tuesday from a British government lawyer to the British court ’s judges that said the home secretary had referred to law enforcement officials in Britain “ the question of possible criminal wrongdoing ” in the treatment of Mr. Mohamed .

The nation was introduced to Michele Bachmann ’s special kind of crazy last week , a fact that ( surprise ! ) is bad for Bachmann ’s electoral prospects .
According to CQ Politics , her McCarthy - esque appearance on Hardball ( video below ) has put her in jeopardy of losing her seat , a previously unthinkable outcome in her deep red district .
It helps that , because of Bachmann ’s screed , her opponent El Tinklenberg has nearly doubled his fundraising for the entire race .
Here ’s CQ :
Tinklenberg , a former state Transportation secretary , had collected more than $ 810,000 between Friday night and Monday afternoon , after raising $ 1 million for the entire election cycle through the end of September .
“ It ’s hard to give a completely accurate number because the money keeps rolling in , ” said Tinklenberg spokeswoman Kate Monson .
“ We ’re in the middle of a political earthquake here , ” Sen .
Amy Klobuchar , a Minnesota Democrat , said on Hardball Monday evening .
CQ Politics is moving its rating of the contest from Republican Favored to Leans Republican , a more competitive category .
The DCCC plans on going on the air in the district this week , with the goal of spending $ 1 million in TV advertising that it hopes will unseat Bachmann .
“ She effectively put the race into play by herself , ” says one Republican consultant .

MATTHEWS : So you believe that Barack Obama may have anti- American views .
BACHMANN : Absolutely .
I ’m very concerned that he may have anti-American views .
That ’s what the American people are concerned about .
That ’s why they want to know what his answers are .
[…]
MATTHEWS : Well , he ’s a United States senator from Illinois .
He ’s one of the people you suspect as being anti-American .
How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti- American ?
You ’ve already suspected Barack Obama .
Is he alone , or are there others ?
How many do you suspect of your colleagues as being anti-American ?
There are some lists that you just do n't want to be on .
The No - Fly List .
The 10 Most Wanted List .
The list of candidates so desperate they actually want George Bush to come out and campaign with them .
Then there 's John McCain 's List of Real Smart People .
What does it take to be on this list ?
Well , Sarah Palin is there .
McCAIN : She knows more about energy than probably anyone else in the United States of America .
Who else makes the list ?
Try former Texas Senator , Phil Gramm .
McCAIN : one of the smartest people in the world on economics
As we watch the financial sector move into the next stage of melt down , here 's a reminder of what Gramm did to earn himself a spot as not only a Real Smart Person , but McCain 's top economic advisor .
[ Gramm ] was co-sponsor of the 1999 law that allowed commercial banks to get into investment banking .
And the fact that Gramm was a prime architect of a 2000 bill that kept regulators ' hands off of " credit default swaps , " an exotic financial tool which helped enable the bundling and selling of crappy subprime mortgages to investors .
In other words , Gramm was at the top of the list of people rushing to give the banking industry " more flexibility " and relieve them of all those nasty regulations that kept them from showing the kind of constraint that Wall Street always shows when nobody is looking .
The value of the entire U.S. Treasuries market : $ 4.5 trillion .
The value of the entire mortgage market : $ 7 trillion .
The size of the U.S. stock market : $ 22 trillion .
The size of the credit default swap market last year : $ 45 trillion .
[ Risk expert ] CHRISTOPHER WHALEN :
They are the most hideous kind of speculation .
To have a federally insured bank like JPMorgan as the largest dealer in this market , to me says we do n't know what we 're doing anymore , and we do n't understand the difference between real work -- real economic activity -- and something that 's essentially wasting .
Phil Gramm saw to it that banks could not only become involved in risky investments , they could buy and sell those investments to each other , creating a speculative shadow economy many times larger than the real economy , and Gramm made sure that all this activity was completely unregulated .
Back to Dave Davies ' of the Philadelphia Daily News and his July interview with McCain .
[ McCain ] said that Gramm and others thought that they were doing the right thing in the 2000 legislation .
But that 's just the point .
Nobody thought that they were setting up a cataclysmic collapse in the nation 's financial sector , but when you 're restricting public oversight of private markets , you 'd better give some serious thought to the downside .
Serious thought to the downside ?
That 's surrender talk .
Hell , boy , what kind of maverick are you ?
That kind of thinking is never going to make McCain 's list .
Which is a very important reason why McCain should n't be on anyone 's list of potential presidents .
What is ophcrack ?
Ophcrack is a free Windows password cracker based on rainbow tables .
It is a very efficient implementation of rainbow tables done by the inventors of the method .
It comes with a Graphical User Interface and runs on multiple platforms .
Features :
Some commenters have raised a very reasonable question :
Why does n't NASA just human rate an expendable launch vehicle like the Atlas V or the Delta IV ?
It seems reasonable because they fly all the time , they are big , they are reliable and they are * already built .
* So what is the problem ?
Weight - The Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle is too heavy for the Atlas V and the Delta IV ( I will deal with other capsules after the jump ) .
You also have to account for other mission constraints .
For example , you have to include the loss of performance you get from going to the high inclination orbit of the International Space Station .
ISS does n't just fly directly over the equator but at an angle that allows it to pass over Russia .
That orbit takes more energy to get to .
In addition you will also lose performance because you have to fly a less aggressive launch profile .
The current profile subjects payloads to 6 G's ( Space Shuttle is 3 G's ) .
Human payloads do n't respond well to sustained 6 G loads .
Flying a less aggressive profile will mean you will be able to lift less .
So all in all , you would need to develop a " triple - core " ( three Atlas ' strapped together ) to be able to lift Orion .
A triple core Atlas has never been flown .
You would also need a new upper stage for an extra bit of kick at the end of the flight .
The Delta IV , although larger and more mature , would also need a new upper stage .
Triple Redundancy -
All human - rated vehicles are designed to be triply redundant .
If something fails , there has to be two other options for the crew .
It 's like when the power goes out at your house , you have a back - up system which is a flashlight .
If the flashlight fails , you have a second back up system which is a bunch of candles and matches .
Now , to be stuck in the dark you would need to have all three systems fail .
Cargo rockets are not designed with that much redundancy in their systems .
Adding in that kind of redundancy after the fact would be like getting under the hood of your car and installing a back - up set of brakes .
You have to create feed throughs for the wires , try to figure out where you will put the extra brakes etc .
Now to be fair , you could launch a smaller human vehicle on a current expendable rocket ... ( Orion does seat six ) .
In fact , before the Columbia disaster NASA teams were working on an Orbital Space Plane ( OSP ) designed to do just that .
At the time , OSP was maligned for being small and limited in capability .
( It is ironic that the Orion is now being maligned for being too large and capable . )
OSP was a smaller vehicle designed to launch on an Atlas V or a Delta IV and seat " no less than four " crew members .
It was eventually overcome by events when Constellation and the Moon , Mars , and beyond program kicked off and NASA transferred the knowledge gained on the OSP to the development of Crew Exploration Vehicle .
Then there is Robert Bigelow , a self made millionaire , who is building an inflatable space module hotel ( they already have a scale model on orbit now ) .
He is converging on a deal with Lockheed Martin to human - rate a version of the Atlas V .
This is plausible , given that they are looking for an OSP - class capability .
Bigelow 's main interest is getting clients to and from his future orbiting facilities .
SpaceX is also building a small capsule that could launch people to ISS or Bigelow 's space modules hotel .
Their Dragon capsule , being built to take cargo to the International Space Station , will fit on their Falcon 9 rocket and be able to launch humans .
Although it will not fly on an Atlas or a Delta , it is in that same class of vehicles .
Perhaps in the end it is a good idea for NASA to focus their efforts on building the new , heavier Orion capsule and the Ares I and V .
These vehicles are suitable for the longer , more demanding trips to the moon .
Then NASA could leave the lighter , smaller low Earth orbit capsules to commercial space to work out .
That would serve both the goal of NASA being an exploration agency and of evolving our commercial space sector .
So the short answer is : NASA is not human - rating an Atlas V because that system will not be sufficient for exploration beyond low Earth orbit ( though Bigelow Aerospace is looking at human - rating the Atlas V ) .

For the past few years Apple has seen an increase in its laptop business due majorly to the dismal failure of Microsoft ’s Windows Vista operating system .
Umpteen number of reports have been published telling people why they should consider switching to the Mac OS now that Vista has failed , but not a single one has surfaced that spells out the merits of switching over to a variety of Linux .
Linux on the server side is pretty well established with Red Hat Enterprise Linux being the dominant flavour there .
It is on the desktop that there is an ongoing war mainly between three parties – Microsoft , Apple and the host of Linux vendors .
The availability of a large number of Linux distributions may initially confuse a user but a harder look quickly separates the wheat from the chaff and Ubuntu / Kubuntu emerges as the best .
Traditionally Linux adoption on the desktop has been plagued by the notion that it was difficult to handle .
Its really a misconception .
Ubuntu has changed the face of Linux ever since its launch .
The current versions are sturdy , have very good UIs and are intuitive .
Program management no longer needs knowledge of the various packaging systems but is driven by an elegant UI .
Productivity applications on Linux have come a long way and the crown jewel in this category has got to be Open Office .
Not only do you get a great word processor , a brilliant spreadsheet program , a fantastic presentation tool and a good desktop database but you also get compatibility for Microsoft Office documents .
In the majority of cases , MS Office documents can be opened in Open Office without any changes .
For e-mailing , there is Evolution that offers connectivity to Microsoft Exchange and also Mozilla Thunderbird .
Calendar applications are galore .
There are a host of commercial and open source tools for multimedia authoring , image manipulation and desktop publishing .
Applications like Scribus , Blender 3D and GIMP are the best - of - breed and have the capacity to rival their commercial counterparts .
For web browsing , Mozilla Firefox comes pre-installed .
If you are a developer programming in open technologies like Java / JEE or C/C++ , adopting to Linux is really easy .
All major JEE vendors support Linux as a platform for their offerings .
Eclipse , NetBeans and IntelliJ are some of the best IDEs around that have Linux versions .
For C/C++ there is KDevelop , Anjuta and many more IDEs offering best - of - breed features .
Microsoft . net developers might have it a bit more difficult .
Although Mono allows you to run .net applications on Linux , tooling support till now is not the greatest .
In any case , if some one is going to use Microsoft technology for development , its much more likely that she / he would stick to Windows .
So thats not really a great problem .
Ubuntu has a large number of hardware drivers in it making it very close to being the best distro for plug - n - play .
In fact in a few areas it surpasses the great Apple Mac OS .
Here ’s an example .
The Linksys WUSB54GC USB Wireless Adapter worked out of the box on Ubuntu 8.04 whereas in Mac OS it did not .
Security wise both Mac OS and Ubuntu are equally good though some would argue that Ubuntu is probably better .
There are GUI tools available to tweak the security settings in a system .
In the look and feel department , Linux has improved in leaps and bounds .
In Gnome and KDE you have two of the best windowing systems .
With the KDE 4.1.1 environment , users get a light , responsive , and aesthetically appealing desktop that can rival even the Mac OS .
Also with Compiz it is possible to extract effects from a Linux desktop that were hitherto unavailable on any other system .
I doubt it exists in the Mac .
So why are people not going over to Ubuntu ?
Beats me .
If you are looking for commercial technical support , Ubuntu does offer that .
If you are looking at extreme personalization options Ubuntu offers that , probably even more than the Mac OS .
If you are looking for easy upgrades to future versions , Ubuntu offers that .
If you are looking for ease of use , Ubuntu offers that .
If you are looking for robustness and security , Ubuntu is the best .
Ubuntu can be installed on all types of hardware and even on older hardware .
Mac OS does not offer this flexibility .
The more I use Ubuntu , the more I fail to understand the lure of the Mac OS .
Is it the snob value or stupidity that make people consider a Mac over Windows and not Ubuntu ?

JUSTICE — WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS IGNORES REPORT ON U.S. ATTORNEY SCANDAL :
After an 18 - month investigation , the Office of Public Responsibility and the Department of Justice Inspector General ( IG ) released a report yesterday finding that the firing of nine U.S. Attorneys was “ fundamentally flawed ” and in some cases , governed by politics .
The report said former attorney general Alberto Gonzales and other DOJ officials made “ inconsistent , misleading , and inaccurate ” statements about their reasons for firing the attorneys .
But despite the IG ’s finding of White House efforts to stonewall the investigation , the White House press corps did not ask one question about the investigation in yesterday ’s press briefing .
Reacting to the report , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) said the abuses documented in the report “ are corrosive to the very foundations of our system of justice . ”
He also warned President Bush that “ any misuse of the pardon power ” to the benefit of administration officials involved will be seen “ as an admission of wrongdoing and misuse of power . ”

“ When there ’s a fire in your kitchen threatening to burn down your home , you do n’t want someone stopping the firefighters on the way and demanding they hand out smoke detectors first or lecturing you about the hazards of keeping paint in the basement , ” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader , said in a speech on the Senate floor .
“ You want them to put out the fire before it burns down your home and everything you ’ve saved for your whole life . ”

Mr. McConnell added : “ The same is true of our current economic situation .
We know that there is a serious threat to our economy , and we know that we must take action to try and head off a serious blow to Main Street . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , after a meeting with party leaders on Monday evening , said she , too , remained committed to getting a bill to the president as quickly as possible .
But powerful lawmakers in both parties said they would not be rushed into granting Mr. Bush ’s request .
“ I walked down LaSalle Street on Friday , a great street in Chicago lined with banks and big office buildings , ” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois , the No. 2 Democrat .
“ A lot of people came up and said ‘ hi . ’
But a lot of them came up and said : ‘ Are you really going to do this ?
$ 700 billion bailing out the banks ?
And I said : ‘ I do n’t know .
At the end of the day , I just do n’t know . ’ ”
Mr. Durbin , in a speech on the Senate floor , angrily recalled that the administration had similarly requested swift approval of its plan to attack Iraq .
“ Just as we should have asked more questions about weapons of mass destruction six years ago before we found ourselves in this war , ” Mr. Durbin said , “ we need to ask questions today about where this is leading . ”

Joe Biden 's denunciation of his own campaign's ad to Katie Couric got so much attention last night that another odd note in the interview slipped by .
He was speaking about the role of the White House in a financial crisis .
" When the stock market crashed , Franklin Roosevelt got on the television and did n't just talk about the princes of greed , " Biden told Couric .
" He said , ' Look , here 's what happened . ' "
As Reason 's Jesse Walker footnotes it : " And if you owned an experimental TV set in 1929 , you would have seen him .
And you would have said to yourself , ' Who is that guy ?
What happened to President Hoover ? ' "

" ... But I really do think it 's a strange time because we 're all watching to see who won , but as Nora pointed out , 4 out of 5 , or so , of the Hillary voters today believe she 's still in the running .
That this is still up in the air and I think that was probably a mistake of the media .
I think in the effort of the media , to try to keep this game going , we 've created the delusion that somehow this race is still open .
I do n't think it is open .
I think if you look at the numbers Barack has to really blow it in the weeks ahead to lose . "
My point is that , Sarah Palin never struck me as stupid .
When she talked about not backpacking across Europe and working her whole life , beneath the dumb anti-intellectual dig , I saw a gem of truth .
I wish she had have mined it , instead of trying to score a cheap point .
Rambling aside , she simply is n't ready .
Maybe she would be eight years from now , but she is n't ready now , any campaign worth its salt would have known this .
In election season , there is a price for being turned into a symbol .
When actual journalists , with a rep to protect , show up , they are going to do their job .
Which brings me to the sexism of John McCain .
He knew full well what Sarah Palin was going to face if he nominated her .
He knew that reporters would go through her past , that they 'd quizz her on the present , that she would need to be ready , and he shunted concern aside , and tossed her to the wolves .
Think on that for a mement .
For one last run at the White House , he risked a future star of the party he claims to call home .
How do you do that ?
I do n't meant to rob Palin of agency , certainly she is also a victim of her own calculations and ambitions .
But where I am from the elders protect you , and pull you back when you 've gone too far , when your head has gotten too big .
Of course the irony of all this is how conservatives have , for years , lampooned the liberal pursuit of multiculturalism / identity politics .
But here 's the thing , even when done haphazardly , awkwardly , and imprudently , the fight against bigotry and ignorance has rewards .
But when you decide to not be a leader in the fight against sexism / racism and simply criticize those who do , you rob yourself of political experience .
Put differently , there is a price -- bigger than the black vote -- to be paid for disengagement .
You become ignorant of a growing sector of the world .
They expected Hillary .
And if it were a black man , they never even knew it could be someone like Barack Obama .
So these guys go to the well one more time , and ressurect the old spectres of " Us against Them . "
But the fools have n't been paying attention - - the " Us " has changed .
This is n't Alabama , and it ai n't 1968 .
There is a whole class of educated , working women , themselves , the children of educated working women .
And this is what McCain has to say to them , " I do n't care if you know a thing about foreign policy .
I do n't care if you know a damn thing about the economy .
Here is what you are to me -- breasts , hair and a lovely smile . "
Turns out it helps to actually care about the fate of women , to know something about them , beyond your own lust , when going for their votes .

Nepal Christians hope new republic brings more religious freedom
|PIC1 | Christian leaders in Nepal have reported persecution at the hands of Maoist guerrillas , as well as Hindu militants .
They are praying the new republic will guarantee their basic human rights .
The republic has given a significant role to former Maoist guerrillas who fought a ten - year insurgency against the government .
The fighting left 12,000 dead and displaced 100,000 .
The Maoists now hold about one third of the seats in the new parliament .
In the latest edition of Release International 's World Update , a pastor ( who can not be named for security reasons ) described how guerrillas had previously tried to close down his church and recruit him to their cause .
The guerrilla commander came to his church and demanded that it be closed .
He then tried to get the pastor to join the gunmen , telling him : " It 's the scientific age , why are you believing in Jesus ?
It 's not the age for religious things .
You have to go with us and carry a gun and fight for the nation . "
The pastor 's experience was n't an isolated one , says CBN reporter Gary Lane , whose report appears in World Update .
Some of Nepal 's tiny Christian minority say their homes and churches were destroyed by the Maoist guerrillas .
They were often targeted for opposing atheism and refusing to join the Maoist movement .
The challenge ahead for Nepal 's new rulers will be to allow Christians the basic human right to worship freely and tell others about their faith .
Many Christians are hopeful but distrustful because of the atrocities committed against them .
Christianity is spreading in Nepal .
In central Kathmandu , one church reports that it is adding some 15 new members per week , and Christians there are sharing their faith with others around the country .
Many now face opposition and persecution from radical Hindus .
The father of believer Joshua ( not his real name ) was a Hindu priest who tried to kill him with a knife when he discovered Joshua had become a Christian .
Joshua fled unharmed and was forced to live elsewhere because his father had disowned him .
He said : " My father in this world left me , but my Father in heaven will never leave me .
He will always love me . "
Another pastor described how militant Hindus destroyed their church building in the village .
He said : " They made a slogan : Christians have to move from this village , otherwise we will kill .
It was really hard , but praise God , God took every care .
No - one backslid , no - one left Christ , they became very strong believers and they are the ones who are working the village now . "
Joshua is also refusing to be intimidated .
He is determined to return to his village despite the risk to his life to share his Christian faith .
He told reporter Gary Lane : " Go into the world and preach the Gospel .
What you 've received from God , share it with other people who do not know Christ .
" Whenever persecution comes in your life , do not be discouraged , just go and ask for strength from God and God will save you .
God will guide you in every difficulty , in every difficult situation .
Keep strong faith in God . "
Release International 's CEO Andy Dipper adds : " The Bible tells us to remember our brothers and sisters who are persecuted for their faith .
They need our prayers - and our financial support .
And they have a dynamic overcoming spirit that we need to catch . "

Controversies surrounding Libertarian U.S. presidential nominee and former congressman Bob Barr intensified on Friday afternoon .
There is now a serious effort by some in the Libertarian Party to remove Barr as its presidential nominee .
In order for this to happen , the matter must be voted upon by members of the Libertarian National Committee .
A motion has been written calling for Barr 's removal and at least one representative has expressed a willingness to make it .
If and when the motion is seconded , it will be brought to a vote .
The motion can be read in its entirety below .
The motion is in response to Barr 's refusal to attend former Republican presidential hopeful Congressman Ron Paul 's third party unity conference at the National Press Club in Washington , DC on Wednesday .
Barr instead decided to hold a press conference of his own two hours after Paul 's at the same location .
" I 'm not interested in third parties getting the most possible votes , " Barr told reporters .
" I 'm interested in Bob Barr as the nominee for the Libertarian Party getting the most possible votes . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
Should the members of the Libertarian Party remove Bob Barr as their presidential nominee ?
Add or view comments
Several of Barr 's supporters were furious with his remarks , some even going so far as to retract their endorsements of him .
Bloggers quickly picked up on the story and by Thursday evening there was an Internet frenzy , which continued into Friday .
Removal motion
WHEREAS , Article 12 , Section 5 of the Libertarian Party ’s bylaws provide for the suspension of the party ’s presidential candidate by the Libertarian National Committee ; and
WHEREAS , said bylaws provision requires a 3 / 4 vote of this body ; BE IT KNOWN that Bob Barr , the Libertarian Party ’s 2008 presidential nominee , is hereby suspended on the basis of the following causes :
- Failure to appear , with little or no notice , at a major media event to which he had been invited and to which he had committed to appear ;
- Vicious public attacks by his campaign staff on the character and reputation of the event ’s host ( 1988 Libertarian Party presidential nominee Ron Paul ) and sponsor ( Campaign For Liberty ) ;
- The disrepute and discredit which the aforementioned misbehaviors have brought upon the Libertarian Party .
The committee advises Barr that he has seven ( 7 ) days to appeal this action to the party ’s Judicial Committee .
Absent a successful appeal , his nomination will be deemed null and void and he will be replaced as the party ’s presidential nominee .

The university law review is an American phenomenon that has no parallel in Britain 's lazier and less academic law schools : the notion of an elite group of students determining , by the juristic contributions they choose to solicit , the focus of contemporary legal thinking would cause apoplexy in Oxbridge common rooms .
But in the US , law reviews are important in shaping the law , and Harvard is the most important of all .
Hence the newsworthiness of Obama 's election .
Never before had there been a black editor - in - chief .
" The fact that I 've been elected shows a lot of progress , " he said at a news conference .
" But you have to remember that for every one of me there are hundreds of thousands of black students with at least equal talent who do n't get a chance " because of poverty and family drug environments .
It was a worthy beginning and earned him an affectionate impersonation in that year 's Harvard Law Revue .
( " In Chicago I discovered I was black , and I have remained so ever since " ) .
The 1990 - 91 legal term was an unsettling and unsettled time .
Justice William Brennan , architect of Supreme Court activism ( for example , The New York Times v Sullivan ) had just retired , and Obama 's volume begins with a tribute to him from Thurgood Marshall , the court 's first black judge .
William Rehnquist now held the reins , and Reagan and George snr appointees were in the majority : the candle of liberal jurisprudence , burning bright in classrooms inspired by the philosophy of Ronald Dworkin , was beginning to tremble .
Volume 104 is full of civil liberty issues ( Obama had been an editor of the previous year 's Civil Liberties Review ) and full of apprehension lest Dworkin 's moral theories would cut no ice with the likes of Justice Scalia .
The first major article ( solicited , it was noted with surprise , from a non-ivy league professor ) analysed the philosophy of Vaclav Havel and argued that his " individual responsibility " approach might be better suited to protecting freedom than Dworkin 's appeals to individual rights .
Volume 104 exhibits a refreshing interest in foreign cases ( some Republican justices regard the citation of British court decisions as tantamount to treason ) and there is a contrast between Stephen Sedley 's views on the need to censor hate speech and the ACLU 's support for the right of racist utterance .
Barack Obama leaves no byline in this volume , but as president he would have been responsible for selecting the topic of the major student disquisition : a 180 - page analysis of the need for new law to protect the environment .
Introduced with quotes from Chekov , U Thant and the Grateful Dead , this closely argued segment appears prescient today : it was produced long before climate change became topical , and its advocacy of " green helmets " and extra-territorial law enforcement against corporate polluters is more relevant than ever .
It is tempting to detect the young Obama 's hand in a few of the many unsigned articles and book reviews .
There is a scathing dismissal of a book by Roy Grutman , a great courtroom advocate ( " money is what makes his legal world go round " ) reminiscent of Obama 's later comments that law " is a sort of glorified accounting that seems to regulate the affairs of those who have power " .
I strongly suspect his contribution to the last and best article in Volume 104 , titled Talking of Unconscionable Niggers .
This is an acidic review of a biography of Frederick Douglass , the slave who became a formidable orator for abolition and later a respected public servant ( the title is a quoted reaction to Douglass 's modest request to be paid for his services ) .
The review notes how most white abolitionists ( including Lincoln ) were opposed to equal rights for freed slaves , and severely criticises the author ( a white historian ) for failing to notice black women .
This is not an admission that Obama , shortly to marry Michelle ( who had graduated from Harvard before him ) could readily forgive .
Obama himself graduated Magna cum Laude with the legal world at his feet .
He could have taken a highly paid job at a prestigious law firm , or a year 's clerkship with a Supreme Court judge followed by an even more highly paid job .
Instead he returned to community work for a small firm in Chicago that specialised in housing , welfare and employment and that billed him out at a modest $ 167 an hour .
For all his rhetorical genius he never tried a case , preferring the solicitor 's work of researching briefs and preparing witness statements .
His clients were whistle - blowers and NGOs anxious to use the law to assist the registration of voters who were poor and black and mainly Democrat .
Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate , although he continued to lecture for 12 years on constitutional law as a visiting professor in Chicago .
By all accounts , especially those of his students , he was an outstanding teacher .
There is one abiding mystery about Obama 's legal career .
Although ( as his books attest ) he is a fine writer , he never put his name to any article , anywhere .
It was a time when the very ambitious had become very cautious : Robert Bork had been denied Supreme Court confirmation on the strength ( in fact , the weakness ) of his earlier writings , and the mysterious David Souter passed muster only because he had written nothing that Democrats on the Senate 's judiciary committee could sink their teeth into ( to Republican fury , he turned out to be a closet liberal ) .
Perhaps young Barack decided to leave no hostages to fortune in a career trajectory that might take him to the Supreme Court , or to the White House .
Or perhaps he was too busy with his humble work in and for poor communities than to bother about reshaping a legal system that he had come to believe would inevitably serve the powerful .
Ironically it is that system which is most at stake in this election .
George Bush leaves a bloc of four dyed - in - the - wool conservatives seated for many years yet on the nine - judge Supreme Court .
Three of the remaining moderates ( Justices Stevens , Ginsberg and Souter ) are likely to leave in the next few years .
" Gentleman John " McCain has promised to appoint strict constructionists , judges who will find no constitutional bar to executing juveniles , or limiting abortions or abolishing habeas corpus .
The fate of liberal jurisprudence hangs once again in the balance as it did , in 1990 , for the president of the Harvard Law Review .
Just how vital - and how insecure - that balance is , was demonstrated by the 5 - 4 US Supreme Court decision this month to strike down as unconstitutional the Bush Congress law depriving Guantanamo Bay inmates of the right to habeas corpus .
The moderates in the majority drew upon Anglo - American legal history , from Magna Carta onwards , to insist that " the great writ " could not be suspended by the government on the pretence that Guantanamo is a foreign country .
The minority , led by Bush 's chief justice , mean - mindedly accepted this pretence and exhibited a cruel insouciance over the fact that the inmates had already been detained without trial for six years .
Obama , out on the stump , immediately and courageously went into battle for the principled , but unpopular , majority decision .
" … you remember during the Nuremberg trials , part of what made us different was even after these Nazis had performed atrocities that no - one had ever seen before , we still gave them a day in court .
And that taught the entire world about who we are , but also the basic principles of rule of law .
Now the Supreme Court upheld that principle yesterday . "
It is sobering to think that unless Obama is elected it is unlikely that the Supreme Court , its balance changed by just one more Republican appointment , will uphold that principle again , at least for the next decade .
Obama 's legal career never took off , for all its historic promise at Harvard .
He turned his back on the glamour of trial attorneyship and the mega bucks of a prestige partnership , preferring to help house the poor .
That may have been the result of careful calculation , as the quickest way to a political career .
Or it may simply be that Barack Obama , despite being a lawyer , is in fact a good person .

[ In this in - depth article , originally printed in Game Developer magazine , designer Boutros takes a close look at difficulty in games , asking how creators can add unique , high - end challenges which excite , but do n't frustrate skilled players . ]
Difficulty modes in games are rarely discussed as an important factor in our business .
In some games , they are well - thought out additions , built for the hardcore players .
In other games , these modes are an afterthought , provided to appease a publisher , or as an attempt to provide direction to multiple audiences attracted by the same product .
For almost all developers though , difficulty modes are tackled at the end of the project when the game is being tuned , and they are tough to implement well without significant time and thought .
For this piece , I 'll aim to explore some methods and philosophies behind how difficult play has been successfully implemented in games overall , either in terms of general difficulty , or within an optional objective that recontextualises play ( such as Rare 's super - tough multiplayer bonus unlockable objective in GoldenEye for the Nintendo 64 ) .
We 'll explore where certain methods have worked , failed , and where they are simply not relevant anymore .
Since difficulty is so subjective , I 'll focus arguments around the following ideas :
" A player must always feel like the failure of a challenge is entirely his own responsibility , and not a fault of a poorly designed product . "
" The player must understand how and why he failed , so that he can learn from his mistake and increase the feeling of failure being his responsibility . "
Choosing a high difficulty is the act of wanting to be tested on the part of the player .
The reward of passing a test is a feeling of worth and accomplishment - and to make a test enjoyable is to make it challenging , while also achievable .
Tuning difficulty in a quick and dirty way can also change the game 's play fundamentally - this is something many developers do n't factor into their decisions enough .
Tuning for Tough
Many games have sought to copy Rare 's N64 GoldenEye model for greater difficulty - double damage from enemies = harder game - but within the context of other factors , doing this can actually change the consistent play type of the game , and thus change the experience in a fundamental and arguably unsatisfying way .
Let 's say there 's a fictitious FPS called NaziShoot 2000 .
In this game 's normal difficulty mode , the player can usually get shot , have a second to think , recover , then react .
In tough mode , players cannot risk being shot as the increased damage and AI kills them almost instantly .
This forces players to move and act more conservatively .
In an ideal - world 's well - designed tough game , it would be possible to play through and not die , if the player used the utmost care and thoughtfulness .
However , this game had to hit a deadline so the tough mode had to be evolved from the normal mode , and tuned to a formula .
In this memorizing bottleneck scenario , surprise snipes to the head , and learning from trial and error become the dominant way to play .
And there is the difference : whereas one mode is a reactionary and lightly memory - reliant experience , in the tough mode , the game becomes very classically rooted in trial and error , using memory play as the core consistent play type .
The only way a player can survive with meager resources and a damage disadvantage is by trying , dying , remembering , and restarting .
This is a classic tenet of the old school 2D arcade shooters .
In a 3D game where an additional axis dramatically adds to your things - to - worry - about radar , control complexity is usually increased , and gameplay acts - core gameplay sequences such a shooting something and then grabbing a power - up - are spread across a longer timeline because of the physical world 's scale increase .
If the player can be killed in one hit , or by other fatal game features , this can often result in an intense feeling of frustration , and quite possibly lead to dissatisfaction with the game overall .
...... Hounddog Spoiler Warning .....
I rarely get viscerally angry despite all of the sex crimes I read about and all of the denial I see from people who defend rapists or justify allowing most rapists to deny that they are real rapists .
But an article by the Concerned Women for America calling the movie Hounddog " child porn " has me feeling angry .
I would be angry even if I had n't previewed the finished version of Hounddog which opens today .
From http://www.cwfa.org/articles/15758/FIELD/pornography/index.htm:
Donna Miller , a CWA Prayer / Action Chapter Leader for the Fayetteville area and No More Child Porn Campaign Director , will attend the 2008 Values Voter Summit , a prominent conservative voting rally in Washington , D.C. this weekend , to spread the word about Hounddog , in hopes that concerned citizens will halt the distribution of this film in the mainstream media . [...]
Hounddog features child actress Dakota Fanning , who portrays a nine - year - old that is raped by a man in his late teens , after he tricks her into dancing naked to get Elvis Presley concert tickets .
Deborah Kampmeier , writer and director of Hounddog , wrote in the film 's press kit , " … she [ Fanning 's character ] is simply and innocently experiencing and relishing the aliveness of her being , the life force pulsing through her body , celebrating the power and creative force of her sexuality that is her birthright . "
Donna responds , " This movie is about a nine - year - old girl , not an adult woman .
She should be outside skipping rope or riding her bike , not ' celebrating the power and creative force of her sexuality . ' "
This last quoted statement is what began the escalation of my anger because this smacks of victim blaming .
She seems to be saying that if girls just properly restrained themselves they would n't get raped .
Only they still do get raped because rape is caused by the rationalizations of rapists .
Rape is not caused by the behavior of rape victims immediately prior to rape .
Some rapists will go after girls like the character Lewellen , others will go after those who do nothing anyone would ever criticize .
The practical outcome of telling us what 9 year old girls should be doing in this context is to give rapists another reason to shift responsibility for their crimes onto their victims .
They would likely tell their fellow sexual predators if they could that if that 9 year old girl was n't " asking for it " she'd be outside skipping rope or riding her bike .
And they could cite this CWA article as evidence .
That should send shivers down Ms. Miller 's spine , but I suspect she 'd react with denial .
Hey , Ms. Miller , how about some lectures about proper behavior directed at boys and men ?
How about telling teenage boys that it is rape when they " have sex with " a 9 - year - old girl no matter what she is doing ?
No ?
Then do n't claim to be concerned Ms. Miller because I have no reason to believe you .
They also requested that the Assembly " provide information from the North Carolina Department of Commerce ( which oversees the North Carolina Film office ) as to how three movies dealing with the subject of adults having sexual encounters with minors ( Hounddog , Bastard Out of Carolina , and Lolita ) were filmed in North Carolina .
Hounddog was so controversial that it did not receive distributorship until very recently .
This description " dealing with the subject of adults having sexual encounters with minors " is dangerously wrong .
Those are 3 movies dealing with the subject of rape .
To describe child rape as " sexual encounters " is to reinforce the rationalizations of rapists such as those depicted in those films .
This descriptor especially helps rapists who do n't use overt force to view themselves as non-rapists .
The result of Ms. Miller 's fear and misperceptions is that a character who has been betrayed like I and many others were betrayed cannot be allowed to be seen in a positive light , but must instead be condemned .
Donna says , " Our concern is that this film would say to other children that this behavior is acceptable .
As taxpayers here in North Carolina , we 're not happy about this . "
I suspect that " this behavior " Ms. Miller is referring to is not rape but is the behavior of a 9 year old immediately before she is raped .
Miller unfortunately echoes the disdain of rapists .
What this film says to children -- old enough to handle a movie where a child is harmed -- is that people they know can find excuses to exploit a child 's innocence .
In the movie Hounddog , it is a child mimicking Elvis , in real life it might be a 9 year old swinging on the playground with no awareness of how her movements are perceived by a clean - cut sexual predator supervising his own children .
Viewers of Hounddog will learn that lecturing children on morality is no way to prevent them from being raped .
This misrepresentation of the movie Hounddog is beginning to spread like a virus .
Living His Life Abundantly : New Movie Normalizes Child Rape furthers the distortion .
A new movie to be released Sept. 19 is causing outrage among pro-family groups because it features a nine year old girl being raped , a scene which the film ’s director describes as an innocent experience .
The director did not describe the rape of a child as an innocent experience .
She made that statement about the actions of Dakota Fanning 's character prior to her rape .
The actions of a 9 year - old - child .
Not the actions of a teenage rapist .
Not the rape .
Rick Schatz , president and CEO of the National Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families , cited in this second article needs to get more reliable sources .
Those who distort Deborah Kampmeier 's words need to stop their slander or they need to take a reading comprehension refresher course .
“ Once again , Hollywood is irresponsibly promoting sexual encounters with minors that not only influences our culture but actually normalizes this egregious behavior in our society . ”
Mr. Schatz , Hounddog is not promoting sexual encounters with minors .
The " encounter " as you put it is rape .
To call it anything less is to make the fictional 9 - year - old rape victim as guilty as her rapist .
You are against normalizing " egregious behavior " but apparently you are for the normalizing of rape denial because that 's exactly what you are doing with the wording of your statement .
Also on this bashing bandwagon is Whole Kids Project .
Rape has already been normalized as indicated by the number of sexual assaults that happen each year , which according to RAINN was 272,350 in 2006 not counting victims age 12 or younger .
Fifteen percent of sexual assault and rape victims are under age 12 .
That means that the 272,350 sexual assaults listed is only about 85 % of all of the sexual assaults in 2006 .
More than one quarter million sexual assaults .
In 1 year .
Most of these acts of violence are committed by someone the victim knows .
Family , friends , teachers , preachers , etc .
The movie Hounddog is n't what makes these horrific statistics a reality .
Neither is the movie Bastard Out of Carolina .
The book and movie Lolita have a more mixed impact because of the number of people who view a child rapist 's POV as reality and refuse to see that the character Lolita is an innocent crime victim .
Please , all those taking action against the movie Hounddog spend at least as much time and effort fighting real rape including rapes committed by so - called good Christians .
Make sure your organizations and churches have sexual violence response policies in place which exempt nobody from investigation , including the leaders , so that no sex offenders in your midst can be protected though denial and a subsequent refusal to investigate or a refusal to report allegations to the police .
I suspect most members of these so - called values groups would see me as anti-family or anti-Christian even though I am neither .
I am anti-rape which most people claim to be , but I am also against actions which contribute to the silencing of rape victims ' voices .
This CWA call to action unfortunately falls under the silencing category whether they intended it to or not .
Note : This Values Voter Summit where Ms. Miller of CWA went to spread the word about Hounddog is also where an Obama Waffle mix , packaged using multiple racist stereotypes and distortions , sold quite well from the Thursday of the summit until sometime Saturday when organizers who previously approved of this product changed their minds .
Back to the discussion of Hounddog , CWA wants people to contact :
Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey
U. S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Avenue , N.W .
Washington , D.C. 20530-0001
Office of the Attorney General : ( 202 ) 353-1555
If you disagree with the CWA call to action , please consider contacting the AG 's office to voice your opposition to what CWA is trying to do .
Besides voicing your opinion about CWA 's silencing efforts , ask the AG 's office to do more to fight real child rape , real child porn and real rape against older victims .
Let them know that you are willing to have your taxes spent on real sex crime enforcement and real prevention .
Please call your local movie theater and respectfully ask them exactly why they are not showing Hounddog .
It looks like the booking of Hounddog has been delayed , at least in Philadelphia .
If you or anyone else do n't want to see this film , that 's fine .
Just make your choice based on the reality of Hounddog not the fear - mongering rumors being spread by people who admit that they are passing judgement on a movie based on hearsay from an unnamed " reliable source " who allegedly watched this movie .

MONTROSE — A Utah County physician has pleaded not guilty to a Colorado indictment that alleges he is partly responsible for the death of a Salt Lake City boy assigned to a wilderness therapy camp .
Keith R. Hooker is accused of negligent homicide and child abuse .
He was indicted by a grand jury in July and was arraigned last week in a Montrose courtroom .
Hooker , who has worked in the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center for more than 30 years , was medical director for Alternative Youth Adventures , according to court documents .
Caleb Jensen , 15 , died from a staphylococcus infection in May 2007 while in an AYA program in southern Colorado .
Prosecutors contend his disease went untreated despite glaring symptoms .
But court papers detailing the indictment contain no allegations about what Hooker is alleged to have done or not done , related to the boy ’s death .
A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 6 .
“ Doctor Hooker never examined Caleb .
His role is an adviser to the program .
We think it ’s an overshot , ” Hooker ’s Provo attorney Mike Esplin said .
“ He did n’t give ( AYA ) any advice concerning this incident .
We are in the dark .
( Investigators ) never talked to him . ”
Esplin said he has not seen transcripts of testimony given to the grand jury and believes there is insufficient evidence to support charges .
Prosecutors have also charged camp emergency medical technician Ben Askins , who treated Jensen ’s illness with ibuprofen , with manslaughter .
Camp program director Jim Omer and the businesses , Alternative Youth Adventures of Colorado and its corporate parent , Community Education Centers Inc. also face criminal charges .
The New Jersey - based company provides treatment to 6,000 juvenile and adult offenders a year , in seven states .
Colorado officials shut down the camp operation there two months after Jensen ’s death .
No charges were filed against field counselors who tended to Jensen and later spoke to investigators .
Jensen had been ordered to the camp by Utah juvenile justice officials .
He entered a 60 - day program in March 2007 .
Court documents show camp counselors thought Jensen was “ faking ” his illness and separated him from the group of teens in the field .
They ordered him to wear diapers and put him on suicide watch .
Court documents also say field staff called an AYA ’s base camp about Jensen ’s condition , but no additional medical attention was ordered .

Way back in early July , we made note of a little video aggregation engine called ScrapeUp , an offshoot of VideoSift .
It turns out both are still alive and kicking .
The news today is that the folks who brought you those services are out with another public beta .
It ’s name is Dwigger .
And while it does n’t quite roll of the tongue , it is for sure an interesting bit of kit .
Twitter feeds plus threaded replies plus voting .
It ’s Twitter , Diggnified .
Moving quickly past the terrible Diggnified coinage that is mine and mine alone , Dwigger is , in short , both a useful and playful application .
How it operates :
You can paste a pre-published Twitter message URL and submit it to Dwigger , to be voted and commented on .
You can also write a fresh post directly within Dwigger , 140 characters long .
And if you want to write items exclusive to Dwigger , you may add info as needed .
Just keep in mind the character limit , which carries across the various post options .
Also , if you happen to be in the city of Los Angeles , San Francisco , New York or London , you can designate your message like so .
If only just for kicks .
It ’s important to note that both original posts and replies are shown through Dwigger .
This is done in order to streamline the communications process .
You wo n’t have to convince your dozens , hundreds , or thousands of followers to log in to Dwigger to see what you ’re saying .
Everything is simple , everything is smooth .
Still , what ’s especially pleasing about Dwigger ’s presentation is that replies to you are channeled into a thread , a la Pownce .
If you want to easily make sense of your Twitter inbox insofar as a particular post you made , Dwigger works like a charm .
Add voting to the mix , and you ’ve got yourself a recipe for fun .
Indeed , the ability to vote on material is enjoyable , but it certainly needs much more time to become popular and a solid part of the feature set .
Dwigger is in its first day as a public item , so give it time , I say .
Just keep in mind that the voting component is Dwigger ’s own , so votes do n’t carry over to other Twitter services as updates or anything of the sort .
But that is just as well .
Better to keep that part of your Dwigger life separate from your Twitter life .
In addition to the core features , Dwigger has dressed its front page with top weekly posts , popular people , a “ Zeit Cloud , ” a subscription to the feed , and more .

FEMA Says No to Ice For Hurricane Survivors
Under new policy , FEMA says ice is not its responsibility .
September 18 , 2008  --
Hurricane survivors are being put at risk in Texas and other hot weather states because the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) is no longer providing ice in relief situations , say watchdogs , relief workers and local leaders in Hurricane Alley .
" It 's frustrating that the government can deliver $ 85 billion to bail out AIG , and they can't deliver ice in Texas , " said Ben Smilowitz , executive director of the Disaster Accountability Project ( DAP ) , a nonpartisan organization that monitors the nation 's disaster response system .
In fact , while the federal government can deliver ice to disaster areas , it 's chosen not to , under newly - revised FEMA rules .
Instead , individual states and local governments are now tasked with purchasing , delivering and storing ice , even though they face tough logistical challenges in doing so , according to critics of the new policy .
" FEMA is effectively saying we can't guarantee you ice , " said Mike Womack , director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency .
Besides preserving food when electricity is out , ice is essential in maintaining temperature - sensitive medication and feeding formulas and keeping people cool in the aftermath of disaster , relief and support workers say .
" This is n't for their gin and tonics , " said Elise Hough , CEO of the Houston chapter of United Cerebral Palsy , who says she encountered a lot of indifference when she started raising the issue of FEMA 's ice policy last month .
" This is for people who are extremely sensitive to heat , and ice has a huge impact on their health and safety . "
FEMA says it instituted its new policy in July 2007 , although those in disaster relief circles widely point to the National Hurricane Conference in Florida in April as the announcement of the change .
There , FEMA Administrator R. David Paulison told attendees that the agency would stop providing ice to disaster victims , except in the case of medical emergencies or life - threatening situations , according to media reports at the time .
That 's the first time , support workers , watchdogs and local officials say they heard about the policy change , just as hurricane season was beginning .
Since then , many say , they 've had no direction or guidance as to what the new procedures entail .
" I would be thinking that [ FEMA ] would be communicating through emergency management officials to volunteer citizens that this is how ice is going to be handled in the case of an emergency , but I have n't heard anything , " said Annie Anthony , executive director of the Cape Fear Volunteer Center in Wilmington , NC .
Instead , Anthony learned of the policy from DAP .
And Bob Ronne , board president of the disAbility Resource Center in Wilmington , NC , said once there 's a medical emergency , a term which he says FEMA has not clearly defined , " it 's a little too late to think about ice . "
" Ice has to be there to prevent the medical emergencies , " said Ronne .
Change in Policy
A FEMA spokesperson said the policy change is a result of leftover ice after the 2005 and 2006 hurricane seasons , which the agency paid millions of dollars to store and then melt when it was no longer fit for consumption .
Another spokesperson said the new policy is part of " a smarter business model , " in which states must provide ice themselves and then call in FEMA if there 's trouble .
" When a state has a need for ice that they 're not able to provide on their own , we 'll provide that ice through partnerships with missions , " said the spokesperson , pointing to the current situation in Texas in which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been charged with ice delivery .
She also said states can apply for reimbursement for ice from FEMA , although relief workers and watchdogs say that logistical issues are not helped by money that comes after the fact .
Smilowitz takes issue with both points , countering , " It 's contrary to the whole purpose of FEMA …
Just the fact that FEMA is involved means the disaster is over the head of the state . "
And Womack , who recalls having to tell Hurricane Katrina victims that there was n't enough ice for them , strongly opposes the new policy , calling it " a lifesaving issue . "
He said that because neighboring states have to contract out their plans for ice , they are essentially competing against each other in the face of disaster .
" We would get into bidding wars with contractors and we may not be able to purchase as much as the larger states , " said Womack .
" Our state and probably a lot of other states need the assistance of the federal government in purchasing and distributing ice . "
Womack , who coordinated Mississippi 's resources following devastation by Katrina , said FEMA needs to think in terms of safety , not dollar signs .
Congress , officials and oversight agencies , he said , must recognize that adequate disaster relief requires financial commitment .
" I would like them all to acknowledge that you do have to spend money to be totally prepared , " said Womack .
' Desperate ' For Ice
" We have small babies who do n't have ice , who do n't have water , " says one Texas Gulf Coast resident struggling in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike .
" We need ice over here ASAP so that we can store this insulin , " says another , whose 83 year - old parents depend on the temperature - regulated medication numerous times a day .
In the matter - of - fact words of one more resident , " We need ice desperately . "
They are just three of over 80 calls the DAP has received on its hotline since Ike hit last week , at least a third of which , says Executive Director Ben Smilowitz , pertain to the issue of not being able to get ice .
" The people on the ground do n't know who 's doing what , " Smilowitz said .
Now , as confusion escalates in Texas over who is in charge of ice and how and where survivors can get it , an unlikely group is stepping in to take on the duty that has traditionally belonged to the federal government .
Sam's Club President Doug McMillon responded Wed. to a plea from Houston Mayor Bill
White for donations of ice in case rations run out this week .
McMillon said , " ' Where do you want it , and how much ? ' " said White 's Director of Communications Frank Michel .
" Anywhere we can get ice , we 're making that appeal . "
White and Harris County Judge Ed Emmett announced Tues . that they would take the lead in distributing supplies to survivors after reports that thousands of Houston residents stood in line for hours for emergency food , water , ice and tarps at disaster relief sites while trucks filled with supplies sat in empty parking lots .
This type of confusion , says Smilowitz , is reminiscent of relief after Hurricane Katrina and is exacerbated by FEMA 's new " failed policy , " in which the agency only steps in when " the state 's response falls through . "
" FEMA has many more resources at its disposal than the state of Texas , " said Smilowitz .
" Instead of testing it out to see if the state can get it right , this is something FEMA should do . "
That 's why he launched a campaign that calls on FEMA to reverse its policy and once again assume responsibility of ice delivery and planning .
" We 're not saying FEMA 's done nothing right , but for ice policy they get an F , " said Smilowitz , warning that the situation is only going to get worse .
" There 's been literally no solution for these individuals and , as time continues , there will be even more burdens on the 9 - 1 - 1 system because basic self - maintenance will be impossible . "
In North Carolina , Bob Ronne hopes that a solution will come soon .
He 's right in the middle of Hurricane Alley , he says , and it 's been an active season .
Sitting in his wheelchair , which he has been confined to since a car accident left him paralyzed in 1986 , Ronne goes through the seven medications he depends on daily for his spinal cord injury .
When asked how he would be affected after a disaster if he did n't have ice to keep those medicines safe , Ronne has trouble finding words .
" It 's something I do n't want to imagine , " he said eventually .
DAP 's hotline is open for calls and to receive reports of gaps in disaster relief and response services at 866-9 - TIP - DAP .

Introduction
Your village has suffered too long from the nocturnal attacks of that horrible beast , the Wumpus .
At your coming - of - age ceremony , you vow to do what no other hunter in the village has had the courage to try .
Donning an old suit of armor and taking only a torch and a crossbow with a single arrow , you enter the cavernous lair of the Wumpus .
The path is unknown , twisting through narrow corridors and forgotten chambers .
Ancient pits , built by a dead people for their lost subterranean gods , ooze slime as they wait to claim another explorer .
Monstrous bats inhabit the caves , carrying the unaware through the darkness and releasing them again at whim .
Most terrible of all is the Wumpus , who slumbers even now in the darkness .
Woe to any who come upon the beast in the shadows !
But you have chosen to face these dangers , great as they are .
You will free your village or fall in the attempt .
Because you alone have chosen to Hunt The Wumpus !
Controls Hunt
The Wumpus uses the keyboard to play .
Here are the key controls : Menu Keys
KEY FUNCTION (S ) Arrow Keys Change current menu selection Enter Key Select current menu item Escape Key Return to main menu F12 Function Key Exit game ( standalone version only ) Ingame Keys
KEY FUNCTION (S ) Arrow Keys · Move character Up / Down / Left / Right
· Fire arrow in direction ( in fire mode ) Shift Key Move character using express movement ( see below ) F Switch to fire mode ( for firing arrow ) M View game map ( when on Tally screen ) P Play new game at same difficulty ( when on Tally screen ) F12 Function Key Exit game ( standalone version only )
Express Movement Express movement is a special movement mode which you can activate by holding down the Shift key when you move , or by turning it on under the Options menu .
When express movement is active , your character will move quickly through any corridors and only stop when they reach the next room .
This can be useful for getting around quicker , since corridors are always safe .
But it can also mean rushing into a dangerous room , so use it carefully !
The Game Screen
You begin the game in a relatively safe room in the cavern .
All the rest of the cavern is unknown , and as you explore it new rooms ( and new dangers ) become apparent .
Here are the things you will encounter during your hunt :
Your Character
This is who you 'll control in the game .
Cavern Room
This is an open space in the caverns .
Corridors
These run through the caverns and are always safe .
Slimed Room
This room has slime on the walls .
That means this room is connected to a slime pit .
Slime Pit
This room is a deep pit filled with slime .
Entering a pit room will lead to a fatal fall .
Bloody Room
This room has bloodstains splattered about .
That means this room is within two rooms of the Wumpus ' lair .
Nasty Room
This room has both slime and bloodstains .
That means this room is both immediately connected to a slime pit and within two rooms of the Wumpus .
Bat
One of the bats which lives in the cavern .
Each time you enter a room with a bat , there is a chance you will disturb the bat .
If you do , it will grab you and carry you to another room of the cavern .
It could even carry you to a slime pit or right to the Wumpus !
Wumpus Your foe .
If you see the Wumpus , then it 's already too late .
Firing Reticle
You 'll see this symbol over your character when you 've chosen at last to fire your lone arrow at the Wumpus .
You can then press a directional key to fire the arrow in that direction , or any other key to cancel the attack .
How To Play
From the main menu you may select to play a New Game , change the Options , or read the About screen .
( In the standalone version of the game , you may also Exit the game here . )
The options screen lets you turn the audio ( music and sound effects ) on or off .
It also lets you toggle express movement .
Once you choose to start a new game , you 'll be given the option of three difficulty levels - Easy , Hard , and Pro. Each difficultly level is harder than the previous one , with fewer rooms in the cavern and more aggressive bats .
( Even the Easy setting can be difficult at times . )
Upon starting a new game , your character will appear in a safe room in the cavern , and the hunt can begin .
Your goal is to move around the cavern , avoiding slime pits and using the bloodstained rooms to track down the location of the Wumpus .
Once you think you know where the Wumpus is , you 'll enter the room next to it and fire an arrow into the beast 's lair .
If you 're right , you 'll slay the Wumpus and win .
Otherwise , you 'll awaken the Wumpus and your game will end .
You gather clues about the Wumpus ' location by studying which rooms have bloodstained floors .
Every room that is within two rooms of the Wumpus will have a bloody floor .
Note that corridors are not counted as rooms , so any two rooms are considered " next to " each other if they are connected by any amount of corridor .
For example , both these pictures show rooms that are considered " next to " each other , in that they are immediately connected .
As far as the game is concerned , both room B and room C in this picture are " next to " room A . To ( hopefully ) make things clearer , here is an actual game map .
( Click the picture for a larger image . )
As you can see , there are bloodstains on the floors of every room " next to " the Wumpus , regardless of corridors in between , as well as rooms that are " next to " those .
( Again , every room that is within two rooms of the Wumpus has bloodied floors . )
You can also detect slime pits this way , except that there is slime only in the rooms that are " next to " the pits .
This means less warning than the " two room " blood warning around the Wumpus .
If you enter a room with slime in it , take your next step very carefully !
Play a game or two and study the map afterwards .
It should all make sense quickly then .
That 's it !
Hope you enjoy Hunt The Wumpus , and good hunting to you !
Nightmare on Wall Street : 72 hours that shook the world 's economy
The financial crisis which reached its peak yesterday has been rumbling on for months .
But in the vital 72 hours between last Friday and yesterday morning , bankers and government officials played what one described as a game of ' poker ' as they tried to come up with a solution .
What ensued was a sleepless weekend which resulted in thousands losing their jobs in New York and London - and a financial despair not seen in decades .
Hour by nail - biting hour , this is how the crisis unfolded :
Down and down : Wall Street experienced its worse day since the September 11 terror attacks
FRIDAY , 6 PM NEW YORK TIME :
Thirty of Wall Street 's top executives are summoned to the austere , stone headquarters of New York 's Federal Reserve .
They are told by America 's two most powerful financial figures , Hank Paulson , the Treasury Secretary , and Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , that Lehman Brothers is on the brink of bankruptcy , and that Merrill Lynch may soon follow .
They are also warned that there will be no government bail - out .
Washington 's will and resources are exhausted .
The bankers are told ' Come back in the morning and be prepared to do something . '
8 PM :
The gravel - voiced Paulson dismisses the meeting saying : ' Everybody is exposed ' .
Across Wall Street , Lehman is being called a ' dead bank walking ' .
SATURDAY 9AM :
The bank chiefs reconvene at the Federal Reserve .
They and their teams are broken into groups to discuss the crisis .
John Mack , the burly , Lebanese - born chief executive of Morgan Stanley asks :
' If we 're going to do this deal , where does it end ? '
Many in the room ask why they should be bearing the cost of the Lehman collapse when others , including hedge funds and foreign investors , got a free ride .
8 PM : Across Wall Street , Lehman is being called ' dead bank walking '
Two banks announce that they are in the running to buy the good parts of Lehman : Britain 's Barclays and Bank of America .
But by noon , Bank of America is all but out of the running .
Barclays , meanwhile , is keen to establish an American beach - head and presses on , hoping the U.S. government will change its mind and provide financing .
2 PM :
While the meeting at the Federal Reserve continues , John Thain , the bespectacled head of Merrill Lynch , nicknamed I - Robot because of his clinical , emotionless manner , calls Ken Lewis , head of Bank of America , about being taken over .
Lewis is receptive .
Thain is driven down to the Fed where he sees the Lehman deal is collapsing .
He must now pursue the deal with Bank of America or risk seeing Merrill Lynch face the same fate .
He cancels a trip to Asia and Merrill and Bank of America begin meetings at Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & Katz , New York 's most fearsome corporate law firm .
According to his contract ,
Thain will collect over £ 5 million as an exit package after the takeover .
All afternoon , Wall Street executives arrive at the Federal Reserve in jeans and blazers .
Caterers wheel in trays of sandwiches and fruit and the usually quiet weekend streets are choked with limousines .
5 PM :
Those departing the Federal Reserve say the discussions are turning into ' the world 's biggest game of poker ' .
Will the government blink and bail Lehman out ?
Meanwhile , even the smartest financial minds in the world are struggling to understand the details of Lehman 's books .
Stock broker Andrew O'Connor takes a break from his floor position at the New York Stock Exchange to contemplate the situation
SUNDAY 9AM :
Barclays is the only remaining potential buyer of Lehman and has drawn up documents to pitch a deal .
But it insists on federal support .
NOON :
Barclays fails to secure Federal funding and withdraws its offer for Lehman .
Wall Street traders are called in to work in anticipation of Lehman 's imminent bankruptcy .
Meanwhile , word reaches the Fed that Merrill and Bank of America are reaching a deal .
2.30 PM :
Government officials announce an extraordinary trading session to help Lehman unwind its trades .
One trader calls the four - hour session scene ' utter chaos ' .
During this Sunday afternoon trading session , Lehman 's famously rambunctious traders send out goodbye messages to colleagues and gather on the bank 's trading floor in New York to eat pizza and drink beer , struggling to deal with the speed of their firm 's demise .
Workers leave the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the closing bell
6.48 PM :
It is reported that Bank of America will buy out the 94 - year - old Merrill Lynch .
It is a bitter end for the firm which claimed to have brought ' Wall Street to Main Street ' with its network of stock brokers .
AIG , one of America 's largest insurance firms , is now in trouble .
It announces it plans to move capital from its regulated insurance business to its holding company .
It had requested a $ 40 billion bridge loan from the Federal Reserve to help it stay afloat .
8.44 PM :
Bank of America agrees to buy Merrill Lynch for $ 29 per share ( about $ 50 billion in total ) - two thirds of its value one year ago , and half its all - time peak .
MONDAY 2AM :
The 158 - year old Lehman Brothers announces its intention to file for bankruptcy in order to ' protect its assets and maximise value ' .
Its shares are already down 94 per cent .
4AM :
Major European indices fall more than 2.6 per cent when the markets open .
Financial shares are hit hardest - the Royal Bank of Scotland loses 4.7 per cent .
9AM :
Lehman employees in New York leave their offices clutching boxes containing their possessions , most refusing to discuss their fate with the waiting reporters .
They are entering a terrible job market .
8AM :
Insurance giant AIG plunges 40 per cent .
Meanwhile , in London , the fallout from events in the U.S. starts to hit home .
Here is how the day unfolded :
7 AM LONDON TIME :
The first of Lehman Brothers 4,000 London staff turn up for work only to be told they are out of a job .
8AM :
The Bank of England moves to calm the situation by saying it is prepared to do anything to stabilise London 's financial markets .
It also injects £ 5 billion into the banking system .
Scenes at the Lehman Brothers Headquarters in Docklands
8:30 AM :
FTSE 100 opens down with loss of over 200 points .
12:06 PM :
FTSE hits low - point for the day with a loss of nearly 300 points as fears of contagion reach fever pitch .
4.30 PM :
FTSE closes down 4 per cent , with Halifax owner HBOS losing as much as a third of its value .

The United States Senate passed the sweetened ' New and Improved ' bailout bill last evening ( Oct. 1 , 2008 ) .
With a 74 aye and 25 nay vote , the bill passed in a landslide .
What WAS ORIGINALLY a $ 700 BILLION bailout of the Banksters , has now morphed into a ' sweetened ' $ 850 BILLION " feel good " package .
How many times have WE said we want clean Bills ?
How many times have we said we want Bills that deal with ONLY the issue at hand ?
How many times have we screamed , " No more riders !
No more add - ons ! "
NOW THEY have done it again !!
Stuck a bunch of add - ons into the Bill to make it palatable to the Senators to the tune of an EXTRA $ 150 BILLION !
Ultimately , it will cost every man woman and child $ 10,000 to " feel " better about bailing out the Banksters .
Say , " No Way !!! " to your Congressperson .
They vote tomorrow , Friday , October 3 .
PLEASE remind your CONGRESSMAN their job is to CONTROL the purse strings .
This bailout , no matter how " good " it feels , is not responsible government .
Let the Free Market reign .
Let
Those fall who unscrupulously lent money to people who could n't afford it .
The poor folks who have fallen from this unethical behavior have already fallen .
They can't get any lower .
They 've lost it all .
Let the Perps bear the consequences of their actions .
What an insult to ask us to cover their backs .
The scripted mainstream media ( MSM ) talking heads , carry water for those who want the bailout .
Do n't listen to their tripe .
Remember :
The MSM routinely lies and spins because they are propagandist mouthpieces .
Also , remember : Almost everything they say , exactly the opposite is true .
So if they say , " the sky will fall if we do n't ... "
The TRUTH is , " the sky will fall if we DO ... "
Will NOT bailing out the Banksters have global consequences ?
Probably .
At this Country 's founding , were we intended to have these kind of entanglements with other countries ?
NEVER .
We are no longer the freest people ( nation ) on earth BECAUSE of these kinds of entanglements .
Lean on your Congressperson to vote " No " on this bailout .
Do n't accept some condescending statement that " you just do n't understand the global implications ... " blah , blah , blah .
Do n't swallow that kool - aid .
Also , remind the " Gentle Congressperson " this is an election year , that you will be watching their vote closely , and you have every intention of voting for their opposition if their vote on this issue is not representative of your position .
THEN do n't let your words be an idle threat .
If your " representative 's " vote does n't represent you , quote Donald Trump , " You 're FIRED ! "

In the Public Interest
Behind The Deregulatory Curtain
by Ralph Nader
The current finger pointing by the deregulation crowd in Congress and their ideological soul mates in the media reminds me of the 1939 film classic The Wizard of Oz .
It is as though these spin masters want us to pay no attention to the government officials behind the deregulation curtain .
Indeed , the right - wing pundits and the revisionists in Congress are spending an inordinate amount of time falsely claiming that our nation ’s current financial disaster stems from the Community Reinvestment Act , a law passed by Congress and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 .
The primary purpose of this modest law is to require banks to report on where and to whom they are making loans .
Community organizations have used the data produced as a result of this law to determine if banks were meeting their lending obligations in the minority and lower - income communities in which they do business .
Congress passed this law because too many lenders were discriminating against minority borrowers .
" Redlining " was the name given to the practice by banks of literally drawing a red line around minority areas and then proceeding to deny people within the red border home loans - even if they were otherwise qualified .
The law has been in place for 30 years , but the right - wing fringe claims it somehow is responsible for predatory lending practices that date back just to the beginning of this decade .
Notice what these revisionists are not mentioning .
No " thank you " to former Senator Phil Gramm for pushing the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act .
This law was passed in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929 – and designed to separate banking from securities activities .
In 1999 , when Congress passed the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act and in so doing repealed Glass - Steagall the banks strayed into rough waters by looking for fast money from risky investments in securities and derivatives .
As predatory lending mushroomed out of control , the regulators — key among them , the Federal Reserve and the Office of Comptroller of Currency — sat on their hands .
The Federal Reserve took exactly three formal actions against subprime lenders from 2002 to 2007 .
Bloomberg news service found that the Office of Comptroller of the Currency , which has authority over almost 1,800 banks , took three consumer - protection enforcement actions from 2004 to 2006 .
No " tip of the hat " to the Bush Administration for preempting state regulators and Attorneys General from using state consumer laws to crack down on predatory and sub - prime lending by national banks .
And , let us not forget the folks at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Imagine allowing these two government sponsored enterprises — that were weakly regulated by HUD — to claim they were meeting the national housing goals by counting the purchase of subprime loans .
Back in May of 2000 , our associate Jonathan Brown warned that it would be inappropriate and counterproductive to encourage Fannie and Freddie to meet the housing goals by purchasing subprime loans .
Too bad our members of Congress and the regulators at HUD were infected with deregulatory zeal .
Former Texas Senator and current UBS executive Phil Gramm — would - be President John McCain ’s Treasury Secretary - in - waiting — pushed through the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 , which deregulated the derivatives market .
With help from his wife , Wendy , the former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission who went on to a post on the Enron board of directors , Gramm removed the controls on Wall Street so it could innovate all sorts of exotic financial instruments .
Instruments far riskier than advertised , and now at the core of the financial meltdown .
The SEC , through its “ consolidated supervised entities ” program , decided that voluntary regulation would work for the investment banking sector .
Not surprisingly , this was a scheme cooked up by Wall Street itself .
The investment banks were permitted to double , triple and go 20 times ( and more ) down on their bets by using lots of borrowed money .
They made minimal disclosures to the SEC about what they were doing , and the SEC did n’t bother to review those disclosures adequately .
Too bad for the investment banks — and the rest of us — they made lots of bad bets .
The SEC has now closed the voluntary program , though now there are n’t any major investment banks left ( the two remaining ones have converted themselves into conventional banks ) .
It is time to start paying very close attention to government officials behind the deregulation curtain .
Let your Members of Congress know you are not willing to bailout the gamblers on Wall Street with a no-strings - attached pile of taxpayer dollars .
The time for regulation is upon us .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Two U.S. troops and a group of contractors have been indicted on charges they were part of a bribery scheme involving the awarding of military contracts in Afghanistan , the Justice Department announced Wednesday .
Maj . Christopher P. West , an Illinois National Guardsman and head of operations at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan , was arrested Monday on charges of bribery and conspiracy .
Air Force Tech .
Sgt. Patrick W. Boyd , a resident of Rockledge , Florida , and a contracting officer at Bagram , was arrested Tuesday on the same charges .
Contractors Assad John Ramin , Tahir Ramin , Noor Alam and Abdul Qudoos Bahkshi were also charged in the indictment .
Those indicted face up to 15 years in prison and a fine of $ 250,000 for bribery , and up to five years in prison and a fine of $ 250,000 for conspiracy .
The contractors ' companies face fines of up to $ 500,000 for bribery and conspiracy .
" We will aggressively prosecute individuals and companies who line their own pockets by corrupting the bidding process for base procurement in Afghanistan , " said Thomas O. Barnett , Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department 's Antitrust Division .
" These contracts were meant to protect U.S. soldiers serving their country , and we will not tolerate corruption that deprives the troops of the benefits of competitively - sourced goods and services . "
All About Afghanistan
Western concerns about global energy markets hit new heights last night when Russia , Iran and Qatar said they were forming an Opec - style gas cartel .
The move by the three countries , which control 60 % of the world 's gas reserves , was met with immediate opposition from the European commission , which fears the group could drive up prices .
Alexey Miller , chairman of Russia 's Gazprom , said they were forming a " big gas troika " and warned that the era of cheap hydrocarbons had come to an end .
" We are united by the world 's largest gas reserves , common strategic interests and , which is of great importance , high cooperation potential in tripartite projects , " he explained .
" We have agreed to hold regular - three to four times a year - meetings of the gas G3 to discuss the crucial issues of mutual interest . "
Miller 's comments , likely to increase pressure on the west to accelerate developments in wind and other renewable energy alternatives , followed a meeting in Tehran with Gholamhossein Nozari , Iran 's petroleum minister , and Abdullah bin Hamad al - Attiyah , Qatar 's deputy prime minister and oil and energy minister .
Miller said the group was establishing a technical committee comprised of specialists and experts to discuss the implementation of joint projects embracing the entire value chain from geological exploration to marketing .
The Russians avoided the word cartel but the Iranians spelled it out clearly .
" There is a demand to form this gas Opec and there is a consensus to set up gas Opec , " Nozari told a news conference .
With Opec due to meet on Friday to look at ways of driving up oil prices , Miller said fossil fuels were going to cost more .
" We share the opinion that oil price fluctuations do n't put in question the fundamental thesis stating that the era of cheap hydrocarbons has come to an end . "
The European commission said last night that it would oppose the creation of any organisation that could restrict competition .
" The European commission feels that energy supplies have to be sold in a free market , " said its spokesman , Ferran Tarradellas Espuny .
The west already suspects that Russia and Iran are happy to use energy to pursue political goals .
The cutting off of gas by Moscow to Ukraine in the middle of a political and commercial spat caused outrage and worry in western Europe .
For its part , Iran , in its stand - off with world powers over its nuclear programme , has threatened to choke off oil shipments through the Persian Gulf if it is attacked .
A gas cartel could extend both countries ' reach in energy and politics , particularly if oil prices bounce back to the highs seen this year , prompting politicians , businesses and consumers to look toward cleaner - burning natural gas and other alternative fuels .
The gathering in Iran needs to be ratified by further meetings in Qatar and Russia but is the most significant step toward the formation of such a group since Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , raised the idea in January 2007 .
The European Union depends on Russia for nearly half of its natural gas imports .
Moscow , which controls many of the pipelines from Russia and central Asia , already has a tight hold on supplies .
" To try to manoeuvre the supply makes perfect sense , " said James Cordier , president of the US - based Liberty Trading Group and OptionSellers.com .
" Just because it does n't have the clout of oil , it 's still in their best interest to deliver natural gas where it needs to go and manage supply in order to help manage the price . "
Liquefied natural gas , a rapidly growing segment of the market , could be traded as a commodity similar to oil and the move by Russia , Iran and Qatar appears to anticipate that , said Konstantin Batunin , an analyst with Moscow 's Alfa Bank .
" My take is that it is just a commitment to create something in the future , " he said .
" It 's just a first step . "
A blog dedicated to rooting out and stopping all monsters .
By Richard Black
Environment correspondent , BBC News website
The grassland plots were grown in DRI 's " Ecocell " facility Plants are unlikely to soak up more carbon dioxide from the air as the planet warms , research suggests .
US scientists found that grassland took up less CO2 than usual for two years following temperatures that are now unusually hot , but may become common .
The conclusion parallels a real - world finding from Europe 's 2003 heatwave , when the continent 's plant life became a net producer , not absorber , of CO2 .
The latest study is published in the scientific journal Nature .
Researchers extracted four intact segments of grassland , about 3 sq m in area and weighing about 12 tonnes each , from the prairies of Oklahoma , and placed them in special chambers at the Desert Research Institute ( DRI ) in Reno , Nevada .
Conditions in the chambers , such as temperature , moisture and sunlight , could be precisely controlled .
Drying out
Two of the four chambers were given a set of conditions mimicking what actually happens , on average , on the wild prairies .
Temperatures rose and fell with days and nights and seasons , and " rainfall " was injected in a realistic pattern .
The other two chambers received the same prescription with the exception that for a whole year , temperatures were always 4C higher .
Grassland " monoliths " were excavated from the Oklahoma prairie
The warmer plots saw a shortfall in carbon dioxide uptake of about 30 % during the warm year and the one following .
DRI 's Jay Arnone , who led the study , said two different mechanisms appeared to be responsible .
" So in the warm year , the temperature goes up and causes more evapotranspiration from the plants , " he told BBC News .
" But plants have evolved to ' know ' that when it gets dry they should curb their water loss , so they reduce the apertures of their stomata ( pores ) to conserve water , and that constrains the amount of CO2 they can take up ( by photosynthesis ) . "
This response has been understood for some time .
But what happened in the following year , when temperatures returned to " normal " , was not so familiar .
Even during the warm year with its meagre amount of photosynthesis , plants had put carbon in the soil .
So during the normal year following , soil microbes had extra carbon to process , which they did , emitting more carbon dioxide into the air .
Mixed forest
By complete coincidence , the study mimicked fairly closely events on the other side of the Atlantic .
As DRI researchers were turning up the heat in 2003 in their experimental plots , in Europe it was happening for real , with temperatures in some places reaching 6C above normal .
Heat makes plants warm planet
An analysis led by French researchers , published in 2005 , showed that as the continent became hotter , Europe 's plants changed from being net overall absorbers of CO2 to net producers .
A lot of faith is being placed in some circles in the capacity of trees and plants to maintain absorption of CO2 as concentrations of the gas rise , or even to use the extra CO2 to grow faster and absorb more of it .
It is one of the reasons behind the recent upsurge of interest in having western governments pay to protect tropical forests .
But the DRI research is one of a number of pieces of evidence suggesting it will not always work .
Some ecosystems might continue to absorb carbon dioxide , and perhaps increase the rate of absorption ; others may react to warming by releasing the greenhouse gas .
" We conducted this study under current ambient levels of CO2 so we do n't know for sure what 'll happen in the future , " said Professor Arnone .
" But we do n't anticipate a huge effect of [ elevated ] CO2 on these systems .
As high temperatures become more commonplace , you might expect a persistent reduction in the uptake of CO2 by natural ecosystems , and that may mean that the net rate of CO2 elevation may increase . "

Talk about hypocrites .
The Republicans carefully orchestrated this media buzz about Palin and now are playing the hurt feminists who are just standing up for Sarah .
Republican women leaders Wednesday leapt to the defense of under fire vice - presidential pick Sarah Palin , saying she had been the victim of unfair and sexist attacks .
They charged that Palin , a 44 - year - old mother of five named as Senator John McCain 's wildcard running mate , faced the same dilemma as ex-first lady Hillary Clinton in her failed bid to become Democratic presidential candidate .
Palin even attacked Hillary via Ben Smith :
" She does herself a disservice to even mention it , really , " Palin said .
" When I hear a statement like that coming from a woman candidate with any kind of perceived whine about that excess criticism , or maybe a sharper microscope put on her , I think , ' Man , that does n't do us any good , women in politics , or women in general , trying to progress this country , ' " Palin said .
" I do n't think it bodes well for her .
I have n't seen anyone on TV call Palin a bi*&ch or anything close to it .
What a bunch of phonies .
Cavuto joined in too : Neil Cavuto on Hillary ’s “ kind of bitchy image ” And of course this one : John McCain supporter on Hillary : “ How do we beat the Bitch ? ”
There are tons more to choose from .
And now the McCain camp says there is no sexism going on either .
See the kabuki dance ?
Looking at Palin 's record is sooo sexist to them .
I wonder if the media will turn on McCain since they love him so dearly for pushing this garbage , but I have no faith and they will back down to the McCain camp in the end as when one side says there is no sexism and the other side does .
The Internet can be a place where craziness does happens , but it 's not coming from the liberal blogs and that 's a very different thing .
And where were the Republican ladies when all the Obama smears appeared in the Internets as well --- that the right wingers were all too happy to see ?
I just heard Tim Pawlenty on CBS tell me that John McCain is decisive and clear and showed that last night , and then I went over to the Carpetbagger and read this jumbled mess of an answer from McCain :
“ Some of the richest people I ’ve ever known in my life are the most unhappy .
I think that rich is — should be defined by a home , a good job and education and the ability to hand to our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one that we inherited .
I do n’t want to take any money from the rich .
I want everybody to get rich .
I do n’t believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth .
But I can tell you for example there are small businessmen and women who are working 16 hours a day , seven days a week that some people would classify as , quote , ‘ rich , ’ my friends , who want to raise their taxes and raise their payroll taxes .
Let ’s have — keep taxes low .
Let ’s give every family in America a $ 7,000 tax credit for every child they have .
Let ’s give them a $ 5,000 refundable tax credit to go out and get the health insurance of their choice .
Let ’s not have the government take over the health care system in America .
“ So I think if you ’re just talking about income , how about $ 5 million .
But seriously , I do n’t think you can — I do n’t think , seriously that — the point is that I ’m trying to make here seriously — and I ’m sure that comment will be distorted , but the point is — the point is — the point is that we want to keep people ’s taxes low and increase revenues .
And my friend , it was not taxes that mattered in America in the last several years .
It was spending .
Spending got completely out of control .
We spent money in a way that mortgaged our kids futures .
My friends , we spent $ 3 million of your money to study the DNA of bears in Montana .
Now I do n’t know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue , but the point is — but the point is it was $ 3 million of your money .
It was your money .
“ And you know , we laugh about it , but we cry and we should cry because the Congress is supposed to be careful stewards of your tax dollars .
so what did they just do in the middle of an energy crisis when in California we are paying $ 4 a gallon for gas , went on vacation for five weeks .
I guarantee you , two things they never miss , a pay raise and a vacation .
And we should stop that and call them back and not raise your taxes .
We should not and cannot raise taxes in tough economic times .
So it does n’t matter really what my definition of rich is because I do n’t want to raise anybody ’s taxes . ”
It 's the end of another week ...

Bundling controllers with popular video games is a fairly common occurrence these days , as Wii Play can attest .
The latest controller to be bundled with something is none other than the DualShock 3 with LittleBigPlanet .
Exclusive to Japan ( for the time being ) , these bundles will come with a copy of LittleBigPlanet and your choice of a black , white , or chrome / silver DualShock 3 to either match , complement or contrast with your system .
It has been tagged at a price point of ¥ 7980 ( Yen ) , or just about $ 79 US .
Speaking of bundles , a PlayStation 3 system bundle was also announced .
What ’s unique about this bundle is that it comes with not one , but two DualShock 3 Controllers .
It seems like the perfect way to start out when buying a PlayStation 3 with such a social - centered title .
For your hard - earned Yen you get the 80 GB Chrome / Silver PlayStation 3 system and a DualShock 3 controller , plus the LittleBigPlanet bundle .
Pricing was not mentioned for this yet , but it should n’t cost much more than your typical bundle even with that extra controller .
Given that bundles have been spotted in Europe and now have been announced for Japan , it would n’t be much of a leap of faith to hope that one is planned for the US / Canada , right ?

It is understandable to be nervous when meeting a man who shoots first and asks questions later .
An agent who mainlines Martinis and sleeps with a Walther PPK under his pillow is generally not known to be the most sympathetic of company .
So it was no surprise that when game developers Treyarch arrived to meet current Bond actor Daniel Craig for the first time at Pinewood Studios earlier this year , the usually tough technology experts were filled with trepidation .
The developers ' mission was to get Craig to approve early shots of forthcoming Bond game Quantum of Solace , so that they could use his likeness and voice in their product .
If the pictures failed to meet his approval , the lack of continuity between the game and the eagerly - awaited Bond movie of the same name could prove deadly .
When Craig turned up late for the meeting , it only compounded the designers ' anxiety .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Thankfully , the thespian had a good reason for his tardiness .
" He had been playing Guitar Hero III on his PlayStation , " says Adam Gascoigne , co-design director of Quantum of Solace , who was at the meeting .
" He is a bit of a gamer .
People often do n't believe that but he is .
He said to us that he would need to sit down and play the game a few times and work out whether he was satisfied with it before he could let his image be used .
It is unusual for the lead in a title to be into gaming so we knew our work would have to be up to scratch . "
Thankfully it passed muster .
Craig , along with the film 's other main actors – including Bond girl Olga Kurylenko and Dame Judi Dench , who plays " M " – all lent their talent to the finished product .
While cinema - goers look forward to the latest instalment of the Bond movie franchise , released on 31 October , gamers are just as excited by the tie - in game , released on the same day .
Bond games have a history of shaking – not stirring – things up .
N64 game GoldenEye 007 , based on the 1995 James Bond film Goldeneye , sold more than eight million copies worldwide after it was released in 1997 .
With its multiplayer deathmatch mode , it is considered one of the most influential first - person shooters ( FPS ) ever .
Gascoigne hopes to repeat GoldenEye's success with Quantum of Solace , which was two years in the making .
The developer says the game was easier than those built from scratch because its plot is based on a fusion of the forthcoming film and 2006's Casino Royale , which was the first Bond film to feature Craig and marked a grittier , more realistic turn for the series .
The game begins and ends at the same points Quantum does , and tells the story of Casino Royale through flashbacks .
" We have something called the Bond Bible , which is a very long document that details everything you could possibly want to know about the Bond universe , " he says .
" It discusses how Bond dresses , how he behaves , what he likes to drink .
To begin , we were using that to develop a game based solely on Casino Royale .
But while doing that , in late 2007 , we got the first draft of the Quantum script from the screenwriter Paul Haggis .
We took crucial elements of that script and used them when designing levels for the game .
It continued for the next 15 months . "
The game - makers spent hundreds of hours photographing the film 's locations and sets which were then digitally recreated .
Producers also furnished them with pictures of costumes and props , which were also used to inform their designs .
While the game 's " engine " – the fundamental means by which its characters are powered and controlled – is the same one used in another hugely successful FPS , Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare which like Quantum of Solace is published by Activision , the artificial intelligence of Quantum 's baddies is superior to anything seen before .
" They do things like take cover and blind fire [ shoot at Bond by pointing their gun around a corner they are sheltering behind ] , " says Gascoigne .
" There are many more actions from a much more mercenary enemy .
They do a lot more things people might not usually notice .
For example , they are more likely to charge at you when you are reloading . "
When playing the game , much of it is spent with Bond taking cover .
The user can flick between viewing the world " first person " ( from Bond 's eyes ) or " third person " , being able to see the character , and those around him .
This latter viewpoint can be used in these sheltering scenarios .
Enemies can be aimed at , and Bond will fire around a corner or over a desk , say , before retreating to safety .
" The cover is necessary because of the advances in artificial intelligence , " says Gascoigne .
" But you can't just stay hidden , you will need to break cover to advance .
It is much more like the Bond character .
He leaves nothing to chance , and deliberates before he does anything .
However , we like to counteract this slowness in the game .
Every so often he will enter an area and all hell will break loose . "
The game is already winning fans from those who work in the real - life security services .
" I am a gamer , like a lot of guys in the security industry , " says Will Geddes , one of the world 's leading experts in counter - terrorism and head of his own private security firm .
" Our heads are usually filled with stuff because the job is 24 / 7 .
You have to switch off .
This game will be sold out in the Navy , Army and Air Force Institutes of Afghanistan in a couple of days because a load of the troops have PS3s and Xboxes .
Games get your brain off topic .
The testimony of a good game is how involving it is because you forget where you are . "
Former MI6 agent Harry Ferguson says that Bond 's character mirrors the changing climate in which members of the security services find themselves .
" The new Daniel Craig Bond is getting into firefights , " he says .
" Now the war on terror is happening , the gloves are off .
That can involve dealing with al - Qa'ida in downtown Karachi which turns into the kind of situations you see in Bond , unlike during the Cold War , where there were moments of civility . "
Ferguson says that shoot - 'em - ups might give people the idea that agents only trained to kill using guns .
In fact , like Bond does in the film and game , they are likely to use the most efficient means of ending someone 's life .
" Even here , I could find something to kill you , " the former agent says worryingly , while seated at a table .
" It would depend on what I had in front of me .
Here , there 's lots of glassware for a start .
The key thing is , if you are in an operations situation , be aware of all your surroundings .
At the moment we 've got hot drinks in front of us .
If you move first , my first move would be with the tea because it 's nice and hot and if I catch you right it will do some damage and it will distract you from pulling a gun . "
Geddes only has one criticism of the game .
" The only thing I would say is , it features a mobile phone that has a radar reading of everyone in the region .
If only , " he pines .
" But if it does come out Harry 's mob and our good friends [ government surveillance experts ] at GCHQ will try and build something like it .
They get a lot of their ideas from movies .
There was a detonator watch once featured in a Bond film that is not unfeasible .
The advances in technology in the last two years are just astounding . "
So maybe Bond 's latest foray into gaming will have repercussions in the real world , as well as the virtual one .
Quantum is released on 31 October on multiple formats .

The Huntsville Times reported on September 12 that , in response to the looming threat from Hurricane Ike , Alabama Governor Bob Riley declared a formal state of emergency .
The governor 's declaration of emergency activated the state 's price - gouging law , which makes " unconscionable pricing " illegal during times of emergency .
The Times quoted Riley as saying that he thinks " a threat to public health is a strong possibility due to the shortage of fuels . "
Hurricanes do n't cause shortages , however .
Price controls do .
A " shortage " occurs when the amount of a good demanded exceeds the amount of a good supplied at the prevailing price .
In other words , shortages happen when the price is too low .
The market mechanism fixes this automatically by moving us forward along the supply curve and backward along the demand curve until we reach a price at which the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are again equal .
Hurricanes along the Gulf Coast are likely to do two things .
First , they are likely to increase demand for gasoline as people flee the storm and look for fuel to power generators .
Second , a hurricane that hits a major oil - producing region will almost certainly knock supply offline in the short run .
An increase in demand coupled with a reduction in supply means that the price will go up .
Higher prices tell people to economize on gas and other essentials by cutting out nonessential driving .
They also have the benefit of attracting supplies from elsewhere : profit - seeking entrepreneurs in regions that are not affected by the hurricane would , in anticipation of higher profits , redirect their supplies from unaffected areas toward places where they are most desperately needed .
The process by which equilibrium is restored is rendered inoperable — indeed , made illegal — by price - gouging laws .
This has several surely unintended but negative consequences .
The first is that if people cannot pay for something with their money they will pay for it with their time .
Thus , we will see long lines and rationing at gas stations .
Second , since quantity demanded will far outstrip quantity supplied at the below - market price , supplies may very well dry up with little extra in the offing .
People will spend their time and energy looking for gas supplies that are n't there instead of attending to what the market would reveal to be more urgent concerns if prices were allowed to increase .
Third , since there are criminal penalties associated with price increases , recovery will not be as swift as it otherwise would be .
Parts of the Gulf Coast are still recovering from Hurricane Katrina after three years .
This is due in no small part to price controls and other regulations that have impeded the rebuilding process .
Recovery would be more rapid if prices were allowed to move freely .
There are also more subtle effects that are n't so apparent at first glance .
Price gouging is very poorly defined as " unconscionable pricing . "
There is basically no way for a businessperson to know whether they are breaking the law or not ; while there are benchmarks that states use to denote prima facie gouging , these are not exclusive .
The added uncertainty associated with the postdisaster business environment means less investment , lower supplies over the long run , and slower , more painful recoveries .
Enforcing these statutes also requires resources .
The time and resources that states spend prosecuting price gougers are time and resources they are not spending keeping order or assisting with disaster relief .
It is hardly clear that hunting down gas - station owners who engage in vaguely defined " unconscionable pricing " is the best use of our resources .
Hurricanes reduce supply and increase demand , but it 's price controls that create shortages .
The additional misery of gas lines and long postdisaster recovery periods are tragic but easily avoidable .
Laws against price gouging look compassionate and make excellent fodder for political crusaders , but they are based on incorrect economic reasoning .
If we are serious about minimizing damage and maximizing recovery , price - gouging laws should be one of the first things to go .

“ Let us be silent , that we may hear the whispers of the gods . ” – Ralph Waldo Emerson
Post written by Leo Babauta .
Follow me on Twitter .
I woke up at 4 a .m. this morning to the sound of silence .
An absolute still household , despite there being six kids and a wife all at home .
And while I love my family to death , this time of tranquility is one of absolute bliss for me .
I enjoyed my coffee , read a bit , got some writing done .
Then I headed out for an early morning 5 a .m. run in pure silence , without an iPod , busy traffic , or the busy - ness of humanity to disturb my peace .
There was a full - to - nearly - bursting orange moon lighting the sky , the hush of the nearby ocean , and an inky blackness surrounding me , my running , and my thoughts .
This time of quietude is not only one of my favorite parts of my day , but has become an essential part of the day .
It soothes the soul , quiets my inner beast , brings out the goodness in me , allows me to hear myself .
Having a time of stillness in your life can be similarly wonderful , if you do n’t have it already .
Let ’s take a look at some ways to find quietude in your life and see how the sound of silence can allow your thoughts to emerge .
Now , I should note that you do n’t need to be an early riser to find a time of silence during your day .
It ’s one of the options ( as I ’ll talk about below ) , but it ’s only one option among many .
Rise early .
If your day is so busy that you just ca n’t find the time to be alone and to have stillness and silence , getting up a bit earlier can be a good solution for some people .
It ’s not for everyone — some people hate getting up early .
I used to be one of those , but in recent years I ’ve discovered a love for the early morning hours .
Here ’s how to wake earlier if you want to do that .

Late nights .
If you ’re not into early mornings , late nights can be just as peaceful , when everyone ’s asleep .
Turn off the TV and get away from the computer .
Find other ways to spend this golden time , in quiet .

Get out into nature .
Sometimes households and offices can be a bit noisy and chaotic .
To escape the noise , get out into nature as much as possible .
Find a park , or a trail in some woods .
Go to the beach or a pond or a lake or a river — water is one of my favorite ways of finding peace in nature .
Pay close attention to everything around you , instead of blocking it all out .

Meditation .
Many of you are n’t into meditation , and I totally get that — for years I dismissed it as “ new agey ” and not worthy of serious attention .
But it does n’t have to be anything complicated or difficult to understand .
Try this very simple meditation : close your eyes ( after reading the rest of this paragraph ) and pay attention to your breathing .
Notice your breath as it enters your body , and again as it goes out .
Your mind will probably stray — that ’s OK .
Just pay attention to these thoughts , let them go without forcing them out , and gently return your attention to your breathing .
Keep doing this for a minute or so .
Gradually increase the time you do this as you practice .
It ’s nice to get into a comfortable position , but not so comfortable you fall asleep !

Exercise .
As I mentioned at the beginning of this post , exercise is one of my favorite things to do during my time of silence .
It can be anything : running , walking , biking , swimming , strength training , rowing .
This exertion of energy helps release stress and gets the blood flowing to your brain — giving you some of the best thinking you ’ll do all day .

Take a break and take a walk .
Every hour or two , take a break from working .
Get away from the computer , and stretch .
Then take a walk , to get the blood flowing .
It ’s fine to just walk around your office or building , but if you can get outside into the sunlight ( or rain , as the case may be ) and fresh air ( or less - than - fresh air , as the case may also be ) , I find that to be helpful .
Sure , it might not be all that quiet if you ’re out in a busy street , but it ’s better than being cooped up all day .

Yoga .
I will admit that I ’m not into yoga , but I know some people who swear by it .
I ’ve tried it and enjoyed it , but it ’s just not my thing .
That said , I think it ’s worth a try and it can be a great quiet - time exercise .

Reading .
One of my all - time favorite quiet - time activities !
I love curling up with a good book and a cup of coffee when all is quiet , and losing myself inside the magical world of fiction .
If you have n’t been reading as much as you ’d like , finding some quiet time in the morning ( or evening ) can be a great way to work reading into your routine .

Journaling .
There ’s something therapeutic about writing in a journal , and if you make it a daily habit , it can be one of the best things you do all day .
It gives you a way to reflect on your life , on the things you ’ve been doing and the things you want to do .
It records your life so you can look back on it later .
And it brings clarity to your thoughts in a way you might not find without writing .
Blogging can be a great form of journaling .

Bathing .
I do n’t get a chance to do this enough , but I love to take a nice long bath .
That might not seem very manly , but I do n’t care .
It ’s relaxing and enjoyable .
Calgon , take me away !

Massage .
If you can afford it , it ’s nice to go and get a paid massage now and then — Eva and I had numerous massages during our trip to Thailand , and they were wonderful .
Quiet , relaxing , oh so pleasurable .
Of course , you can do this the cheap ( more positive term : frugal ) way by exchanging massages with your significant other on , say , alternating days .
Use massage oil and candles and relaxing music to create a great atmosphere .

Museums , art galleries , libraries , gardens .
If you live in a city , it can be hard to find zones of quietude .
But they do exist .
When I lived in San Francisco , for example , some of my favorite quiet places ( besides parks and the beach ) were the city ’s libraries , museums , galleries , and private gardens .
Find those places in your city and use them as oases .

For those with kids .
Many of these things can be difficult if you have kids to take care of — trust me , with six kids , I know the feeling .
Some suggestions : take advantage of the early mornings or late evenings when they ’re sleeping ; exchange quiet times with your significant other so that one watches the kids while the other relaxes or exercises ; trade kid-watching duty with a friend or relative ; pay a babysitter for a short time each day ; or find activities for your kids to do while you get your quiet time .
MOSCOW  A car bomb in the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali killed seven Russian peacekeepers and two others on Friday , raising tensions in the separatist enclave days before a scheduled pullback of Russian troops from Georgian territory .
President Eduard Kokoity of South Ossetia said he had “ no doubt ” that Georgian special forces were behind the explosion .
The acts , he said , “ undermine international efforts to stabilize the situation and torpedo the Medvedev - Sarkozy plan . ”
The blast comes six days before a Russian deadline to pull back from the so - called buffer zone outside South Ossetia , returning a large swath of land to Georgian control .
European Union monitors began patrolling the buffer zone on Wednesday , in accordance with a cease - fire agreement brokered by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and agreed to by Russia .
President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia agreed to adhere to the timetable for withdrawal .
“ The last terrorist act in South Ossetia proves that Georgia has not abandoned the policy of state terrorism , ” Mr. Kokoity told the Interfax news agency .
Here is a list of phone , fax , and email address for all US senators : United States Senate 110th Congress Phone , Fax , Email Addresses
Here is a second List Of Senate Contacts .
I am told this list is more current .
It was used to formulate the fax contact table below .

Here is a comma separated list for those of you with access to to a program that allows block faxing .
You may need to modify that list slightly for your application .

Metro Fax
I have an existing email fax number but I opened up a second account just now for purpose of faxing every senator in the US .
If a senator is missing from the list it because they did not have a listed fax number .
I did not count them up .
I chose to go with MetroFax .
There are others services , but 1000 pages a month for $ 12.95 was the best overall deal I could find .
There is a $ 10 activation fee , but the second month is also free .
If you elect to do the same , mention my name and I will get a free month .

Restoration and Expansion of Civil Liberties & Constitutional Rights
Civil liberties and due process of law are eroding due to the " war on terrorism " and new technology that allows for easy invasion of privacy .
Americans of Arab descent and Muslim - Americans are feeling the brunt of these dragnet , arbitrary practices .
Mr. Nader supports the restoration of civil liberties and the repeal of the Patriot Act .
He also supports an end to secret detentions , arrests without charges , restricting access to attorneys , the use of secret " evidence , " military tribunals for civilians , misuse of non-combatant status , and the shredding of " probable cause " determinations .
These policies represent a perilous diminishment of judicial authority in favor of concentrated power in the executive branch .
Sloppy law enforcement and dragnet practices are wasteful and reduce the likelihood of apprehending violent criminals .
Mr. Nader seeks to expand civil liberties to protect basic human rights in employment regardless of gender , sexual orientation , race or religion .
Civil Rights of Muslims and Arab Americans
The Nader Campaign urges the Department of Justice to take action regarding civil rights violations against Muslim and Arab Americans .
According to a report released on March 3 by the Council on American - Islamic Relations , The Status of Muslim Civil Rights in the United States 2004 , Muslims in the United States experienced more than 1,000 incidents of asserted harassment , violence and discriminatory treatment in 2003 , a jump of 70 percent over the previous year .
The largest number of incidents had to do with employment and the refusal to accommodate religious practices .
But there were , however , 93 reported hate crimes ( i.e. , incidents of anti-Muslim violence ) , more than double the total in 2002 .
And there were numerous cases in which Muslims alleged that laws were applied to them more harshly because of their ethnic or religious identity .
The report also noted that the implementation of the USA PATRIOT
Act has been associated with law enforcement abuses .
The report points to a number of questionable national security policies including :
The rounding up of Muslim Americans and Arab Americans by the government that blurred the clear distinction between immigration cases and terrorism investigations .
CAIR cites a report by the Office of Inspector General of the Justice Department which found that between September 11 , 2001 and August 2002 , the government arrested 738 Muslims and Arabs whose entry visas had expired .
In doing so , government officials interfered with their access to lawyers , blocked communication with family members , and even denied their constitutional right of obtaining information about the charges filed against them .
The Justice Department 's Office of Inspector General also reported that many were held in inhumane conditions including being detained in jail cells for 23 hours a day , and taunted and abused by guards .
Guards also allegedly slammed prisoners against walls .
Security tapes of the Bureau of Prisons show 308 incidents of physical abuse perpetrated by staff of federal prisons .
None of these hundreds of detainees were found to have links to terrorism .
The singling out of Muslim visitors and immigrants by requiring them to report to government offices to be fingerprinted , photographed and assigned a registration number or be deported .
Thirteen thousand of the people who complied were still subject to deportation for violation of minor immigration regulations .
The CAIR report points to widespread incidents of prosecutorial and law enforcement bias against Muslims .
Violations of local ordinances for minor offenses like failure to cut lawn , or leaving garbage cans outside , have increased as have discretionary criminal prosecutions .
Enforcement of the PATRIOT
Act has also led to harassment by banks and financial institutions .
People with Muslim or Arab names are being arbitrarily requested to provide detailed documentation of their identities as well as financial and tax records .
The Ralph Nader Campaign urges :
Passage of the End Racial Profiling Act , championed by Congressman John Conyers , Jr. in the House and Senator Russell Feingold in the Senate .
The Act would dissuade law enforcement from engaging in profiling by requiring collection of race data , and providing legal options to victims of racial profiling .
The Department of Justice to implement regulatory and procedural reforms suggested by its own Office of Inspector General designed to restore constitutional protections in government investigations and handling of detainees .
Congressional hearings on post 9 - 11 rules and procedures enacted by the Bush Administration in order to examine their impact on security and civil liberties .
Opposition to the extension of provisions of the USA PATRIOT
Act that are set to expire in 2005 .
Reinstatment of the Federal Communications Commission 's " Fairness Doctrine " -- an attempt to ensure that coverage of controversial public issues by a broadcast station be balanced and fair .
In the spring of 1987 , both houses of Congress voted to put the Fairness Doctrine into law but President Ronald Reagan vetoed the legislation .
Equal Rights for Asian Americans
The Nader campaign strives for equal opportunity and justice for all .
During times of war , civil liberties and due process of law are threatened .
During World War II the United States moved to intern Japanese - American families .
This was shameful .
It must never be repeated again .
Today , in the war on terror , civil liberties are eroding as Muslims , primarily of Arab and Asian decent , are targeted .
Even from a law enforcement perspective , racial profiling is sloppy law enforcement that leads to ineffective and unjust dragnet sweeps , which is wasteful and reduces the likelihood of apprehending violent criminals .
The Nader campaign seeks to expand civil liberties to include basic human rights in employment and equal rights regardless of gender , sexual orientation , race or religion .
This specifically includes passage of the End Racial Profiling Act , championed by Congressman John Conyers , Jr. in the House and Senator Russell Feingold in the Senate , that would dissuade law enforcement from engaging in profiling by requiring collection of race data , and providing legal options to victims of racial profiling .
Regarding discrimination in employment , after more than 300 years of affirmative action to benefit white males , we definitely need affirmative action for people of color and women to offset enduring historic wrongs as well as present - day inequalities .
Affirmative - action programs should not be based on quotas , and race and gender should not be the predominant factor in choosing qualified applicants .
A good affirmative - action program uses a variety of methods to achieve the goal of increasing diversity , including using race and gender as one of many factors in evaluating the suitability of an applicant .
Regarding Asian Americans , the Nader - Camejo campaign supports the enforcement of Executive Order 11246 which forbids any organization from receiving federal money if they practice discrimination .
This should be applied to Asians as it is to other groups .
Cases of racial discrimination should be vigorously prosecuted .
The United States government should set an example regarding discrimination against Asian Americans by appointing qualified Asian Americans to policy - making positions in the Judicial and Executive branches of the federal government .
Asian issues have been a long - term concern of Ralph Nader ’s , as an undergraduate at Princeton University his major was East Asian studies including language study in Chinese .
Equal Rights for LGBT Citizens
Ralph supports equal rights for gays , lesbians , and other LGBT citizens , including equal rights for same - sex couples .
He opposes President Bush ’s proposed constitutional amendment to ban same - sex marriages .
All adults should be treated equally under the law .
The Nader campaign believes that by attempting to mandate inequality , President Bush is leading the country in the wrong direction .
The Nader campaign agrees with Marie C. Wilson , the president of the Ms. Foundation , who recently said : " The most important thing is really having equal rights .
It ’s not about the marriage .
It ’s having the same rights that you would get if you were married . "
The Nader campaign also believes that love and commitment is not exactly in surplus in this country and should be encouraged .
The main tragedy of marriage , what undermines marriage , is divorce , as Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago recently said .
The Nader campaign supports full equal rights for gays and lesbians .
While civil unions are a step in the right direction under current federal and state law , they do not afford full and equal rights .
There are 1,049 federal rights that are only conferred with marriage .
Additionally , at the state level , a civil union is only recognized in the state where it occurs , while a legal marriage , and all the rights that go with it , is recognized in all the states .
Thus , the only way to ensure full equal rights is to recognize same - sex marriage .
In more than 200 years of American history , the U.S. Constitution has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights and in each instance ( except for Alcohol Prohibition , which was repealed ) , it was to extend rights and liberties to the American people , not restrict them .
For example , our Constitution was amended to end our nation ’s tragic history of slavery .
It was also amended to guarantee people of color , young people and women the right to vote .
The amendment urged by President Bush ( called the Federal Marriage Amendment ) would be the only one that would single out one class of Americans for discrimination by ensuring that same - sex couples would not be granted the equal protections that marriage brings to American families .
Equal Rights for Women
Ralph Nader endorses the full eleven - point agenda for economic , social and political rights of women advanced by the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) .
The NOW agenda endorsed by Nader includes :
Feminization of Power :
If we are to reverse the feminization of poverty , we must have a Feminization of Power .
We must move more feminist women into policy - making positions in government , business , education , religion and all the other powerful institutions of society .
Women are barely tokens in the decision - making bodies of our nation , so the laws that govern us are made by men .
In Congress , women make up only 10 % of the lawmakers ; in state legislatures , the number is less than 25 % .
NOW 's Political Action Committees support candidates , both women and men , who support feminist goals .
NOW encourages women to be politically active , to run for office from any political party , and to participate in the decision - making processes of the nation .

We are helping women break through the " glass ceiling " of the executive suite , and break loose of the " sticky floor " the dead - end , low wage jobs that keep so many women in poverty .
NOW is actively opposed to punitive welfare reform that harms the most vulnerable women and children in our society .

Equal Rights Amendment : Women are still not in the fundamental law of the land .
The Equal Rights Amendment is essential to establish equality under the law for women .
Equality in pay , job opportunities , insurance , social security , and education will remain an elusive dream without an ERA in the U.S. Constitution , and we are committed to its passage and ratification .
The progress we have made for women 's rights , and must continue to make , can be lost at any time without the strength of a Constitutional foundation .

We oppose attempts to restrict these rights through legislation , regulation ( like the gag rule ) or Constitutional amendment .
NOW supports the right of women to have children , including appropriate pre-natal care and quality child care .
We oppose government efforts to limit or discourage childbearing , such as family caps and involuntary sterilization .

We pioneered model rape and spouse assault legislation as well as support programs for battered women , and NOW was instrumental in passing groundbreaking federal legislation , the Violence Against Women Act .
In recent years , increasing anti-abortion violence has been used to limit women 's access to reproductive health services , and NOW has brought a precedent - setting racketeering case against these terrorists .

War on Drugs
The Nader campaign calls for the decriminalization of marijuana , the legalization of industrial hemp , and an end to the war on drugs .
Medical marijuana :
The criminal prosecution of patients for medical marijuana must end immediately , and marijuana must be treated as a medicine for the seriously ill .
The current cruel , unjust policy perpetuated and enforced by the Bush Administration prevents Americans who suffer from debilitating illnesses from experiencing the relief of medicinal cannabis .
While substantial scientific and anecdotal evidence exists to validate marijuana ’s usefulness in treating disease , a deluge of rhetoric from Washington claims that marijuana has no medicinal value .
The Controlled Substances
Act of 1970 defines marijuana as a Schedule One narcotic , making it very difficult for American researchers to perform rigorous double - blind scientific studies on marijuana .
Even without these difficulties , research has shown marijuana to be a safe and effective medicine for controlling nausea associated with cancer therapy , reducing the eye pressure for patients with glaucoma , and reducing muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis , para - and quadriplegia .
Internationally , scientists are undertaking massive studies to determine the healing powers of cannabis .
In August 2003 the esteemed British medical journal The Lancet reported that the world ’s largest study into the medical effects of cannabis have confirmed that the drug can reduce pain and improve the lives of people with multiple sclerosis .
The three - year study was the first proper clinical appraisal of whether cannabis - derived drugs can help treat MS .
Harvard medical doctor Lester Grinspoon has said he would have loved to do a similar study , but has been held back by the law .
On his website , www.rxmarijuana.com, and in his book The Forbidden Medicine , Grinspoon documents how marijuana relieves the pain of people enduring more than 110 different medical conditions like AIDS , Crohn ’s Disease , glaucoma , cancer , and many more .
Marijuana helps increase appetite , reduce blood pressure and intraocular pressure .
Whenever given the chance , the American public has voted to allow seriously ill people to relieve their pain with marijuana .
Despite well - funded opposition from the federal government , citizens in nine states have cast ballots to legalize the use of medicinal marijuana .
No state has ever rejected such a voter initiative .
Medical marijuana community health centers have opened up in the states , like California , only to be aggressively attacked and closed by federal law enforcement agents .
Physicians must have the right to prescribe this drug to their patients without the fear of the federal government revoking their licenses , and doctor - patient privacy must be protected .
The Drug Enforcement Administration should not be practicing medicine .
Industrial hemp :
The Nader campaign supports industrial hemp as a renewable resource with many important fuel , fiber , food , paper , energy and other uses .
Industrial hemp is a commercial crop grown for its seed and fiber and the products made from them such as oil , seed cake , and hurds ( stalk cores ) .
Industrial hemp is one of the longest and strongest fibers in the plant kingdom , and it has had thousands of uses over the centuries .
In need of alternative crops and aware of the growing market for industrial hemp — particularly for bio- composite products such as automobile parts , farmers in the United States are forced to watch from the sidelines while Canadian , French and Chinese farmers grow the crop and American manufacturers import it from them .
Federal legislators , meanwhile , continue to ignore the issue of removing it from the DEA list .
It is time to allow hemp agriculture , production and manufacturing in the United States .
Clemency for Non-Violent Drug Offenders :
In 2004 , Ralph Nader wrote President Bush urging that he grant clemency to 30,000 non-violent drug offenders .
Nader ’s letter highlighted the three decade long failed , and unjust , drug war .
His call for clemency highlighted a similar request made by 400 clergy members to President Bill Clinton in 2000 .!— end summary — >
Nader ’s letter recalled President Bush ’s substance abuse problems and noted that if he had been incarcerated for cocaine use he " probably would not have gone on to have the career you have had . ”
The letter also highlighted the rapid expansion of the prison system in the United States which now houses more than 2.1 million people – one - quarter of the world ’s prison population .
Clemency for non-violent drug offenders would save more than $ 1 billion annually .
" It is urgent that the U.S. reverse the incarceration binge .
The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that if incarceration rates remain unchanged an estimated 1 of every 20 Americans and greater than 1 in 4 African Americans can be expected to serve time in prison during their lifetime , ” said Nader .
" It is time to make the failed war on drugs a central issue in the American political dialogue .
For too long we have let this injustice continue to grow unhindered .
Taking action on clemency at the federal level will set an example for the states and begin the process of reversing this failed policy . ”
Nader Reiterates Need to Heed Lessons of Native Peoples :
In 2004 , Ralph Nader personally welcomed representatives of the thousands of American Indians and Alaska Natives who visited Washington to celebrate the opening of the National Museum of the American Indian .
A contingent from Albuquerque , New Mexico briefed Nader on the continuing neglect of two million - plus off - reservation Indians by the federal and state governments , as well as some tribes , in matters of health care and educational support .
So - called welfare - to - work programs have had the impact of other historic Indian removal programs and sent single mothers and their families into cities far away from health care , tribally influenced education , or even extended family support .
Nader ’s concern with Native Americans first blossomed when he published a lengthy article in 1956 on tribal sovereignty during the termination era in the Harvard Law Record .
He has steadfastly supported tribal authority and America ’s commitment to treaty obligations pertaining to human services , land rights , governmental authority and hunting and fishing rights .
Nader sees the Museum as an opportunity for non-Indians to understand the continuing Constitutional obligation of a government - to - government relationship between the United States and the five hundred - plus tribes .
He views the fidelity of our commitment to treaty and statutory commitments , which flow from this trust relationship between our government and the tribes , as a test of the application of our Constitution .
The museum ’s focus on modern Indian communities offers a second opportunity for non-Indians , according to Nader .
Indian peoples have developed critical survival skills over many generations as each confronted systematic efforts to destroy their cultures and their communities .
These tribes offer object lessons of stamina for American citizens who must now confront powerful efforts by concentrated corporate power to erode our culture and our democracy .
Equal Rights for Americans With Disabilities
The Full Integration of People with Disabilities Into All Aspects of Life is Fundamental To Creating A Just Society
The struggle for disability rights is not a question of " us ” and " them . ”
It is not a question of a charitable government taking pity on lesser human beings .
It is not a question of throwing money at an issue and hoping for a quick fix .
It is a question of recognizing that ALL of us deserve a just society , which of course includes persons with disabilities .
It is a question of recognizing that the same corporate domination that harms the earth , robs citizens of their constitutional right to equal participation in government , and endangers the health and well being of our children , also limits the potential of people with disabilities and in turn limits us all .
It is a question of recognizing that guaranteeing the rights of people with disabilities also guarantees that all citizens , all disadvantaged groups , all responsible businesses the many opportunities of growth , fulfillment and worthwhile public endeavor that the United States can offer .
The Americans With Disabilities
Act is now 10 years old – but it has only begun to correct the fears that have kept people with disabilities in isolation since the beginning of history .
Disabled people are still too often refused access to health care , transportation , school , housing and jobs .
Disabled women and people of color are hit especially hard .
By eliminating each and every form of discrimination , we can create the just society to which we aspire — a society whose fairness inspires the confidence that will enable Americans from every sector to reach their full potential .
EMPLOYERS NEED THE SUPPORT OF A JUST AND CIVIL SOCIETY
To illustrate the universality of disability rights , we must take disability rights issues out of the disability ghetto where we usually find them .
It is instructive to look at how a fully integrated society would benefit employers , both public and private .
Mistakenly , employers often see their interests as juxtaposed against those of persons with disabilities .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Especially in this day of work force shortages , we as a society can not afford to exclude an entire group of people simply because of the manner in which they do or do not move their legs , use their eyes , or process information .
Employers need all available expertise and creativity .
Thanks to the integration of students with disabilities into our public schools over the past 26 years , there is now a rising swell of highly trained graduates with significant disabilities .
Employers who have taken full advantage of this pool of talent — among them IBM and NASA — have set very high expectations for their disabled employees , while exposing them to the rigors of fast - paced mentoring programs .
The employees have in most cases exceeded the expectations of their employers , and thus put the moderate costs of work site and job task modification in perspective — these costs are seen as a normal and reasonable cost of doing business .
Hiring disabled applicants is a good start , but an employer needs the support of a just and civil society — backed up by the ADA — to be sure that their new employee has a good chance of succeeding on the job .
Every neighborhood near each site of the employer must have wheelchair accessible housing and public transportation in place .
The telecommunication system , including the Internet , must be usable by employees with every type of disability .
Airlines , trains , and buses must accommodate business travelers with disabilities promptly , at any location .
Many employers provide local transport with a variety of trucks and vans , none of which is easily or safely usable by a wheelchair rider .
Low - floor minivans are available , with gently sloped entry ramps and nearly a foot of extra headroom giving easy entry for heavy deliveries .
Unfortunately , the lowering of the floor is currently done after the minivan is manufactured , adding more than 50 % to the cost of the van .
A large enough order from the postal service — easily justified to save the backs of postal workers — could result in the original manufacture of low - floor minivans for nearly the same price as a standard minivan .
Once these vans became available at a lower cost , they could provide transportation to many wheelchair riders , taxi and delivery services .
People with disabilities need a wide variety of other equipment to get around and to function effectively , but wheelchairs and other forms of adaptive equipment are priced so high that they are often unavailable to the people who need them most .
The wheelchair industry , controlled by a virtual monopoly of a single maker of poor - quality chairs for thirty years , was finally opened up to dozens of new competitors by a Justice Department antitrust settlement in 1979 .
With new competition , prices dropped to one - half of what they had been , while the chair quality became much better .
But recent swallowing of many of these small companies by one large company again threatens to return the market to its former monopoly status .
As employees with disabilities adapt to the changing schedules , locations , and other needs of their employers , they in turn will need the support of a well - developed civil society .
The goal of most workers , disabled or not , is to create a seamless web of support for their families .
If they worry about health or safety , the worker ’s productivity suffers .
Available child care , nearby and in synch with the schedules of the employer , must be physically accessible either to a disabled parent or to a disabled child .
In - home extended care for elderly family members can be vastly safer and less expensive than nursing homes ; the lessened worry can boost the employee ’s productivity .
The Olmstead decision of 1999 of the U.S. Supreme Court stated that a person receiving long term care should receive it in the " least restrictive setting appropriate . "
The proposed bill MiCASSA [ Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act – HR 4416 — Rep. Danny Davis ( D - IL ) ] will take funds away from nursing homes and make them available for in - home care .
I strongly support MiCASSA .
Health care is paramount to the care of an extended family , but many employers offer no health insurance .
High prices and the exclusion of pre-existing conditions make adequate insurance unavailable to many people with disabilities .
Central to building a civilized society in the U.S. is the provision of Universal and Accessible Health Care .
Contact with an Independent Living Center , run by disabled people with years of experience in solving the day - to - day puzzles of living well with a disability , could be invaluable .
State - of - the - art adaptive equipment developed in the network of Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers , under the direction and consultation of people with disabilities , could be made available to the employee .
Group health insurance must remain available and affordable to employers that hire disabled persons .
Individual health coverage must also remain in effect for the disabled employee during all periods of unemployment ; only Universal Health Care could protect against the catastrophes that occur during gaps in coverage .
Adult education facilities for advanced training must be physically accessible and ready to accommodate students who are blind or deaf .
A SPECIFIC PROGRAM : IN THE SHORT TERM
Enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act and lead the U.S. by example in the full integration of persons with disabilities into all public programs Complete the full integration of students with disabilities into all schools , public and private .
Decreased class size will help achieve this goal .
Monitor and enforce the full integration of disabled employees into the workplace Rewrite the Uniform Building Code to require all new homes to be visitable and adaptable for disability access .
This can be achieved at very little cost on new construction .
Speed up the conversion of all over - the - road buses , light rail , and airplanes for disability access Monitor the wheelchair and medical device industries to prevent anti-competitive practices and to prevent the over - pricing and lack of technical progress that result from monopolization Fund Child Care for all lower income workers Fund In - Home Extended Care by passing MICASSA ; help the states in every way possible to carry out the directive of the Olmstead decision to provide extended care in the least restrictive setting .
This is cheaper than institutionalized nursing care .
Increase support for Independent Living Centers that are run by disabled people in decision - making roles .
Increase support for Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers that are run by disabled people in decision - making roles Contract with auto makers to manufacture Low - Floor Minivans for postal and fleet use , so that the vans become widely available for use by persons with disabilities at low cost .
Every person , disabled or not , has the need to travel freely without the risk and encumbrance of an automobile .
Sometimes it ’s just because the darn Chevy broke down again .
If public transit is available but inaccessible , each one of us has the right not to scuttle the trip just because one of our friends or family has a disability .
Our freedom to live , our liberty to pursue happiness is dependent on mobility .
What about the scores of thousands of us who can never , ever drive a car ?
A civil society owes its citizens some alternative to that Chevy .
The problem in the vast majority of cases is that no bus is available - buses do n’t come where you are or go where you need to go .
The ideal solution for everybody is more and better modern public transit .
New buses could be comfortable , low floor , easy to enter buses with ramps to the doors of the lowest models … buses to every neighborhood at every reasonable hour , coupled with urban development policy that fights the automobile - driven suburban sprawl and rebuilds the cities for better living .

People wonder why asexuals bother to get together , but Amanda and I have been happily married for nine months now and we 're both still virgins .
Some people even think asexuality does n't exist .
It 's so underrepresented , I can understand why people are skeptical .
I was too , even though I was perfectly used to thinking of myself in this way .
For years I just thought I was the only person in the world who felt like this .
My parents are agricultural scientists , so I 've lived overseas since around the age of 10 .
I was in India until I was 16 , then Zimbabwe for two years , and then Kuwait .
I studied in China and New York , before settling in London .
Even at 10 , I had a sense that I did n't want to get married and have children .
I know a lot of kids say things like that , but I did n't change my mind about it later on .
I was n't interested in relationships or finding a girlfriend , and was very sure I did n't have an interest in boys either .
Gradually my school friends spent more and more time talking about girls and pursuing relationships , but I could never grasp what they were expecting to get out of it .
There were family parties in India where all the kids would gather outside in the garden .
I was 13 and had a best friend , Kasim , who was a year younger than me .
He had a crush on an Australian girl called Jessica - everyone seemed to think she was the prettiest .
We had lots of whispered discussions about what he could say to her , and even though I thought it was a ridiculous game , I wanted to fit in , so I pretended I had a crush too - on a French girl called Sylvie .
She was a safe bet because she was so unlikely to reciprocate .
I knew she was n't at all interested in me .
I 'd just discuss her with the boys .
There were times as I got older when girls did seem interested in me , but I always deliberately ignored their signals .
I wanted to avoid getting into a situation I 'd feel uncomfortable with , so I never even kissed a girl .
The first girl I kissed became my wife .
When I was 13 , my father gave me a book on sex education .
I felt as if I was reading about a foreign culture ; I just could n't see why anyone would go to so much trouble just to have sex .
I tried looking at pornography on the internet .
I was n't disgusted or appalled - it was just boring , like looking at wallpaper .
Masturbation was another topic of conversation in those days , and I did masturbate .
It was n't a sexual urge for me , I did n't fantasise , it was just something my body decided to do .
People say about asexuals : " But if they masturbate does n't that make them sexual ? "
It 's hard to explain , but if you 're asexual you do n't necessarily feel an explicit connection between masturbation and sexual orientation .
It 's just part of having a human body - a physical , biological process .
After we moved to Zimbabwe I went back to visit my old friend Kasim .
The last time we 'd seen each other we'd been into computer games , drinking Coke and going for pizza .
Two years on , it was a shock to see how much Kasim had changed .
Sex was his major preoccupation .
He had a girlfriend and was on the brink of going all the way with her .
One afternoon we were with some of Kasim 's friends , and he began goading two of the girls into kissing each other in front of a camera .
The whole atmosphere was really charged , and I felt out of my depth .
I 'd fallen behind .
Kasim had been my friend a long time , but he 'd entered this different world without me .
By the time I went to university , I was happy to let people wonder about my sexuality .
I was n't pretending to talk about girls any more .
Some people assumed I was gay , but my best friend Simon was the first person to confront me directly .
We were studying in Hangzhou , in China , just south of Shanghai .
It 's a very beautiful city , on a lake with mountains , and we were walking through the streets when Simon asked me outright .
First he made a joke about whether " I liked girls ... or boys ? "
I laughed but he persisted and said " So what are you ? "
I just said , " I 'm not straight and I 'm not gay , and that 's it , full stop . "
Back then I did n't know what term to use .
The following summer I was surfing the internet when I read a post from a girl who was n't attracted to anyone .
Someone had suggested she should be aware of " asexuality " , and gave the address of a website : asexuality.org .
When I went to the site and read the material , I was quite dismissive at first , because you just do n't hear about other asexuals .
Since Freud and Kinsey , and even to an extent the sexual revolution of the 60s , we tend to believe anyone without a sexual orientation must be repressed or delusional .
Asexuality is therefore an impossibility .
Kinsey labelled us " X " , a statistical throwaway category for anyone damaged to the point where they can't express any sexuality .
Gradually , though , through visiting the site , I came to realise that these were just ordinary people ; people who were writing things I 'd thought myself , but had never heard anyone else express .
It was such a relief .
Finally I had a label - a way to explain myself that could settle all the awkwardness and questioning .
I told my close friends straightaway .
Only one female friend did n't really believe me .
I think she thought I was secretly in love with her .
Back at college I decided to get it over with in one day by wearing a T - shirt saying : " Asexuality is not just for amoebas " .
I was nervous , but I 'd already told a dozen or so people , and was used to answering the same questions over and over .
No one has ever reacted really badly to me - I 've been lucky .
I told my mother shortly after finding the asexual website , and she said : " Well as long as you understand the possibility that one of these days you 'll meet someone and want to settle down with them . "
I was n't so sure .
I 'd already resigned myself to a solitary existence .
I 'd convinced myself I could form strong friendships and was independent enough to fare OK .
Luckily my mother always ends up being right about everything .
When my studies took me to New York , I got more involved with the asexual community there .
I posted messages on their website and there were regular meet - ups in a little pink tea shop in the East Village - I guess you could call it the asexual equivalent of a gay bar .
One day I got an email from Amanda .
She was asexual , living close by , and offered to show me around the neighbourhood .
In case she was cruising for an asexual boyfriend , I responded with a warning that I was " vehemently anti-romantic " .
But we met up anyway , for tea and ice - skating , and we took to meeting a lot .
I loved Amanda 's attitude to life and enjoyed hanging out with her .
And she was pretty .
At first I tried to treat it like any other friendship .
Then I found myself travelling four miles downtown to deliver sandwiches when she told me she was hungry .
Two months in , we were at a gig and it seemed like a good idea to hold her hand .
I felt cautious about it but just wanted to .
I wondered if I could .
Then I found I could n't let go .
That evening ended with us agreeing that our friendship was an important thing .
We wanted to commit for life .
In the asexual community we do n't form relationships lightly .
If you do n't want to spend the rest of your life with a person , there 's no reason to make such a special commitment .
When we announced our engagement , our families were happy for us , and our friends in the asexual community were particularly pleased .
On our wedding night , my mother - in - law insisted on booking us into a honeymoon suite , so we invited all our friends to an after party .
We played Scrabble late into the night and everyone stayed over and slept on the hotel - room floor .
People always ask how our marriage is different from just being friends , but I think a lot of relationships are about that - being friends .
We have built on our friendship , rather than scrapping it and moving on somewhere else .
The obvious way we differ is that we do n't have sex , though we do kiss and cuddle .
We like to joke that the longer we 're married the less unusual this is .
By the time we 've been married five years we 'll be just like everyone else .
Do I feel as if I 'm missing out on something ?
Not really .
We 've decided that if either of us wants to try sex out in the future then we will see what we can do .
We would both be willing to compromise because we 're in a relationship and that 's what you do .
When it comes to the future and to children , we 're big advocates of adoption .
We 're not so fussed about passing on our own genes .
Right now we 're quite happy with what we 've got .
After moving around so much , I can say now that wherever Amanda is - that 's home .

Claim : Photograph shows Sarah Palin posing in a U.S. flag bikini while holding a rifle .
FALSE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , September 2008 ]
Photo is attached .
It shows Vice Presidential candidate Sara Palin holding a rifle .
She is wearing a stars and stripes bikini .
Behind her a male is holding a can , possibly beer , and in the other hand a cigarette .
There is a third person behind the beer / cig guy holding another rifle .

If it ’s real it ’s dynamite !
She ’s a Life Member of the NRA yet is at a pool where guns and alcohol are mixed .
American Legion / VFW frown on garments made from US flag .
Origins : It ’s
an unfortunate aspect of modern life that just about any woman who enters the public sphere at a national level
is presumed to have posed for risqué photographs ( anything from cheesecake shots to nude pictures ) at some point in her past , and that ( whether she has or not ) examples of such photos will inevitably be fabricated and put on public display .
Alaska governor Sarah Palin quickly became the object of such attention when Senator John McCain selected her as his running mate for the 2008 presidential election .
The image displayed above , of a bikini - wearing , rifle - toting Sarah Palin , began circulating on the Internet within days of the announcement that she had been tapped for the vice - presidential spot on the 2008 Republican ticket .
It ’s purely a digital manipulation , however , created by pasting an image of her head onto this original photo ( of a bikini - clad woman holding a BB gun , not a rifle ) :
Another widely circulated photograph was this putative pose of Sarah Palin in a short skirt and high heels ( which was also fashioned as a Playboy magazine cover ) :
It , too , was a fake , one similarly created by clipping the head of Sarah Palin from the photograph below and pasting it onto someone else ’s body shot :
Likewise , much attention was paid to a supposed nude shot of a much younger Sarah Palin , seen at the bottom center of this Chinese newspaper article :
This picture was a double fake .
It ’s not a photograph of Sarah Palin ; it ’s an image that has long been circulated as a picture of Seinfeld actress Julia
Louis - Dreyfuss .
Even that attribution is wrong ,
however , as the picture was fabricated by pasting the actress ’ face onto someone else ’s body .

The United States Senate has voted to approve legislation containing a one - year extension of the wind energy Production Tax Credit ( PTC ) through December 31 , 2009 .
The bill , H.R. 6049 , also contained an extension of the Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) for solar , and would create a new ITC for purchases of small wind systems used to power homes , farms and small businesses .
After failing to pass the extensions 8 times so far this year , the bill was approved by an overwhelming 93 to 2 majority .
The only two Senators voting against the extensions were Republicans Crapo ( ID ) and Kyle ( AZ ) .
Five Senators did not vote on the issue , and Republican presidential hopeful John McCain made his record on the issue a stunning 0 - for - 9 this year alone , answering the question many had whether he would finally show up to vote on this critical energy policy issue .
In all fairness to Senator McCain , both Senators Obama and Biden also recorded an absent vote .
One can only assume that Biden and Obama ( and perhaps McCain ) were tipped - off by their colleagues that the vote would be a landslide and chose not to come to Washington for the vote .
The cynic in me says that the only reason it passed this time is because we are so close to the election , and failing to pass the legislation is not a black mark that Senators want on their record in this critical campaign season , where the Democrats are poised to get a veto - proof majority of more than 60 Democratic Senators .
Next , the bill must be approved by the full House of Representatives in a vote later this week .

Iceland has nationalised its biggest bank , Kaupthing , and suspended trade on its stock exchange in an attempt to prevent further panic in the country .
Kaupthing is the third bank to be rescued by Iceland 's government .
The OMX Nordic Exchange Iceland is closed for trading for two days because of " unusual market conditions " and will reopen on Monday .
Meanwhile , Iceland 's Prime Minister Geir Haarde criticised the UK 's move to freeze Icelandic bank assets .
Mr Haarde said the UK used anti-terrorism legislation to freeze assets in Landsbanki in order to protect UK savings in one of its units , Icesave .
" We do not consider this to be a particularly friendly act .
But we understand that the UK authorities need to act in the interests of their citizens , " he said .
Over the past years , Iceland has pursued a policy of inflation targeting , similar to the UK ..
In the case of Iceland it was disastrous .

Brown : Iceland 's actions illegal Analysis : What happened to Iceland ?
Councils ' not reckless with cash '
Icelandic compensation to start Prime Minister Gordon Brown has condemned Iceland 's handling of the collapse of its banks and its failure to guarantee British savers ' deposits .
Mr Brown said it was " effectively illegal " and " completely unacceptable " .
Unusual conditions Mr Haarde said Iceland had not decided whether to seek help from the International Monetary Fund to weather the crisis .
The country 's Financial Supervisory Authority said it took over Kaupthing to safeguard its domestic banking system .
All domestic deposits at the bank were fully guaranteed , it added .
On Wednesday , the UK Treasury arranged for ING Direct to take over the £ 2.5 bn of deposits of 160,000 UK customers of Kaupthing 's online arm , Kaupthing Edge .
The Swedish central bank had already agreed to provide a loan to the bank 's Swedish arm .
Iceland 's government has now seized control of all three of the nation 's major banks .
Landsbanki and Glitnir were taken over earlier this week .
The country of just 300,000 people has struggled to cope with the global financial crisis .
" The action taken ... was a necessary first step in achieving the objectives of the Icelandic government and parliament to ensure the continued orderly operation of domestic banking and the safety of domestic deposits , " Iceland 's Financial Supervisory Authority said .

What are these ?
It was n't the trash - talking you see before a football game , but Sarah Palin showed some spunk today at a rally in Ohio .
With a new poll showing Barack Obama the decisive winner in the first presidential debate , all eyes are on Thursday night 's vice presidential debate .
Let 's just move forward
After a week that provided plenty of fodder for Saturday Night Live material , the Republican nominee for vice president was a crowd pleaser today and seemed eager to talk about the upcoming debate .
" I guess it 's my turn now , " she said .
" And I do look forward to Thursday night . "
" I 'm looking forward to meeting him , " she continued .
" I 've never met him .
I 've been hearing about his Senate speeches since I was in , like , the second grade . "
Lower expectations ?
She did the pre-debate spin , too , as in lowering expectations ( although many GOP strategists have said after last week it's impossible to lower expectations any further ) .
“ I have to admit though , he is a great debater and looks pretty doggone confident like he 's sure he 's gonna win , but then again , this is the same Senator Biden who said the other day that the University of Delaware would trounce the Ohio State Buckeyes .
Wrong ! ”
Palin was referring to a comment Biden made a couple weeks ago when speaking to the University of Delaware football team .
Holding a football , Biden announced , " I told the folks in Ohio that we ’d kick Ohio State ’s ass ! "
They tried , but the McCain team could never get any traction on Biden 's prediction .
It was just Biden being Biden .
He says stuff like that .
Real Palin
Palin says stuff , too , like " doggone " and " awesome . "
And she calls her husband the " First Dude . "
That 's the Sarah Palin who can get John McCain elected , say some conservatives .
Let her be herself .
Knock off the spin .
Let her get mad , they say , and fight her own fight .
Get real , Sarah !
New York Times columnist Bill Kristol amplified this call for a " real " Sarah Palin today , writing , " McCain picked Sarah Palin in part because she 's a talented politician and communicator .
He needs to free her to use her political talents and to communicate in her own voice . "
Kristol said McCain was reportedly unhappy with his staff's " handling of Palin , " sending campaign honchos Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis to Ohio to " liberate Palin to go on the offensive as a combative conservative . "
I told you so
This is n't a new call .
US News and World Report 's John Farrell said the same thing nearly two weeks ago .
" The worst thing the McCain folks could do is wreck Palin 's confidence , " he wrote .
" She needs to be herself — and on her game — in the upcoming vice - presidential debate , not cowed and uncertain and brutalized by weeks of cramming and prep sessions . "
With only three nights to go before the biggest moment yet in Palin 's political life , Farrell could say , " I told you so . "
Ignore her
Democratic strategist Chris Lehane told The Vote that Biden needs to look past Palin and focus his efforts on communicating with the American people who will be tuning in on Thursday night .
" His goal is to ignore Palin and focus on connecting with voters sitting in their living rooms by making clear he is indeed one of them - an uncommon , common man , " Lehane said .
What about his reputation as gaffe - prone ?
A fumble is OK -- its only the context that matters said Lehane .
" He can discuss campaign ads or whether or not conducted his fire side chats by radio or tv , but so long as the gaffes do not make the Democratic ticket look patronizing , elitist or arrogant than any such gaffes will have the lasting impact of cotton candy , " he said .
Django FormWizard - Passing Data Between Forms
I recently had the need for a multi-step web form and so I wanted to give the Django FormWizard a spin because I have n't had a chance to use it yet .
The FormWizard documentation is lacking a little and it makes no mention of the support for passing an initial value for each form " step " to the Wizard .
Passing an initial value is done by passing a dictionary , containing dictionaries , where the keys are the individual form step sequences .
For example , the first form will have a key of 0 ( zero ) , the second form will have a key of 1 , etc .
Here is an example urls .
py ...
# Import forms and custom wizard
from yourproject.yourapp.forms import * init = {
0 : {
' field1 ' : ' value1 ' ,
' field2 ' : ' value2 ' ,
} ,
1 : {
' field3 ' : ' value3 ' ,
' field4 ' : ' value4 ' ,
}
} # In your urlpatterns ...
url ( r ' ^wizard / $ ' , BusinessWizard ( [ Form1 , Form2 ] , initial=init ) ,
This will create an instance of the BusinessWizard FormWizard ( assuming that 's the name of your Wizard ) and it will have 2 steps , processing Form1 and Form2 .
When the wizard is processing the form it will pass the dictionary in key 0 to Form1 as it's initial value and it will iterate with each step .
So what happens if you need data from Form1 to be available in a field in Form2 as the initial value ?
Well there is no built in way to do this but the good folks over at Django decided to give us a nice helper method that is called from the __call__ method of the FormWizard class .
This helper method is called parse_params and it can be used to help us pass data to the next form by manipulating the FormWizard. initial dictionary .
One thing to note is that parse_params will be called when the form is being displayed and " written to " ( via form POST ) .
You need to check for the step PRIOR to the step where you want the data to be passed .
If the request method is POST , then you can call the form and check for validation .
If valid , you can assign the initial value for the next form based on the cleaned_data dictionary of the current form .
So in my case , I needed the form on step 1 ( which is the second form , remember the counter starts at zero ) to receive data from step 0 .
Here 's an example ...
from django.contrib.formtools.wizard import FormWizard class BusinessWizard ( FormWizard ) :
def parse_params ( self , request , * args , ** kwargs ) :
current_step = self.determine_step( request , *args , ** kwargs )
if request . method == ' POST ' and current_step == 0 :
form = self.get_form( current_step , request .
POST )
if form.is_valid( ) :
self.initial [( current_step + 1 ) ] = {
' name ' : form.cleaned_data[ ' name ' ] ,
' address ' : form.cleaned_data[ ' address ' ] ,
' city ' : form.cleaned_data[ ' city ' ] ,
} def done ( self , request , form_list ) :
# Your form processing code goes here
When the second form is displayed it will have the initial value assigned in the parse_params method .
I can't think of many situations where you would want to do this but they do pop up occasionally .
If you are curious about the FormWizard class check the source code out .
It 's a small class and very easy to follow .
Note :
This might not be the " best " way to do this .
The process_step method may also be a good place for this type of operation but it was called twice , conditionally , in the __call__ method so it just felt " right " to use parse_params .
First the back story :
I 've been told by two sources that [ local businessman and political contributor Nasser ]
Kazeminy has in the past covered the bills for Coleman 's lavish clothing purchases at Nieman Marcus in Minneapolis .
The sources were not certain of the dates of the purchases ; if they were made before Coleman joined the Senate in 2003 , he obviously would not be required to report it under senate rules .
But having a private businessman pay for your clothing is never a good idea if you 're a public official ( Coleman was mayor of St. Paul from 1994 to 2002 ) .
When pressed by reporters Wednesday on whether or not Coleman , in fact , accepted these suits from Kazeminy , spokesman Cullen Sheehan repeats the phrase " the Senator has reported every gift he has ever received " no fewer than nine times .
HuffPo has the excruciating transcript .
Ouch .
Is n't it really a simple " yes or no ? " question ?
No wonder Coleman is running around blaming the evil bloggers and canceling press conferences .
Also remember that Coleman was busted earlier for getting a sweetheart rental deal on his pad down in DC .
Does the guy pay for anything ?
The best news , of course , is that this all helps Al Franken , who has drawn the Minnesota Senate race to a dead - heat .
Go show him some love if you can spare it .
Politicians were busy in Washington , and on Wall Street , things were anything but calm .
Friday in New York began with a now - familiar feeling : dire expectations of what the opening bell would bring after stocks in Asia and Europe plummeted by as much as 10 percent .
Scott Black , president of Delphi Management in Boston , said he had taken to waking up at 3 a.m. to check on foreign markets .
When he arose before dawn on Friday , he was distressed .
“ I am worried , ” he said .
“ I have a fiduciary responsibility to my clients . ”
At the open , the Dow Jones industrial average quickly sank nearly 700 points .
But suddenly , shares of struggling financial companies surged , the Dow regained all of its losses in less than half an hour , and a cheer went up on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange .
By about 10:20 , stocks had started to slide again , and President Bush tried to soothe frayed nerves with an appearance at the White House .
“ This is an anxious time , ” he said .
“ But the American people can be confident in our economic future .
We know what the problems are .
We have the tools to fix them .
And we ’re working swiftly to do so . ”
If traders were paying attention to the president , it did not show .
Over the course of several hours , stocks ground down , with the Dow losing more than 600 points and again falling below the 8,000 mark .
In the afternoon , an investor walked into a Kansas office of the mutual fund company American Century Investments .
The woman , who is two years from retirement , was worried about her small business account .
She brought her unopened statement to John Leis , a director of personal financial solutions at the company .
“ She did n’t have the guts to open it even though she had conservative investments , ” Mr. Leis said .
“ She asked me , ‘ How bad is it going to be ? ’ ” The client was fortunate : her investments , in mostly government - backed bonds , were up 6 percent for the year .
But Mr. Leis said the concern about her investments symbolized the fear among many everyday Americans who are watching the financial markets with trepidation .

Authorities have found the industrial chemical melamine in baby formula made by 22 producers , suggesting China 's problems with tainted baby formula extend far beyond the single company implicated to date .
The Chinese government early Wednesday increased its estimate of the number of babies sickened by the tainted formula to 6,244 , including 158 who have acute kidney failure .
The Ministry of Health also reported a third infant death in the widening scandal , which has again highlighted China 's weak control over food ...
Banksy graffiti of giant machine gun-toting rat DOUBLES the value of a derelict pub
A bizarre bidding frenzy has broken out over a derelict pub ... because it is adorned with Britain 's most valuable piece of Banksy graffiti .
The Whitehouse pub is on the market for just £ 495,000 , but art experts say the huge image of a rat holding a machine gun that covers the building could be worth £ 1 million .
Despite the housing market slump , with average prices in Liverpool falling by 16 per cent , estate agents Sutton Kersh have been inundated with offers above the asking price .
But the majority of bids have been from canny investors wanting to buy the graffiti at a bargain basement price .
Valuable :
The giant rat was commissioned from the secretive artist in 2004 as part of a Liverpool - wide art festival
Bristol - born Banksy daubed the giant masterpiece on the Georgian building in Berry Street as part of Liverpool 's Biennial art programme in 2004 .
The then relatively underground artist spent a week on Merseyside , painting various buildings with his tag , before he found world - wide fame with his politically charged images .
As an official commission the work is a rarity for Banksy who has stopped authenticating his work to discourage dealers from cashing in .
Banksy has now conquered the art world , selling his unique pieces for millions , and counts Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie among his fans .
Urban art specialists Purple Revolver , who have campaigned for the giant Banksy to be preserved , said it would easily fetch more than £ 1 million at auction .
Director Amber Tan said : ' This is Britain 's biggest Banksy , painted while he was still relatively unknown and the value reflects its size .
' As a graffiti artist , Banksy has gained international acclaim for his works , many of which now command millions at auction .
' The asking price for the pub makes it a bargain and it would n't be a surprise if it fetched three times that .
' The buyer will effectively be getting a giant Banksy free with the pub .
' There is no reason why the graffiti could not be worked into any future renovation scheme , as it is a major tourist attraction . '
A spokesman for Liverpool - based estate agents Sutton Kersh said : " We have been inundated with offers for the building .
' The pub is a Grade II listed building and we 're selling it as a development opportunity .
' We are aware that the Banksy was commissioned to paint it in 2004 and many of offers since it went on the market have been from art dealers . '
Updated : The
Federal Highway Administration
reported yesterday that travel during August 2008 on all roads and streets in the U.S. fell by - 5.6 % compared to August last year .
According to Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters , this was the largest ever year - to - year decline recorded in a single month .
YTD through August 2008 fell by - 3.3 % compared to 2007 .
The ten consecutive monthly declines ( November 2007 through August 2008 ) in miles driven compared to the same month in the previous year is almost a record , and represents one of the most significant adjustments to driving behavior in recent history .
On a moving 12 - month total basis , traffic volume in August fell to 4.5 - year low of 2.929 trillion miles , the lowest level since March of 2004 ( see chart above ) , and this measure has fallen in ten of the last 12 months .
Bottom Line :
The moving 12 - month total traffic volume in August 2008 ( 2.929 trillion ) is below the August 2007 level ( 3.008 trillion ) by 78.911 billion annual miles driven .
At an average fuel efficiency of 20 m.p.g. , and an average gas price of $ 3 per gallon over the last year , that reduction in miles driven represents almost a $ 12 billion annual savings for American consumers .
That 's in addition to the much larger $ 200 billion annual savings for consumers from the drop in gas prices from $ 4.12 per gallon to $ 2.71 since August ( August marks the tenth consecutive month of traffic volume decline compared to the same month in the previous year .

It will be interesting to see how the significant fall in gas prices in September and October 2008 affects driving behavior , and we 'll know in about a month from the next FHA report on September 2008 traffic volume .
Noise pollution causes sleep disturbance , raises blood pressure and can lead to heart disease .
Rebecca
Hardy on how to survive in an increasingly noisy Britain
John Stewart was living in south London six years ago when two things happened that seriously affected his health .
" First the flight paths were changed so planes passed over my flat every 90 seconds .
Then a nearby laundry centralised all its activities into one site , so the noise of the machines permeated the whole block .
They were going all day and during the night , " he says .
" I had to have the radio and TV on , even if I did n't want to , just so I did n't have to hear the outside noise .
My sleep became interrupted and I ended up getting heart palpitations .
My doctor said my blood pressure was too high , he was very worried about my heart , and I needed to take some serious action to reduce the stress before it killed me . "
After Stewart moved house , he slowly got better .
There is growing evidence that noise - related stress is a significant public health hazard .
According to a report from the World Health Organisation , unwanted noise is causing hearing impairment including tinnitus , disturbing our sleep and triggering stress hormones which could in turn affect the immune system and metabolism .
It also makes us feel helpless and more aggressive and increases the chances of having a heart attack or stroke , accounting for an estimated 3 % of ischeamic heart disease ( the most common cause of death in the EU ) in Europe .
" There is increasing evidence that air and road traffic noise might be related to high blood pressure , " says Stephen Stansfeld , professor of psychiatry at Barts and the London School of Medicine .
" Exposure in school to aircraft noise is also linked to reading impairment in children . "
Another study , by Cornell University in New York , found that workers in an open - plan office with constant exposure to hubbub from machinery , telephones and office chatter had higher levels of adrenaline in their urine than workers in a quiet , self - contained work station .
The open - plan group were also less effective at puzzle solving than the quiet group , who slept better , had better digestion , and were less irritable .
" When people get annoyed by noise they get stressed , " says Stewart , who went on to set up the National Noise Association pressure group .
" Constant exposure to even moderate levels of noise can be harmful .
One Austrian study showed that children living on a main road had shorter concentration spans than those who did n't . "
Small wonder then that noise is slowly inching up the political agenda .
Last year , EU law required all European cities with populations of more than 250,000 to produce digitised noise maps .
" People think that we should ' live and let live ' and only old people complain about noise , " says Richard Tur , one of a growing number of anti-noise activists and founder of the US organisation NoiseOFF .
" But we need to change our perception of what noise actually is - unwanted sound which can be physically harmful . "
The big offenders , says Stewart , are loud music , aircraft and traffic , and the problem seems to be getting worse .
One report from Sheffield Hallam University showed that some parts of Sheffield were up to 10 times noisier than 10 years previously while the UK Office of National Statistics suggests that noise complaints have increased fivefold in the past 20 years .
Short of joining the half a million people who moved home in 2006 to escape a distressing din , here 's our guide to surviving noisy Britain .
Take control
Not feeling in control of a situation significantly increases stress .
Stansfeld says it is important to take action such as complaining about the noise .
Change your perception
A study funded by the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs found that CBT ( cognitive behavioural therapy ) and hypnotherapy helped reduce stress in those disturbed by low - frequency noise such as the low rumble of distant traffic , or the hum from an electric generator .
" CBT is partly about enabling people to control the thing that is bugging them , rather than it controlling them , " says noise and vibration consultant Dr Geoff Leventhall , who conducted the study .
" Try the following exercise : Visualise the noise as a big black ball .
Move it around , nearer , further away , or change its colour and size if you want , and explode it .
The point is to take control of whatever is worrying you . "
Trying to change your perception of the situation is particularly helpful if the culprit is moderate noise which does n't distress others ( 20 - 30 % of the UK population are thought to be particularly noise - sensitive ) .
" The meaning of noise is very important , " says Stansfeld .
" If you are lonely then hearing other people 's parties can be upsetting .
Airbases that emphasise their positive benefits to the local community are more warmly received than those that do n't . "
To take part in the second stage of the study , go to copingwithnoise.org .
Focus on ' flow ' activities
Doing things that are so enjoyable and absorbing that we lose sense of time may also distract from moderate noise .
" A difficult crossword , perhaps , a favourite hobby , or reading or watching something gripping , " suggests Stewart .
Learn relaxation techniques
" Anything that relaxes you will also help , " says Leventhall , who recommends this meditative technique : " Sit in a comfortable chair and repeat ' peace ' or ' one ' , for example , with each exhalation , for 10 or 20 minutes every day .
The body responds with a dramatic decrease in heart rate , breathing rate , blood pressure ( if elevated to begin with ) , and metabolic rate - the exact opposite of the fight - or - flight response . "
Block it out
" For noisy streets , try thermal double glazing " , says John Hinton , president of the Institute of Acoustics , or try secondary glazing , adding an extra window pane four inches or so inside the existing double - glazed window .
" Reduce aircraft noise by increasing the sound insulation of the loft , and put up fencing to reduce traffic noise . "
And noisy neighbours ?
" Increase the mass of the dividing wall or the floor by adding another layer of plasterboard , " says Hinton .
Push for " low - noise road surfaces " from local authorities and fit ' low - noise tyres " to cars .
Soft foam earplugs marginally reduce noise ( the equivalent of standing in the next room ) and office din can be neutralised with noise - maskers such as ChatterBlocker software ( chatterblocker.com ) .
Or if your computer is the culprit , try quietpc.com .
Other noise - busting tips can be found at noiseoff.org .
Protect yourself
Not all noise - related health risks come from other people .
DIY , concerts , clubs and listening to iPods are common causes of ear damage such as tinnitus , says David Baguley , director of audiology at Cambridge University Hospitals .
Party animals should protect their ears by not mixing music with intoxication ( " smoking and drinking both affect the protective mechanism of the inner ear , " says Baguley ) , wearing Etymotic earplugs at gigs ( " they reduce sound but keep music exciting " ) and taking 10 minutes out of every hour exposed to loud music .
" Ditch the earphones that come with iPods , " he adds , " and invest in noise - cancelling headphones . "
These muffle unwanted noise so you can enjoy music at lower volumes .
Finally , for noisy DIY , use ear - defenders ( acoustic ear muffs ) .
Spend time in quiet places
Finally , buck the trend of the 22 % of all Londoners who , according to one poll , had not experienced silence in over six months .
" There is evidence to show that finding peace and quiet can help people physically , emotionally and mentally , " says Stewart .

The galaxy cluster 1E 0657 - 56 ( known as the Bullet Cluster ) lies 3.8 billion light - years away .
It 's one of hundreds that appear to be carried along by a mysterious cosmic flow .
As if the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy were n't vexingenough , another baffling cosmic puzzle has been discovered .
Patches of matter in the universe seem to be moving at veryhigh speeds and in a uniform direction that can't be explained by any of theknown gravitational forces in the observable universe .
Astronomers are callingthe phenomenon " dark flow . "
The stuff that 's pulling this matter must be outsidethe observable universe , researchers conclude .
When scientists talk about the observableuniverse , they do n't just mean as far out as the eye , or even the mostpowerful telescope , can see .
In fact there 's a fundamental limit to how much ofthe universe we could ever observe , no matter how advanced our visualinstruments .
The universe is thought to have formed about 13.7 billion yearsago .
So even if light started travelling toward us immediately after the Big Bang , the farthest it could ever get is 13.7 billion light - years in distance .
Theremay be parts of the universe that are farther away ( we can't know how big thewhole universe is ) , but we can't see farther than light could travel over theentire age of the universe .
Mysterious motions
Scientists discovered the flow by studying some of thelargest structures in the cosmos : giantclusters of galaxies .
These clusters are conglomerations of about athousand galaxies , as well as very hot gas which emits X - rays .
By observing theinteraction of the X - rays with the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) , which isleftover radiation from the Big Bang , scientists can study the movement ofclusters .
The X - rays scatter photons in the CMB , shifting itstemperature in an effect known as the kinematic Sunyaev - Zel ' dovich ( SZ ) effect .
This effect had not been observed as a result of galaxy clusters before , but ateam of researchers led by Alexander Kashlinsky , an astrophysicist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , found it when they studied a huge catalogue of700 clusters , reaching out up to 6 billion light - years , or half the universeaway .
They compared this catalogue to the mapof the CMB taken by NASA 's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) satellite .
They discovered that the clusters were moving nearly 2 million mph ( 3.2 million kph ) toward a region in the sky between theconstellations of Centaurus and Vela .
This motion is different from the outwardexpansion of the universe ( which is accelerated by the force called darkenergy ) .
" We found a very significant velocity , and furthermore , this velocity does not decrease with distance , as far as we can measure , " Kashlinsky told SPACE.com .
" The matter in the observable universejust cannot produce the flow we measure . "
Inflationary bubble
The scientists deduced that whatever is driving themovements of the clusters must lie beyond the known universe .
A theory called inflation posits that the universe we see isjust a small bubble of space - time that got rapidly expanded after the Big Bang .
There could be other parts of the cosmos beyond this bubble that we cannot see .
In these regions , space - time might be very different , andlikely doesn?t contain stars and galaxies ( which only formed because of theparticular density pattern of mass in our bubble ) .
It could include giant , massive structures much larger than anything in our own observable universe .
These structures are what researchers suspect are tugging on the galaxyclusters , causing the dark flow .
" The structures responsible for this motion have beenpushed so far away by inflation , I would guesstimate they may be hundreds ofbillions of light years away , that we cannot see even with the deepesttelescopes because the light emitted there could not have reached us in the ageof the universe , " Kashlinsky said in a telephone interview .
" Mostlikely to create such a coherent flow they would have to be some very strangestructures , maybe some warped space time .
But this is just purespeculation . "
Surprising find
Though inflation theory forecasts many odd facets of thedistant universe , not many scientists predicted the dark flow .
" It was greatly surprising to us and I suspect toeveryone else , " Kashlinsky said .
" For some particular models ofinflation you would expect these kinds of structures , and there were somesuggestions in the literature that were not taken seriously I think untilnow . "
The discovery could help scientists probe what happened tothe universe beforeinflation , and what 's going on in those inaccessible realms we cannot see .
The researchers detail their findings in the Oct. 20 issueof the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , waves at the airport after a campaign event in Green Bay , Wis. , Monday , Sept. 22 , 2008 .
WASHINGTON — Democraticpresidential candidate Barack Obama is urging Congress to take several steps toensure the United States can continue to access the international space stationbeyond 2011 .
Inletters addressed to House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and SenateMajority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) and posted on his Senate Web site Sept. 22 , Obama urges the two congressional leaders to renew anexisting waiver to the Iran - North Korea - Syria Non-proliferation Act ( INSKNA ) to permit NASA to continue buying the Russian Soyuz vehicles it needsto transport U.S. , Canadian , European and Japanese astronauts to and from thestation .
NASA 's current waiver , enacted in 2005 , expires at the end of 2011 .
NASAAdministrator Mike Griffin told reporters Sept. 18 that without swiftaction on the waiver request , NASA might not be able to send its astronauts tothe station on a Soyuz flight slated to launch in October 2011 since the agencywould have no way to guarantee their return .
Griffin said Russia needs a three - year lead time to produce a Soyuz .
Obama , echoing a plea Republican presidential candidate John McCain made to PresidentGeorge W. Bush inan Aug. 25 letter , also calls for NASA to " take no further action thatwould make it more difficult or expensive to fly the Shuttle beyond 2010 . "
Obamaalso urges Congress to give NASA additional funding in 2009 for the additionalshuttle flight House and Senate authorizers want to see NASA conduct in orderto launch the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer to the international space station .
Obamasaid Congress needs to be prepared to further increase NASA 's budget dependingon what emerges from a shuttleextension study recently initiated at Griffin 's request .
" Theresults should be available in the November timeframe so that the President - elect 's transition team can prepare appropriate action along withappropriate [ fiscal year 2010 ] budgeting , " Obama wrote .
" NASA ' sappropriators , however , should be prepared to consider increasing NASA 's budgetto extend safe Shuttle operations beyond 2010 and to accelerate government andprivate - sector efforts to provide human access to low - earth orbit .
Any effortto extendthe Shuttle program must receive adequate funding , ensuring that progresson developing new vehicles is not further delayed by diverting funds to the Shuttle . "
TheSenate Foreign Relations Committee is slated to take up the INKSNA waiver ? formally known as S. 3103 , the International Space Station Payments Act of2008 , during a Sept. 23 working session .
The standard unit measurement for mass weight of feces , as noted on the 2007 South Park episode " More Crap " .
The European Fecal Standards & Measurements Board in Zürich keeps track of the authenticity of its records .
It is mentioned in the episode that " one Katie Couric is about two and a half pounds of excrement " .
The original record was set in 1960 at 7.5 Courics .
It was revealed in October 2007 that the record excrement is in fact Bono of U2 fame , which had grown to 80 Courics .
This explains why Bono seems so great , yet is still a piece of shit .
That same day , American Randy Marsh set the new record at 100 Courics .
The record still stands .

US President George W Bush has expressed " deep concerns " over China 's human rights record in a speech on the eve of the Beijing Olympics .
" The US believes the people of China deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings , " he said in the Thai capital , Bangkok .
He praised China 's economy but said only respect for human rights would let it realise its full potential .
But China rejected the US president 's comments .
" The Chinese government puts people first , and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens ' basic rights and freedom , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said .
" We firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries ' internal affairs , using human rights and religion and other issues . "
' Firm opposition '
Mr Bush has been criticised by some campaigners for going to the Games .
He flew to Beijing following the speech in Bangkok , a stop on his final trip to Asia before he leaves office in January .
The wide - ranging address , which included criticism of the regime in Burma , was more nuanced than Mr Bush 's past speeches on China , the BBC's Jonathan Head reports from Bangkok .
It is unlikely to cause much offence in China , our correspondent says , and many people will see it more as a valedictory speech for Mr Bush 's record in Asia rather than an outline of future US policy .
Mr Bush said he was optimistic about China 's future and said change in China would arrive " on its own terms " .
Young people who grow up with the freedom to trade goods will ultimately demand the freedom to trade ideas ...
George W Bush
US president
But his criticisms of China 's human rights record were clear .
" America stands in firm opposition to China 's detention of political dissidents , human rights advocates and religious activists , " he said .
When it was controversially awarded the games in 2001 by the International Olympic Committee , Beijing promised to make improvements in human rights , media freedoms and the provision of health and education .
But campaigners , such as Amnesty International , say Chinese activists have been jailed , people made homeless , journalists detained and websites blocked , while there has been increased use of labour camps and prison beatings .
In March , China suppressed violent anti-government protests in Tibet .
Beijing said rioters killed at least 19 people , but Tibetan exiles said security forces killed dozens of protesters in the worst unrest in Tibet for 20 years .
The Dalai Lama , Tibet 's exiled Buddhist leader , rejected Beijing 's claims he was behind the riots and said he expressed good wishes for the success of Games .
On Thursday , at least 1,500 Buddhists were holding a protest in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu against what they called China 's violation of religious freedom in Tibet .
Correspondents say there have been scuffles with police .
In Beijing , police dragged away three US Christians who tried to demonstrate on Tiananmen Square in support of religious freedom .
Four pro-Tibet activists from Britain and the US were arrested and held briefly in the city on Wednesday after a protest close to the Olympic stadium .
Burma refugees
In his address , Mr Bush said the US recognised that the growth sparked by China 's free market reforms was " good for the Chinese people " and the country 's ' purchasing power was " good for the world " .
On foreign policy , he commended China 's " critical leadership role " in the negotiations to end North Korea 's nuclear weapons programme , and the " constructive relationship " between Beijing and Washington over Taiwan .
He also called for an end to what he described as tyranny in Thailand 's neighbour , Burma .
Friday 's Olympic opening ceremony coincides with the 20th anniversary of a democracy uprising in Burma , which was crushed by the military .
First lady Laura Bush flew to the Thai - Burmese border to spend the day at the Mae La refugee camp where about 35,000 refugees live , having fled their homes .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The dollar tumbled Monday as investors appeared to have second thoughts about the government 's proposed $ 700 billion bailout plan aimed at stabilizing the nation 's financial system .
The 15 - nation euro fetched $ 1.4770 in afternoon trading , up sharply from $ 1.4492 late Friday .
Great Britain 's pound jumped to to $ 1.8572 from $ 1.8365 , and the dollar fell to ¥ 105.80 Japanese yen from ¥ 107.22 .
Monday 's decline marked the steepest one - day drop in the dollar against the euro since the euro - zone currency was formed in 1999 .
" Dollar selling intensified across the board as the post - bailout hysteria subsided and questions remain on the details about which banks and credit institutions will be eligible for the purchase of bad debt and the ban on short selling , " wrote CMC Markets currency analyst Ashraf Laidi in a note to investors .
The dollar 's slide comes as the government plans a massive intervention in the nation 's financial markets .
The Treasury Department announced plans late Thursday to use tax dollars to buy soured mortgage - related assets from Wall Street investment firms in an attempt to get the nation 's economy back on track .
News of the government 's rescue sparked a rally on Wall Street Friday , with the Dow rising 370 points .
But stocks slumped Monday as investors awaited further details on the bailout plan and eyed a staggering rise in the price of oil .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson urged Congress last week to approve the rescue plan as soon as this week .
But Democratic lawmakers have expressed some misgivings about the proposal in its current form .
Senate Democrats circulated an alternative plan Monday that would require the government to receive an ownership stake in the companies it helps .
Democrats have also called for the plan to include caps on executive pay and possibly additional economic stimulus measures .
Meanwhile , oil surged more than $ 25 a barrel at one point Monday , the sharpest one - day increase on record , to trade above $ 130 a barrel before pulling back and settling at $ 120.92 .
The late day rally came as the current October futures contract is set to expire and a smattering of global supply disruptions put the oil market on edge .
The dollar 's decline also fueled the run-up in oil prices .
Crude futures are traded in dollars and a softer greenback makes oil a bargain for overseas investors .
" Oil prices are driving everything , " said Tom Benfer , vice president of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal in New York .
The market is questioning what effect the bailout plan will have , but the price of oil has re-emerged as the main factor in the dollar 's weakness , Benfer said .
" When oil shoots up , that depresses the dollar , " he said .

Girl , 19 , tortured for 13 hours after being wrongly accused of stealing phone
A 19 - year - old girl was tortured for 13 hours by two women after she was wrongly accused of stealing a mobile phone .
Katie McNamara was lured to a house by her former friend Francesca Raby , 18 , before her marathon ordeal took place .
During the horrific attack , Raby and her friend Kelly Louise Garrity , 26 , punched , burned , kicked and stabbed McNamara before locking her in a cupboard .
The two women hacked off McNamara 's long black hair and forced her to lick her own blood off the floor .
Horrific : A bruised and burned Katie McNamara lies in a hospital bed after the attack
Katie 's swollen body was covered with bruises after her marathon ordeal at the hands of her tormentors
After Raby and Garrity were sentenced for assault and false imprisonment , McNamara , now 20 , spoke of her horrific attack .
She said : ' I thought I was going to die .
They were going to keep me another night if the neighbour had not turned up .
' I kept asking them to stop but they carried on , laughing at me .
I was really scared when they were stamping on my head .
I could n't escape - they had locked the front door and there were two of them , I had no chance .
' They cut my hair and then put my face into a mirror and said " you do n't look so pretty now " .
Maybe they were jealous of my looks .
I will never forgive them for what they did . '
Katie 's injuries were so severe her mother Denise did n't even recognise her in the hospital bed .
' Inexplicable ' : Francesca Raby ( L ) and Kelly Louise Garrity ( R ) have been found guilty of assault and false imprisonment
Sentencing the two women at Minshull Street Crown Court , Judge Jonathan Geake said : ' That night , possibly affected by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol , you allowed your darker sides to get the better of you in a most bizarre way .
It was quite inexplicable . '
Garrity was sentenced to four years in prison and Raby 40 months in a young offenders ' institution after both pleading guilty .
McNamara originally fell out with Raby after the latter had accused her of stealing her mobile phone in November .
Later that day , Raby phoned her up apologising and asked her to come to an address in Farnworth , Bolton .
' Scarred for life ' : Katie McNamara outside court with her mother Denise
After she arrived at the house with another friend , the two women pulled her by the hair into the kitchen and started kicking and beating her .
McNamara 's friend attempted to intervene , but was threatened and told to leave .
She was then taken by taxi to a second house , where two men joined in the attack .
During the attack , McNamara lost conscious repeatedly .
As well as being punched , kicked and stamped on , she was burned with cigarettes and Garrity threw a kitchen knife at her .
A female neighbour visited the house the following morning , where Garrity and Raby showed what they had done to McNamara .
They told the woman they would kill her if she told police .
After being hospitalised , McNamara spent four months receiving treatment as an outpatient .
Her hearing has been permanently damaged .

Ed Harrison of Credit Writedowns alerted us to the impact on collateralized debt obligations , which have been crowded out of the headlines as a source of worry by other credit market train wrecks , like the failure of Libor to show much movement despite heroic central bank interventions .
Note that the Iceland - related damage applies to a subset of CDOs , the the so - called synthetic CDOs .
Synthetic CDOs bundled cashflows from premium payments on credit default swaps and then tranched them , like CDOs that ( more conventionally ) held tranches from other securitizations , such as pieces of subprime securitizations ( they also could hold whole loans , but they tended to be a small part of the mix )
Even in this sector , there was a great deal of heterogeniety in the structures and underlying assets .
Many were called “ trades ” and never intended to be resold .
Many had also had tremendous embedded leverage , This hit mainly the lower tranches , but even with the top tranche , if you crossed a magic threshold in loss expectations , you often see very sudden , dramatic decay in value .

Rastafarians have always regarded Ethiopia as the promised land , but Italy could rank a close second after its Supreme Court ruled that smoking or possessing cannabis is not a criminal offence but a religious act when the person doing it is a Rastafarian .
Last year , the same court declared that cultivating even a single cannabis plant was a punishable offence .
But now Italy 's Court of Cassation has said Rastafarians use marijuana " not only as a medical but also as a meditative herb .
And , as such [ it is ] a possible bearer of the psychophysical state to contemplation and prayer " .
Release , the London - based drugs information service , said that the ruling was a European first .

The case was brought by a man in his forties from Perugia who was sentenced to 16 months in jail plus a € 4,000 ( £ 3,000 ) fine in 2004 for possession of 97g of marijuana .
The Supreme Court said the court of first appeal had failed to consider that the man , a Rastafarian , smoked marijuana according to the precepts of his religion , which , the judges said , permits the smoking of 10g per day .
Rastafarians smoke the drug , said the court , " with the memory and in the belief that the sacred plant grew on the tomb of King Solomon " .
The government is livid .
The judgment " shatters the laws which forbid and proscribe penal sanctions for " the use of illegal drugs , an Interior Ministry spokesman said .
Right - wing politicians were scathing .
Senator Maurizio Gasparri said : " Today we learn a Rasta is free to go around with drugs .
If somebody belonged to a religion which permitted them to eat their children , would they give them the go - ahead , too ? "
But the verdict was received with joy at Rototom Sunsplash , Europe 's biggest festival of reggae music , near Udine , in north - east Italy .
" Finally the principle of religious pluralism is beginning to make headway , " Filippo Giunta , president of the festival , said .
" This judgment ... underlines again the difference between this substance and so - called ' hard ' drugs , alcohol included . "
Thank you for being patient .

Barack Obama ’s September 9th trip to Lebanon , Virginia , in the southwestern hill country , came at a moment of deep unease among Democrats .
John McCain ’s selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate , eleven days earlier , had yielded rich results , in Republican enthusiasm and in polling numbers .
Several polls showed McCain pulling ahead of Obama , and some Democrats worried that Obama ’s slogan of “ Change ” was a frail substitute for an emphatic message spelling out just what change he hoped to bring about .
It seemed that the Obama camp had been knocked off balance by the Palin factor .
Some Democrats feared that Obama himself — cool , cerebral , aloof — was a problem , reflected by the campaign ’s apparent inability to counter McCain ’s bold communications strategy effectively .
Most disturbing , polling revealed that voters were increasingly inclined to trust McCain on the economy — an issue on which the Democrat should have the advantage .
If Obama was feeling deflated , he did not show it when he bounded onto the stage that afternoon in the Lebanon High School gymnasium .
The crowd of about two thousand had been warmed up by Cecil Roberts , the fire - breathing president of the United Mine Workers of America ( who offered the observation , which was making the rounds that week , that “ Jesus was a community organizer ” ) .
Obama , shedding his suit jacket and rolling up his shirtsleeves , worked the crowd hard for more than an hour .
He joked about the hubbub surrounding McCain ’s choice of running mate ( “ I ’ve been to forty - nine states now .
The only one I have n’t been to is Alaska , and I realize now that maybe I should have gone up there ” ) , and then began a performance that was as populist in theme and as personal in style as a Harvard lawyer could credibly deliver .
He portrayed an America that had lost its dream , becoming a nation whose people stood in unemployment lines as their homes were being foreclosed on .
He decried C.E.O.s who “ give themselves million - dollar bonuses , even as they ’re closing down a plant . ”
And he portrayed John McCain as being hopelessly out of touch .
“ I do n’t think John McCain is a bad man , ” Obama said .
“ I just think that he does n’t get it .
I just think that he does n’t understand what the American people are going through right now . ”
Obama attacked Republicans for their trickle - down economic theories , and McCain for buying into them .
“ They call it the ownership society in Washington , ” he said .
“ What they really mean is , You ’re on your own .
Your plant closes up and you lose your job , you ’re on your own .
You ’re sailing along , trying to look after your kids , if you want to go back to college , you ’re on your own .
You ’re a poor kid , lift yourself up by your bootstraps , you ’re on your own .
. . .
Now , I guess if you think that somebody making four million dollars is still middle class , maybe you think it ’s worked .
But if you ’re like an ordinary person , making thirty or forty or fifty thousand dollars , then you realize how tough things are .
And that ’s why I ’m running for President , because that ’s what I come from , that ’s where I ’ve been . ”
Obama spoke of his mother , a single mom who “ had to take out food stamps a couple of times , just to make sure we had enough to eat . ”
He wondered why “ Iraq has a seventy - nine - billion - dollar surplus that they ’ve parked in banks in New York , drawin ’ interest ” while Americans were wanting .
“ That is gonna change under an Obama Administration , ” he vowed , to loud cheers .
“ I want to spend that money right here in the United States . ’’
In a nod to local values , Obama declared , “ I ’m a Christian and I believe deeply in my faith , ” and he volunteered the information that he was no gun grabber .
“ I just want to be absolutely clear , all right ?
So I do n’t want any misunderstanding , so that when we all go home and you ’re talking to your buddies , and they say , ‘ Aw , he wants to take my gun away , ’ you heard it here .
. . . I believe in the Second Amendment .
I believe in people ’s lawful right to bear arms .
I will not take your shotgun away from you .
I will not take your rifle away .
I wo n’t take your handgun away . ”
Obama said he was for “ common - sense gun-safety laws , ” and repeated again , “ I am not gonna take your guns away .
So , if you wanna find an excuse not to vote for me , do n’t use that one , because that just ai n’t true .
It just ai n’t true ! ”
In all , it was an inspired performance , which concluded to cascading cheers .
But it was for a largely partisan crowd , which had come to the event already convinced , and it was hard to guess how it would play outside that gym .
Although the regional media outlets gave the event a lot of coverage , it turned out that Obama ’s Virginia début as a rousing populist was hardly noticed nationally , having been overwhelmed by the kind of controversy that has come to characterize this campaign .
During his talk , Obama had slipped into a colloquial style ( not his strength ) , and at one point he decided to drive home a point with a down - home aphorism .
The McCain - Palin claim as change agents , he said , was false .
“ You can put lipstick on a pig , ” Obama said , to the delight of the crowd .
“ It ’s still a pig . ”
When Obama finally secured Hillary Clinton ’s capitulation in the Democratic primary race , in June , the first place he took his campaign was Bristol , Virginia , also in the state ’s far southwestern corner .
Although Virginia likes to be known as the Mother of Presidents , having produced eight , for generations the Old Dominion has been so reliably Republican in Presidential general elections that its vote was scarcely worth contesting .
Except for 1964 , when the Texan Lyndon Johnson prevailed , Virginia has not voted Democratic since 1948 , resisting even the Democrats ’ all - Bubba ticket in 1992 and 1996 .
This year , after Obama and Clinton emerged from the February 5th Super Tuesday vote virtually deadlocked , Obama went on to sweep the “ Potomac primaries ” ( Virginia , Maryland , and Washington , D.C. ) the following week .
In Virginia , he far surpassed expectations , taking ten of the state ’s eleven congressional districts , and beating Clinton over all by a twenty - nine - point margin .
That showing aroused Democratic hopes that Virginia might finally back a Democratic Presidential nominee in the general election .
The state would be a prize , delivering more electoral votes ( thirteen ) than all but eleven other states .
As Washington ’s expanding suburbs have reached farther into farmland and horse country , accommodating a well - educated workforce of government and tech - industry employees , northern Virginia has grown bluer and more politically influential .
Virginia has elected successive Democratic governors , and in 2006 the Democrat Jim Webb unseated the formidable Senator George Allen , who was considered a favorite among potential Republican Presidential contenders .
So tempting is Virginia to Obama that he seriously considered both Webb and Governor Tim Kaine as his running mate ; another Virginia Democrat , the former governor Mark Warner , would likely have made the list as well , but for his campaign ( in which he is heavily favored ) to win the Senate seat of the Republican John Warner , who is retiring .
Virginia Democrats knew , however , that , impressive as Obama ’s primary victory was , the most notable result from that day ’s voting might have come in the only district he lost — the Virginia ninth , which includes Lebanon .
The rout there — by thirty - two points — had troubling implications for Obama ’s chances in Virginia as a whole , and beyond .
The southwestern region , rising from the Roanoke Valley up to the Appalachian Plateau , is a place of small farms , coal mines , and chronic economic hard times .
It was settled in the eighteenth century by Scots - Irish Calvinists who fled Anglican - dominated Ulster and , eventually , came to that portion of Virginia which the planter aristocracy did n’t want .
Their descendants live in small hill towns that are nearer , in mileage and in spirit , to the old factory town of Ironton , Ohio , than to the glass office towers of northern Virginia .
Three weeks after the Virginia primary , the mostly white , working - class voters of southern Ohio , a significant portion of them of Scots - Irish descent , helped deliver that state to Hillary Clinton .
In the next weeks , their kin did the same in Pennsylvania , West Virginia , Indiana , and Kentucky .
It became clear that if Obama hoped to win in November he would probably have to overcome his Appalachia problem .
In May , Tim Kaine , Obama ’s national co-chairman , wrote a memorandum to the candidate , urging him not to write off southwestern Virginia ; if the region votes against Obama in the general election by the same margins it did in the Democratic primary , John McCain will almost certainly win the state .
“ I said , first , do n’t assume that Hillary Clinton really racking up a margin there means that you ’re just not going to do well , ” Kaine told me recently .
Kaine explained to Obama that the hill people were skeptics , but could be convinced .
“ Presence really matters , ” Kaine says he told Obama .
“ They ’re not used to seeing somebody come by and ask for their vote in a Presidential campaign .
And my thought was ,
If you go , and show ’em that you ’re really interested , and they get a chance to see you more up close and personal than in a TV ad , a little bit of presence might go a long way in that part of the state . ”
After Obama ’s appearance , I left Lebanon and drove into the Shenandoah Valley , to Roanoke , for a visit with a man who has made a profession of selling Democrats to rural Virginians .
David ( Mudcat ) Saunders has been called the Democrats ’ “ Bubba coordinator , ” the embodiment of the Party ’s faint but growing recognition that its alienation of rural white men is both unnecessary and costly .
Saunders , who is fifty - nine , is an exaggerated version of an élitist liberal ’s caricature of a Southern redneck .
His face fixed in a wicked grin , he happily proclaims his love for Jesus and guns , college football and bluegrass music , and the Democratic Party .
He smokes Camels , and is prolifically profane .
Saunders is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans , and can provide details of his great - grandfather ’s wounding at the Battle of Seven Pines , in Henrico County , while serving in General James L. Kemper ’s brigade .
He sleeps under a Rebel - flag quilt , and when challenged on such matters he has invited his inquisitors to “ kiss my Rebel ass ” — his way of making the point that when Democrats are drawn into culture battles by prissy liberal sensitivities they usually lose the larger war .
In 2006 , Saunders served as a personal adviser to Jim Webb in his Senate run against the incumbent ( and former governor ) George Allen .
Social conservatives had put on the ballot a measure banning gay marriage , a familiar ploy intended to drive up Republican turnout .
When a coalition opposing the measure asked Saunders to volunteer for its side , he said that he would do so if the coalition agreed not to censor his message to the press .
It agreed .
“ In my first interview , I said , This has nothing to do with queers getting married , this has to do with politics , ” Saunders recalled .
“ This has to do with drivin ’ up George Allen ’s numbers .
It has to do with dividing God ’s children .
The one thing people better understand is God loves every queer every bit as much as he loves any Republican .
It ’s about individual rights . ”
The gay - marriage ban passed , but its opponents won more than forty per cent of the vote — a victory in the margins — and Webb won his seat .
Mike Murphy , a Republican strategist who has worked for McCain , has called Saunders ’s approach “ one - third true , two - thirds hokum , ” but Saunders ’s methods have proven merit .
In 2001 , in his first full - time foray into politics , Saunders worked on the Democratic gubernatorial campaign of Mark Warner , who had an uphill climb in rural Virginia .
Warner , who was born in Indiana and reared in Connecticut and Illinois , was a cellular - telephone mogul based in northern Virginia , and , therefore , culturally suspect in the southwest .
At the time , Republicans held the statehouse and the governor ’s chair , but Virginia was stuck in a budget crisis .
Saunders believed that if Warner could break through the cultural barriers rural Virginians would respond favorably to his message of competent governance .
Warner made dozens of visits to the region , and Saunders worked out a deal that put Warner ’s name on a truck running on the Nascar circuit .
One morning in the shower , Saunders decided that Warner needed a bluegrass campaign jingle .
He composed lyrics on the spot , and put them to the tune of the Dillards ’ song “ Dooley ” :
Mark Warner is ready
To lead our Commonwealth .
He ’ll work for mountain people And economic health !
Get ready to shout it From the coal mines to the stills Here comes Mark Warner —
The hero of the hills !
The jingle became a small sensation during the campaign , and Warner won fifty - two per cent of the vote in the southwestern district .
In office , Warner repaid the region by persuading two high - tech companies to move to Lebanon , and fought to get Virginia Tech — Virginia Polytechnic Institute , in the Blue Ridge town of Blacksburg — into the Atlantic Coast Conference .
“ Mark Warner has become part of the culture , ” Saunders says .
“ We accept him as part of who we are , if for no other reason — God damn , he got V.P.I. into the A.C.C.!
I mean , it ’s a big damned deal . ”
Saunders worked as a senior strategist in John Edwards ’s Presidential campaign , and is now following Obama ’s with a critical eye .
He worries that Obama seems too professorial , too detached , to make headway with rural voters .
‘‘ I never thought I would see Hillary Clinton being defined as pro-gun and anti-trade , and a black guy being considered an élitist down here . ”
“ God damn it , Kimball — for us , Main Street is Wall Street . ”

Obama ’s “ Change ” message , Saunders argues , is too abstract , too vague , for the region .
“ Those people you were with today were screwed by the English in Scotland and Ireland way before they came over here and started getting screwed , ” he said .
“ They ’ve been screwed since the dawn of time .
And you know what ?
You ai n’t gonna do anything with them , talkin’ about change .
You know why ?
We ’re all changed out .
That ’s all you ever hear , every election .
Somebody ’s gonna change some shit .
Nothin ’ ever changes .
We get fucked . ”
Saunders was eager to hear about the distinctly populist message Obama had delivered in Lebanon , but when I mentioned the “ lipstick on a pig ” line he stopped grinning .
“ That quote might come back to burn his ass up , ” Saunders mused .
“ Using the word ‘ pig ’ . . . ”
If John Edwards were the nominee , he would certainly be pounding home the greed message .
That message , Saunders said , “ would be beatin ’ the hell outta John McCain right now . ”
He went on , “ And the reason is , is because John said , Enforce the antitrust laws that have decimated us .
He said we ’re gonna make the playing field level , that the American workers are the most productive workers in the world still — let ’s put ’em back to work .
We ’ve traded local economies for Wall Street dividends .
That ’s all that ’s happened .
Since the dawn of time , the big sons of bitches kicked the little sons of bitches ’ ass .
And that ’s what ’s happenin ’ now .
I mean , it ’s a time to fight .
I mean , anybody who does n’t think we have a problem with economic disparity , it ’s the worst it ’s been since the eighteen - eighties .
And the redistribution - of - the - wealth argument ?
I love it when a Republican says to me , ‘ The Democrats wanna redistribute the wealth . ’
Well , there ’s been a redistribution of wealth — but it ’s the other fuckin’ way ! ”
Trinary Computer Systems
Ever wonder how a computer based on three logic levels , instead of two ( binary ) would operate ?
Busted .
McCain ’s campaign specifically said they ’d stop appearances , rallies , and TV advertising .
But they did n’t .
Liars .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain vowed Wednesday to suspend his campaign to focus on the nation ’s financial crisis , but there were plenty of signs of activity on Thursday — including an apparently live fundraising link on the campaign ’s Web site .
On Wednesday , McCain said : “ Tomorrow morning , I will suspend my campaign and return to Washington after speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative .
I have spoken to Senator Obama and informed him of my decision and have asked him to join me . ”
He offered no details , but senior campaign adviser Steve Schmidt later told reporters , “ We ’re just not going to engage right now in the back and forth of the campaign , ” adding that meant appearances , rallies and TV advertising would be canceled .
In an e-mail to reporters , spokesman Brian Rogers added that fundraising would be halted .
McCain appeared that evening in an interview on CBS ’ newscast , but canceled a planned appearance on David Letterman ’s “ Late Show . ”
His vice presidential running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , made a highly visible visit to ground zero in New York on Thursday morning .
McCain spokeswoman Nicole Wallace appeared on NBC ’s “ Today ” show … .
E-mail messages continued to trickle out from the campaign , but at a far slower rate than normal .

From BestLife : “ All over the globe , there are signs that plastic pollution is doing more than blighting the scenery ; it is also making its way into the food chain .
Some of the most obvious victims are the dead seabirds that have been washing ashore in startling numbers , their bodies packed with plastic : things like bottle caps , cigarette lighters , tampon applicators , and colored scraps that , to a foraging bird , resemble baitfish .
( One animal dissected by Dutch researchers contained 1,603 pieces of plastic . )
And the birds are n’t alone .
All sea creatures are threatened by floating plastic , from whales down to zooplankton .
There ’s a basic moral horror in seeing the pictures : a sea turtle with a plastic band strangling its shell into an hourglass shape ; a humpback towing plastic nets that cut into its flesh and make it impossible for the animal to hunt .
More than a million seabirds , 100,000 marine mammals , and countless fish die in the North Pacific each year , either from mistakenly eating this junk or from being ensnared in it and drowning . ”

With the financial crisis weighing on everyone 's minds , many debate whether our government 's economic policies cater to the rich over the poor .
But a new study finds it would be impossible to serve only one socioeconomic group , because people 's preferences tend to be overwhelmingly similar when it comes to how the federal government should spend its money .
" Even if government wanted to respond only to the interests of the rich , it could n't , because the rich and the poor tend to share similar political viewpoints — at least on economic issues , " said North Carolina State University political science researcher Chris Ellis .
Ellis and Joseph Ura , an assistant professor of political science at Texas A&M University , analyzed data from the General Social Survey on public opinion of government spending from 1973 to 2006 .
They found that , overall , the country would sway from being more fiscally conservative to more liberal , but that these trends occurred across all socioeconomics groups .
In general , both rich and poor responded to changes in the nation 's economic health , or the actions of the federal government , in broadly similar ways .
For example , the public 's views of how the federal government should spend money on education , health care and the environment are similar regardless of socioeconomic level .
Social issues , such as abortion , were not considered in the study .
The researchers concluded that the federal government acts on the desires of all income groups either because it can't tell the difference between the preferences of the rich versus the poor , or because politicians wish to serve the public as a whole .
The study was detailed in the Oct. 3 issue of the journal Political Science and Politics .
" This does not mean that the government is actually acting in the best interests of the poor , only that what the poor want is similar to what the rich want in terms of how the government appropriates its funds , " Ellis said .
U2 frontman Bono , who has become an international spokesperson in recent years on global poverty , is astounded by how quickly the U.S. government was willing to part with $ 700 Billion to bail out flatlining investment banking firms .
The singer says he and other advocates have had trouble getting just a fraction of that amount to help end poverty in underdeveloped nations for years .
Bono teamed up with former President Bill Clinton yesterday to ensure that this latest economic crisis in the U.S. does n’t overshadow the ongoing need for global aid .
The U.S. financial crisis making global waves is no excuse for governments and companies to walk away from helping the world ’s poor , former U.S. President Bill Clinton and rocker Bono said on Wednesday .
As Congress debates a White House - proposed $ 700 billion bailout for the worst financial crisis since the Depression of the 1930s , Bono questioned why wealthy countries had not been able to come up with enough aid for the world ’s problems .
“ It is extraordinary to me that you can find $ 700 billion to save Wall Street and the entire G8 ca n’t find $ 25 billion to save 25,000 children who die every day of preventable treatable disease and hunger , ” the U2 lead singer told Clinton ’s fourth annual philanthropic summit in New York .
“ That ’s mad , that is mad . ”
“ This crisis is not an excuse to walk away from the world ’s challenges , but a compelling reason to intensify our efforts to meet them , around the corner and around the world , ” said Clinton , who has focused on humanitarian work since leaving the White House in 2001 .
The Group of Eight wealthy nations vowed in 2005 to raise annual aid levels $ 50 billion by 2010 , $ 25 billion of which was to go to Africa .
But under current spending plans , the G8 will fall $ 40 billion short , according to a June report by the Africa Progress Panel set up to monitor implementation .
“ Bankruptcy is a serious business and we all know people who have lost their jobs , ” Bono said , referring to the bankruptcy declared by Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc .
“ But this is moral bankruptcy . ”
[ From Yahoo News ]
Perhaps someone ( like maybe a certain former president ? ) should have explained to Bono that the reason the U.S. government was so willing to hand over that kind of money to bail out Wall Street is because it ’s not really their money - its the taxpayers who will be footing the bill for this little exercise in corporate welfare .
It ’s easy to give away something that ’s not yours to begin with .
Still , the rocker does have a point - our economic woes are a walk in the park compared to what people in poor and warring parts of Africa go through on a daily basis .
They lack access to some of the most basic human needs and for the most part , nobody cares .
Last week , Newsweek ran a cover story on Sarah Palin with a close - up of Palin on its cover under the headline " She 's one of the folks ( and that 's the problem ) " .
Republican commentators were quick to protest , but their opposition took a novel turn : they objected not to the explicitly editorialising headline , but to what they argued was an implicitly editorialising photograph .
Fox News 's Megyn Kelly complained that it was " ridiculously unfair to her – not the headline , but the photograph " .
The twist was that the photo had not been altered , which , Republican pundits like Andrea Tantaros claimed , was evidence of clear bias on the part of the magazine .
" This cover is a clear slap in the face of Sarah Palin , " she told Kelly .
" Why ?
Because it 's unretouched .
It highlights every imperfection that every human being has .
We 're talking unwanted facial hair , pores , wrinkles . "
And why is a news magazine revealing normal human imperfection suddenly objectionable , rather than , you know , normal and human ?
Because , according to Tantaros , " unlike movie stars and liberal media types , regular ' folks ' have other concerns besides tweezing , waxing , moisturising , exfoliating , detoxifying and pore tightening .
We 're busy . "
You have to admire the sheer effrontery of the proposition that the liberal media has time for grooming but the conservative media does not .
Tantaros 's exhaustive catalogue of cosmetic procedures would seem to belie her protestations – if her appearance had n't already .
This is a woman who is no stranger to the made - up , in every sense of the word .
I was reminded of nothing so much as Claude Rains in Casablanca being shocked – shocked !
– to find a casino at Rick 's at the same moment that the waiter hands him his winnings .
Except that the new twist on the old hypocrisy is that the regular folks who do n't have the time or luxury to spend on superficial appearances are complaining about being confronted with unvarnished reality .
Nothing is so unfair as facts in a world of spin , distortion and brazen misrepresentation .
One of my grandmothers would have called this the chickens coming home to roost – except that she was something of a diehard Republican herself .
My other grandmother , a liberal elite and damn proud of it , would have said they 've been hoist with their own petard .
There 's a reason why children learn through rote : repeat something enough , and it will become a habit of thought , and eventually a mode of perception .
If you become accustomed to shaping reality to suit your own agenda , then actual reality , when it reappears , will come as an unwelcome shock .
And it will always reappear .
Facts do n't go away just because they 're as unwanted as facial hair .
Tantaros is half right , of course : regular folks do n't object to wrinkles , facial hair or pores , and are unlikely to start disparaging Palin because of the empirical evidence of a photograph .
As the article inside the magazine noted , we have far bigger empirical problems with Palin – and her imperfections are far from skin deep .
We have become so accustomed to a world of slant and partiality that Megyn Kelly , looking for reasons to object to the Newsweek cover , explicitly did n't object to the headline , or consider it unfair .
But – unlike the photograph – the headline completely lacked impartiality , announcing its " problem " with Palin from the outset .
As someone who shares that problem , I was n't predisposed to protest .
After reading the actual article — which apparently conservative media types can't be bothered to do , as they 're too busy worrying about appearances —
I am even more disposed to agree with the article 's perspective , and its arguments .
But I am deeply concerned that we 've become so used to living in a " No Fact Zone " , to borrow Stephen Colbert 's phrase , that Kelly , Tantaros , et al could see nothing remarkable in a news magazine 's cover story announcing an interpretive judgment from the outset .
We 've been spun for so long that we can no longer see straight — an undiluted truth , like an untouched photograph , is suspect , dishonest in its honesty , imbalanced by virtue of being insufficiently , or openly , imbalanced .
We recognise distortion only in its absence .
Objectivity has become objectionable , and if it 's unflattering , it must be unfair .
As an accidental expatriate living in Britain for the last decade , I have often been asked why the UK does n't have a version of shows like The Colbert Report , as if its absence reflects a failure of nerve on Britain 's part .
But the answer seems to me obvious : it is because the BBC and the other major British news outlets still exercise the principle of journalistic impartiality , and still believe in that fusty , archaic , elitist thing called truth .
They do n't always achieve it , to be sure , but as far as I can tell America 's stopped trying .
Colbert only makes sense in a mediasphere dominated by the likes of Megyn Kelly , who finds objectivity unfair when it does n't favour her agenda .
Objectivity may be an impossible ideal for humans to achieve , but that it does n't mean it is n't worth striving for .
There 's a reason why we call it the ugly truth .
From over here across the pond , it seems that America has been quite cavalier in its willingness to toss the principles of fact and objectivity aside in favour of a screaming subjectivity that passes for individualism and , God help us , democracy .
As Colbert told President Bush at the 2006 White House Correspondents ' dinner , reality has a well - known liberal bias .
As the world continues to sift through American subprime rubble , several additional shoes are ready to drop : Alt - A mortgages , Prime mortgages , land and construction loans , and ... commercial real estate loans .
Thus far , commercial real estate loans have been ( relatively speaking ) safe .
That happy era may be coming to an end .
Today 's NYT describes a large apartment complex in New York that is about to default on a $ 225 million mortgage payment .
This would be New York 's largest default so far , and as consumer balance sheets continue to deteriorate , there will likely be more to come .
How much of this commercial property loan exposure is out there ?
The NYT estimates more than $ 100 billion , which would be a tiny slice of the $ 500 billion Alt - A and $ 1 trillion subprime markets .
But whatever the exact size , it 's still real money , and the big Wall Street banks are carrying around a boatload of it :
Lehman Brothers : $ 40 billion
Deutsche Bank : $ 25.1 billion
Morgan Stanley : $ 22.1 billion
Citigroup : $ 19.1 billion
Writedowns have trickled in from banks such as Morgan Stanley and Wachovia .
But the collapse in value of this particular asset class has likely only just begun .

Obama : McCain health plan ' radical '
With families increasingly worried about their economic security , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) is opening a major assault on what he charges is a “ radical plan ” by Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) to decentralize health insurance .
Bill Burton , national press secretary of the Obama campaign , charged : “ Millions [ would ] lose the health care that they have . ”
Advertisement
Obama is unveiling his new assault at a rally in Newport News , Va. , this afternoon , and the campaign is following up with TV ads , radio spots , mailers and grass - roots events in battleground states , aides said .
“ What John McCain does n’t tell you is that his plan calls for massive deregulation of the insurance industry that would leave families without the basic protections you rely on , ” Obama says .
“ So here ’s John McCain ’s radical plan in a nutshell :
He taxes health care benefits for the first time in history ; millions lose the health care they have ; millions pay more for the health care they get ; drug and insurance companies continue to profit ; and middle - class families watch the system they rely on begin to unravel before their eyes . ”
Burton told Obama ’s traveling press corps this morning : “ In the next phase on the campaign trail , on TV , in the mail and on the radio , we are going to do two things :
1 ) Educate voters about voters about Senator Obama ’s plan to get all Americans affordable , acceptable health care ; and 2 ) Make sure that voters know what John McCain is n’t telling you about his health care plan .
“ He loves to talk about his tax credit .
But what he does n’t tell you is that he taxes health care benefits for the first time in history .
Millions lose the health care that they have .
And millions more will pay for the health care that they get .
It ’s the same approach President Bush road - tested a few years ago .
But if John McCain were to succeed where George Bush failed , it could have disastrous results . ”
McCain - Palin spokesman Tucker Bounds called the Obama charges a " radical lie " : " Barack Obama is lying to voters .
It ’s a bald faced lie because John McCain will improve the tax code so that middle class paychecks are n’t used to pay government bureaucrats but instead will pay for the access to health care Americans deserve . "
The McCain campaign released a memo from Doug Holtz - Eakin , McCain - Palin Senior Policy Adviser , titled : " The FACTS About The McCain Health Care Plan " : " Transforming The Tax Code To Create Greater Equity :
The McCain plan transforms the current tax code to provide all American families – including the self - employed and the uninsured – the same tax benefit , a $ 5,000 refundable tax credit ( $ 2,500 for individuals ) that was previously only available to those with employer coverage .
Families can use this credit to purchase insurance of their choice , including keeping their current coverage . "
The Obama campaign also posted an 11 - page memo called “ Five Pitfalls of the McCain Health Plan ” : “ [ T ] he McCain health plan represents a continuation of the policies we have seen over the last eight years , policies that have contributed to health premiums more than doubling , 7 million more Americans uninsured , and nearly 2 million more Americans without employer sponsored insurance . "
Obama calls his plan an effort to “ Make Health Insurance Work ” : “ Require insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions so all Americans regardless of their health status or history can get comprehensive benefits at fair and stable premiums .
... Create a new Small Business Health Tax Credit to help small businesses provide affordable health insurance to their employees . ”
Here are the excerpts from Obama ’s prepared remarks for the event in Virginia :
Senator McCain has been eager to share some details of his plan — but not all .
He tells you that he ’ll give you a tax credit of $ 2,500 per person — $ 5,000 per family — to help you pay for your insurance and health care costs .
But like those ads for prescription drugs , you have to read the fine print to learn the rest of the story .
You see , Senator McCain would pay for his plan , in part , by taxing your health care benefits for the first time in history .
And this tax would come out of your paycheck .
But the new tax credit he ’s proposing ?
That would n’t go to you .
It would go directly to your insurance company — not your bank account .
So when you read the fine print , it ’s clear that John McCain is pulling an old Washington bait and switch .
It ’s a shell game .
He gives you a tax credit with one hand — but raises your taxes with the other .
* * * *
And here ’s something else Senator McCain wo n’t tell you .
When he taxes people ’s benefits , many younger , healthier workers will decide that it ’s a better deal to opt out of the insurance they get at work — and instead , go out into the individual market , where they can buy a cheaper plan .
Many employers will be left with an older , sicker pool of workers who they ca n’t afford to cover .
As a result , many employers will drop their health care plans altogether .
And study after study has shown , that under the McCain plan , at least 20 million Americans will lose the insurance they rely on from their workplace .
It ’s the same approach George W. Bush floated a few years ago .
It was dead on arrival in Congress .
But if Senator McCain were to succeed where George Bush failed , it very well could be the beginning of the end of our employer - based health care system .
In fact , some experts have said that that ’s exactly the point of John McCain ’s plan — to drive you out of the insurance you have through your employer — and out into the marketplace , where your family will be given that $ 5,000 tax credit and told to buy insurance on your own .
A $ 5,000 tax credit .
That sounds pretty good .
But what Senator McCain does n’t tell you is that the average cost of a family health care plan these days is more than twice that much — $ 12,680 .
So where would that leave you ?
* * * *
Finally , what John McCain does n’t tell you is that his plan calls for massive deregulation of the insurance industry that would leave families without the basic protections you rely on .
You may have heard about how , in the current issue of a magazine , Senator McCain wrote that we need to open up health care to – and I quote – “ more vigorous nationwide competition as we have done over the last decade in banking . ”
That ’s right , he wants to deregulate the insurance industry just like he fought to deregulate the banking industry .
And we ’ve all seen how well that worked out .
* * * *
So here ’s John McCain ’s radical plan in a nutshell : he taxes health care benefits for the first time in history ; millions lose the health care they have ; millions pay more for the health care they get ; drug and insurance companies continue to profit ; and middle class families watch the system they rely on begin to unravel before their eyes .
Well , I do n’t think that ’s right .
I do n’t think we should settle for health care that works better for drug and insurance companies than it does for hard working Americans .
I do n’t think that ’s the change we need .
We can do better than that .
* * * *
… I reject the tired old debate that says we have to choose between two extremes : government - run health care with higher taxes …or insurance companies without rules denying people coverage .
That ’s a false choice .
It ’s the same distracting rhetoric that ’s kept us gridlocked for decades .
And we know that neither of these approaches is the answer to this problem .
The real solution is to take on drug and insurance companies ; modernize our health care system for the twenty - first century ; reduce costs for families and businesses ; and finally provide affordable , accessible health care for every American .

Since I ’ve dissed patterns and OOP recently ( and rightly so ) I thought I ’d be a little positive and recycle an email I sent a friend a while ago .
This someone was curious about functional languages after I had mentioned them over dinner as he had no experience with them .
I absolutely think that if all you have ever used is an imperative language ( exemplified by C++ , Java , C# and other similar crap ) I highly recommend spending ( at least ) several days learning a functional language .
You ’ll be a better programmer for it .
( And why not learn some logic programming too , while you ’re at it . )
What follows is a somewhat edited version of the 30 - minute stream - of - consciousness crash - course email I sent to my friend .
( So it ’s not the best tutorial in the world , but hopefully it gets someone interested in playing around with a new language . )
Over the years I ’ve played around with a lot of different functional languages ( including Miranda , Standard ML , Haskell , FP , LISP , and Scheme ) .
Here I ’m using Standard ML ( SML ) because it nicely illustrates some of the cool concepts I wanted to outline ( and other than LISP , is the one I know best ) .
Haskell is another good choice for a first functional language and would be worth exploring in addition to SML , notably because Haskell features lazy evaluation ( as well as several other important concepts ) .
To follow along , begin by downloading and installing an SML interpreter .
A smattering of SML
First , some fundamentals .
In SML we bind values to variables using “ val ” and functions to variables using “ fun ” .
- val m = 42 ;
val m = 42 : int
- fun inc x = x + 1 ;
val inc = fn : int -> int
The “ - ” is the prompt , so the rest of the line is what was typed .
Note that as we type a line and hit return , the system interactively responds with a result on the following line .
Note also how SML derives types automatically ( known as type inference ) .
“ 1 ” is an int and “ + ” takes two arguments of the same type ( both ints or both floats ) so “ x ” must be an int and therefore “ inc ” must be a function that takes an int as an argument and returns an int ( “ int -> int ” ) .
The other thing we need to know is that SML natively supports tuples :
- val n = ( 1,2,3 ) ;
val n = ( 1,2,3 ) : int * int * int
Note again how it derives the types , using “ * ” to denote a tuple ( or cartesian product if you prefer ) .
What I want to get to is one of the more powerful concepts of SML : the ability to define recursive data types , by cases .
So , diving right in , let us define a binary tree data structure :
- datatype 'a BinTree = Leaf of 'a | Node of 'a BinTree * 'a * 'a BinTree ;
datatype 'a BinTree = Leaf of 'a | Node of 'a BinTree * 'a * 'a BinTree
This oneliner ( ! ) says that a data type “ BinTree ” that contains elements of type “ ‘ a ” ( a special notation of a polymorph type ; think templated type ) is either ( | ) :
a “ Leaf ” of one element , or
a “ Node ” of a 3 - tuple , where the first value is a BinTree of the same type , the second value is an element of the type , and the third value is a BinTree of the type .
But more than that , we can now also use “ Node ” and “ Leaf ” as constructors to create a tree on the fly :
- val t = Node ( Leaf ( 1 ) , 2 , Node ( Leaf ( 3 ) , 4 , Leaf ( 5 ) ) ) ;
val t = Node ( Leaf 1,2 , Node ( Leaf #, 4 , Leaf # ) ) : int BinTree
Note how the SML interpreter prints the structure for us , but caps it at a certain depth ( showing “ # ” to show it capped it ) .
We can also construct a tree with floats
- val u = Node ( Leaf ( 1.0 ) , 2.0 , Leaf ( 3.0 ) ) ;
val u = Node ( Leaf 1.0,2.0 , Leaf 3.0 ) : real BinTree
which nicely shows how the data type is polymorphic ( “ type abstracted ” ) .
And again it derived the type ( “ real ” as floats are called in SML ) .
We can now e.g. declare a recursive function “ height ” that computes the height of a BinTree using declaration by cases :
- fun height ( Leaf ( x ) ) = 1
| height ( Node ( lft , x , rht ) ) = 1 + Int.max ( height lft , height rht ) ;
val height = fn : 'a BinTree -> int
The first case ( the first line ) is that height is called with an argument that pattern matches “ Leaf ( x ) ” , i.e. something constructed using “ Leaf ” and with a single argument “ x ” .
The second case is that height is called with an argument matching “ Node ( lft , x , rht ) ” where lft , x , rht are arbitrary variable names that will bind to the actual values in the supplied Node argument .
In the first case , we just return 1 ( as a tree with just a leaf has height 1 ) .
In the second case , we recursively compute the heights of the subtrees , take the maximum , and add 1 .
Again the system infers the type , saying height is a function that takes a BinTree of whatever type and returns an int .
We can try height now on “ t ” and “ u ” :
- height t;
val it = 3 : int
- height u ;
val it = 2 : int
SML also has lists built in :
- val r = [ 1,2,3 ] ;
val r = [ 1,2,3 ] : int list
- val s = [ 4 ] ;
val s = [ 4 ] : int list
- r @ s ;
val it = [ 1,2,3,4 ] : int list
The “ @ ” is the built - in append function .
We can now e.g. write a function that takes a BinTree , visits it in depth - first order , and collects all the node values into a list :
- fun values ( Leaf ( x ) ) = [ x ]
| values ( Node ( lft , x , rht ) ) = ( values lft ) @ [ x ] @ ( values rht ) ;
val values = fn : 'a BinTree -> ' a list
( This function usually exists in functional languages , normally known as “ flatten . ” )
And we can use it directly :
- values t;
val it = [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] : int list
Note how if we do n’t bind the value , the system always binds the last result to “ it ” .
We can use “ it ” directly if we want .
Now lets create a function “ sq ” that squares its argument , and we ’ll “ map ” this sq function across every element of the list that is the flattened tree :
- fun sq x = x * x ;
val sq = fn : int -> int
- map sq ( values t ) ;
val it = [ 1,4,9,16,25 ] : int list
“ map ” is a built in function that takes a function ( of type “ ‘ a -> ‘ a ” ) and a list ( of type “ ‘ a ” ) and then applies the function to every element of the list .
It is a very useful function that you can now find in a lot of languages , not just functional languages ( e.g. in Python and several others . )
BTW , we do n’t need to actually bind the function .
We can create the sq function on the fly ( a so - called lambda function ) too , using “ fn ” :
- map ( fn x => x * x ) ( values t ) ;
val it = [ 1,4,9,16,25 ] : int list
And for the last example , SML also handles higher - order functions in the sense we can apply just partial arguments .
To show this , first we define a function in two arguments :
- fun add x y = x + y ;
val add = fn : int -> int -> int
Note how the type is “ int -> int -> int ” which is really saying that we have a function that takes an “ int ” and returns as result a function of type “ int -> int ” !
We can see this is the case by passing only one argument to “ add ” and bind it to the variable “ inc ” :
- val inc = add 1 ;
val inc = fn : int -> int
Lo and behold , inc is a function , of type “ int -> int ” .
We can now use “ inc ” in e.g. the map function we used earlier :
- map inc [ 1,2,3 ] ;
val it = [ 2,3,4 ] : int list
Yup , it works !
To recap , these 4 (! ) lines of code implements a ( templated ) binary tree , declares an instance of a binary tree , and defines a function to compute the height of a binary tree :
datatype 'a BinTree = Leaf of 'a | Node of 'a BinTree * 'a * 'a BinTree ;
val t = Node ( Leaf ( 1 ) , 2 , Node ( Leaf ( 3 ) , 4 , Leaf ( 5 ) ) ) ;
fun height ( Leaf ( x ) ) = 1
| height ( Node ( lft , x , rht ) ) = 1 + Int.max ( height lft , height rht ) ;
How many lines of code do you need in C++ to do the same thing ?!
In SML we can encapsulate the data type and the operations on it , just as is done with classes ( objects ) in object - oriented languages .
In SML , such an encapsulation is called an abstract datatype ( and created with the keyword abstype ) .
I recommend following the link and reading about abstract data types if you are not familiar with them ( and also reading the SML link at the top , to see how they relate to the module concept in SML ) .
OO is not the be -all end - all of encapsulation if you ever thought that .
Edit : Based on a comment that was made ( hi Vesa ) , I should mention that SML in addition has an advanced module system that can be used in preference of abstype .
The point of mentioning abstract data types is that they ’re an important concept ( outside of their use in SML ) , so they are worthy of a study on their own .
In real life
Sadly , most functional languages are not industrial strength , in part because they never received industry financial backing ( like Sun pushing Java , and Microsoft pushing C# ) .
Functional languages in general lack IDEs , debuggers , libraries , and all those other things you need for real development , so the information provided here is mostly for expanding your mind and not for direct practical use .
( Yes I know about F# , which is a commendable effort . )
A notable exception is Erlang , which has been used and developed by the Swedish phone giant Ericsson ( no relation ) for many many years and is known to be very robust .
This comparison between Erlang and Haskell is quite interesting .
Overall , Erlang seems to be an up - and - coming language , which is cool , because we need something to break the dominance of the imperative crowd of languages .
Erlang is also very interesting for its support for concurrency , which is highly relevant to this increasingly parallel world .

Another few posts worth reading about learning more languages are Jim Tilander ’s Are you bilingual and David Pollak ’s Functional languages will rule .
There ’s also several quite good books available for learning more about functional languages ( many free for the download ) :
In a tour de force of office supply physics , researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles , have shown that it is possible to produce X - rays by simply unrolling Scotch tape .
Next step : nuclear fusion .
“ We ’re going to do that , ” said Seth J. Putterman , a professor of physics at U.C.L.A .
“ I think it will work . ”

But first , X - rays .
In the current issue of the journal Nature , Dr. Putterman and his colleagues report that surprisingly fierce flows of electrons were unleashed as the tape was unpeeled and its gooey adhesive snapped free of the surface .
The electrical currents , in turn , generated strong , short bursts of X - rays  each burst , about a billionth of a second long , contained about 300,000 X - ray photons .
Yahoo News is naming 12 members who might switch their vote
The $ 700 billion rescue plan the House defeated Monday would have passed if just 12 more members of the House had voted the other way .
Here ’s a list of a dozen members who voted against the bill — and what it might take to turn their nays into yeas .
Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen ( R - N.J . )
According to one senior GOP aide , Frelinghuysen was a yes but reversed his vote at the last minute .
Afterward , Frelinghuysen called for more hearings and debate on the bill , saying , “ We have not adequately consulted , deliberated and explained this to the American public and our constituents . ”
Rep. Jim Ramstad ( R - Minn . )
A retiring moderate Republican , Ramstad could have voted for the bill without worrying about a voter backlash in November .
But he complained that the rushed debate had left “ the final cost to taxpayers ... uncertain ” and said he would prefer an insurance plan to a bailout .
Rep. John B. Shadegg ( R - Ariz . )
Although John McCain ’s campaign said he was working to rally House GOP support , not a single Republican from McCain ’s home state voted for the bill .
Shadegg wants changes in mark - to - market accounting rules and an increase in Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. limits .
Rep. Steven C. LaTourette ( R - Ohio )
A close friend of House Minority Leader John A. Boehner , LaTourette opposed the package .
Later , LaTourette said in a statement he wants to double the amount of FDIC insurance and allow U.S. companies operating overseas to bring assets back to the United States .
Rep. Doc Hastings ( R- Wash . )
A moderate Republican , Hastings told the Yakima Herald that he was undecided until Sunday night .
In the end , he said he voted no because there were still “ too many concepts ” and not enough details about taxpayer exposure .
Rep. Judy Biggert ( R - Ill . )
Like many other Republicans on the Financial Services Committee , Biggert voted against the bill .
But Biggert has said Congress needs to act , and she has expressed support for some sort of government - backed insurance plan that would allow business , rather than taxpayers , to assume more risk .
Rep. Xavier Becerra ( D - Calif . )
A close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a member of the Democratic leadership , Becerra ultimately voted no because he “ wanted to see direct protections for responsible homeowners ” in the bill .
Rep. David Scott ( D - Ga . )
A member of the Congressional Black Caucus , Scott said after the vote that he could back the plan if 1 percent of the $ 700 billion were set aside in a program to prevent foreclosures .
Rep. Hilda L. Solis ( D - Calif . )
With foreclosures in her district nearly tripling in the past few months , Solis said she opposed the bailout because it “ lacks needed reform of bankruptcy laws ” that may help keep people in their homes .
Rep. Shelley Berkley ( D - Nev. )
While Berkley voted no , aides said she would be inclined to support the bill if it placed “ tougher restrictions on CEO pay . ”
Aides also said she is looking for more specific language on the regulation of Wall Street .
Rep. Bill Delahunt ( D - Mass . )
Another close Pelosi ally , Delahunt said he voted no because the bill would have done too much to help the firms that caused the problem .
Delahunt wants to lessen the burden on taxpayers and has proposed assessing a transaction fee on lenders who turn over bad mortgage securities to the government .
Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin ( D - S.D. )
While a majority of her fellow Blue Dogs voted for the bill , Herseth Sandlin ultimately opposed it because she thought it would give Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson a “ vast amount of power ” without “ effective oversight . ”

My brother visited Argentina a few weeks ago .
He ’s been living in Spain for a few years now .
Within the first week , he go sick , some kind of strong flu , even though climate is n’t that cold and he took care of himself .
Without a doubt he got sick because there are lots of new viruses in my country that ca n’t be found in 1st world countries .
The misery and famine lead us to a situation where , even though you have food , shelter and health care , most of others do n’t , and therefore they get sick and spread the diseases all over the region .
What got me started on this post is the fact that I actually saw this coming , and posted on the subject here at Frugal ’s , months before the new viruses spread over the country and the news started talking about this new , health emergency , which proves that talking , thinking and sharing ideas with like minded people ( you guys ) , does help to see things coming and prepare for them with enough time .
So I started thinking about several issues , what I learned ( either the hard way or thanks to this forum ) after all these years of living in a collapsed country that is trying to get out an economical disaster and everything that comes along with it .
Though my English is limited , I hope I ’m able to transmit the main ideas and concepts , giving you a better image of what you may have to deal with some day , if the economy collapses in your country .
Here is what I have so far :
URBAN OR COUNTRY ?
Someone once asked me how did those that live in the country fare .
If they were better off than city dwellers .
As always there are no simple answers .
Wish I could say country good , city bad , but I can’t , because if I have to be completely honest , and I intend to be so , there are some issues that have to be analyzed , especially security .
Of course that those that live in the country and have some land and animals were better prepared food - wise .
No need to have several acres full of crops .
A few fruit trees , some animals , such as chickens , cows and rabbits , and a small orchard was enough to be light years ahead of those in the cities .
Chickens , eggs and rabbits would provide the proteins , a cow or two for milk and cheese , some vegetables and fruit plants covered the vegetable diet , and some eggs or a rabbit could be traded for flower to make bread and pasta or sugar and salt .
Of course that there are exceptions , for example , some provinces up north have desert climate , and it almost never rains .
It is almost impossible to live of the land , and animals require food and water you have to buy .
Those guys had it bad ; no wonder the northern provinces suffer the most in my country .
Those that live in cities , well they have to manage as they can .
Since food prices went up about 200% - 300 % .
People would cut expenses wherever they could so they could buy food .
Some ate whatever they could ; they hunted birds or ate street dogs and cats , others starved .
When it comes to food , cities suck in a crisis .
It is usually the lack of food or the impossibility to acquire it that starts the rioting and looting when TSHTF .
When it comes to security things get even more complicated .
Forget about shooting those that mean you harm from 300 yards away with your MBR .
Leave that notion to armchair commandos and 12 year old kids that pretend to be grown ups on the internet .
Some facts :
1 ) Those that want to harm you / steal from you do n’t come with a pirate flag waving over their heads .
2 ) Neither do they start shooting at you 200 yards away .
3 ) They wo n’t come riding loud bikes or dressed with their orange , convict just escaped from prison jump suits , so that you can identify them the better .
Nor do they all wear chains around their necks and leather jackets .
If I had a dollar for each time a person that got robbed told me “ They looked like NORMAL people , dressed better than we are ” , honestly , I would have enough money for a nice gun .
There are exceptions , but do n’t expect them to dress like in the movies .
4 ) A man with a wife and two or three kids ca n’t set up a watch .
I do n’t care if you are SEAL , SWAT or John Freaking Rambo , no 6th sense is going to tell you that there is a guy pointing a gun at your back when you are trying to fix the water pump that just broke , or carrying a big heavy bag of dried beans you bought that morning .
The best alarm system anyone can have in a farm are dogs .
But dogs can get killed and poisoned .
A friend of mine had all four dogs poisoned on his farm one night , they all died .
After all these years I learned that even though the person that lives out in the country is safer when it comes to small time robberies , that same person is more exposed to extremely violent home robberies .
Criminals know that they are isolated and their feeling of invulnerability is boosted .
When they assault a country home or farm , they will usually stay there for hours or days torturing the owners .
I heard it all : women and children getting raped , people tied to the beds and tortured with electricity , beatings , burned with acetylene torches .
Big cities are n’t much safer for the survivalist that decides to stay in the city .
He will have to face express kidnappings , robberies , and pretty much risking getting shot for what ’s in his pockets or even his clothes .
So , where to go ?
The concrete jungle is dangerous and so is living away from it all , on your own .
The solution is to stay away from the cities but in groups , either by living in a small town - community or sub division , or if you have friends or family that think as you do , form your own small community .
Some may think that having neighbors within “ shouting ” distance means loosing your privacy and freedom , but it ’s a price that you have to pay if you want to have someone to help you if you ever need it .
To those that believe that they will never need help from anyone because they will always have their rifle at hand , checking the horizon with their scope every five minutes and a first aid kit on their back packs at all times … .
Grow up .
SERVICES
What ever sort of scenario you are dealing with , services are more than likely to either suffer in quality or disappear all together .
Think ahead of time ; analyze possible SHTF scenarios and which service should be affected by it in your area .
Think about the most likely scenario but also think outside the box .
What ’s more likely ?
A tornado ?
But a terrorist attack is n’t as crazy as you though it would be a few years ago , is n’t it ?
Also analyze the consequences of those services going down .
If there is no power then you need to do something about all that meat you have in the fridge , you can dry it or can it .
Think about the supplies you would need for these tasks before you actually need them .
You have a complete guide on how to prepare the meat on you computer … how will you get it out of there if there is no power ?
Print everything that you consider important .
WATER
No one can last too long without water .
The urban survivalist may find that the water is of poor quality , in which case he can make good use of a water filter , or that there is no water available at all .
When this happens , a large city were millions live will run out of bottled water within minutes .
In my case , tap water is n’t very good .
I can see black little particles and some other stuff that looks like dead algae .
Taste is n’t that bad .
Not good but I know that there are parts of the country where it is much worse .
To be honest , a high percentage of the country has no potable water at all .
If you can build a well , do so , set it as your top of the list priority as a survivalist .
Water comes before firearms , medicines and even food .
Save as much water as you can .
Use plastic bottles , refill soda bottles and place them in a cool place , preferably inside a black garbage bag to protect it from sun light .
The water will pick some plastic taste after a few months , but water that tastes a little like plastic is far way better than no water at all .
What ever the kind of SHTF scenario you are dealing with , water will suffer .
In my case the economical crash created problems with the water company , that reduces the maintenance and quality in order to reduce costs and keep their income in spite of the high prices they have to pay for supplies and equipment , most of which comes from abroad , and after the 2001 crash , costs 3 times more .
As always , the little guy gets to pay for it .
Same would go for floods or chemical or biological attacks .
Water requires delicate care and it will suffer when TSHTF in one way or another .
In this case , when you still have tap water , a quality filter is in order , as well as a pump if you can have one .
A manual pump would be ideal as well if possible .
Estimate that you need a approximately a gallon per person per day .
Try to have at least two - four weeks worth of water .
More would be preferable .
POWER
I spent WAY to much time without power for my own taste .
Power has always been a problem in my country , even before the 2001 crisis .
The real problem starts when you spend more than just a few hours without light .
Just after the SHTF in 2001 half the country went without power for 3 days .
Buenos Aires was one big dark grave .
People got caught on elevators , food rots ; hospitals that only had a few hours worth of fuel for their generators ran out of power .
Without power , days get to be a lot shorter .
Once the sun sets there is not much you can do .
I read under candle light and flashlight light and your head starts to hurt after a while .
You can work around the house a little bit but only as long as you do n’t need power tools .
Crime also increases once the lights go out , so whenever you have to go somewhere in a black out , carry the flashlight on one hand and a handgun on the other .
Summarizing , being in a city without light turn to be depressing after a while .
I spent my share of nights , alone , listening to the radio , eating canned food and cleaning my guns under the light of my LED head lamp .
Then I got married , had a son , and found out that when you have loved ones around you black outs are not as bad .
The point is that family helps morale on these situations .
A note on flashlights .
Have two or three head LED lights .
They are not expensive and are worth their weight in gold .
A powerful flashlight is necessary , something like a big Maglite or better yet a SureFire , especially when you have to check your property for intruders .
But for more mundane stuff like preparing food , going to the toilet or doing stuff around the house , the LED headlamp is priceless .
Try washing the dishes on the dark while holding a 60 lumen flashlight on one hand and you ’ll know what I mean .
LEDs also have the advantage of lasting for almost an entire week of continuous use and the light bulb lasts forever .
Rechargeable batteries are a must or else you ’ll end up broke if lights go out often .
Have a healthy amount of spare quality batteries and try to standardize as much as you can .
I have 12 Samsung NM 2500Mh AA and 8 AAA 800 mh for the headlamps .
I use D cell plastic adaptors in order to use AA batteries on my 3 D cell Maglite .
This turned out to work quite well , better than I expected .
I also keep about 2 or 3 packs of regular , Duracell batteries just in case .
These are supposed to expire around 2012 , so I can forget about them until I need them .
Rechargeable NM batteries have the disadvantage of loosing power after a period of time , so keep regular batteries as well and check the rechargeable ones every once in a while .
After all these years of problems with power , what two items I would love to have ?
1 ) The obvious .
A generator .
I carried my fridge food to my parents house way to many times on the past .
Too bad I ca n’t afford one right now .
2 ) A battery charger that has both solar panel and a small crank .
They are not available here .
I saw that they are relatively inexpensive in USA .
Do yourself a favor and get one or two of these .
Even if they do n’t charge as well as regular ones , I ’m sure it will put out enough power to charge batteries for LED lamps at least .
GAS
Gas has decreased in quality as well , there is little gas .
Try to have an electric oven in case you have to do without it .
If both electricity and gas go down , one of those camping stoves can work as well , if you keep a good supply of gas cans .
The ones that work with liquid fuel seem to be better on the long run , since they can use different types of fuel .
You can only store a limited amount of compressed gas and once you ran out of it , you are on your own if stores are closed of they sold them out .
Anyway , a city that goes without gas and light for more than two weeks is a death trap , get out of there before it ’s too late .
A DIFFERENT MENTALITY .
I was watching the People & Art channel with my wife the other night .
It was a show where they film a couple for a given period of time and some people vote on who is the one with the worst habits , the one they find more annoying .
We were in our bed , and this is when I usually fall asleep but since the guy was a firearms police instructor I was interested and managed to stay awake .
At one point the guy ’s wife said that she found annoying that her husband spent 500 dollars a month on beauty products for himself .
500 USD on facial cream , special shampoo and conditioner , as well as having his nails polished !
If you are that guy and happen to be reading this , or if you know him , I ’m sorry , but what an idiot !!
“ 500 USD , that ’s a small generator or a gun and a few boxes of ammo ” I told my wife .
“ That ’s two months worth of food ” she said .
We were each thinking of a practical use for that money , the money this guy was practically throwing away .
Once the SHTF , money is no longer measured in money , but you start seeing it as the necessary goods it can buy .
Stuff like food , medicine , gas , or the private medical service bill .
To me , spending 500 dollars on beauty products , and to make it worse , on a guy ?
That ’s simply not acceptable .
The way I see it , someone with that mentality can’t survive a week without a credit card , no use in even considering a SHTF scenario .
And this guy is a firearms instructor ? … probably the kind of guy that will say that a handgun is only used to fight his way to his rifle … and his facial night cream …
Once you experience the lack of stuff you took for granted , like food , medicines , your set of priorities change all of a sudden .
For example , I had two wisdom tooth removed last year .
On both occasions I was prescribed with antibiotics and strong Ibuprofen for the pain .
I took the antibiotics ( though I did buy two boxes with the same recipe just to keep one box just in case ) but I did n’t use the Ibuprofen , I added it to my pile of medicines .
Why ?
because medicines are not always available and I ’m not sure if they will be available in the future .
Sure , it hurt like hell , but pain alone is n’t going to kill you , so I sucked it up .
Good for building up character if you ask me .
Make sacrifices so as to ensure a better future , that ’s the mentality you should have if you want to be prepared .
There ’s stuff that is “ nice to have ” that has to be sacrificed to get the indispensable stuff .
There ’s stuff that is not “ basic need stuff ” but it ’s also important in one way or another .
My wife goes to the hairdresser once every month or two .
It ’s not life or death , but it does make her feel better and it boosts her morale .
I buy a game for the Xbox or a movie to watch with my wife every once in awhile , just to relax .
7 or 10 dollars a month are not going to burn a hole in my pocket .
Addictions such as alcohol , drugs or even cigarettes should be avoided by the survivalist .
They are bad for your health , cost a lot of money that could be much better spent , and create an addiction to something that may not be available in the future .
Who will have to tolerate your grouchy mood when your brand of smokes is no longer imported after TSHTF ?

PART II
GRAY / BLACK MARKET
Once the SHTF the black / gray market will take no time to appear all around you .
In my country , gray markets were even accepted in the end .
At first it was all about trading skills or craft products for food .
Districts and towns would form their own barter markets , and created their own tickets , similar to money , that was used to trade .
This did n’t last long .
Those tickets were easy to make on your home computer , there was no control and eventually people went back to paper money .
These markets were usually placed on warehouses or empty land , and were managed by some wise guy and a few thugs or hired security .
Anyone can go rent a kiosk inside these markets for about 50 - 100 pesos ( about 20 - 30 dollars ) a day and sell his goods and services .
Peace within these markets is usually respected … lets just say that these managers do n’t call the police if someone tries anything funny , like stealing , fighting or taking advantage of women .
That ’s not good for their business and anyone that tries to mess with their business finds out how much pain the human body can actually experiment or gets a free ticket to meet the Lord .
Sometimes even uniformed cops manage security on these markets , for a small fee of course .
As always , you still have to be careful .
They may still try to pick your pockets or even attack you once you leave the market .
Once you leave the market , you are on your own , as always .
These markets evolved and now a lot of different products are available .
Today I visited my local market , a warehouse that is fairly well set up and cleanly managed .
They had problems for selling stolen merchandise and fake Brand name clothes a few days ago .
What can be found at a local markets ?
Mostly food and clothing .
Some have more variety than others but cheese , canned food , spices , honey , eggs , fruits , vegetables , beer , wine and cured meat are generally available , same as bakery products and pasta .
These are less expensive than those found at supermarkets .
Fresh fish is sometimes available but not always , people do n’t trust much products that need refrigeration , and they get those at supermarkets instead .
Clothes are also popular and you can find copies of brand name clothes , imitations , or even original stolen new clothes , the same goes for shoes and snickers .
Children clothes , underwear , socks , sheets and towels are all very popular .
Some sell toys , but they are always China made , mostly poor quality though there are some few exceptions .
Others sell tools , also made in China can be found as well , but they are of poor quality .
Some offer their services and repair stuff or offer work as handyman .
You would be amazed of the junk that these guys manage to fix : TVs , CD players , Power tools , etc .
They even manage to solder the small integrated circuits boards sometimes .
Give one of these guys a screw driver and a bar of chocolate and he will fix a nuclear submarine .
After food and clothes , the 3rd most popular item has to be CDs and DVDs , movies , music , play station 2 and Xbox games , programs , it all ends up there just one or two days after the official release in USA .
Seems that they have a guy hidden under Bill Gate ’s desk or something .
Anyway , almost everything can be found there , and if you want , you can ask around , talk to the right guy and buy illegal stuff like drugs or black market guns and ammo .
The quality of the drugs is questionable , of course , and a lot of addicts die from the mixtures these guys sell .
Guns are mostly FM High Powers , Surplus 1911s and Colt .45s , Sistemas , and old Colt Detective revolvers in 38 special that found their way from police and military armories into the black market .
Condition is n’t very good but if you have money you ’ll be amazed of what you can end up with .
Everything that is used by the military and police , including SMGs a , Browning 50 BMG Machine guns , and even frag grenades , is available in the black market , if the customer has the amount of money and a little patience , of course .
The big guns may take a while , but the handguns and grenades are readily available .
GOLD !!
Someone hit me in the head please because I messed up about the gold issue .
Everyone wants to buy gold !
“ I buy gold .
Pay cash ” signs are everywhere , even on TV !
I ca n’t believe I ’m that silly !
I just did n’t relate it to what I read here because they deal with junk gold , like jewelry , either stolen or sold because they needed the money , not the gold coins that you guys talk about .
No one pays for the true value of the stuff , so big WARNING !
Sign on people that are buying gold coins .
Since it is impossible to determine the true mineral percentage of gold , small shops and dealers will pay for it as regular jewelry gold .
What I would do if I were you : Besides gold coins , buy a lot of small gold rings and other jewelry .
They should be less expensive than gold coins , and if the SHTF bad , you ’ll not be loosing money , selling premium quality gold coins for the price of junk gold .
If I could travel back in time , I ’d buy a small bag worth of gold rings .
Small time thieves will snatch gold chains right out of your neck and sell them at these small dealers found everywhere .
This is VERY common at train stations , subways and other crowded areas .
So , my advice , if you are preparing for a small economical crisis , gold coins make sense .
You will keep the value of the stuff and be able to sell it for its actual cost to gold dealers or maybe other survivalists that know the true value of the item .
In my case , gold coins would have been an excellent investment , saving me from loosing money when the local economy crashed .
Even though things are bad , I can go to a bank down town and get paid for what a gold coin is truly worth , same goes for pure silver .
But where I live , in my local are small time dealers will only pay you the value of junk gold , no matter what kind of gold you have .
So , I ’d have to say that if TSHTF bad , gold jewelry is a better trade item than gold coins .
Forgive me for not talking about this before , but I did n’t realize this until today , when I visited my local market warehouse and saw a “ Buy Gold ” sign .
PART III : GUNS , AMMO AND OTHER GEAR
After TSHTF in 2001 , only the most narrow minded , brain washed , butterfly IQ level idiots believed that the police would protect them from the crime wave that followed the collapse of our economy .
A lot of people that could have been considered antigun before , ran to the gun shops , seeking advise on how to defend themselves and their families .
They would buy a 38 revolver , a box of ammo , and leave it in the closet , probably believing that it would magically protect them from intruders .
Oh , maybe you do n’t think that firearms are really necessary or your beliefs do not allow you to buy a tool designed to kill people .
So you probably ask yourself , is a gun really necessary when TSHTF ?
Will it truly make a difference ?
Having gone through a shtf scenario myself , total economical collapse in the year 2001 , and still dealing with the consequences , 5 years later , I feel I can answer that question .
YES , you need a gun , pepper spray , a machete , a battle axe , club with a rusty nail sticking out of it , or whatever weapon you can get hold of .
A LOT has been written on survival weapons .
Everyone that is into armed survival has his or her own idea of the ideal gun battery .
Some more oriented to a hunting point of view , others only as self defense means and others consider a little of both , and look for general purpose weapons .
Talking about guns , there is one special subject I want to rectify , and it ’s the point on what ’s the primary weapon for the survivalist , specially a urban survivalist that has to function in a society , yes , even after the SHTF .
The primary defensive weapon for the survivalist is his HANDGUN .
It ’s the weapon that stays with him when he is doing his business around town of working on the field .
The survivalist IS NOT a soldier , even though you are a soldier or you once were the meanest mother on the battle filed , your home town is not a battlefield and it wont be , even if the SHTF .
A LOT of water has to go under the bridge until the situation gets to a point where you can calmly walk down the street with a rifle on your shoulder .
People , if you are interested in real world SHTF situation , and you want to prepared for the real deal , then understand that this is n’t black or white .
You wake up one day and listen on the radio that the economy collapsed and that the stock market closed indefinitely .
What do you do ?
You still have to go to the office / work / whatever .
Kiss the wife good bye and walk to the office with your AR across your back , or across your chest , Israeli style , ready to shoot ?
You wo n’t get far .
Someone will shoot you or throw you in jail , or in a mental institution .
What I ’m trying to explain , is that it ’s ok to prepare for China invading you country , Germans and UN or Martians .
That is the extreme , less likely worst case scenario .
There is an infinity spectrum of gray between the black and white .
White being your average normal day and black being total TEOTWAWKI , lizard men invading the planet .
Rifles do have a place in the survivalist ’s arsenal , and a very important one .
But you have to understand that 90 % of the time , the handgun will be the weapon you have available when you need one .
You ca n’t compare to a trooper in Iraq that has his weapon with him at all times .
I ask you how many soldiers do you know that keep wearing cammo and totting their M4s around town when they return home ?
What works for war does not work for the survivalist , especially the urban survivalist .
Even if you live in a retreat far from town , you have to work , do n’t you ?
Or do you have employees that take care of all your mundane tasks , leaving you all day to keep watch with your rifle ready ?
A soldier is part of a huge machine ; HIS job is to carry that rifle , while others take care of other needs .
A survivalist , one that is not part of a large survivalist group , has no one to cover for him .
When a new guy looks for advice on what to get for defense , some will recommend a rifle or shotgun as a first defensive weapon .
Let ’s say race riots start in this guy ’s city .
He still has to go to work every day .
What is he supposed to do ?
Shove his pump shotgun in his pocket ?
A handgun , even though less powerful , can be used for home defense AND go with you wherever you need to go .
If the place floods , he can still hop into an evacuation boat without leaving his weapon behind .
I ’m sure no rescue team will pick you if you are carrying a long arm .
They ’ll ask you to leave it behind for sure .
What if your government , realizing that TSHTF and that they lost control of the events , bans all firearms indefinitely ?
Do n’t know about you , but if things are that bad , I ’d like to be armed .
You can hide a handgun under a jacket .
You cant hide a long arm under your clothes .
I think it was Clint Smith who said that the handgun is only used to fight his way to his rifle .
Man ! that sounds “ macho ” .
I ’d love to see him walking into Walmart with his tactical M4 , taking the subway , visiting the doctor or going to the bank .
“ Over here Mr. Smith , you can hang you M4 right next to my coat ” I do n’t think so .
Guys , unless you have your own shooting school , you do not get to carry your rifle to work .
OK , now that I got that out of my chest lets look at some options .
Handguns : Revolver or Pistol ?
Pistol ALL THE WAY !
Yes , I saw the video of the guy that accurately emptied his S&W in ½ a second .
I also saw the shooting range and the crowd behind him , watching the event .
Can he shoot and reload that way if he is in his car , driving with one hand and shooting with the other , while a bunch of scum bags in another car are shooting at him ?
Hey , maybe he can .
I know I can ’t .
Can you ?
Generally speaking , the revolver is more difficult to master than the pistol .
The double action is hard and it affects speed and accuracy .
It can be done , but I found that pistols are easier , as did many shooters .
Also , even though they seem to be more simple , revolvers are not as rugged as service pistols , the mechanisms that cycles the cylinder and cocks the hammer is both complicated and fragile compared to auto pistols .
Before anyone starts casting evil voodoo spells at me for insulting their prized S&W or Ruger : I own revolvers and like shooting them , I just do n’t think they are the best option for self defense , and I see that everyone I talk to in my country who is worried about security as I am also chooses pistols .
Quality pistols resist sand , mud and dirt in general better than revolvers , where a small pebble locked in the mechanism may render the revolver inoperable .
I personally had a problem with a new stainless steel Taurus Tracker .357 magnum .
After shooting it a couple of times I reloaded it and shot all 7 rounds as fast as I could and when I tried to empty it , I found that the empties were stuck because they expanded because of the heat .
I had to wait until the gun cooled a little so I could empty the gun .
Stuff like this can get you killed , even more in a 7 round handgun .
I once saw a man walk into a gun store wanting to trade his 357 magnum revolver for a 9 mm high capacity pistol .
He said he was driving when thugs from another car started shooting at him .
He was chased for a few blocks .
He said that he pulled his revolver and started shooting at them , and ran out of ammo real fast .
He wanted more capacity and fast reloading .
I could not agree with him more .
Some will consider this “ Spray and pray ” , thinking that all rounds should hit the target and if some do n’t then it means that you need more time at the range .
Those same people will tell you that they intend to use bolt action rifles as defensive rifles , making each shot count , without ever missing their target , one shot one kill .
I do n’t agree with this .
One shot one kill is ok for snipers , but the survivalist should have other alternatives .
I do n’t see anything wrong with shooting four or five rounds at a chasing car .
If those rounds make them think twice about their intentions , they are rounds well spent in my book , even if they do n’t kill the attacker .
Suppressive fire is possible if you have a high capacity pistol .
I would n’t doubt on using such a tactic if it serves my purposes , or if it buys me time to get out of there .
Also keep in mind that criminals are cowards and therefore attack in groups .
The survivalist should be able to face more than just one attacker .
Getting into a gunfight with two or three armed men while packing a 6 round revolver is rather hard to deal with .
A high capacity pistol can load about 15 or 19 rounds , and that can certainly make a difference in a gunfight where you are outnumbered .
A forensic doctor that used to live in my neighborhood got killed last year .
He was ambushed when he exited a restaurant by 5 or 6 men .
Even though they did kill him he managed to kill 4 of them and severely injure another .
He shot regularly and carried a Glock .40 .
I ’m sure he was lucky but I also think that his choice of weapon was also important in the outcome .
If anyone is wondering , people in my country that are serious about self defense carry Glocks .
Those that do n’t have the money for a Glock carry Bersas , FM High Powers or 1911 surplus .45s .
At first I was n’t sure about the Bersa , but once I tried them I saw that they are very descent guns .
I now own two Bersas and am pleased with they performance .
The caliber choice calls for endless debate and it is not my intention here .
Lets just say that 9 mm , 40S&W and 45ACP are the obvious choices .
40S&W seem to be the most adequate , both in FMJ and HP , while 9 mm lacks some stopping power and hollow points should be used if possible .
Though the 9 mm lacks power compared to the 40S&W , it is more popular world wide , a factor to consider seriously when choosing a handgun for SHTF .
Besides , 9 mm can also be used in a number of carbines and SMG , another important fact to be considered .
SMGs and carbines chambered for 40S&W and .45 ACP are also available , but they at not nearly as popular as those chambered for 9 mm .
Whatever you choose keep 500 or better yet 1000 rounds of quality ammo for your handgun at all times .
100 rounds wo n’t last much if the crisis lasts long .
Also consider that once the balloon goes up , governments tend to restrict guns and ammo .
Rifles
I previously stated that the urban survivalist will be using his handgun 90 % of the time he needs to defend himself and family from attackers .
I did n’t pull this figure out of thin air , it is quite accurate based on what happens here on daily basis , even a little optimistic .
Cold harsh reality has shown us that most attacks occur when entering or exiting your home , when you are more vulnerable .
Almost no one is stupid enough to try to enter a barred house with armed occupants .
Believe me people ; the gene pool will clean itself rather fast once the SHTF .
So , is a rifle necessary ?
Of course it is !
There is still that 10 % , and that 10 % can still ruin your day .
And this percentage sky rockets if you intend to use that same rifle for putting meat on the table .
If you have to settle with just one rifle , go for a semi auto .
Ideally you should have a bolt action one and a semi auto rifle .
A bolt action and a semiautomatic 308 would make a nice combination .
Whatever you choose , try to keep it within military calibers and military weapons if possible .
It may seem that I have something against bolt rifles but I do n’t .
I think they are fantastic weapons , but I think that semi autos are much better fighting weapons .
The idea of “ picking them out ” 300 meters away with your bolt rifle , as they come in a row blowing whistles and firing warning rounds is laughable at best .
Bolt rifles do have advantages over semi autos , accuracy not being the most important one .
Bolt rifles such as Mausers last forever and are harder than rocks , THAT ’S important .
They are simple , easy to repair tools that will serve you ( within their limitations of course ) longer than any other weapon .
For example , the coil spring on my Mauser 1891 safety broke into 3 separate parts , after almost 100 years of faithful service .
I dug into my tool box and found a spring left over from a kitchen shelve door .
I cut it approximately to the length of the previous spring , replaced it and the rifle was fixed .
There are not many weapons that allow this .
And it is a very valuable attribute once the SHTF and spare parts are no longer available .
Stick to common calibers , 223 , 7.62x39 mm , or 7,62x51 ( 308 ) .
223 vs. 308 ?
I ’m not going there .
If you prefer 223 because it has less recoil , it ’s lighter , or you favor the AR rifle go ahead .
If you think that 223 is more powerful than 7,62 sign up to Physics I . Just remember what I said before , a survivalist is not a soldier serving in Iraq , and you do n’t have the entire USMF to back you up .
You are on your own .
You are not going to pin your attackers down with a questionably effective round and wait until someone hits them with artillery .
About ARs …
I would n’t trust my life to a rifle that has more versions than Rocky sequels … the way I see it , it means that the basic design was the problem and there is no solution .
On AK … all has been said .
The most popular rifle on the planet , and popular not because of politics , but because it works .
It also fires an intermediate power , effective round , available world wide .
SKS are also good , but I ’d rather have removable magazines .
Again , do n’t use voodoo on me because I say I would n’t trust my life to a AR .
If you keep your weapon clean , know its limitations and feel comfortable with it , go for it please .
A couple of rounds of 223 will kill anyone just as well .
If you want a rifle that can do a little bit of everything relatively well , do yourself a favor and get either a M1A or a FAL in 7,62 ( 308 ) with a carbine length barrel .
Preferably with a red dot scope and some kind of light mount .
Leave full length barrels to hunters and bench rest shooters .
Do your homework on both guns and you ’ll see what I mean .
Choose 308 not because of the added range you can get out of it , but because of its power at all ranges , choose it because it turns cover into concealment .
Think about all the possible cover material you can find in a city , like cars , trees , low walls and other structures .
The 308 will go right through it , or destroy it after a few rounds .
It ’s a proven cartridge through out the years .
Shotguns .
Shotguns are good general purpose guns .
The main advantage I see is the devastating stopping power and the ability to use special ammo , like slugs and less than lethal ammo .
I ’m not so sure about the role as an “ inside house ” gun .
The muzzle blast is great and quick follow up are not easy , especially when adrenalin is pumping through your system or , even worse , when someone is shooting back at you .
Pistol caliber carbines and SMG .
If possible , I ’d choose a SMG reduced to semi auto ( only if necessary , of course , full auto selector is better if possible ) or other kind of short , small , pistol caliber carbine .
The combination of a 9 mm handgun and a 9 mm carbine or SMG reduced to semi auto or full auto class III has lots of advantages in my book and is a fine combination .
Some think that full auto is a waste of ammo .
I do n’t think so , not if you know how to use your head , and use this feature wisely .
If you can get a short barrel and collapsible stock , you ’ll also have a weapon that can be hidden under a heavy coat .
A red dot scope would enhance accuracy a lot .
The advantage of having the same ammo for long and small arm is not to be taken lightly .
From the logistical , survivalist point of you , this is one big thumbs up !
Think about cowboys and Americans that lived in the west , they also knew the value of using the same ammo for rifle and handgun .
They had single action handguns and lever action handguns chambered for the same ammo , the modern survivalist can have the same ammo for his auto pistol and his sub -rifle as well .
Some think that a pistol caliber long arm is just one big clumsy pistol or a rifle sized gun that delivers pistol power and accuracy .
This is BS .
Anyone that ever fired a pistol caliber rifle or SMG knows that they are much more accurate , hitting torso targets at 100 yards is easy , and a little more if you have a red dot scope .
Also , SMGs can manage hot ammo specially made for such guns , much more powerful than the one for handguns .
Even if you use regular handgun ammo , the added barrel length adds a few extra feet per second making it more powerful .
Just check the information on boy armor .
Body armor that is rated to stop 9 mm , for example , is not rated to stop the same 9 mm ammo out of a SMG or carbine , because the added speed will make that same round penetrate the vest .
Anyway , +P ammo is more than enough power out of a SMG or carbine , you do n’t have to go looking for special SMG ammunition .
If you can get full auto that ’s one nice feature to have , not worth it if you are on a tight budget , but if you can get it , it may come in handy someday .
Full auto SMG are giving police in my country a lot of headaches .
A criminal with little or no training will put 3 or 4 cops armed with pistols and shotguns on their toes , just because of the sheer volume of fire these high capacity 9 mm deliver .
There was this case of a bad guy standing in front of a patrol car full of cops on a red light stop , pulling a 9 mm SMG out of his coat and emptying it on full auto .
The cops did n’t have a chance , he killed them all .
The car looked like Swiss cheese with 40 9 mm holes all over the vehicle .
SOUND SUPPRESSORS
All I ’m going to say on this subject is :
Have one if you can .
That ’s it .
I ’ll leave the rest of it to your imagination , do n’t make me say it .
Today it may seem like a “ nice to have ” feature … after the SHTF , it may be a “ O God I ’ve got to get a suppressor !! ” feature .
I ’d buy a good suppressor instead of a ultra high dollar scope like the SOG .
Buy a good quality scope , but do n’t spend a fortune on it , and use the rest of the money on a suppressor .
If you are serious about preparing for SHTF , you ’ll thank me one day , just trust me on this one .
9 mm and 45 suppress quite well .
Not as well as .22 , but there is much more power on the big bore ammo .
Combined with a full auto SMG , the possibilities are much greater .
Sometimes it ’s just better to go unnoticed , especially in a SHTF crisis .
BODY ARMOR
Dear God !
Buy body armor PLEASE !!
It ’s dirt cheep in USA .
Preferably , get the police concealable kind ( class II )
Then continue to work on it and get class III A military armor and some rifle plates , just as you do when you start buying guns .
You ’ll end up with 2 or 3 sets of armor which are great to have for family members and spares .
Just so you know , I got so desperate about body armor I ordered it from USA through internet ( bulletproofme.com ) , I ended up paying a total of nearly 600 USD for body armor that costs 200 USD in USA .
Buy it while you still can .
When the SHTF you ’ll end up wearing it , believe me .
I do n’t wear mine all day long but I do wear it when I have to go some place dangerous , deal with people I do n’t trust , or when I have to go teach Architecture Representation late at night , and must travel through a much dangerous road at 12 PM .
PART IV
- Interlude - Studying the SHTF at the University : Dark omens .
I forgot it !
Darn , same as the gold stuff but worse , much worse .
I ’ve never been good at remembering some things , like numbers and names of people I meet , I forget those ( instantly ) , they just flee my mind , uneventfully , but I do remember some other things that do n’t seem to be as important .
I do remember living in USA as a kid .
I remember my school , Pierce School , Do n’t remember exactly were it was , because we lived some in Boston , Massachusetts and some in New Hampshire .
I remember my best friend , Freddy , and a girl ( why is there always a girl ?
[ Smile ] ) Samantha , Sam .
She was red haired and tall , I had a picture of her playing together but I lost it .
Some time between the age of 3 and 26 I lost that picture that was so dear to me .
I remember the smell of an orange shaped “ scratch and smell ” sticker my kindergarten teacher stuck in a small book we made once .
But I almost forgot this forever .
This , this was important , a moment where the life we once knew stopped existing , and a group of students , in a class room that looked like and abandoned building , realized it , all 60 of us at the same time .
It ’s 1:06 AM over here .
I just finished showering and my wife and son are asleep .
I was putting shampoo on my hair , thinking about what I wrote today on this post , and remembered the exact moment when I realized along with several other people , not only that TSHTF ( that we all knew ) but that the world we once new no longer existed , and that this was not a hurricane , this was an ice age period , it would n’t just go away .
We understood it the same way a kid understands photosynthesis :
Because a teacher coldly explained it to us , even used graphics .
I slept 5 hours yesterday , 2 hours the day before yesterday .
Saturday night I did n’t sleep at all .
I ’m already used to it .
Deadlines at the University , staying late at night , drawing in CAD 3D , waiting until Renders are ready .
It ’s a competitive world out there , and no one sympathizes with what you are going through , they just want you to perform as expected , and the standard is always high .
It happened 4 years ago , almost a year after the December 2001 crisis .
It was a social studies class and this teacher , do n’t remember if it was a he or a she , was explaining the different kinds of social pyramids .
God !
Now I remember more !
We even had a text book with those darn , cruel pyramids !
The first pyramid explained the basic society .
A pyramid with two horizontal lines , dividing those on top ( high social class ) those in the middle ( middle class ) and the bottom of the pyramid ( the poor , proletarian ) .
The teacher explained that the middle of the pyramid , the middle class , acted as a cushion between the rich and the poor , taking care of the social stress .
The second pyramid had a big middle section , this was the pyramid that represents 1st world countries .
I which the bottom is very thin and arrows show that there is a possibility to go from low to middle class , and from middle to the top of the social pyramid .
Our teacher explained that this was the classic , democratic capitalist society , and that on countries such as Europeans one , socialists , the pyramid was very similar but a little more flat , meaning that here is a big middle section , middle class , and small high and low class .
There is little difference between the three of them .
The third pyramid showed the communist society .
Where arrows from the low and middle class tried to reach the top but they bounced off the line .
A small high society and one big low society , cushioned by a minimal middle class section of pyramid .
Then we turned the page and saw the darned fourth pyramid .
This one had arrows from the middle class dropping to the low , poor class .
“ What is this ? ”
Some of us asked .
The teacher looked at us .
“ This is us ”
“ It ’s the collapsed country , a country that turns into 3rd world country like in pyramid five where there is almost no middle class to speak , one huge low , poor class , and a very small , very rich , top class . ”
“ What are those arrows that go from the middle to the bottom of the pyramid ? ” Someone asked .
You could hear a pin drop .
“ That is middle class turning into poor ” .
I wo n’t lie , no one cried , though people rubbed their faces , held their heads and their breath .
No one cried , but we all knew at that very moment that all we thought , all we took for granted , simply was not going to happen .
“ You see , the income from the middle class is not enough to function as middle class any more .
Some from the top class fall to middle class , but the vast majority of the middle class turns into poor ”
Said the teacher .
I do n’t know how many people in that room suddenly understood that he / she was poor .
The teacher continued “ You see , we have a middle class that suddenly turns to poor , creating a society of basically poor people , there is no more middle class to cushion tensions any more .
Middle class suddenly discovers that they are overqualified for the jobs they can find and have to settle for anything they can obtain , there for unemployment sky rockets , too much to offer , too little demand .
You see they prepare , study for a job they are not going to get .
You kids , you are studying Architecture because you simply wish to do so .
Only 3 or 4 percent of you will actually find a job related to architecture . ”
We all sat there , letting it all sink in .
After a few months , it all proved to be true .
Even the amount of students that dropped out of college increased to at least 50 % .
They either so no point in studying something that would not make much of a difference in their future salaries , had no money to keep themselves in college , or simply had to drop college to work and support their families .
Someone once said , in this forum , that if this had happened in USA , the social unrest would have been much worse , because people from S. America are stronger .
At first , I told him that I did n’t think so , I said that all humans adapt when they have no other choice .
But now that I consider it more , maybe he was right .
Not that S. Americans are stronger , but they are more used to adversities .
Most of us are children from grandparents that escaped civil war , either in Spain or dictators in Italy , our parents survived the dirty war , even more dictators , and therefore their children are of strong character too .
Can USA citizens survive what we survived ?
Of course they can , though I think that there are too many that are not like you , many that do n’t prepare , and take everything for granted .
Those are the ones that will be responsible for the increase in the social unrest once the SHTF , those that were too lazy to take care of themselves before the SHTF , or that had gone soft through out the years , believing that the government will “ take care of them because they pay their taxes ” .
But in the end , they will pull through .
People will adapt , they always do .
You ’d be surprised .
And those that do n’t want to adapt to the new reality they live in , will die young , thus cleaning the gene pool and ensuring the continuity of the specie .
It ’s been this way for thousands of years .
Note : I ’m sorry I took so long to continue this post .
I spent the last few days drawing on the computer , I have to present this sort of thesis for the University , a school project , to a board of 4 teachers in 3 weeks .
CRIME AND INSECURITY
Even though crime has always been an issue in South America , my country was quite the exception .
It was dangerous , yes but nothing like after the 2001 economical crisis .
One used to be able to let kids play on the sidewalk , or walk back home from a party , a few blocks , and be somewhat safe .
This all changed now .
There are no kids playing on the sidewalks anymore .
I should emphasize this a little more .
There are absolutely NO kids playing on the sidewalks at all , at any time of the day .
Maybe a kid rides his bike a few meters on the sidewalk , but always under the supervision of an adult .
A kid riding a bike on his own will get that bike stolen in no time , probably get hurt in the process , therefore no responsible parent leaves a kid alone on the street .
Teenagers present a greater problem .
You ca n’t keep a 15 or 16 year old inside a house all day long , and even though they are big enough to go out on their own , when the sun goes down things get much worse .
This is when parents organize themselves ; either taking them to someone ’s house or to a club and picking them up at a certain time .
Taxis and remises are used sometimes , but there have been lots of cases of girls getting raped , so no parent worth a buck leaves his son or daughter in hands of a stranger .
After years of living like this , almost everyone learned to be careful ; sometimes they had to learn the hard way .
Practically no one leaves a door or window opened or unlocked .
Nor do they hang out in front of the house talking to friends .
A bad guy might just see you there , like a sitting duck , pull a gun on you and take you inside your house .
There are no “ bandit ’s law ” anymore .
One used to hear people talk about “ You should n’t resist a robbery , give them what they want and they ’ll go away ” .
That holds true no more .
These guys are under the influence of drugs , epoxy glue , or just hate your guts so much , because you have a better life than they ever dreamed of , because they were abused since the day they were born , that they will hurt and humiliate you as much as they can .
Letting a criminal inside you house almost guaranties you that he will rape / beat / torture and abuse whoever they find inside .
I personally drew a line a few years ago and decided , after one long , serious conversation with my wife ; that no one would be allowed inside the house , no matter what .
We figured that there are worse things than death .
Having decided that , I make sure I always have a weapon on me .
They ’ll have to pay dearly for my life , plus interests .
By far , the most dangerous moment of the day , is when I ( or my wife ) leave / enter my house .
A solid , secure house cannot be broken in easily , so criminals wait until you are standing on front of the door with the keys on your hand to jump on you .
This is why we are extra alert when approaching our house , look all around us and if we see anything strange , keep walking around the block or keep on driving .
No door is ever opened when there is a strange person around .
Whenever someone knocks on our door ( and we do n’t know him / her ) , they are answered from a second story window .
Criminals sometimes disguise as electric company guys or something like that , saying that they have to fix something .
NO !
If there is something to be fixed they can fix it on the sidewalk .
Anything inside your house is your responsibility and the company is not going to fix it for you .
Either way , it ’s always better to play it safe , Better to be rude than dead .
On the car / driving issue , that calls for an entire post dedicated to SHTF driving .
For now I ’ll just say that windows and doors have to be closed at all times , a weapon must be within arms reach , and that stop signs and traffic lights have a hole new meaning once TSHTF .
If your country ever falls as mine did , you ’ll remember me whenever you see a traffic light .
You never stop at a red lights or stop sign unless there is traffic , especially at night .
At first , police would write you a ticket for not stopping at a red light if they saw you ( another way of saying that they will ask for a bribe if they see you pass a red light ) , but after a few months they realized that nothing could be done , people would rather risk a ticket than risking their lives , so they decided to turn traffic lights to permanent yellow at night , after 8 or 9 PM .
This is , of course , very dangerous .
Night car accidents are both frequent and brutal since sometimes both cars hit each other at full speed .
MissinLink asked some good questions that might interest others as well , and since we are on the security issue , here they are :
quote :
“ Do the invaders of homes in the country just drive up in cars or trucks ?
Do they hide and sneak up ?
How do these home invaders attack a home in the country ?
A similar question could be asked for homes in the city . ”
Sometimes they just drive up to where you are working , if you are far away from the home , but most of the time they sneak up on you .
Criminals are not stupid , and they will spend days checking the place and specially YOUR ROUTINE .
For example , if they see that you lock the gate at night , as most do , they will wait for you behind a tree until you are close .
This is done a lot .
Dogs are the best alarm you can find , and criminals know that .
They will poison them with pills when you go to sleep and attack the place in the middle of the night .
I know of many that had their dogs killed .
If they think that security is tight , they will just hide near the main gate , and wait for you to leave or return .
When you stop at the gate and must get out of the truck to open / close the main gate , they attack .
I ’d say that the most frequent kind of attack is attacking by surprise when you enter / leave your home .
quote : “ Most common times of attack ?
Day night evening morning ?
I understand occur when coming or going from ones home , etc . ”
7 am , 9 am , 1 pm 7 pm , all are common times for attacks .
There is no “ safe ” hour of the day .
Night is particularly dangerous .
Maybe attacks during the day are faster , they want to get some money or jewelry and leave fast , while at night they might stay inside more time , maybe till the next day .
But there are no fixed patterns .
If I could give one advice concerning SHTF security , it would be : Eyes and ears wide open when you enter / leave your home .
If possible , keep a gun on your hand when doing either one .
If something looks , even “ feels strange , then go around the block and check again , carefully .
If you see them still there , either call the police ( if still available ) or get help .
If you approach the house with a large number of people they will leave .
One time , I saw a couple of strange looking guys at my door .
I went round the block and saw them still there .
I started flashing the car lights and the horn and they left .
I had a gun with me , though , so be careful when trying this .
Also , remember that a car is one heavy , powerful piece of machinery .
I know a guy that had one of those big chrome–tube bumpers installed on his truck , especially for hitting those that were stupid enough o try to make him stop by standing in front of the car .
If I had a truck , I would do so myself .
Though I would keep my mouth shut about it , as always .
Just say that you think it looks cool or something .
Every now and then someone tries to force me to stop my car by standing in front of it ( I suppose there are still fools out there that get robbed this way ) , in the middle of the street .
I just aim at them and accelerate at full speed .
They always jump out of the way before I hit them .
By the way , at first , doing this made me feel nervous , but can you believe that now it ’s just common driving , as normal as changing gears ?
I guess it ’s a little sad .
PART V
Note : Sorry for the delay .
This thread started ok and it seems to have a lot of acceptance so I give it serious thought before I post , try not to leave anything out so it can serve the better , as a mini guide of things that may come .
A LIST OF THINGS THAT" If you had it to do over again " YOU WOULD GET .
Nomad came up with this one .
It ’s a good idea because it may help some of you from making the same mistakes I did .
There are things you do n’t think about until you need them , and then it ’s too late .
OK , If I had to do all this from scratch ?
Say , for example , if I had a 2 year warning , fairy godmother appears one night , all dressed in blue waving a magic wand , saying “ Your country will go down the sewage in 2 years , consider yourself warned dear ”
There are several things I would have done differently , and things I would have bought : Food : I ’ll get to the food issue soon enough , but you can never have too much canned , or other long shelf life food .
This was probably one of my greatest mistakes , I overlooked the food problem .
I was talking to my wife today while driving , asked her the same question Nomad asked me “ what would you do if you could go back in time , before the 2001 crisis ” .
My wife , though smart , is n’t much into preparedness , but she answered “ I ’d buy food ” in a heartbeat .
“ Do n’t you remember that you could only buy one small bottle of oil at a time , same with sugar , flour and milk .
Do n’t you remember all those empty shelves at the supermarket . ? ”
Definitely , more food , specially food that lasts for a few years .
CAR : I would have bought a 4x4 , even though I live in the city .
A 4x4 allows you to dive over the sidewalk or through wasteland , away from roadblocks or riots .
I ’ve see those that have 4x4s simply go off road , climb over a boulevard and leave while the rest of us poor car owners have to stay .
A 4x4 truck also has more mass and power in case that someone tries to cut you off or rams you with the car .
It ’s less likely to stop running if you hit someone or several people ( in a riot situation ) since it ’s prepared for cross country use and the engine is much more protected .
Fuel containers :
Not only jerry cans , but those big metal containers , that hook up like small “ u- hauls ” ?
I ’m not sure about their capacity , maybe they can hold one or two barrels of gas .
I saw them at construction sites , and they were not that expensive if bought used , before the 2001 crisis .
Now , I do n’t know .
Have n’t seen them for a while .
A generator :
These are imported and very expensive for us .
I think that they are now making them here , but I ’m not sure about the quality .
A nice TV and DVD player : I know what you are thinking “ this guy has gone … “ nuts ” ” [ Smile ]
Please , let me explain .
Going out for dinner or to the movies is not only dangerous but also expensive .
You WILL find much better use for that money if SHTF .
There are places in Buenos Aires where you can go out for dinner , movies , or theater shows and have a good time , safely .
They either have their own security or arrange with the police for added security .
These are the kinds of places you are likely to visit if you ever come to Argentina , places were tourists can move around , relatively safe ( there are always exceptions , of course ) .
But these places are either for tourists or for the extremely wealthy .
I have a good socio- economical level , better than 96 % of the population at least , yet I cant afford to spend that amount of money every weekend or even two weekends a month .
Going out for a walk is a possibility , and we do go out for a walk every now and then , but lets just say that the view is n’t that good , and you can only walk about 6 blocks in the same direction before you get out of the are which is guarded by private security , after that you are on “ you are on your own ” land .
You CAN go for a walk ( just like millions that live in Somalia or Afghanistan go for a walk as well ) millions of citizens do , but I ’d rather not risk it .
Just the day before yesterday , a young woman was waiting at the bus stop in my neighborhood , holding her 6 month old daughter .
A cop that was chasing a bad guy opened fire with his High Power , with no regard to bystanders as they always do .
The 9 mm FMJ ( JHP are not allowed for the average police ) went right through the baby ’s buttocks and through the mother .
Miraculously , the bullet did n’t hit any of the baby ’s internal organs and the mother also survived after a few days at the hospital .
Was that just luck ?
Maybe , I prefer to think that God does work in mysterious ways .
We have a lot of cases like this , were innocent people get shot by the police , and the stupid “ no JHP ” rule makes it worse , since 124 gr. FMJ 9 mm will penetrate walls , windows , even bad guys and end up injuring or killing innocent people .
So , back to the TV .
Good places are too expensive , and just going out for a walk at night with your wife / girlfriend is out of the question .
All of a sudden popcorn , pizza and a movie sounds like a good plan .
I ’m not saying that you should spend all day in front of the screen like a zombie .
Reading is nice , I love reading myself , but once the SHTF , going out with a date at night wont be that easy , nor will it be that cheap .
You will end up paying for that added security the shop / bar / theater owner hired , the higher price of gas and food , while a DVD copy can be found everywhere , and costs only a couple of bucks .
After the SHTF there will be a lot of “ why do n’t we watch a movie ” nights .
Like it or not TV is cheep , safe entertainment .
A play station or xbox is also nice to have .
Even if the country collapses , there will always be a guy with a DVD writer making copies .
Just something to think about if you like movies .
BOOKS : Oh , almost forgot .
If you like reading a lot , buy books now , even if you wont read them for some time .
If your economy crashes , paper will become a source of income for many .
We have thousands of scavengers collecting cardboard and paper all day long , specially at night when people take out the trash .
As a result , books are not cheap , because they have a value of its own in the form of paper .
Also , consider that books are heavy , making transportation expensive and many are printed abroad .
Just as an example : I returned from visiting my parents in Spain with three suitcases .
ONE suit case was entirely full of books .
Books cost about 80%- 200 % more than what they cost in USA or Spain .
Guns & ammo : I always liked guns , so I always had weapons .
But I did n’t have an adequate survival battery .
If you do n’t have a good survival selection of weapons , buy them now , or as soon as your budget allows .
Make it one of your priorities , just after food , water and shelter .
There are several posts on the ideal choice of weapons .
Get at least a service size pistol and a military semi auto rifle and a 22 handgun / rifle .
( try to get both if you can , they are not that expensive ) .
A bolt rifle ( preferably in the same caliber as the semi ) a pump 12 ga shotgun and a sub rifle , like a SMG or pistol caliber semi auto carbine ( same caliber as pistol ) would complete the package .
I forgot to buy a 22 pistol until after 2001 , and ended up paying for a Norinco 22 pistol the same price I would have paid for a Ruger pistol before the crisis .
My advice is :
See what you use regularly and what you expect to need after TSHTF .
Of those goods , see where they are made .
If they are made outside your country , they will either increase in price of stop importation entirely after TSHTF .
In my case , one good example ( of many , many others ) is Gillette disposable blades .
They are made in USA , and right now they cost a fortune .
But as I said before , check what is being imported .
No point in buying cases of Cubans for trade after TSHTF if you live in Cuba , right ?
I would n’t think of these items as trade goods , but as “ gifts ” to buy favors , build up relationships with police , government officials , doctors , people you might need favors from .
Stuff , like liquor / wine , a nice pen , perfume , makeup and other “ free shop ” kind of items can go a long way when you need some strings pulled , or a “ friend ” within certain circles .
And it ’s not only the item , sweet talking also must be applied .
For example , you need renew your drivers license after the XXXX crisis .
The problem is that the office is low on personal ( they had to let go 25 % and 50 % are on strike ) so you ’ll have to wait 4 months until you get an appointment .
You approach the information desk were you find Betty .
Now , Betty has n’t had a date since the age of 10 , and she weights as much a healthy manatee ( though she ’s not THAT pretty ) you kindly ask her to please help you fill the paperwork , and though she ’s as cold as a Popsicle , you keep calling her by her first name and when you leave she smiles and says good bye .
The next day you drop by and give Betty a Revlon lipstick for “ helping ” you fill the form , which had difficult questions like “ name ? ” ” Age ? ” .
It cost you about 4 bucks before the crisis but , since it ’s made in France , it went up to 20 dollars and then , 2 months ago , they no longer imported it .
Revlon saw that they no longer had a market for their 4 Euro lipstick , which now costs Americans 20 dollars and the segment that used to buy it is spending that money in other items like food , so their marketing experts told them that the 4 Euro lipstick is no longer profitable in USA .
Betty used to love that particular lipstick , she though it made her look like Cindy Crawford ( poor Betty ) but 20 dollars was more than she could spare in her good looks , and when she finally decided to drop the 40 pounds of M&M ’s she ate a month in favor for the lipstick , the girl at the drugstore told her that the item is no longer imported into the USA .
Her face lights up when she sees your present , and tells you that you should n’t have bothered , and she asks how did it go with you license .
You tell here that you actually have a problem , it seems that it takes 4 months to renew , and you ask her if , well , maybe she can do something about it … you get the picture .
In other occasions people will let you know that they want a plain and simple “ bribe ” , and there 50 bucks or 100 bucks according to the situation will get the job done .
I ’ve used “ gifts ” ( a perfume ) to get my passport faster , saved a few months , and I ’ve used bribes every single time the police stopped me for “ inspection ” .
I know this does not apply to 1st world countries were most officers are honest self sacrificed people , I mean no insult to the law enforcement community on this forum , but please understand that it does apply to 3rd world countries , and I ’m not getting shot by an angry cop over 10 or 20 pesos , let them have their bribe .
I tried it once and I will never try it again .
A cop stopped me and started BS me .
I told him “ ok officer , guess you ’ll have to write me a ticket , I understand ” .
He did n’t want to write a ticket , he wanted money and things got ugly .
I ’m never doing anything that stupid again .
FOOD
A delicate issue .
Even though not in the same way , it does affect us all .
Keep in mind that if TSHTF , prepared or not , food will always be in your thoughts .
If you do n’t have it you ’ll do ANYTHING to get it , and if you are prepared you ’ll worry about being able to get more for the future .
Once you see food prices go up between 200 % and 300 % , or simply see it missing , you ’ll realize what a valuable commodity food really is .
To those that think that food will never be a problem in USA : Come visit my country , even though there are desert areas up north , most of the country is fertile “ Pampa ” .
Just after WWII Argentina practically fed Europe .
Argentina was know in Europe as “ the world ’s granary ” .
Cattle and wheat was enough to feed our own country and another continent .
So , what happened ?
Why are there so many that have little or no food and end up eating out of dumpsters ?
I mean , the land is still there , is n’t it ?
Well , the country is the same country that used to be called the “ world ’s granary ” but some things changed .
Several big , multinational corporations , such as Benetton , bought hundreds of thousands of acres of natural resources .
I do n’t know the exact number , but I do remember that the media started talking about the integrity of the sovereignty of the country being at risk because of these massive purchases of land , so you can imagine how many acres were bought .
Mysteriously , the media suddenly dropped the subject .
Another important factor is that now , with our new economy , it ’s not good business to sell Argentine food to Argentina .
Why sell a kg of meat to the local market for 17 pesos when they can now sell it to Spain for 17 Euros when 1 Euro = 3,5 pesos ?
All this combined with high unemployment , salaries that are not enough to buy the minimal amount of calories for a typical family , and the high prices resulted in a country that slowly started to suffer hunger .
Again , I can pin point the exact moment when the entire country realized what was happening .
After the 2001 crisis things had been bad , but people in Buenos Aires , the capital city and the richest province , did n’t realize how bad things actually where in the other provinces .
This was until teachers noted that kids had problems with education .
You see , they noticed that they had problems to concentrate , that they fell asleep , and that they found it difficult to resolve mathematical equations .
They later found out that this was due to mal nutrition , kids where not receiving the minimum amount of nutrients for a healthy working body .
The braking point was when a reporter interviewed a little girl about 8 or 9 years old .
The reporter lady asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up , the usual kiddy questions .
The girl , crying , said that she did n’t want to be anything , that she did n’t care .
The lady asked her why was she crying .
She said that she cried because she was hungry , that she had nothing to eat for days , and it was then that I noticed how skinny the little girl actually was .
Seeing children starve is terrible , I guess we all saw those images f the starving kids in Africa .
But when you see them speak your same language , with your same accent , in your own country , it hits a nerve .
People talked about it for weeks , and they interviewed pediatricians that confirmed that the number of children dieing because of hunger had increased drastically in the last few months .
So whatever happens , let it be a hurricane , economical collapse , earthquake or meteor hitting earth , food and water always come first .
Ideally you already have a food plan and have a year worth of food in your basement …
You do n’t ? hmm … neither did I when the SHTF and lets just say that I had my manhood up my throat all the time , fearing that supermarkets would definitely close and me and my family would be left without food .
If you do n’t have your food needs sorted out already , just do what I did , start buying a little extra every time you go to the supermarket .
The points you want to look for your storage food are , in order of importance :
1 ) No need of fridge .
2 ) High nutritious value / volume
3 ) Long shelf live , between 1 - 5 years .
4 ) That they do n’t need water
5 ) That they do n’t need cooking
This will usually take you to canned meats , canned tuna , canned vegetables , dried pasta , dehydrated soups , chocolate , milk powder , marmalades , soups , rice and dried beans .
Canned food is excellent when it comes to long shelf life .
Most of the time they are already hydrated , so they do n’t need water , and you can eat them out of the can .
Just watch out not to dent the can , if this happens air may get inside and ruin it .
If you have a dent or bump in a can , consume it fast .
Also remember that once the can is opened , you have to remove the food from the can .
My favorite canned food is tuna .
It lasts forever , it ’s full of proteins , and no matter how often I eat it , it always tastes good .
Besides you can combine it with frizzed vegetables or rice .
Canned fruits and vegetables are also good , but they have much less vitamins than the fresh ones , and you loose most of it unless you drink the liquid they come in .
Dried pasta may need a lot of water to cook , but its one of the best ways to store carbs in convenient to use form .
Flower or wheat can also be stored in large quantities and are nutritious , but they require more preparation to consume .
We ’ve become quite independent form the fridge , and only use it to keep frozen our fresh pasta ( ñoqui ) pizza and frizzed vegetables .
We practically freeze everything , because it lasts longer , practically indefinitely , and because if the lights go out a large mass of frizzed food will last for hours , even a day or two .
The more mass of food you have frizzed to longer it will hold .
The survivalist , especially the urban one , should try to rely as little as possible on the fridge .
That ’s why canned food and freeze dried food is your best friend .
Yet , anyone who has been for a while with no fresh fruit knows that after some time the skin starts to suffer .
Sores will appear after a while , especially on delicate skin like the lips and mouth .
Once you start eating fresh fruits and vegetables again they go away .
This happened to me once , spent to much time without fresh vegetables and my mouth was a mess , full of sores .
After a week of eating fresh vegetables regularly the symptoms disappeared .
That ’s why you should try to have some fresh food to supplement you storage food .
Not much , just 2 or 3 fruit trees on your garden and a small orchard would be fine .
You do n’t have to feed out of this , you just need a little fresh veggies or fruit every once in a while .
On the news right now while I write this :
We had elections last Sunday , we voted senators .
It seems that in one of the north provinces people where surrendering their ID documents for bags of groceries , some for water , or for 10 pesos ( 3 USD ) they were later taken to warehouses were they spent the night to ensure that they voted .
The next day the candidate ’s men took them to vote , howled inside cattle trucks , like animals .
When they arrived they were given their ID documents back with the number of list they had to vote .
Thugs guide them and ensure they vote who they want .
HEALTH & FITNESS
Visit you doctor NOW .
Get yourself fixed .
Visit the dentist and make sure your mouth is in perfect conditions .
Nothing is worse than having toothache and no one available to take care of it .
Remember that doctors may not be as available as they are now , in the future .
For example I got eye surgery to take care of my sight problem .
Now I see perfectly without glasses .
The advantage of laser eye surgery is n’t limited to not needing glasses .
( which can brake and would be nearly impossible to replace after TSHTF )
Even people react to you in a different way .
Humans are after all instinctive animals .
Bad guys will look at you as a weaker person if you wear glasses .
Maybe they do n’t know that at a conscious level , maybe they do , but they do react differently .
This is not me imagining stuff , it ’s the way things are .
Old people and women are specially vulnerable .
After old people and women and children , come small framed people , the smaller you are , the weaker you look , the more likely you are to be chosen as a victim by a bad guy .
It sounds , cruel , and it sure is , but that ’s the way it works .
A young man with a well formed body , broad shoulders , muscled arms and a “ do n’t f*** with me ” face , is less likely to be a victims of small time thieves .
If a professional group choses you as a target that ’s a completely different story , of course .
Talk to your doctor a lot .
Just like “ The little Prince ” , never stop yourself from asking a question .
Adopt that as a general philosophy and you ’ll end up learning a little about everything .
Mechanics , doctors , policemen , you can always learn something new from people with skills .
As a survivalist , and as a smart person , you should try to know a little about everything , Always be curious .
That ’s how I learned that I had to diversify my stock of antibiotics .
A doctor told me , that the body will adapt if you always use the same , making that particular antibiotic not that effective , specially in small children , so now I keep two different kinds of antibiotics .
vWorking out 3 times a week , for a couple of hours will keep you in shape .
I work out at home , I have a bench and some weights .
Try to compliment some aerobics and weight lifting .
Working the boxing bag is good exercise , works most muscles if done right , and you ’ll have a much more powerful punch .
Keep in mind that a bag is no replacement for a sparring partner and that the bag does not faint nor does it punch back .
Still , it good exercise and your punch will be more powerful if you connect .
Running belts and bicycles are also good .
Research on the subject and make your own routine , join a gym and talk to a professional if possible .
Whatever you do , the idea is to have a fit , healthy body .
No use in shooting ½ MOA at 100 yards if you have a gut that hangs half way to the floor and you cant run that same distance without needing an oxygen mask .
I know , shooting is fun , and working out is n’t .
At least for most , but after some time you ’ll start to enjoy it , your stamina and morale will definitely increase , and you ’ll start looking forward to working out .
The survivalist that spends 3 hours a week on his gun skills and no time at all on his own body is not doing things right .
Imagine if you have to run away from a riot / gunfight / attack while carrying your BOB , or fighting bare handed against someone that got you by surprise .
This applies for life in general , before or after TSHTF a man has to now how to fight bare handed .
You do n’t have to be Bruce Lee or Mike Tyson , just know how to through a decent punch , cover your face , or some kind or martial art classes .
I once had a fight that got a little ugly .
It happened in my mother in law ’s house , which proves that thing can go bad everywhere at any time .
A guy my wife ’s sister was dating argued with me and things got physical .
He had problems with the police for beating up an ex girlfriend ( which he was proud of , go figure ) and had spend 2 years in jail for stealing cars .
My wife ’s sister was showing up with mysterious bruises on her body , from “ falling while working out ” .
So you could say this guy was n’t my favorite person .
Anyway , he grabbed my neck by surprise , I grabbed his arm with both hands , one in his hand and the other in his elbow , and twisted it around .
The leverage made him let go of my neck and a kept on twisting it forcing him around .
He punched me with his other hand but the positing was n’t on his favor so it was just a glancing blow .
He pushed with his back against me , so I placed my left arm around hid neck , my elbow flexed over his Adam ’s apple .
The guy went berserk so I decided that I had to hold on until he passed out , or I would get seriously hurt .
I had practiced this choking move with my friend , the one that has the farm I talked about before .
He told me that after 30 seconds of choking the person passes out , and after 60 seconds , if you keep choking him , he dies .
So I placed my left arm firmly around his neck while holding my left hand firmly with my right arm , pressing as hard as I could .
The guy went nuts .
He slammed me against the walls , trying to get me away from his back .
He started clawing with his fingers on my biceps , desperate .
Me ?
I just hold my lock around his neck , mentally counting .
As if by magic , after 20 - 25 seconds .
He lost all strength and fell to his knees like a rag doll , and I let him go .
Meanwhile my wife , her sister and my mother in law were all screaming me to stop .
Once he caught his breath he said that I was psycho , and that he was just fooling around .
Not believing a word he said , I said I was sorry and we both got into the elevator , since we were leaving .
As soon as I close the elevator door , the s*** bag attacks me again .
I guess he felt humiliated in front of the woman he beat up .
He tried to grab me the same way I did .
I knew that this was getting out of hand and I completely lost patience with this clown .
I brought my serrated Cold Steel El hombre from my pocket and placed the dull side against his arm .
He got the message instantly a let go of me .
Once he did this I shoved him against the elevator , my forearm pressing against his neck and the knife under the neck as well .
He calmed down instantly , saying he was sorry , bla , bla , bla .
When we got out of the elevator I told him that if he ever got close to me or my family again I would put a bullet in his head .
I never saw him again .
This guy was a thief and women beater and I had no use him .
Besides these are the kind of rats that would brake into your house when you leave , or worse .
I ’m ranting all over the place again .
What I mean is that practicing defensive moves is useful , specially if you spar with someone that knows his thing .
My friend practices Judo .
He won the state championship and was left in 3rd place in the nationals final .
Practice as you would fight in real life .
Getting chocked is n’t nice , but you get to know what you are working with and know how effective it actually is .
Being in shape will also make you less prone to diseases , such as high pressure , heart problems , and will boost your immune system in general .
Knowing first aid procedures is always helpful .
I ’ll take the red cross course this summer .
Keep a first aid kit and any other special medicine you may need .
If you take drugs regularly try to have at least a year ’s worth of the stuff .
Medicines are hard to get and expensive , many are made in other countries and if SHTF they might not be available .
My father in law has Parkinson and needs a special medicine that is no longer imported .
He asks friends that travel to get it for him .
I stock pile as much medicines as I can .
Apart from the regular 1st aid kit stuff you usually have at home , I concentrate on Ibuprofen and antibiotics , both for children and adults .
Antibiotics are precious here , with all the viruses that are floating around .
Lung infections are particularly dangerous .
Also remember that keeping a clean , ventilated house goes a long way when it comes to preventing diseases .
This is hard when the city is full of filth and there are cockroaches and rats everywhere but it can be done .
My neighborhood is n’t that bad , there are places that are much , much worse , where people literally sleep and eat with rats .
Cockroaches are a problem , but I keep them somewhat controlled with that poison that comes in syringes and you place around the house .
That reminds me , stock up on rat and cockroach poison .
Services are bad in general , and the garbage collectors are no exception .
Once , they went on strike for about a week ( though there are worst places where they go months without collecting ) and you could see rats running around eh piles of garbage that people threw on the street ’s boulevard .
This is not healthy , of course .
And helps spread diseases all over the city , so keep that in mind as well .

“ CHOOSE THE CONSTITUTION ” in DC , 7/25
Today the National Impeachment Network ( NIN ) began its “ Choose the Constitution ” campaign .
The first goal of the campaign is to bring citizens to Washington D.C. from July 21 to 25 , 2008 to personally tell members of Congress to Choose the Constitution by using the remedy of impeachment and to ask them to attend the hearing on impeachment of the full House Judiciary Committee on July 25 at 10:00 a.m .
The second goal is to expand the news of the hearings nationwide and to ask the media for coverage .
For those in D.C. on July 25 there will be a pre-hearing rally at 9:00 a.m. in front of the Rayburn Building .
Due to the stunning results of lobbying in support of impeachment , NIN launched a nationwide call for citizens to come to D.C. or to take action from home .
Since July 8 , 2008 two delegations from NIN have lobbied Congress and their Legislative staffs to consider the serious implications if they do not perform their sworn duty to uphold the constitution .
Delegation members have been astounded by the response they ’ve received .
“ During our two week lobbying experience in D.C. we have found the most effective way to present our message is in - person ” says Cynthia Papermaster , NIN Co-Founder , who has been doing just that .
The NIN lobbyists are taking a positive , supportive approach toward Congress members who have already voiced their support for impeachment .
To date more than forty members of Congress have cosponsors of articles of impeachment or demanded immediate impeachment hearings .
During their first three days in D.C. , members of the NIN delegation met with Representatives Mike Hinchey ( D ) New York , Dennis Kucinich ( D ) Ohio , John Conyers ( D ) Michigan , Robert Wexler ( D ) Florida , Lynn Woolsey ( D ) California and Walter Jones ( R ) North Carolina .
Following a Wednesday , July 9 , afternoon meeting with Dennis Kucinich in which he informed NIN that he was sending an announcement to members of Congress regarding the presentation of a new impeachment resolution and an hour - long early evening meeting with Judiciary Chairman , John Conyers , on Thursday morning Nancy Pelosi said “ impeachment hearings may take place ” .
While Pelosi was making her announcement , NIN members were guest of Chairman Conyers at the Karl Rove hearing on the alleged politicization of the Department of Justice under the Bush administration .
Later that day they met with Robert Wexler and Lynn Woolsey .
The day ended with photos on the Capitol steps with Dennis Kucinich after observing him from the member ’s only gallery as he presented his most recent article to impeach George W. Bush on the count of treason .
NIN approaches its lobbying efforts with win -win solutions .
They have considered the dilemma that Congressional Representatives find themselves in during this re-election season when most people are concerned about the economy , fuel prices , mortgages and healthcare .
NIN has offered to work with Congress , to educate and rally the people , and has assured them of support during the election if they stand up for impeachment .
Democratic members are concerned that memories of the Clinton impeachment will create a negative backlash from their constituents .
NIN offers evidence and reminders of the Nixon years ; Senate and Congress members that took the first steps towards impeachment have gone down in history .
More important , a look at history shows that the party that starts impeachment wins the next election .
The National Impeachment Network is a non partisan umbrella under which activist groups , businesses and individuals that support the impeachment process provided under the constitution can unite , coordinate , and expand the movement .
Currently NIN reaches out to more than 40 coordinators and 160,000 activists who in turn reach out to more groups , friends and neighbors .
Due to continuing education and outreach to members of Congress and the public the movement for impeachment is becoming louder .
The next and greatest challenge for NIN and the millions of American ’s that support impeachment is to getting the media to report on it .

Two weeks ago , People magazine was granted an exclusive interview with Senator John McCain ’s new running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , who spoke about motherhood and career , life in Alaska and the historic nature of her candidacy .
She has not given an interview since , eschewing the traditional television news circuit traveled by a vice - presidential nominee .
Ms. Palin will break that news media blackout on Thursday , when she will begin two days of interviews by the ABC News anchor Charles Gibson .
The sessions could be the first test of Ms. Palin ’s ability to parry substantive questions on foreign and domestic policy , and as she flew back to Alaska on Wednesday , she brought with her a squad of Mr. McCain ’s top policy advisers to help her prepare .
In a broader sense , the interviews will also provide fresh material for what is now an intense war between the campaigns to define Ms. Palin in the public mind , a battle that both campaigns consider potentially critical to the election outcome .
Until recently , many observers , most of them on the left , have puzzled over why rising inequality has n't sparked an outright political revolt .
Well , here 's why .
Real income matters less than quality of life .
And for the last two decades , a delicate Consumption Compromise has tamped down economic discontent among working - class voters by driving down the cost of living — we've been living in the era of cheap food , cheap gas , cheap credit , and , of course , cheap Chinese - made goods .
From 2000 to 2005 , mean real money earnings rose for the four percent of the U.S. electorate that has professional graduate degrees and doctorates ; all other groups saw a decrease .
That 's right : college graduates saw their mean real money earnings decline , and there was even sharper backsliding among those with less education .
At the same time , the democratization of finance allowed consumption smoothing — spend tomorrow 's money today — and the quality of consumer goods improved .
Granted , this was small solace , but it gave a large number of Americans the sense that they were making economic progress .
During the same period , better - off workers — those in the top tenth — were hit by a spike in the cost of living .
Two University of Chicago economists , Christian Broda and John Romalis , have looked at the inflation rates of consumer goods for the top tenth and the bottom tenth of American households .
Because poor families spend a larger share of their income on tradable goods — think of the imported goods you find at Wal - Mart or Target — they 've profited tremendously from free trade .
Rich families spend a bigger share of their income on non-tradable services — hiring help , eating out , etc .
As a result , the rich experienced a much higher effective inflation rate than the poor between 1994 and 2005 .
If ever you wonder why the populism of Al Gore or John Edwards resonated with affluent voters more than with the working class , look for the beginnings of an answer right there .
Since 2005 , working - class voters ' wages have n't improved .
But thanks to a combination of the housing bust , ethanol subsidies , a bottleneck in refining capacity , low - sulfur regulations , and the collapse of the dollar , the Consumption Compromise has come undone .
The outrage over gas prices was the beginning .
The Republican right promises to " Drill Here , Drill Now " to lower your gas prices .
But what will they do to address skyrocketing food prices and healthcare premiums , or access to consumer credit ?
They can't do very much , at least not yet .
And as for the Democrats , they can promise redistribution or a more equitable tax code .
But can an increased flow of transfers keep up with the rising cost of a middle - class life without choking off economic growth ?
And there is the drive to price carbon , an effort many believe to be essential to human survival — yet one that will , by necessity , cut against our highly mobile way of life .
Can the Consumption Compromise be revived ?
Probably not .
The Compromise rested on American financial hegemony , and those days have ended .
The right and the left will have to do nothing less than rethink our way of life .

Depending on who you believe , the solid - state storage revolution is on the horizon , just over it , a few years away , or already upon us .
Analysts , journalists , and forum fanboys can’t seem to come to an agreement on exactly where we are in the process .
One thing seems certain , though :
At least for some markets , it ’s not a question of if solid - state storage will take over from traditional mechanical hard drives , but when .
Of course , the mechanical hard drive is by no means dead .
The torrid pace of platter development is still yielding impressive increases in performance and capacity .
But as the price of solid - state alternatives tumbles , SSDs are sure to carve out a niche in the mobile space , where their superior shock tolerance and low power consumption are more important than storage capacity .
Solid - state drives wo n’t just make their way into notebooks , though .
The near - instantaneous seek time of flash memory offers tantalizing performance potential for any workload dominated by random I /O requests .
SSDs are n’t nearly as impressive when it comes to sequential transfers , but they ’re getting faster on that front , too , making them interesting options for high - end desktops , workstations , and servers .
So solid - state drives are going to be big .
Very big .
And everyone wants a slice of the pie .
It ’s no wonder , then , that industry giant Intel is eager to get in on the action .
The company is in a rather unique position to serve the SSD market , too , with expertise not only in the chip manufacturing capability essential to populating a drive with memory , but also in the storage controller design that largely dictates performance .
Intel formally detailed its solid - state drive plans at IDF just a couple of weeks ago , revealing not just a single drive , but an entire collection of products that will trickle out in the coming months .
The first of these SSDs to hit the market will be the X25 - M , which boasts an impressive 250 MB / s sustained read rate , a 70 MB / s sustained write rate , 80 GB of storage capacity in a 2.5 ″ form factor , and support for Native Command Queuing .
Read on to see how this drive stacks up against a mix of solid - state and mechanical alternatives through our exhaustive suite of performance , noise level , and power consumption tests .
Flash inside The X25 - M is based on multi-level cell ( MLC ) NAND flash memory a cheaper alternative to the single - level cell ( SLC ) memory used in some flash drives .
Cheaper is relative , of course ; we ’re still talking about SSDs .
MLC memory is characterized by relatively slow write speeds , and the X25 - M ’s 70 MB / s sustained write rate lives up to MLC ’s reptuation .
Calling 70 MB / s relatively slow seems almost comical given that few 7,200 - RPM notebook hard drives can match that speed .
However , the Intel drive ’s whopping 250 MB / s sustained read rate quickly puts things into perspective .
That ’s more than twice the sustained read throughput of the latest desktop WD VelociRaptor and leagues ahead of the fastest mobile competition .
( For comparison , the SLC - based 64GB Samsung FlashSSD we reviewed not long ago is rated for 100 MB /s sustained reads and 80 MB /s writes . )
Finally , we have a drive capable of exploiting its 300 MB /s Serial ATA interface .
While we ’re embarassing the VelociRaptor , we should note that the X25 - M has a read latency of just 85 microseconds .
That ’s 0.085 milliseconds , if we convert to units more commonly associated with hard drives .
For comparison , the random access time of the VelociRaptor is 7.4 milliseconds a difference of two orders of magnitude .
The X25 - M owes its low latency to the zippy access times inherent to flash memory .
20 flash chips can be found on the X25 - M : 10 on the top of the drive ’s circuit board and 10 on the back , for a total of 80 GB .
Intel fabricates these chips itself using a 55nm process , although rival flash giant Samsung amusingly makes an appearance with a K4S281632I - UC60 memory chip that weighs in at 16MB .
Way to throw Samsung a few dollars ( or more likely , pennies ) for every SSD sale you beat them to , Intel .
As one might expect from a company with a long history of developing core- logic chipsets , the X25 - M ’s storage controller is an Intel design and a smart one at that , with support for , ahem , SMART monitoring .
More interestingly , the controller supports Native Command Queuing ( NCQ ) a new trick for SSDs .
NCQ was developed to reduce the performance impact of mechanical latency found in traditional hard drives , so it ’s might seem like an odd choice for a solid - state drive with no mechanical parts .
According to Intel , its SSDs are so fast that NCQ helps to compensate for latency encountered in the host PC .
Even today ’s fastest systems take some time ( time is relative in the microsecond world of the SSD ) between when a request is completed and another one is issued .
Queuing up multiple requests can keep a solid - state drive busy during this downtime , and the X25 - M is capable of stacking requests 32 deep .
So the X25 - M should n’t be short on performance , but what about longevity ?
MLC - based flash memory cells are limited to 10,000 write - erase cycles , giving solid - state drives a finite lifespan .
When estimating the operating life of their drives , other SSD makers generally rely on a basic formula to calculate the number of cycles used : Cycles = ( Host writes ) / ( Drive capacity )
Intel says this formula oversimplifies the issue , and that two other factors must be considered .
The first of these variables is write amplification , which refers to the amount of data actually written to a drive for a given write request .
Intel gives an example in which a host system generates a 4KB write request that , thanks to a drive ’s 128KB erase block size , actually incurs a 128 KB NAND write .
Dividing the NAND write size by the request size yields the amplification factor , which is 32 in this case .
Intel says the X25 - M ’s write - amplification factor is extremely low at 1.1 , while “ traditional ” SSDs have much higher amplification factor of 20 .
The efficiency of wear - leveling algorithms also has a hand in determining an SSD ’s lifespan .
If a drive is going to shuffle bits around to avoid bad cells and more efficiently use those available , it must do so without wasting precious write - erase cycles .
Intel estimates the X25 - M ’s wear - leveling efficiency factor at less than 1.1 , claiming that traditional SSDs have an efficiency factor of 3 .
Taking write - amplification and wear - leveling efficiency into account , Intel says the correct formula for cycling is as follows : Cycles = ( Host writes ) * ( Write amplification factor ) * ( Wear leveling factor ) / ( Drive capacity ) Using a write - amplification factor of 1.1 and a wear - leveling efficiency factor of 1.1 , 20 GB of write - erase per day for five years should consume only about 550 cycles on an 80 GB X25 - M. Using “ traditional ” SSD technology with an amplification factor of 20 and an efficiency factor of 3 , the same write - erase load would use over 27,000 cycles .
That ’s a huge difference , and to be fair , it ’s one that relies on values provided by Intel that are n’t entirely consistent .
Another Intel presentation from IDF estimates that “ mediocre ” SSDs have a write - amplification factor of 10 and a wear - leveling efficiency factor of 5 , resulting in just under 23,000 cycles for our 20 GB of write - erase per day example .
That presentation also pegs the X25 - M ’s efficiency factor at 1.04 rather than 1.1 .
We ca n’t easily test a drive ’s lifespan ourselves , but we did ask Samsung for the write - amplification and wear - leveling efficiency factor values for its SSDs .
Samsung has n’t responded yet , though .
If you do n’t want to crunch through the math , Intel estimates that the 80 GB X25 - M will last for five years with “ much greater than ” 100 GB of write - erase per day .
That ’s a relatively long time for much more data than most folks are likely to write or erase on a daily basis .
Actual drive lifespans aside , Intel rates the X25 - M’s Mean Time Between Failures ( MTBF ) at 1.2 million hours .
That ’s competitive with the MTBF rating of other MLC - based flash drives and equivalent to common MTBF ratings for enterprise - class mechanical hard drives .
Rather than banking on a single SSD , Intel has prepared a full lineup of solid - state drives with multiple form factors , capacities , and memory types .
The X25 - M will come first , with 80 GB models in mass production this month , followed by 160 GB derivatives early next year .
Intel will also offer 1.8 ″ versions of this drive destined for thin - and - light notebooks and , dare we dream , netbooks as well .
Lest one market segment go without unwarranted Mountain Dew branding , Intel has an Extreme SSD in the works , too .
The X25 - E will only be available in 2.5 ″ form factors with capacity points at 32 and 64GB .
This SLC - based drive maintains the X25 - M ’s 250 MB / s sustained read rate , but boosts writes up to 170MB /s and drops read latency to 75 microseconds .
The Extreme also features an MTBF rating of two million hours and enjoys SLC memory ’s 100,000 write - erase cycle tolerance , making it even more attractive for enterprise environments .
32 GB versions of the X25 - E should enter production in the next three months , followed by 64GB flavors next year .
The X25 - E certainly wo n’t be cheap SLC - based drives rarely are but we do n’t yet know exactly how much it will cost .
Intel has , however , confirmed that the 80 GB X25 - M will sell for $ 595 in 1,000 - unit quantities .
Drives will ship to the channel and major PC builders this week , and will either be sold on their own or installed in pre-built systems .
We ’ve also heard word that Intel partners may sell the company ’s SSDs under their own names .
That would n’t be surprising considering that we ’ve already seen OCZ repackaging Samsung ’s FlashSSD drives .

We ’ll look at the overall score , and then we ’ll show individual application results .
The X25 - M gets off to a good start , scoring higher in WorldBench than any other hard drive we ’ve tested .
Samsung ’s FlashSSD is only one point off the pace , followed by a collection of 3.5 ″ desktop drives .
Multimedia editing and encoding MusicMatch Jukebox Windows Media Encoder Adobe Premiere VideoWave Movie Creator
In three of four WorldBench multimedia editing and encoding tests , the X25 - M turns in the quickest completion times of the lot .
With the exception of the MasterDrive , however , all of the contenders we ’ve assembled are pretty close .
Image processing Adobe Photoshop ACDSee PowerPack
The X25 - M ties for the lead in WorldBench ’s Photoshop test and is right in the thick of things in the ACDSee test .
Scores are still relatively close across the board , though .
Multitasking and office applications Microsoft Office Mozilla Mozilla and Windows Media Encoder Completion times for WorldBench ’s office and multitasking tests do n’t vary much from one drive to the next , but the Intel SSD still finds itself at , or close to , the front of the pack .
Other applications WinZip Nero
Of all the WorldBench application tests , Nero and WinZip are the most demanding of the storage subsystem .
The X25 - M comes out on top in both tests , just edging out the Samsung FlashSSD , ahead of the fastest 3.5 ″ SATA drives on the market .
Boot and load times
To test system boot and game level load times , we busted out our trusty stopwatch .

The X25 - M ’s system boot time is n’t particularly impressive it ’s actually slower than that of our 5,400 - RPM Scorpio Blue .
However , Intel ’s first solid - state drive comes back in a big way in our level load tests , which have it leading the field , a hair ahead of the FlashSSD .
Note just how big a lead the X25 - M has over not only our 3.5 ″ contenders , but also the fastest 2.5 ″ mechanical hard drive of the lot , the Scorpio Black .

To make things easier to read , we ’ve separated our FC - Test results into individual graphs for each test pattern .
We ’ll tackle file creation performance first .
MLC - based flash drives are notorious for their relatively slow write performance , and the X25 - M is n’t an exception to that rule .
The Intel SSD is n’t nearly as slow as the MasterDrive here , and it ’s surprisingly faster than the SLC - based FlashSSD with one workload .
Overall , however , the X25 - M ’s file creation speeds ca n’t keep up with even the 5,400 - RPM Scorpio Blue .
What the X25 - M lacks in sustained write performance it more than makes up when it comes time to read .
The Intel drive easily outguns the rest of the pack here , enjoying a commanding lead with all five test patterns .
Not even the desktop VelicoRaptor comes close .

Next , File Copy

Copy tests combine read and write operations , and it ’s the X25 - M ’s slow write speeds that likely hinder it here .
The Intel SSD actually fares pretty well with the Windows and Programs test patterns , which are made up of large numbers of small files .
However , it ’s not nearly as competitive with the ISO , MP3 , and Install test patterns .
FC - Test ’s second wave of copy tests involves copying files from one partition to another on the same drive .
Our partition copy results closely track with those of the standard copy test .
The X25 - M offers reasonable performance when copying large groups of small files , but it ’s much slower with test patterns dominated by smaller numbers of larger files .
iPEAK multitasking
We ’ve developed a series of disk - intensive multitasking tests to highlight the impact of seek times and command queuing on hard drive performance .

We ’ve developed a series of disk - intensive multitasking tests to highlight the impact of seek times and command queuing on hard drive performance .
You can get the low - down on these iPEAK - based tests here .
The mean service time of each drive is reported in milliseconds , with lower values representing better performance .
The X25 - M leads the field with iPEAK workloads that include a read - intensive Virtualdub import operation as a secondary task .
Otherwise , the drive ’s performance is mixed , and not nearly as consistent as that of the Samsung FlashSSD .
If we average all our iPEAK scores , the FlashSSD comes out ahead of the field with a mean service time of 0.81 milliseconds .
The X25 - M scores a second place finish with a mean service time average of 1.05 milliseconds 0.26 milliseconds ahead of the VelociRaptor , which is n’t bad at all .
IOMeter – Transaction rate
IOMeter presents a good test case for both seek times and command queuing .
IOMeter presents a good test case for both seek times and command queuing .
This , ladies and gentlemen , is absolute domination .
The X25 - M thoroughly outclasses the competition here , wiping the floor with not only every mechanical hard drive in the field , but the other SSDs , as well .
IOMeter ’s file server , workstation , and database test patterns are made up of a mix of read and write requests , so the X25 - M ’s ability to stay so far ahead of the competition is especially impressive there .
The web server test pattern is made up exclusively of read requests , allowing the X25 - M to achieve even higher transaction rates .
Note that with the web server test pattern , the Intel SSD ’s performance levels off after we hit 32 concurrent I/O requests the max depth of the drive ’s Native Command Queueing implementation .
IOMeter – Response time
As one might expect , the X25 - M is the class of the field when we look at IOMeter response times .
All our SSDs have a huge advantage with the web server test pattern , but among them , the Intel drive is still the quickest .
IOMeter – CPU utilization
We do n’t usually see IOMeter CPU utilization scores higher than a few percent , but particularly with the web server test pattern , the X25 - M consumes more cycles than its rivals .
This is to be expected , of course , because the Intel SSD is pushing much higher transaction rates .
HD Tach
We tested HD Tach with the benchmark ’s full variable zone size setting .
We tested HD Tach with the benchmark ’s full variable zone size setting .
Although it does n’t quite hit the 250MB /s sustained read rate Intel promises , the X25 - M manages to post a blistering 229MB /s in HD Tach ’s average read speed test .
That gives the drive a huge lead over the field right up until we test its sustained write performance .
Somewhat surprisingly , the X25 - M ’s average write speed eclipses its rated 70 MB / s.
However , that ’s only fast enough to stay ahead of our 2.5 ″ mechanical drives , not quite quick enough to catch Samsung ’s FlashSSD or the cream of the 3.5 ″ desktop crop .
The Intel SSD ’s burst performance leads the field , but what ’s more interesting is the fact that the MasterDrive and FlashSSD both fail to muster much more than 100 MB /s in this test .
HD
Tach does n’t measure seek times down to the microsecond , so the X25 - M will have to make do with tying the Samsung drive with a 0.1 - millisecond random access time .
The X25 - M ’s CPU utilization is a little higher than the rest here , but keep in mind that HD Tach ’s margin of error in this test is +/- 2 % .
Noise levels
Noise levels were measured with an Extech 407727 Digital Sound Level meter 1 ″ from the side of the drives at idle and under an HD Tach seek load .
Drives were run with the PCB facing up .

Drives were run with the PCB facing up .
Without mechanical parts , our SSDs are entirely silent .
Their 42.6 - decibel reading here represents the noise generated by the rest of our test system .
Power consumption
For our power - consumption tests , we measured the voltage drop across a 0.1 - ohm resistor placed in line with the 5V and 12V lines connected to each drive .
Through the magic of Ohm’s Law , we were able to calculate the power draw from each voltage rail and add them together for the total power draw of the drive .
Those eager to pop the X25 - M into a notebook will be happy to learn that the drive sips less than one watt at idle and only about one - and - a - half watts when seeking .
While those results are impressive , Samsung ’s FlashSSD consumes even less power .
To be fair , though , the X25 - M is an 80 GB drive while the FlashSSD is only 64GB .

The Wall Street Journal stated in a lead editorial last week that the SEC was “ reasonable ” to “ clamp down ” on naked short selling .
Well , that was progress of sorts , though one wonders how it could have taken all these years for the nation ’s most important newspaper to suggest that it might be “ reasonable ” to put an end to criminal activity that has eviscerated hundreds of companies and destroyed countless lives .
And now that this criminal activity has been implicated in the Humpty Dumptying of our financial system , one grows wistful for the golden age of journalism when editorialists ( people working for famous newspapers , not just cyber weirdos ) would express a little outrage , demand that heads roll – muster something better than “ reasonable ” to describe the limpid “ clamp down ” of an SEC that bows in oily servitude to the very short - sellers who manhandled our markets .
Alas , The Wall Street Journal is not angry about the scandal of naked short selling .
To the contrary , it devotes most of its editorial to tut - tutting the SEC for taking the mild step of requiring hedge funds to disclose their short positions .
This , the Journal laments , means the government wants to “ slap a scarlet letter on short sellers . ”
And ( shed a tear ) hedge funds will now have to “ worry that their strategies will be put on display for the world to see . ”
Might the world like to see which hedge funds are employing the strategy of illegal naked short selling – offloading huge chunks of stock that they do not possess – phantom stock – in order to drive down prices ?
No , nothing to see there , says the Journal .
Having thoroughly investigated the matter , the editorialist reports that there is “ no evidence of widespread naked shorting of financial stocks in this panic . ”
Indeed , the Journal assures us that there is no evidence that short sellers have engaged in any market manipulation whatsoever .
That is a mighty bold claim .
As the Wall Street Journal itself reported , the SEC has ordered two dozen hedge funds to turn over trading records as part of its investigation into possible short - seller manipulation of six big financial institutions — American International Group , Goldman Sachs , Lehman Brothers , Morgan Stanley , Washington Mutual , and Merrill Lynch .
The SEC has never in history prosecuted a major case against a short seller , and there is no reason to believe that it is actually going to nail someone now .
But it is not difficult to see why the SEC feels that is has no choice but to investigate .
It must investigate , or at least appear to investigate , because the data scream , “ Investigate ! ”
Take the case of Washington Mutual , which met its demise on the same day that the Journal published its editorial .
While the SEC has not yet released data covering the last couple weeks of turmoil , the data through June show that at one point that month “ failures to deliver ” of Washington Mutual ’s stock reached an astounding 9 million shares .
From June 5 to June 19 there were , on any given day , at least 1 million WaMu shares that had “ failed to deliver . ”
In other words , hedge funds and brokers sold as many as 9 million shares that they did not possess ( which is why they “ failed to deliver ” them ) , and they kept the market saturated with at least 1 million phantom shares for more than two weeks .
WaMu ’s stock price dropped by more than 30 % during this period .
Similar attacks , with similar effects , occurred one after another in the months leading up to June .
That is very good evidence of illegal market manipulation .
Aside from Washington Mutual , Bank of America , Fannie Mae , MBIA , Ambac , and close to 50 smaller financial firms – not to mention a couple hundred non-financial companies – have appeared on the SEC - mandated “ threshold ” list of companies whose stock has “ failed to deliver ” in excessive quantities .
That , too , is very good evidence of illegal market manipulation .
A number of the big banks never appeared on the SEC ’s “ threshold ” list .
Perhaps that explains the Journal ’s claim that there is “ no evidence ” that naked short selling contributed to our financial crisis .
If so , the Journal does not understand the methods that naked short sellers use to manipulate the markets .
The Journal also does not understand how powerful financial elites manipulate the government ( and the media ) .
Peter Chepucavage , the former SEC official who authored Regulation SHO ( the rules that governed short sales from 2005 until the SEC temporarily banned short - selling of financial stock last week ) has told us that the rules were watered down under fierce pressure from the hedge fund lobby .
One result is that Regulation SHO did not force short sellers to borrow real shares before they sold them .
They were given three days to produce stock before it was declared a “ failure to deliver . ”
If they missed the three - day deadline , they were given another ten days , after which they were supposed to buy ( not borrow ) real shares and deliver them , or face penalties .
In practice , many hedge funds and brokers ignored the deadlines without repercussions .
But even traders who met the deadlines were able to churn the markets .
Since they were not required to possess real shares before they hit the sell button , they could offload a large block of phantom stock and let it dilute supply for three to 13 days .
When the deadline arrived , they might borrow real shares and deliver them , and then sell another block of phantom stock , which would hammer prices for another three to thirteen days .
Or , rather than borrow real shares , the hedge fund might buy stock ( the price having been knocked down during 13 days of diluted supply ) from a friendly broker .
Often , the brokers did not have any stock to sell the hedge fund , but they pushed the sale button anyway .
The hedge funds then used the broker ’s phantom stock to settle its initial sale of phantom stock , and when the broker ’s deadline came , he bought an equal quantity of phantom stock from another broker , and so on .
A lot of journalists have portrayed this naked short selling as “ legal . ”
In fact , it is grossly illegal assuming the goal is to manipulate markets .
But the SEC until recently shied away from making that assumption .
So long as the hedge funds met the delivery deadlines , they could distort and destroy at will .
Another result of the short - seller lobby ’s intervention is that a company does not appear on the SEC ’s “ threshold ” list unless there are failures to deliver of more than 10,000 of the company ’s shares ( and at least 0.5 % of its total shares outstanding ) for five consecutive days .
So long as there are no failures on day six , there are no flashing red lights at the SEC .
That is , threshold ( excessive ) levels of phantom shares can float around the system for a total of eight days ( three days before they are registered as “ failures to deliver , ” plus five more ) without a company being designated a victim of naked short selling .
An eight - day blast ( or even just a one day blast ) of , say , a couple - hundred thousand phantom shares can knock down a stock ’s price very nicely .
Blasts of a million - plus shares , which are common , can do even more damage .
If a company has weaknesses that can be blown out of proportion with help from the media , and if hedge funds blast the company with phantom stock , then pause , then blast again , then pause , then blast again — over and over — for a couple of months , then the company ’s share price can soon be in the single digits .
– without ever having appeared on the SEC ’s threshold list .
Unsurprisingly , the data through June shows this blast - pause - blast pattern in the stocks of nearly ever major financial institution that has been wiped off the map , and quite a few that were in death spirals before the SEC temporarily banned short - selling .
Very often , huge failures to deliver have occurred in stretches of precisely five days – just long enough to keep a stock off the threshold list .
The attack on Bear Stearns , for example , began on January 9 , when hedge funds naked shorted more than 1.1 million shares .
The shares “ failed to deliver ” at the end of Friday , January 11 ( the three - day deadline ) .
For the next four days , beginning Monday , January 14 , there were massive failures to deliver , peaking at 1 million shares on January 17 .
That is , the attack lasted a total of eight days , with failures to deliver lasting precisely five days .
On day six , there were few failures to deliver , so Bear did not appear on the threshold list .
Over the next few weeks , there were several more blasts – with failures to deliver ranging from 200,000 to 500,000 shares .
Those were threshold levels , but the failures lasted less than five consecutive days , so no flashing red light at the SEC .
On February 28 , 800,000 shares of Bear Stearns failed to deliver .
For the next five business days , anywhere from 100,000 to 350,000 shares failed to deliver .
On day six , there was a pause — few failures to deliver .
So no threshold list – no flashing red light at the SEC .
A week later , just before CNBC ’s David Faber reported the false information ( given to him by a hedge fund “ friend ” whom he had “ known for twenty years ” ) that Goldman Sachs had cut off Bear ’s credit , somebody naked shorted more than a million shares of Bear ’s stock ..
Over the course of the next couple of weeks , there was a sustained effort to drive the stock to zero , with massive failures to deliver every day — peaking at 13 million shares .
This attack lasted long enough to put Bear Stearns on the threshold list , but by then , it was too late .
The bank ’s mangled remains had been swallowed by JP Morgan .
Ultimately , at least 11 million shares of Bear Stearns were sold and never delivered .
Meanwhile , the naked short sellers began their attack on Lehman Brothers .
On March 18 , Lehman ’s stock had begun to increase sharply , so somebody unleashed more than 1.5 million phantom shares .
Those failed to deliver on March 20 .
For the next three days , there were failures to deliver of between 400.000 and 800.000 shares — far exceeding the daily “ threshold . ”
That helped the share price to fall sharply , but on day five , there were no failures , so Lehman did n’t appear on the threshold list of companies victimized by naked short selling .
On April 1 , another round of naked short selling commenced , coinciding with a wave of false rumors about Lehman ’s liquidity .
That continued until April 3 , when SEC Chairman Christopher Cox , for the first time , told a Senate committee hearing that naked short selling was a big problem .
Using the words “ phantom stock , ” he said many companies had been affected and vowed to crack down .
For a few weeks after that , there was not much new naked short selling .
Then , on May 21 , short - seller David Einhorn gave his famous speech accusing Lehman ’s executives of cooking their books .
Though Lehman , like most banks , was guilty of participating in the dodgy business of securitized debt , it was not cooking its books .
It had , however , failed to mark some of its assets down to levels prescribed by Einhorn , who waved the CMBX index as the proper barometer of commercial mortgages .
The CMBX comes from a company called Markit Group , which is owned by four hedge funds , the names of which the Markit Group will not disclose .
I do n’t know if the managers of those hedge funds are friends of David Einhorn , but the Wall Street Journal ’s Lingling Wei published a story in February noting that the CMBX “ does n’t make sense . ”
It grossly undervalues commercial property , implying default rates , for example , that are four - times higher than they are in reality .
Nonetheless , the media , including the Wall Street Journal , trumpeted Einhorn ’s analysis , which was distorted in many other ways – but that is a tale for a future blog .
For now , it is enough to know that coinciding with Einhorn ’s speech , somebody naked shorted more than 200,000 shares ( the settlement date for that sale was May 27 , three business days after the speech , owing to a holiday weekend ) .
Thus began a five day stretch of failures to deliver ( ranging from 120,000 to 450,000 shares ) .
On day six , as usual , there were few failures to deliver , so Lehman did not appear on the threshold list .
After a pause of a few days , somebody circulated the falsehood that Lehman had gone to the Fed for a handout .
Coinciding with that rumor , hedge funds naked shorted close to 1.5 million shares .
Those shares failed to deliver three days later , on June 9 .
The next day , there were 650,000 failures .
The day after that , 263,000 failures .
On day four , there were 510,000 failures .
On day five , there were 623,000 failures .
Time for Lehman to appear on the threshold list .
But , on day six , of course , the failures to deliver stopped .
No list – no flashing red light at the SEC .
Throughout this time , Einhorn continued to appear on CNBC and in the major newspapers , doing his best to make Lehman ’s problems ( which were real , but probably , at this stage , manageable ) appear to be both catastrophic and criminal .
From May 21 , the day of Einhorn ’s speech , to June 15 , the stock lost almost half its value .
For reasons that I cannot fathom , Lehman then opted for a strategy of appeasement .
Rather than challenge Einhorn ’s assumptions , Lehman aimed to silence him and his media yahoos by doing what they asked .
It “ reduced its exposure ” to mortgages , primarily by marking them down to levels dictated by Einhorn ’s bogus index – the CMBX .
This is the main reason why it booked a 2.8 billion loss in the second quarter .
When Lehman announced its quarterly results , on June 16 , there was another blast of naked short selling , with failures to deliver at threshold levels from June 19 to June 24 .
Exactly five days .
Then the failures stopped .
No threshold list .
No flashing red light .
I look forward to the day ( in a few months ) when the SEC will release data covering July to September .
But I can tell you right now what happened next .
On June 30 , somebody floated the false rumor that Barclays was going to buy Lehman at 15 dollars a share ( it was then trading at 20 ) .
Simultaneously , hedge funds no doubt naked shorted large blocks of shares .
It ’s a safe bet that the data will show failures to deliver lasting precisely five days .
On July 10 , somebody ( SAC Capital ? ) circulated the false rumor that SAC Capital was pulling its money out of Lehman .
Hours later , there was another false rumor — that PIMCO was pulling out its money .
Quite certainly , these rumors were accompanied by naked short selling , with failures to deliver beginning three days later , and probably continuing at threshold levels for precisely five days .
Lehman ’s stock lost almost 50 % of its value in the four weeks leading to July 15 ..
At this point , the SEC finally came to realize what was happening to Lehman .
It realized that similar madness had destroyed Bear Stearns .
It realized that AIG , Citigroup , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Bank of America and fifty other financial companies were getting clobbered in exactly the same fashion .
Clearly , naked short selling posed a real threat to the stability of the financial system .
So the SEC issued an emergency order forcing hedge funds to borrow real stock before they sold it .
No more saying “ Yeah , my cousin Louie has the stock in a drawer somewhere . ”
No more naked short selling .
This order protected only 19 big financial institutions – which is as far as the SEC thought it could go and still retain friendly relations with its short - selling paramours – but it was something .
During the three weeks that the emergency order was enforced , Lehman ’s stock price increased by around 50 percent .
The other companies that had been under attack enjoyed similar rebounds .
The short - sellers , of course , fumed .
Some of those fumes wafted to The Wall Street Journal and other prestigious publications , which lambasted the SEC for issuing the emergency order .
They published all manner of mumbo- jumbo about the emergency order wrecking “ market efficiency ” – though the only evidence of this was an utterly dubious report circulated by the short seller lobby ( see here for the details ) , and it was hard to comprehend what could possibly have been “ efficient ” about a market getting smothered with false information and fake supply .
Of course , the SEC , captured by the short - sellers , and ever mindful of the media , decided to let its emergency order expire , and announced no new initiatives to stop naked short selling ..
The day after the emergency order expired , Lehman ’s stock nosedived .
So did a lot of other stocks that had enjoyed a temporary reprieve .
Mark my words , the data for August and September will show that soon after the order was lifted , rampant naked short selling began anew .
It will show a sustained attack on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , with failures to deliver exceeding one million shares , until the day the two companies were nationalized .
It will show Lehman getting hammered ( blast - pause - blast ) until its stock was so low that there was no way it could raise capital .
And it will show that in Lehman ’s final days , hedge funds sold unprecedented amounts of phantom stock , knowing that the stock would never , ever have to be delivered .
Two days after Lehman was vaporized , AIG watched its stock fall to as low as one dollar .
The data through June shows that AIG was repeatedly blasted with phantom stock , often in stretches of eight days ( three + five ) , with peak failures to deliver reaching 2 million shares .
It ’s a safe bet that the data will show that these attacks continued , and grew in magnitude , until a price of one buck per share resulted in paralysis , and AIG had to be nationalized .
But the company never appeared on the SEC ’s threshold list .
After AIG , the rumor was that Citigroup would go down next .
The data through June shows that Citigroup was bombarded – blast , pause , blast – with massive amounts of phantom stock .
Failures to deliver peaked at 8 million shares .
No doubt , the blasts continued and grew in magnitude in the days leading up to September 16 , when Citigroup ’s stock went into a death spiral .
On September 17 , the SEC rushed out new rules governing naked short selling .
The new rules seemed a lot like the old rules .
Hedge funds would not have to actually possess stock before selling it .
Instead , they would merely have to “ locate ” the stock .
The SEC would have no way of knowing whether hedge funds had “ located ” stock , but if they lied and told their broker , “ Yeah , I located the stock , I got it somewhere , push the sell button , ” then that would be “ fraud . ”
Presumably , the brokers , who depend on the hedge funds for most of their income , and are complicit in their naked short selling , would line up to inform the SEC that their clients were telling them lies .
Meanwhile , the hedge funds would still have three days to deliver stock , with no strong penalties for failing to do so , and no mechanism for determining whether a hedge fund had delivered real stock , as opposed to new phantom stock that it had received from a friendly broker .
As for the “ threshold ” of five consecutive days before a company could get on the list that sets off the flashing red lights that the SEC ignores – that would remain the same .
When these rules were announced , the short - seller lobby cheered loudly .
The media transcribed the lobby ’s cheerful press releases , and then the naked short sellers eliminated Merrill Lynch .
After that , they turned on Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , at which point both stocks went into death spirals and the companies ’
CEOs treated us to the spectacle of calling the SEC to complain that Morgan and Goldman ( ie. , the companies that housed the brokerages that invented and profited the most from naked short selling ) were now getting mauled by their own monstrous creations .
A week later , the Wall Street Journal stated in an editorial that there was “ no evidence ” of naked short selling or market manipulation during this financial crisis .
* * * * * * * *
P.S. I am a former employee of The Wall Street Journal editorial page .
I think it is the finest editorial page in the world .
I enjoyed my time at the Journal .
They let me live in Europe .
I got to write mean things about socialists .
But with genuine respect , I say to my former colleagues – you are like the boy in the bubble .
You live and breath the “ free markets ” paradigm .
This is healthy , but it is limiting .
It is not the real world ..
Please , get out of that bubble .
Get dirty with the data .
Behold the slop in our clearing and settlement system .
Consider how this slop is affecting our market , and tell me what is free or efficient about it .
Please , do it quickly .
If you do not , this nation is screwed .

Gartner put out a five - year outlook for blades a few weeks ago .
While finding that blades are the fastest growing segment of the server market , and they now account for 10 percent of all server shipments , Gartner predicts they will account for only 19 percent of server shipments half a decade into the future .
I beg to differ .
Drew Robb explains why Gartner is wrong about where blades are going .
Gartner 's logic is that blades are not yet mature , so there are still plenty of upheavals lying ahead .
The report zeros in , for example , on a lack of chassis standardization as a major issue .
" Blade servers have a number of proprietary aspects , and the market lacks interoperability standards that lock users in to the technology , " said Gartner 's John Enck .
" In today 's technology , the chassis represents an infrastructure boundary ; compute , storage and network resources cannot span multiple chassis . "
But is this a good enough reason that blade growth should effectively be the same over the next five years as the last five ?
Absolutely not .
Gartner thinks 19 percent of server shipments will be blades by the end of 2012 .
My guess is at least 30 percent for a variety of reasons .
1. Popularity
Blades are sexy , towers are drab .
Blades are cool , rack servers are relatively boring , at least from the perspective of the vendors , analysts and industry press .
Users are going to be hearing a LOT more about blades than any other form factor .
Even in those holdout shops that are quite happy with racks , it 's a cinch that some executive is going to insist on blades sooner or later .
2. Green
Vendors like IBM and HP are headlining their green efforts with an emphasis on blades .
They see it as cost - effective to roll out energy saving features in an integrated cooling and power package as well as a smaller form factor .
3. Storage
There seems to be an inevitable transition ongoing from direct - attached storage to network attached .
It 's happened with the SAN .
It 's even happening with the consumer sector where people store their e-mail online for free in some vast repository .
More and more consumer data now resides in the cloud rather than on the desktop .
So it makes sense to eliminate the hard drives once and for all and hook a bank of blades up to a central storage pool .
As 8 Gbps Fibre Channel and 10 Gbps Ethernet catch hold over the next couple of years , this will make even more sense .
4. Thin Client
Thin client is going to get very very big over the next few years .
Traditional desktops are becoming dinosaurs that are likely to be refreshed out in favor of thin clients that hook up to blades on the back end .
This is currently in the early adopter stage but once it catches hold , I expect this to literally sweep the land .
Unsure About an Acronym or Term ?
Search the ServerWatch Glossary
5. Space
The old ENIAC filled up a massive room .
Steadily over the past years , electronics have gotten smaller .
Remember that old TV set from the fifties .
Instead of going about four feet back , it has shrunk to only about two inches .
How about music  that vast pile of albums that took up an entire wall in your bedroom now do n't take up more than a fraction of the latest iPod .
The blade , then , just represents the inevitable transition of servers down to smaller and smaller form factors .
People want smaller .
Down the ages , we 've gone from messages delivered by real live persons , to letters delivered by horse , to post office delivery to e-mail and text .
The trend is always less space and smaller form factors .
If you can pack the same computer power into a few racks that used to take up a large room , why would n't you  provided you get your act together on power and cooling .
Of course , not all workloads play well on blades .
And many organizations face a nightmare scenario in facilities with grossly inadequate power and cooling infrastructures .
These factors will temper out and out blade dominance , but only a little .
Current stats support the above .
IDC reported 40.8 percent growth in the second quarter for blades .
There may be one way , though , that the Gartner prediction comes true .
Suppose blades get supplanted by an even smaller form factor  the " dagger , " the " pen knife " or perhaps the " nail clipper server . "
After all , pizza boxes had about six months in the limelight before blades overwhelmed them .
The same could happen to the blade .
The small will prevail .

September 20 , 2008 -- “ Will my superannuation [ pension ] fund be next ? ” “ Are my savings safe ? ”
As working people in the developed economies watch the assets of one financial institution after another vaporise into nothingness , tens of millions are asking these dreadful questions .
Yesterday ’s AAA assets are now junk and yesterday ’s “ risk - free ” investments are losing money .
No-one , not even the world ’s central bankers , who are spending sleepless nights arranging rescue bailouts and emergency injections of trillions of dollars into a financial system frozen with fear and distrust , can answer them with 100 % certainty .
Last fortnight ’s actions by US Treasury secretary Henry Paulsen tell us why : on September 12 he refused to bail out Wall Street investment bank Lehmann Brothers , preferring to let firms that had dealt extensively in financial assets based on worthless subprime mortgages go to the wall or be taken over by others .
But on September 17 , faced with the collapse of the American International Group , Paulsen and Federal Reserve chairperson Ben Bernanke decided that the risks of letting the world ’s largest insurance company sink were too great .
AIG was too large — and too enmeshed in global financial markets — to fail .
So , in the free - market , Republican - run US , the state is becoming the owner - operator of a collapsing finance system , with the losses funded by the taxpayer .
Paulsen , Bernanke and their counterparts in Europe , Japan and Australia too will increasingly face this sort of choice : do they let the next stricken financial monster die or put it on government life support ?
And how do they decide , when no one knows where the rest of the toxic financial waste is buried , where interbank lending has nearly dried up and where , according to economic historian Harold James , “ it is impossible to know what solvency means ” ?
Fictitious capital
To understand how the system has arrived at its worst crisis since 1929 , it is necessary to consider some basic features of capitalism and how these have operated over the past 30 years .
Confronted with the decision as to where to invest its money , any business has to make a basic choice : invest in production or in financial assets ( shares , bonds , etc ) .
The decision will be influenced by the expected rate of return on each and its riskiness .
The more that individual firms invest in new production , the greater the overall ( economy - wide ) rate of investment will be , and — on condition that production gets sold profitably — the greater the mass of new value and new profit added .
However , when firms invest in purely financial assets they are deciding to invest in claims on new value and profit , which in itself adds nothing to the mass of value added .
Conventional economics blurs this distinction , but for socialists Karl Marx and Frederick Engels it was central to understanding the boom - bust cycle of capitalism .
They called these claims on future profit fictitious capital .
For example , share certificates are simply “ marketable claims to a share in future surplus value production ” and the share market is “ a market for fictitious capital ” .
Setting up a market for any type of fictitious capital is the equivalent of setting up a casino — a place where people can speculate in these claims on future profit .
During boom times , as the expectation of profit growth drives financial markets higher , the total nominal value of fictitious capital in circulation always grows more rapidly than the actual mass of profits .
The less this gambling is regulated , the more manic it becomes .
However , a point is always reached where more is produced than can be sold profitably .
The mass of profits then shrinks and the prices of the claims on profit shrink even more .
Over the past 30 years , bursting financial bubbles have become more frequent as we have experienced the biggest ever festival of fictitious capital .
In 1980 , world financial assets ( bank deposits , government and private securities , and shareholdings ) amounted to 119 % of global production ; by 2007 that ratio had risen to 356 % .
This state of affairs was the result of the wave of financial deregulation that began in the early 1980s under British PM Margaret Thatcher and US president Ronald Reagan , and then spread out across most of the world .
With every act of deregulation , new financial markets and instruments — new casinos — became possible .
They opened up opportunities to speculate on the future movement of any financial market , to increase borrowing on the basis of expected rises in asset values , and to bundle various forms of fictititious capital into increasingly complex packages .
The economic justification for financial deregulation was that , provided essential standards were maintained , deregulation made it easier to mobilise the world ’s savings for investment and consumption , resulting in greater growth than would otherwise have been the case .
Deregulation also changed the traditional role of big financial firms like Lehman Brothers from intermediaries acting on behalf of major players , like pension funds and insurance companies , to investment bankers acting on their own behalf .
They were joined by commercial and savings banks after the 1999 repeal of the Glass - Seagall Act ( passed in 1933 to stop such banks from gambling away people ’s savings ! ) .
As deregulation gathered pace , it also created a world where the greatest profit went to those who traded the most financial instruments , pressuring everyone to play the same game .
Traders , money managers and financial advisers flogged as much financial product as they could manage , ignoring its dubious quality .
A long period of rapid growth , low inflation and low interest rates — created by the Federal Reserve Bank to counter the 2001 dot.com crash — boosted complacency and willingness to take risks .
From bursting bubble to recession ?
But beneath this orgy of fictitious capital , the wellsprings of real profit began to dry up as mortgage defaults began to rise .
Another reality expressed by Marx was coming into play : “ The ultimate reason for all real crises always remains the poverty and restricted consumption of the masses as opposed to the drive of capitalist production to develop the productive forces as though only the absolute consuming power of society constituted their limit . ”
Credit , especially home mortgages , had extended “ the restricted consumption of the masses ” for a while , but increasingly the credit could n’t be repaid , undermining the value of all financial instruments based on it .
Just before the bubble burst , the credit default swap market ( insuring against credit default ) swelled to a notional value of $ 6.2 trillion before imploding .
And worse is yet to come .
Before the system can begin to recover , asset prices will have to fall massively , producing a further chain of bankruptcies , bailouts and restructurings as the survivors pick over the corpses of the bankrupt .
Tens of thousands of people will lose their jobs .
The potentially bankrupt finance sector will have to be recapitalised , mainly at taxpayer expense .
More seriously still , as consumers are forced to wind back their debt levels , the credit - fed consumption levels of the US will fall , slowing the main motor of the world economy in the 2000s as the economy enters a long repayment period .
More alarming scenarios cannot be discarded :
At present there are more than 100 banks on the watch list of the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission , the body that insures the bank deposits of the mass of working people in the US .
Will the US Treasury be forced to bail out this agency if the poison spreads into the savings bank sector , as in the Great Depression ?
How much will protecting ordinary people ’s savings and recapitalising the finance sector cost the taxpayer ?
To fund bailouts to date the Federal Reserve Bank has had to run down its own holdings of US treasury notes by more than $ 300 billion .
This dwarfs the $ 124 billion spent on rescuing the savings and loan industry in the 1980s .
Former IMF chief economist Kenneth Rogoff says , “ It is hard to imagine how the US government is going to succeed in creating a firewall against further contagion without spending five to 10 times more than it has already , that is , an amount closer to $ 1000 to $ 2000 billion ” ( one to two times Australia ’s annual output ) .
In the end , working people will pay massively for this crisis , either because they will lose part of their savings or because taxes will have to increase and / or social spending decrease to fund the gargantuan rescue package .
In the midst of the wreckage some hard - nosed neoliberal economists still dare to argue that the forces of “ creative destruction ” should be allowed to play themselves out as quickly as possible .
They point to the consequences of rewarding bad financial behaviour , and to the stagnation that ongoing financial bailout produced in Japan ’s economy after the 1980s property bubble exploded .
For these proponents of shock therapy , working people will just have to grit their teeth and bear the factory closures , unemployment , house dispossessions and descent into poverty that ’s involved .
However , it ’s a pretty good sign of the depth of the present crisis that a pillar of financial orthodoxy like the Financial Times is allowing discussion of a third option : nationalisation of the finance sector .
FT columnist Willem Buiter from the London School of Economics wrote on September 17 : “ Is the reality of the modern , transactions - oriented model of financial capitalism indeed that large private firms make enormous private profits when the going is good and get bailed out and taken into temporary public ownership when the going gets bad , with the taxpayer taking the risk and the losses ?
If so , then why not keep these activities in permanent public ownership ? ”
Why not , indeed .

The circles in Isia Leviant ’s ‘ Enigma ’ seem to move – quite why has been a mystery
The cause of an optical illusion , made famous by a 1981 painting , has finally been solved .
See a slideshow of that illusion and others .
Neuroscientists have shown that the way our eyes constantly make tiny movements is responsible for the way concentric circles in Isia Leviant ’s painting ‘ Enigma ’ ( see image , right ) seem to flow before onlookers ’ eyes .
Susana Martinez - Conde and her team from the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix , Arizona , tested whether the effect was down to tiny , involuntary jerks of the eyes , known as microsaccades .
Their purpose is not fully understood , but the rate of these movements is known to vary naturally .
Advertisement
In the team ’s experiment , while three subjects viewed Enigma , cameras recorded their eye movements 500 times every second .
The subjects were asked to press a button when the speed of the optical “ trickle ” of the illusion appeared to slow down or stop , and release it when the trickle seemed faster .
Faster flicker
Accounting for the reaction time required to press the button , the results showed that the illusion became more pronounced when microsaccades were happening at a faster rate .
When the rate slowed to a stop , the illusion vanished .
Those results go against earlier findings that suggested eye movements were not responsible for the effect .
A previous study involved giving volunteers contact lenses with tiny stalks attached that held a version of the illusion , ensuring , the team thought , that it was always stationary relative to the eye .
The volunteers still experienced the illusion , suggesting that the brain actually caused the phenomenon .
But the effect of microsaccades was not taken into account , says Martinez - Conde , since the contact lenses do not keep pace with the eye during such rapid , jerky movements .
“ We can now rule out the idea that the illusion originates solely in the brain , ” she told New Scientist .
Martinez - Conde adds that their research may also explain other similar illusions , such as Bridget Riley ’s Fall , or the Ouchi illusion .
“ It would be unexpected if Enigma is the only illusion affected by eye movements , ” she says .
See a slideshow of that illusion and others .
However , the researchers are still in the dark as to what brain processes link the eye movements and the perception of an illusion .
They intend to develop new experiments to find out .

It ’s circa 2003 and I ’m dating a really hot number named Jess .
I ’m a sophomore and he ’s a first - year graduate student , and I think I ’m the shit because of our vast age difference — 24 to 19 .
Despite being a typical young horny student , I do n’t really know anything about guys or dating .
That ’s why early in the relationship I stupidly ask the following forbidden question : “ How many guys have you been with ? ”
Ask this question at your own peril .
Jess : “ A few . ” Madison : “ How many ?
30 ? 60 ? 2000 ?
Give me a ballpark . ”
Jess : “ You do n’t need to know that .
Let ’s put it this way : I ’ve had my slutty phase . ”
And now , the kicker : “ The bright side is that I ’ve never been with a black guy . ”
Madison : “ Well , I ’m certainly glad to help you meet your quota . ”
There ’s nothing like Affirmative Action dating .
I do n’t really know how I wanted Jess to respond to my query .
I mean , it ’s not like he ’d actually tell me the real number .
I think most people decrease their number by intervals of 10 for significant others , but add on 20 to 30 in front of friends .
In reality , nobody really knows how many people someone has been with at any given time .
So , how many lovers are too many ?
My home girl Whoopi Goldberg recently came out as a slut on The View .
I really gotta watch daytime TV more often .
The four individually fierce bitches were cawfee tawkin’ it up with France ’s smoking hot first lady , Carla Bruni , when Bruni admitted to having 30 lovers .
But Whoopi was like , hahaha bitch !
I got you beat .
I ’ve had over 50 lovers .
Okay , Whoopi , work that cooch !
Can I just say that the bombastic reaction to Whoppi ’s “ Over 50 lovers ? ” comment by various media outlets has been a little unfair ?
First , why does anyone care ?
Everybody ’s like , “ I always knew Whoppi was a heffa ! ” People , please !
Media personalities just love everybody else ’s sex lives , do n’t they ?
Britney ’s a ho .
Lindsay is a celesbian .
Madonna is cheating .
Lance is “ out . ”
Chace is “ in . ”
Sex sells , but damn .
The reason the media picked up on “ over 50 lovers ” is that Whoopi is a woman .
Obvi .
Now settle down : I ’m not ‘ bout to go all Judith Butler on you and be like “ If Whoppi were a dude , nobody would care ; men can put it anywhere and be A.O.K . ”
But really , what ’s the big deal ?
Whoopi is 53 years old .
That ’s like two lovers a year since the age of 25 .
Perfectly within reason .
Now if she ’d been like , “ You guys , I ’m really into Bukkake sessions with 50 men or more , ” then we would all have something to gossip about .
And I ’m sure that a “ Whoopi- Bukkake Tell All ” would sell millions .
That said , the issue is n’t that Whoppi traded her Nun ’s Habits in exchange for over four dozen cocks .
No .
It ’s that people are often embarrassed not just about sex , but about their own sex lives .
Not like ashamed or anything , but embarrassed .
It ’s like , “ ZOMG !
Whoopi has had over 50 lovers and I ’ve only had 12 !
Need .
Botox .
Now . ”
Why else do so many people exaggerate or conceal the number of partners they ’ve had ?
Why else do I get red and giggly when my boyfriend touches me inappropriately in public ?
Or maybe it ’s that when you get into a relationship , nobody wants to know about past sexual adventures .
Unless it involves , oh I do n’t know , Chlamydia .
And you certainly do n’t want to be in bed and then your partner ’s all : “ Well actually , I really liked it when Bob approached it from this side and wore a poncho , ” or , “ You know what ?
Kim used her tongue and did a swirl at the end . ”
There ’s something about feeling that your partner is fresh , clean , innocent , and that s/he would never do anything even remotely scandalous without you , because you want to be the one who totally rocks them out .
Is n’t that why everybody likes a virgin ?
I ’m not Dr. Ruth or anything , but it seems to me that the number of lovers you ’ve had is a likely index of your potential to be unfaithful in a relationship .
Sure , people stray for any number of reasons : curiosity , distance , loneliness , the relationship sucks anyway , or they are just wired to keep having sex with lots of people .
It ’s not like getting into a relationship means that everybody else morphs into eternal ugliness .
But think about it : if you ’re 30 and get into a relationship having already slept with 2000 people , it may be a bit difficult to keep your hands to yourself .
My friend Brian - the - Artist said this to his current bf : “ I really like you but
I need to go to D.C. for the summer to participate in this artists - in - residence program .
I ’ll be back in August .
Will you wait for me ? ”
The bf goes : “ That ’s fine and all .
But I really need to have sex , so I ’m going to do it with a lot of other people .
Is that okay ? ”
That ’s what he actually said .
Not so long ago , it was n’t unusual for a gay to have had thousands of partners .
Just read Samuel Delaney .
But to be honest , I do n’t think the number actually matters , for gays or heterosexualists .
What does is the idea that your bf / gf has been / is going around the block , whether they ’ve had five or 500 partners .
It ’s all in our heads .
Because do n’t nobody want to feel like their mate ’s been picked over .
I mean , unless you get off on that kind of thing , which is cool too .
Microsoft and Washington State officials announced a new partnership today aimed at fighting scareware in general and one specific vendor in particular .
Today is n't such a good day for one James Reed McCreary IV , of The Woodlands , Texas .
Mr. McCreary is the sole director of Branch Software , which created the Registry Cleaner XP program , and the CEO of hosting company Alpha Red .
Scareware , it should be noted , is n't malware — at least , not technically .
Instead of installing its own set of viruses , worms , or Trojans , a scareware program tricks the end user into believing he or she needs the program to correct a nonexistent error within the operating system .
This type of falsified error was a common tactic in the days before Windows XP 's SP1 ( supposedly ) closed the door that made the random pop-ups possible ; I still remember seeing ads pop up on customers ' desks insisting that they needed to download Program X for $ 9.99 to fix this issue .
No one likes the badware industry , but scareware has to be one of Microsoft 's least - favorite types .
It 's the equivalent of a mechanic who wants to change the oil in your serpentine belt , or who insists that the transmission fluid in your car needs to be swapped out every 10,000 miles .
In a best - case scenario , scareware does no harm after the consumer has been tricked into installing it .
Worst case , the stuff is as full of malware , exploits , and / or system - crashing instabilities as the problems it purports to solve .
Malware exploits may give Microsoft a bad reputation in general , but scareware actually charges the user for her own infection , and that tends to make people a wee bit cranky .
Ironically , Microsoft 's reputation ends up tarnished , in this case , by a product that takes advantage of a consumer 's gullibility rather than an OS - related design flaw .
Registry Cleaner XP is an example of exactly this sort of product .
Web 0.5 - styled website that appears to have been written by a kindergartner with an unactivated copy of FrontPage ?
Check .
Product website consists of a single page , with no " About Us " information , list of press contacts , or even a list of other products ?
Check .
Prominent endorsement from nonexistent rating service ?
Check .
WebTronics , if such a service ever existed , does n't appear to exist anymore , and there 's no link to any sort of page promoting that recommendation .
Read through what the program supposedly does , and it's an obvious fraud to those of us who know what to look for , but your average user confronted with bizarre pop-up errors and warnings may not be able to distinguish it from a legitimate piece of software .
Running Registry Cleaner XP , by the way , always results in the program finding errors .
Consumers are then told to pony up $ 39.95 if they want to clean their systems .
James Reed McCreary
AlphaRed 's involvement is harder to quantify .
McCreary is listed as a company employee ( though not as CEO ) , but the firm appears to be a legitimate hosting business .
Legitimate hosting companies can still host plenty of illegitimate activities — ask Atrivo if you do n't believe us — but the links between AlphaRed and any sort of scareware or illicit business are at least slightly camouflaged .
Digging around online , I found vague references to bad experiences with AlphaRed or its onetime affiliate OrangeWire , as well as references to a scammer that went by the name of Chris Gotzmann , aka Michael Sanduval , but most such discussions date back to 2004 - 2006 .
According to Microsoft , AlphaRed sold Registry Cleaner XP , though it 's not apparent how / when such transactions occurred .
In its formal complaint ( PDF ) , Microsoft details the means by which Registry Cleaner XP sought out and attempted to persuade victims to purchase its dubious services .
Redmond charges that McCreary has committed five separate violations of the Consumer Protection Act and / or Washington State 's Computer Spyware Act .
The company than asks for a permanent injunction against McCreary 's products , as well as relief and court costs .
When Microsoft and Washington State announced this new initiative today , Washington Attorney General Rob McKenna had strong words for the companies and programmers that produce and market scareware .
" The Attorney General 's Office along with Microsoft has yanked the fear factor dial out of the hands of businesses that use scareware as a marketing tool and have spun it toward them , " McKenna said .
" We wo n’t tolerate the use of alarmist warnings or deceptive ' free scans ' to trick consumers into buying software to fix a problem that does n’t even exist .
We 've repeatedly proven that Internet companies that prey on consumers ' anxieties are within our reach . "

Could So Many UFO Witnesses Be Right ?
Could all those UFO sightings be real ?
Sept. 12 , 2008  --
For decades , millions of people around the world have reported seeing UFOs hovering in their skies .
It is a mystery that science has been unable to solve , and the phenomenon remains largely unexamined .
Much of the reporting on this subject holds those who claim to have seen UFOs up to ridicule .
" UFOs : Seeing is Believing " takes a serious look at the phenomenon in today 's world .
The 90 - minute special includes interviews with scientists searching for proof of life beyond earth and UFO witnesses who claim aliens are already here .
Building on the original Peter Jennings report in 2005 , David Muir reports on new sightings , as well as NASA 's current search for life on Mars .
The program follows the entire scope of the UFO experience , from the first famous sighting by Kenneth Arnold in 1947 to the present day .
Muir reports on a recent UFO sighting in Stephenville , Texas , where multiple witnesses reported seeing enormous lights moving in strange configurations on the evening of January 8 , 2008 .
He interviews some of the most credible witnesses of the sighting and a radar expert who evaluated their claims and found something surprising in the data .
Sophisticated animations approved by the eyewitnesses allow viewers to get a feel for the experience first hand .
The special draws on interviews with police officers , pilots , military personnel , scientists and ordinary citizens who give extraordinary accounts of encounters with the unexplained .
While professional skeptics about UFOs speak out , including scientists who are leading the search for life forms elsewhere in the universe .
The special also examines the most recent advances in the search for life on other planets .
This past summer , NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander , a robot that tests and analyzes soil on the planet , found conclusive evidence of water ice on Mars .
You 'll hear from scientists on the project about the real possibility of finding life on Earth 's next - door neighbor .
ABC News explores the facts behind the mystery of the incident at Roswell , New Mexico , where , in 1947 , the story goes , the U.S. Government collected the wreckage from a crashed flying saucer .
And you 'll hear from the people who claim they 've been abducted by aliens .
Among the UFO cases presented :
Phoenix , Ariz. , March 1997 --
Thousands witness what many believe was a huge triangular craft moving slowly over the city .
St. Clair County , Ill. , January 2000 -- Police officers in five adjoining towns all independently report witnessing a giant craft with multiple bright lights moving silently across the sky at a very low altitude .
Today , if you report a UFO to the U.S. government , you will be informed that the Air Force conducted a 22 - year investigation which ended in 1969 and concluded that UFOs are not a threat to national security and are of no scientific interest .
But leading theoretical physicist Michio Kaku told ABC , " You simply cannot dismiss the possibility that some of these UFO sightings are actually sightings from some object created by an advanced civilization because … on the off chance that there is something there , that could literally change the course of human history . "
In a moment of unusual candor , Reagan ’s own chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , Martin Feldstein , gave three reasons for the growth of the deficit : the president ’s tax cuts , the increased defense spending and the interest on the expanding national debt .
These were the self - proclaimed fiscal conservatives who were behaving so profligately .
The budget was balanced and a surplus realized under Bill Clinton , but soon the “ fiscal conservatives ” were back in the driver ’s seat .
“ Deficits do n’t matter , ” said Dick Cheney , and the wildest , most reckless of economic rides was on .
Americans , including the Joe Sixpacks , soccer moms and hockey moms , were repeatedly told that the benefits lavished on the highfliers would trickle down to them .
Someday .
Just as they were wrong about trickle down , conservative Republican politicians and their closest buddies in the commentariat have been wrong on one important national issue after another , from Social Security ( conservatives opposed it from the start and have been trying to undermine it ever since ) to Medicare ( Ronald Reagan saw it as the first wave of socialism ) to the environment , energy policy and global warming .
When the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the discoverers of the link between chlorofluorocarbons and ozone depletion , Tom DeLay , a Republican who would go on to wield enormous power as majority leader in the House , mocked the award as the “ Nobel Appeasement Prize . ”
Mr. Reagan , the ultimate political hero of so many Republicans , opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .
In response to the historic Brown v. Board of Education school - desegregation ruling , William F. Buckley , the ultimate intellectual hero of so many Republicans , asserted that whites , being superior , were well within their rights to discriminate against blacks .
“ The White community is so entitled , ” he wrote , “ because , for the time being , it is the advanced race ... ”
He would later repudiate that sentiment , but only after it was clear that his racist view was harmful to himself .
The G.O.P. has done a great job masking the terrible consequences of much that it has stood for over the decades .
Now the mask has slipped .
As we survey the wreckage of the American economy and the real - life suffering associated with the financial crackup of 2008 , it would be well for voters to draw upon the lessons of history and think more seriously about the consequences of the ballots they may cast in the future .
When all else fails , Republicans and their wives turn into monsters .
John McCain and Sarah Palin were backstage , and Lehigh County GOP Chairman Bill Platt was warming up the crowd of 6,000 at a rally here for the Republican ticket .
" Think about how you 'll feel on November 5 if you wake up in the morning and see the news , that Barack Obama -- that Barack Hussein Obama -- is the president - elect of the United States , " Platt said .
The audience at the Lehigh University arena booed at the thought of it .
" The number one most liberal senator in the United States of America was , you guessed it , the ambassador of change , Barack Hussein Obama , " he added .
All journalists covering the McCain - Palin events should take out extra life insurance .
Read Milbank 's entire piece .
He finishes it off with this ..
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The number of banks and other agencies reporting that they have received angry letters containing a powdery substance has risen to 45 in 11 states , and there could be more cases , FBI officials said Wednesday .
Officials said most of the powder - laced letters were sent to branches of JPMorgan Chase .
Wednesday 's count is up from the 30 in eight states that were reported Tuesday .
The FBI , U.S. postal inspectors and state and local authorities are investigating , causing what FBI spokesman Richard Kolko called " a drain on resources " for those agencies .
" Even sending a hoax letter is a serious crime , and law enforcement will continue to work to identify and arrest those responsible , " Kolko said in a statement .
" The FBI and our law enforcement partners are following up on numerous leads , and if anyone has information , they are requested to contact the FBI , USPIS or local authorities . "
Postal inspectors offered a reward of up to $ 100,000 for information leading to the conviction of those behind the hoax letters , which they said were mailed late last week .
As of Tuesday , financial institutions in New York , New Jersey , the District of Columbia , Ohio , Illinois , Colorado , Oklahoma , Georgia and Texas had been targeted by the letters .
Wednesday , that list had grown to include Virginia , California and Arizona , the FBI reported .
Kolko said that field tests on the powder from the letters have found no sign of a hazardous material but that additional tests were being conducted .
The letters contained a message of anger concerning the " banking situation , " one law enforcement official said on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing .
The official said most of the letters have been sent to branches of JPMorgan Chase .
Two other officials said all the letters were postmarked in Amarillo , Texas .
And not all of the recipients were banks , officials said .
Letters were also sent to the offices of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision , federal agencies that oversee financial institutions .
CNN 's Kevin Bohn and Kelli Arena contributed to this report .

Stephon Marbury may be in shape physically to join the Knicks on the court , but the Knicks might finally be ready mentally to part ways with their chaotic point guard .
The Knicks are preparing to put Marbury on waivers by the end of the week , several sources with knowledge of the situation told Newsday .
The team must await the go - ahead from Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan , however , because it would involve eating another large chunk of money in a buyout , Newsday reported .
Trying to make a good impression ,
Stephon Marbury showed up at new coach Mike D'Antoni's news conference in May .
Mike Stobe / Getty Images
Marbury is entering the final year of his contract , worth $ 21.9 million .
Once Marbury clears waivers and a buyout is agreed upon , he would be free to sign with any team .
Reports in Newsday and the South Florida media have mentioned the Miami Heat , who are in need of a point guard , as having interest .
According to Newsday , Marbury has recovered from January 's left ankle surgery , which was needed to remove bone spurs , and has worked out all summer in Southern California , trimming his weight to 200 pounds .
He did not join the other Knicks veterans for scrimmages at the team 's training center until Monday , even though the informal workouts had been going on since last week .
Marbury 's best performance statistically in 4 ½ seasons with the Knicks was in 2004 - 05 , when he averaged 21.7 points and 8.1 assists a game .
Since then , his numbers have declined , even as his feuding with his bosses and his teammates increased .
Marbury had numerous conflicts with former Knicks coaches Larry Brown and Isiah Thomas .
The low point may have been in November 2007 , when
Marbury left without permission and returned to New York while the team was in Phoenix for a game .
The Knicks signed guard Anthony Roberson in July , a further indication that they were ready to jettison Marbury .
Roberson played 36 career NBA games with Memphis and Golden State , but spent last season in Turkey and Israel .
The Knicks signed him to a deal after he averaged 14.8 points in five games for their summer league team .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
Both presidential candidates have now issued answers to a series of questions about science policy , Senator Barack Obama having done so in late August and Senator John McCain on Monday .
Their responses show clear areas of agreement on such apple - pie issues as ocean health , as well as sharp contrasts , as when Mr. Obama stresses the role of government and Mr. McCain that of business in addressing some of the nation ’s main challenges .
What follows is a digest of their answers , as posted by Science Debate 2008 .
The private group , in an effort endorsed by leading scientific organizations , has worked since November to get candidates to articulate positions on science policy .
The full answers are at www.sciencedebate2008.com.
INNOVATION Mr. Obama calls for doubling federal budgets for basic research over a decade and supports broadband Internet connections “ for all Americans . ”
Mr. McCain stresses policies to provide “ broad pools of capital , low taxes and incentives for research in America , ” as well as the streamlining of “ burdensome regulations . ”
Mr. McCain also said Congress , “ under my guiding hand , ” adopted wireless policies that “ spurred the rapid rise of mobile phones and WiFi technology . ”

Brad , a friend sent me this as well - with so many new Obama silkscreens floating around these days it 's sort of an oddly relevant point : PLEASE , PLEASE , PLEASE ADVISE EVERYONE YOU KNOW THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT GO TO THE POLLS WEARING ANY OBAMA SHIRTS , PINS OR HATS .
IT IS AGAINST THE LAW AND WILL BE GROUNDS TO HAVE THE POLLING OFFICIALS TO TURN YOU AWAY .
It can be CONSIDERED CAMPAIGNING AND NO ONE CAN CAMPAIGN WITHIN 100 FEET of THE POLLS .
THEY ARE BANKING ON US BEING EXCITED AND NOT BEING AWARE OF THIS LONG STANDING LAW THAT YOU CAN BET WILL BE ENFORCED THIS YEAR !
THEY ARE BANKING THAT IF YOU'RE TURNED AWAY YOU WILL NOT GO HOME AND CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES AND COME BACK ...
PLEASE JUST DON'T WEAR OBAMA GEAR OF ANY SORTS TO THE POLLS !
PLEASE SHARE THIS INFORMATION , OH AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE ALREADY AWARE THIS WAS NOT MEANT TO INSULT YOUR INTELLIGENCE .
JUST TRYING TO COVER ALL GROUNDS . >>

The email is hoax , but how many well - meaning but low - information poll workers in contentious swing states will know there is no problem with folks wearing campaign memorabilia when they go to vote ?
How many challengers will be laying / lying in wait for victims to challenge at the precinct level , to take advantage of the voters ' and pollworkers ' lack of knowledge about the rules on clothing ?
It only takes a few wrenches thrown in the works here and there to create long lines and other distractions that get in the way of people actually voting .

There should be a " counter flyer " which says someone spoke to the McCain - Bush campaign and wants us to put out a flyer all over America to warn Karl Rove , Harriet Miers and all the other Bush administration officials to NOT show up at polling places because they might be hauled away in chains .
At least it 's partialy true !
I wonder where Ann Coulter will be voting and whether anyone will notice .

Brad : I do n't understand how you mean " scam " here .
From the link it seems that the email is about whether or not people at the precinct level can " get away " with intimidation and harassment such as " passive electioneering " .
In fact the link you sent suggests carrying extra clothes and etc. since the local officil may be unobserved and capable of this voter suppression .
It is weird that the text is so specifically the same .
But is n't that from lots of fwd.ing ?
WRH 's Rivero points to the Cointelpro fbi habits of writing these in the past as being manifest by repub operatives today , and we have the clear evidence of the tactic agaist McCain in South Carolina back in 2000 by Rove on behalf of Bush ... but in this case , is n't the warning valid ?
I mean to say , " Do n't wear Obama promotional material because some foul - playing Republican poll worker might try to hassle you ?
I do n't see the scam there ...

Hey Brad , this is off topic , but just wanted to tell you that I was pleased to catch you on the Tavis Smiley show tonight on NPR radio , and I thought you did a great job .
The Republican dude sure was annoying with his disinformation and the way he kept trying to make it about " voter - fraud " .
You handled him pretty well I thought , and you would have been better if Smiley had let you .
Smiley sure was under - informed on these issues .
He should know better .
Keep up the good work .
In the love of truth , John

Brad ,
I wanted to applaude your efforts at addressing an issue that has been a serious threat to this country for far too long .
The attack on our elections are the most serious threat to our democracy that has ever taken place , even more serious that any attack that has led to war .
For those who would say this is overstating this issue , I would respond that your ignorance is part of the reason it continues to occur ; refusing to inform yourselves , even when another warns you of the existence of these issues / threats , is the trojan horse being used , to perpetrate them .
We , as citizens of the greatest democracy in history , are being attacked from within , and if we do not fight back , are at risk of losing what so many others died protecting .
We must remember that our democracy / republic is not something that can be just taken for granted ; it 's not just simply going to always exist , and I suspect that if we , as citizens , continue with this apathy , in regard to this , we will lose it .
The battle has long started , and those who wish to destroy this gift have a huge head start .
But we have great equalizers to this , and your effort is a shining example of that .
I look forward to viewing more of your work , and pray that your energy sustains you , in this most serious battle .
This can not be more serious .
Our lives , as we know them to be , are at risk .
It is obvious that you understand this , and I sincerely thank you for all of your efforts .

In addition the obvious hoaxes , the Rupublic Party operatives are going to continue to have poll workers demand to see photo ID - even where this is clearly not required by law .
The ONLY way they can defeat Obama is through voter fraud the GOP way - delay , deny or derail valid voters from going to the polls .
It has worked before ... but this time , many of us are aware of the con , and how it is played .

Magic Johnson Faked AIDS Say KTLK 100.3 Radio Jocks
and , on their KTLK 100.3 radio show in Minneapolis yesterday , said that they are convinced that the former Los Angeles Lakers starfaked AIDS .
While on the air yesterday the conversation went like this :
PERRY : What about diseases that are eminently treatable and you can live with for a long , long time quite happily if you just get some basic drugs ?
BAKER : Like Magic Johnson .
PERRY : Like Magic with his fake AIDS .
BAKER : You think Magic faked AIDS for sympathy ?
PERRY : I 'm convinced that Magic faked AIDS .
BAKER : Yeah , me too .
PERRY : ' Cause he 's the only cured AIDS guy ever .
Michael Rand of the Minneapolis Star - Tribune , overheard the exchange and decided to contact the former NBA great to get Magic 's reaction .
Johnson said :
" I am extremely disappointed in KTLK in Minneapolis .
I am outraged that Chris Baker and Langdon Perry would minimize such a serious and deadly issue .
Millions are dying of HIV / AIDS and the fact that they would make jokes about my status is unbelievable .
Chris , Langdon and KTLK should use their power in a more positive light by encouraging people to get tested for this disease instead of making up such ridiculous lies . "
The 49 year old Johnson was diagnosed with AIDS in 1991 .
He was inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame in 2002 and was named Greatest Point Guard of All Time by ESPN in 2007 .
Magic and his wife Cookie have a son Earvin III and a daughter Elisa .
Something tells us this might not be the end of the story ....

" What the Bail - Out does is saddle the country and all its ' taxpayers ' with new trillions of debt and makes it such that every ' taxpayer ' , regardless of how wise , cautious and frugal he may be , owes loads of Federal Reserve Notes ( money ) to the Federal Reserve Banking system .
What will the ' taxpayers ' receive for this new tax saddle ?
The answer is that they have received and will receive nothing .
Almost all of the Bail - Out money goes to the corporations whose errand boys like Greenspan , Paulson , Bernanke , Dimon , Mozilo and Fuld carried out the debt trap that was set 9 - 10 years ago . " [ emphasis added ] ~ John Olagues , The Real Reason Behind the Bail - Out **

The Vampire State Collapses , Having Drained Its Host
Nearly a century ago , two audacious mechanisms were put into place to drain wealth and power from the American people and to funnel that wealth and power to an elite .
Today 's crisis has arisen because essentially all of our wealth and power has by now been taken from us , and the illusion of normalcy can no longer be maintained .
Symptoms of the collapse are everywhere and visible throughout nearly every facet of society , although the financial and economic elements have recently taken center stage .
The level of debt in America is almost beyond belief ; we have all seen the numbers and they are incomprehensible -- far too large to make sense in human terms .
The on - book national debt has passed ten trillion dollars .
Unfunded federal liabilities , calculated as a business would calculate them , are in the neighborhood of one hundred trillion dollars .
State , county , and local governments are also deep in debt , to the point where , for example , the " Governator " of California recently asked the feds for a $ 7 billion loan to cover the state 's budget deficit , because it was unclear whether the state would be able to borrow enough money from investors to pay its bills .
Yes , California , the world 's seventh - largest economy all by itself , is near bankruptcy , although it did manage to sell $ 5 billion in bonds ( more debt ! ) last week .
Plenty of businesses and other organizations are also deep in debt ; families and individuals are drowning in debt while employment and other measures of economic health are looking grim and getting worse .
Almost half of Southern California house sales are now foreclosures .
Banks , insurance companies , auto manufacturers , and other entities are absorbing multi-billion dollar , even trillion - dollar injections of cash ( mostly from the government via the Federal Reserve - - money created from thin air ) and yet are still in danger of going under .
And that 's just the economic bad news .
Actually , it 's just a partial listing of the visible economic bad news .
What on Earth has happened to this country ?
Speaking mostly of our intensifying economic nightmare , Sam Mathid sums it this way in a recent column :
" We expropriated and wasted not only such real wealth ( production ) as there has been in the present times , but we wasted the accumulated wealth of all the preceding generations , and finally ( and most disgusting of all ) we then went into vast debt and consumed the wealth of future generations .
" The whole lot , every last nickel , has either been doled out in the gutter of political corruption , or flushed down Wall Street 's slimy drain ; all abetted by a malign , mumbo- jumbo nonsense called Keynesian economics .
Nowhere is there reference to prior criminality and stupidity on such a grand scale .
There is no historical precedent . "
-- Sam Mathid ,
It is Time [ emphasis added ]
The problems Mathid identifies , and our loss of freedom *** and other problems as well , all have their root in the two mechanisms that created and which define our vampire state -- the twin evils of income taxation and fiat currency .
Most of our bloated government itself as well as the blatant , government - enabled misbehavior of American corporations of today and yesterday ( Blackwater , Halliburton , AIG , major investment banks , United Fruit , etc. ad nauseum ) result from this epic redirection of wealth and power by coercion ( income taxation ) and by stealth ( the Federal Reserve ) from the American people to the United States government and from there to favored groups , industries , corporations , foreign governments , and individuals .

" Humanity has won its battle .
Liberty now has a country . "
~ Marquis de Lafayette
" O ye that love mankind !
Ye that dare oppose , not only the tyranny , but the tyrant , stand forth !
Every spot of the old world is overrun with oppression .
Freedom hath been hunted round the globe .
Asia , and Africa , have long expelled her .
Europe regards her like a stranger , and England hath given her warning to depart .
O! receive the fugitive , and prepare in time an asylum for mankind . "
~ Thomas Paine , Common Sense
Arguing over whether the income tax and the Federal Reserve are legal or not misses the point : Slavery was legal in much of America until 1865 ; the stunning yet well - known truth is that the Constitution originally sanctioned slavery in plain language .
Prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s and early 1930s was legal , allowed via Constitutional amendment .
Likewise , income taxation was sanctioned by another amendment to the Constitution ; popular arguments aside , the income tax appears as legal as anything else in America .
But just because something is legal does not make it right or positive -- many laws and policies are neither -- and bad law should be repealed .
America ended slavery and alcohol prohibition , and we should certainly end both the privately - owned Federal Reserve and the taxation of income , replacing the inflationary fiat currency the Fed issues with a stable currency backed by gold and silver , and replacing the income tax with nothing .
For most of this nation 's history , we had neither a fiat currency nor an income tax , and during that time America became the wealthiest nation in the world and a haven for those seeking both prosperity and freedom from tyranny .
We desperately need to reclaim America 's original ideals .
Our ultimate goal must be a truly non-coercive society - - a society where love and freedom are the norm -- and until we succeed , we must at least strive to reduce the level of government violence , coercion , and fraud to a minimum .
Henry David
Thoreau put it well right at the start of Civil Disobedience :
" I heartily accept the motto , ' That government is best which governs least ' ; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically .
Carried out , it finally amounts to this , which also I believe -- ' That government is best which governs not at all . ' "
As a direct result of allowing our nation to drift so far from its heritage of relative freedom , many trillions of dollars in wealth ( both directly and via inflation of the money supply ) have been taken from the American people and redirected to special interests of all kinds over the past century , with the largest portion going to war and war - related businesses and government empires ( e.g. , the Pentagon ) .
This " grand theft America " has caused vast market distortions , business and government corruption , human pain and suffering , and many millions of deaths around the world .
It is now causing a global financial crisis that will , before it is over , be unprecedented in human history .

Ripples and Dominoes
It is worth emphasizing that Americans have been devastated not only by our unfolding national bankruptcy but also by secondary effects of the epic , on - going confiscation of their wealth .
Indeed , people around the world have been harmed by these effects .
The problems include two world wars and dozens of lesser wars ; a military - industrial complex which has grown to breathtaking size and expense ( we spend roughly as much on our military as the rest of the world combined does on theirs , so the pressure to get a war on somewhere is constant ) ; corruption of many governments around the globe ; American - engineered coups and destabilization of democratic regimes ; a bizarre " war on drugs " that has wrongfully imprisoned millions of non-violent people and created horrific violence in many nations ; intense and needless poverty in nations that might otherwise have created some measure of prosperity ; the stunning rise of corporatism ( which had previously existed but has now become powerful almost beyond imagining ) ; malregulation ( a form and symptom of corporatism , actually ) leading to corrupt and harmful behavior in industries such as banking and finance ( regulated by the SEC and other government entities ) , pharmaceuticals ( FDA and others ) , and even food and supplements ( the FDA , the USDA -- which has been preventing cattle producers from testing their herds for Mad Cow - - and more ) -- all this and a great many other devastating symptoms have been caused by the pathological over - growth of government power , enabled by the twin evils of income taxation and central banking in the United States .
Do n't miss the forest for the trees : a huge cascade of bad news over the past 95 years -- from our needless entry into World War I to the Great Depression of the 1930s ; from the war in Vietnam to the current implosion of your retirement fund -- has its genesis in the greatest robbery ever conceived , much less carried out : the constant , ongoing redistribution of wealth from the ordinary Americans who create the wealth to a favored elite , via income taxation and fiat currency .
The most productive and wealthiest nation to ever exist has been plundered into poverty right under our noses , and the plunder continues .

There Are No Beginnings ; Only Inflection Points
Even more distant events have played roles in the gestation of our present crisis .
For example , had the Articles of Confederation not been replaced by the Constitution , America would have no central government as we understand the term today and thus there would have been no coercive body to provide a nationwide monopoly charter to the Federal Reserve or to any other such central bank ; nor would we have a national income tax .
Other inflection points , both nearer and more distant in time , can be identified as well ; for example , the Federal Reserve is not the first central bank America has been saddled with , and Andrew Jackson 's successful fight against the Second Bank of the United States remains a dramatic and instructive piece of American history .
As for the future , the very least we can expect is sharply lower living standards for American citizens , with further financial assault from government at every level .
For example :
" As a hint of what is to come , Nancy Pelosi has stated that she wants to tax your 401 k with a one - time levy or even a levy on appreciation or contribution , never mind that you already pay tax when you withdraw the money to spend in retirement .
" The economy will continue to worsen .
With essential government funds redirected to pay off the bankers and make sure they do n't suffer , you will instead , along with all of the businesses and industry that make this nation great , never mind providing you with a paycheck . "
-- Karl Denninger , America Has Died - To Thunderous Applause

Toxic Paradigms as Weapons Against Humanity
How have the power elite gotten away with such a brazen scheme -- with simply appropriating much of the wealth that you and so many other Americans have worked so hard for over the past 95 years ?
Simple : they taught you to question freedom , to obey authority , to believe that coercion is necessary for civil society , to believe that only coercive government can implement compassion for the poor and others in need , and to believe other toxic nonsense designed to legitimize the taking of wealth and power from the people , and handing that wealth and power to an elite .
For that matter , those in power taught this nonsense to previous generations going back to at least the start of coercive government schooling in the 1840s ( see also this excellent video with John Taylor Gatto [ 8 min 56 sec ] on " state controlled consciousness " ) .
By now , the original idea of America -- as a haven for mankind and a place where freedom from tyranny was the plainly - stated and largely - attained goal -- has simply been lost .
The concept and benefits of freedom are no longer understood by the majority of Americans ; the all - powerful State and its shackles are now everywhere , including deep in the mind of the average person .
The classical liberal movement understood , if vaguely , that love and freedom were different aspects of a unified and unbreakable whole , and that both qualities were necessary for a healthy society .
We will not see real progress in fixing our current problems until we first relearn that truth .
The elites have taken that understanding from us , and done so quite deliberately .
It is time to begin reversing the damage .
America never fully got it right ; we put too much power in the hands of government -- even at the start , when government was a mere speck compared to today -- and we never explicitly enunciated and supported the need for non-coercively provided love and compassion , especially for the young .
Love and freedom : there is no other salvation , nor any other long - term solution to the unfolding global crisis .
Notes :
* Part of this column title was suggested to me by the broken - English phrase " All your base are belong to us " ( from a Japanese video game ) that became an internet sensation in 2001 .
The whole fad may have vanished from popular memory in a few more years , and thus this note .
** Mr. Olagues is among those who believe we are headed for hyper - deflation rather than hyper-inflation .
From the linked column :
" Contrary to Ron Paul 's forecast of hyper- inflation , which will only take place if the increased money supply goes to the hands of the consumers and does not create a corresponding amount of debt , there may be a severe demand for dollars and hyper - deflation , where the country and the people have no money to buy goods and services but only debts .
" The bankers have discovered a way to force the people of America and the world into an intense form of debt slavery and that is the reason for their reckless past lending practices , credit cards for all and now this massive Wall Street Bankers Bail - Out . "
*** Check out Naomi Wolf 's list of Ten Steps to Fascism ( which the Bush administration has clearly been following ) for a disquieting look at another type of bad news for America .
For that matter , see my Open Letter to the Red Cross from November 2006 , regarding the gulag of detention camps -- or " concentration camps " as the Germans called them -- that Halliburton recently built here in America on a $ 385 million no -bid contract .
Then there are the numerous pieces of new police - state legislation ( the Patriot Act , the Military Commissions Act of 2006 , and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 , and others ) , systematic use of torture , signing statements , executive orders , repressive new federal agencies ( Homeland Security and TSA , for example ) all clearly aimed more at intimidating and controlling American citizens than defending against terrorists ; the Patriot Act was almost immediately used against U.S. citizens in ordinary criminal cases ( see here for another example ) -- which we had been assured would never happen -- and we have now seen protesters at the Republican National Convention being charged with " terrorism . "
Let 's not forget the ominous deployment , as of October first , of American military to patrol American streets .
In short , a vigorous assault on American rights and freedoms has accompanied the accelerating economic decline .
Take some time to read and enjoy the fantastic mods and concept designs of Playstation Portable ( PSP ) .
1. Undiluted Platinum - World 's first PSP Modchip
T his mod will act as a flash replacement system for the PSP which allow the use of previous flash updates or custom flash builds .
Installation has been optimized to fit entirely inside PSP , this opens up the possibility to run unsigned Homebrew code on the latest PSP systems . ( MAXCONSOLE )
2. Awesome God of War Themed PSP Case Mod
C reated by Morpheon Mods , the guys behind the Zelda - themed Wii and DS mods .
The PSP has been airbrushed metallic bronze and then tarnished to give it a worn look .
It comes with hand - sculpted symbols that have been copper - leafed onto the handheld ad real chains edge the system .
Even the buttons were removed and replaced with copper versions .
Finally the shoulder buttons have been replaced with crystal red buttons that house tiny red LEDs .
3. Control an XBOX with a Sony PSP
The person who brought you the homebrew tic -tac - toe game that connected the PSP and Nintendo DS together has been at it again !
This time he has made a hardware mod that allows the person to control an XBOX with his or her Nintendo DS or Sony PSP .
Hardware Layout is shown below .
4. PSP modded for internal camera and speakers
C reated by Acid Mods member Rex and his R&D team .
Not only did Rex add some presumably improved speakers , but he managed to squeeze in an internal camera that , judging from the video after the break , appears to work remarkably well .
5. PSP Phone Mod
S ome really talented guy managed to mod his PSP and integrated what appears to be a HAIER mobile phone with a touchscreen to the back of the PSP .
It works , however you lose the UMD drive .
6. PSP of the Future
R eached a deal with Samsung to purchase 8 GB flash memory chips which will be built in according to industry reportsMiniature hard disk drives are out .
It will be streamlined and thinner and lighter .
Sony is still expected to include a still / video camera of undetermined resolution as a built - in feature of the new PSP .
7. Amazing PSP Redesigned
A new PSP is n't likely to come any time soon .
However , that has n't stopped this designer from making his own concept design .
We have to admit , this is really quite attractive .
When closed , the unit looks very iPhone - esque , with a sexy PlayStation button that would act like the PSP's " Home " button .
8. Another PSP Phone Concept
It looks like it ’s a dual slider that slides up for the phone keypad or at an angle for the PSP controls .
Sure , you might lose the UMD slot with this design , but it ’s on its way out already , so by the time this phone would be released , you should be good to go .
9 . Interfacing with the PSP Remote port
Why is having serial communications between a PSP and a PC an interesting feat ?
This is interesting because it can provide us with a very wide array of facilities :
- Debug output for application development :
This is already happening - Check out the excellent PSPLink by TyRaNiD !
- Serial console for any Linux port ( a must have device indeed ! ) or any other applications
- The serial protocol is a simple , well known and robust protocol , with loads of existing applications ready to be used .
You could even use a PSP for dial up access or GPS !
- Hijacking the UART4 PSP driver to use the Remote UART might give us access to the low level debug functions of the PSP without the need to tear it apart in order to access the internal UART4
Also :
- The remote is a very optional device for the PSP => it can be used for other purposes ( eg. debug ) without interfering with standard operations ( USB , WiFi , ... )
- As a serial device , IRDA could be used as well , but not everybody has an IRDA receiver .
On the other hand , almost every computer out there has a serial port ( sorry Mac users - this is the one thing that Apple did get wrong ! )
- The cable is very inexpensive / simple to build ( see below ) , and not doubt someone out there will be selling ready made cables for the PSP at some stage
- Rumoured additional capabilities of the Remote Port like re-flash ( this is very doubtful , but who knows ... )
- The Remote driver is probably the best driver to experiment with for development ( low footprint , simple , loads of serial code samples out there )
10 . CollecTic - Interactive PSP Game
Jonas Hielscher has developed an interactive PSP game called " CollecTic " , which basically " has you running around outside trying to collect WLAN access points with your portable " .
Video after the jump .
11 . PSP Robot Remote v0.3
Netoo is back at it again , he 's released a version 0.3 of his PSP Robot Remote .
This version includes a new graphical menu and other goodies that you 'll see in the video .
12 . PSP Motion Sensor
A modder has managed to create a motion sensor for the PSP -- running the game Mercury .
13 . PSP - Controlled Honda Civic
American amp specialists Metro Electrics have taken PSP hacking to a new level with a concept car they showcased at the recent CES 2006 .
The former ' 94 Honda Civic was given a funky paint - job , hollowed out and packed with a working electric engine , 24 LCD screens , " more speakers than an Aerosmith concert " and three amps .
They also made it remote - controllable by PSP ; with a Wi -Fi connection you can use the handheld to open the doors , switch the lights and even drive the thing down the road ( igniq ) .
14 . Gold and Diamond Studded Playstation Postable
The Baby Phat by Kimora Lee Simmons piece is made with one pound of gold and 8ct yellow and black diamonds on the front and crock finishing on the back .
Baby Phat and Phat Farm logos accented with Simmons Jewelry Co diamonds dangle from the bottom of the luxurious accessory .
The $ 35,000 design easily fits over any PSP to add extra bling .

Electric vehicles web - journal EV World has done the English - speaking world a favor by translating an excellent Peak Lithium story written last week by Le Monde journalist Hervé Kempf .
What is Peak Lithium you ask ?
The notion that a wholesale shift to EVs powered by lithium batteries in response to peaking petroleum production could just as quickly exhaust the global supply of lithium metal .
Kempf credits a May 2008 study by consultancy Meridian International Research — The Trouble with Lithium 2 — as the source of growing concern over peak lithium ; the study concluded that reasonable increases in lithium production over the next decade will generate enough of the light , energetic metal to produce batteries for only 8 million batteries of the sort that GM plans to use in its Chevy Volt plug - in hybrid .
But he does his own homework , providing an accessible introduction to the geological distribution of lithium and its likely magnitude .
I say ‘ likely ’ because Kempf shows that industrial secrecy makes it difficult to assess the probability of a peak lithium scenario prematurely squelching the electrification of the automobile .
As George Pichon , CEO of French metals trader Marsmétal puts it in Kempf ’s piece , the world of a lithium metal is “ un monde fermé . ”
Alas , it ’s just a little less closed today thanks to Le Monde and EV World .

In Mr. Paulson ’s plan , the Treasury would have the right to buy as much as $ 700 billion worth of troubled investments , with the taxpayer recouping the proceeds when those investments were sold over coming years .
But many economists 
Mr. Elmendorf among them  argue that taxpayers should get more out of the deal , securing stock in the banks that make use of the bailout .
The government could then sell off that stock at a profit when conditions improve .
A similar approach was used successfully in Sweden in the early 1990s when its financial system melted down .
Others argue that any bailout must pinch the people who have run the companies now needing rescue , along with their shareholders , addressing the unseemly reality that executives have amassed beach houses and fat bank accounts while taxpayers are now stuck with the bill for their reckless ways .
“ It absolutely has to be punitive , ” Mr. Baker said .
“ If they sell us the junk , then we own the company .
This is n’t a way to make these companies and their executives rich .
This should be about keeping them in business so the financial system does n’t collapse . ”
Other questions center on how to value what the Treasury aims to purchase  an issue that goes to the heart of the crisis itself .

The financial system got to its dangerous perch by betting extravagantly on real estate .
When housing prices began plummeting and borrowers stopped making payments , financial institutions found themselves with huge inventories of bad loans .
Not simple loans , but complex investments created by pooling millions of mortgages together and then slicing them into pieces .
These were the investments that Wall Street bought , sold and borrowed against in cooking up the money it poured into housing .
The trouble is that these investments are so intertwined and complex that no one seems able to figure out what they are worth .
So no one has been willing to buy them .
This is why banks have been in lockdown mode : with mystery enshrouding both the value of their assets and their future losses , banks have held tight to their remaining dollars , depriving the economy of capital .
NICOSIA ( Reuters ) - A slowdown in the world economy may give the planet a breather from the excessively high carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions responsible for climate change , a Nobel Prize winning scientist said on Tuesday .
Nobel Prize laureate and atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen speaks during a Reuters interview in Nicosia October 7 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Andreas Manolis
Atmospheric scientist Paul J Crutzen , who has in the past floated the possibility of blitzing the stratosphere with sulfur particles to cool the earth , said clouds gathering over the world economy could ease the earth ’s environmental burden .
Slower economic growth worldwide could help slow growth of carbon dioxide emissions and trigger more careful use of energy resources , though the global economic turmoil may also divert focus from efforts to counter climate change , said Crutzen , winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on the depletion of the ozone layer .
“ It ’s a cruel thing to say ... but if we are looking at a slowdown in the economy , there will be less fossil fuels burning , so for the climate it could be an advantage , ” Crutzen told Reuters in an interview .
“ We could have a much slower increase of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere ... people will start saving ( on energy use ) ... but things may get worse if there is less money available for research and that would be serious . ”
CO2 emissions , released by the burning of fossil fuels in power stations , factories , homes and vehicles , are growing at almost 3.0 percent a year .
The U.N. Panel on Climate Change estimates that world temperatures may rise by between 1.8 and 4.0 degrees Celsius ( 3.2 - 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit ) this century .
The Group of Eight industrial nations agreed in July to a goal of halving world emissions by 2050 .

Crutzen was in Cyprus for a lecture organized by the Cyprus Institute , a research foundation .
He caused a stir with the publication of a paper in 2006 suggesting that injecting the common pollutant sulfur into the stratosphere some 10 miles above the earth could snuff out the greenhouse effect .
He believes that dispersing 1 million tons of sulfur into the stratosphere each year , either on balloons or in rockets , would deflect sunlight and cool the planet .
Scientists observed that world temperatures dropped by 0.5 degrees centigrade on average when Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted in 1991 , spewing sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere , and Crutzen said the idea originated with a Russian scientist about 30 years ago .
“ I am not saying we should do it , but it is one of the options if we continue under present conditions .
We should study it , ” he said .
“ If you look beyond a decade , two decades , and nothing has been done ( to counter warming ) then we will have a very serious problem on our hands . ”
Sulfur is a component of acid rain , which has harmful effects on plants and fish .
“ Acid rain is caused by sulfur dioxide emissions from the ground , from the chimneys , and it ’s 50 million tons per year .
The experiment in the stratosphere would be one million tons of sulfur per year .
It ’s negligible , ” he said .
It would be an extreme endeavor , but for extreme circumstances , he said .
In a 2007 report , the U.N. climate change panel said such geo-engineering options were largely speculative and unproven , with the risk of unknown side effects .
Reliable cost estimates had not been published , it said .
“ The price is not a major factor ... it ’s peanuts , ” said Crutzen .
“ The cost has been estimated by some at 10 , 20 million U.S. dollars a year . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. and Iraqi negotiators have agreed on a draft of a status - of - forces agreement authorizing U.S. troop presence in Iraq , a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday .
The U.S. wants troops in Iraq to be immune from Iraqi law .
The two governments are reviewing the drafts , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Thursday .
Morrell said Defense Secretary Robert Gates " is in the process of consulting closely with members of Congress " on the draft agreement .
Meanwhile , Iraq 's Political Committee on National Security is also reviewing the draft , Morrell said , citing Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh .
" We are close , but not at the final status yet , " Morrell said .
" And as soon as it is final , I think then we can talk in more specificity about what is actually included in it . "
The United States ' insistence that its troops and contractors remain immune from Iraqi law has been a key obstacle to reaching an agreement , U.S. and Iraqi officials have said .
A U.N. mandate authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq expires December 31 , and U.S. officials are examining " contingencies " in case the Iraqi government is unable to sell the status - of - forces deal to the country 's various factions , a senior U.S. official said earlier this week .
Other developments :
• Representatives from Bahrain , Syria , Jordan and Spain took their posts Thursday as ambassadors to Iraq after submitting their credentials to Iraq 's president , the Iraqi government said .
• The governments of Iran and Iraq signed an agreement Thursday aimed at jointly clarifying the fate of those missing from the Iran - Iraq war in the 1980s , the International Committee of the Red Cross said .
The document , signed in Geneva along with the ICRC , establishes a clear framework for collecting information and sharing it between the two countries , the Red Cross said .
It also establishes a framework for handing over human remains .
CNN 's Saad Abedine and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .

Followup to : Are Your Enemies Innately Evil ? , Policy Debates Should Not Appear One - Sided
" The financial crisis is not the crisis of capitalism .
It is the crisis of a system that has distanced itself from the most fundamental values of capitalism , which betrayed the spirit of capitalism . "
-- Nicolas Sarkozy
During the current crisis , I 've more than once heard someone remarking that financial - firm CEOs who take huge bonuses during the good years and then run away when their black - swan bets blow up , are only exercising the usual capitalist values of " grab all the money you can get " .
I think that a fair amount of the enmity in the world , to say nothing of confusion on the Internet , stems from people refusing to contemplate the real values of the opposition as the opposition sees it .
This is something I 've remarked upon before , with respect to " the terrorists hate our freedom " or " the suicide hijackers were cowards " ( statements that are sheerly silly ) .
Real value systems - as opposed to pretend demoniacal value systems - are phrased to generate warm fuzzies in their users , not to be easily mocked .
They will sound noble at least to the people who believe them .
Whether anyone actually lives up to that value system , or should , and whether the results are what they are claimed to be ; if there are hidden gotchas in the warm fuzzy parts - sure , you can have that debate .
But first you should be clear about how your opposition sees itself - a view which has not been carefully optimized to make your side feel good about its opposition .
Otherwise you 're not engaging the real issues .
So here are the traditional values of capitalism as seen by those who regard it as noble - the sort of Way spoken of by Paul Graham , or P. T. Barnum ( who did not say " There 's a sucker born every minute " ) , or Warren Buffett :
Make things that people want , or do things that people want done , in exchange for money or other valuta .
This is a great and noble and worthwhile endeavor , and anyone who looks down on it reveals their own shallowness .
Your competitors are your loyal opposition .
Usher them toward oblivion by offering a better product at a lower price , then dance on their graves ( or buy them out , if they 're worthy ) .
An act of violence , like punching them in the nose , is as absolutely forbidden as it would be to a scientist - violence is reserved for the thuggish lower classes , like politicians .
Plan for the long term , in your own life and in your company .
Short - term thinkers lose money ; long - term thinkers get to pick up the remains for a song .
Acquire a deserved reputation for honesty and reliability - with your customers , your suppliers , your subordinates , your supervisors , and the general community .
Read the contract before you sign it , then do what you said you would .
Play by the rules , and play to win .
Spend less than you earn .
Keep a cushion for rainy days .
Fear debt .
Pay your shareholders a good dividend - that 's why they originally gave you their money to invest , to make more money .
Do n't fiddle the numbers .
The numbers are very important , so fiddling with them is very bad .
Promote based on merit .
Being nice to your nephew - in - law will make less money .
Give someone a second chance , but not a third chance .
Science and technology are responsible for there being something to trade other than stone knives and fruit .
Adopt innovations to increase productivity .
Respect expertise and use it to make money .
Vigorous work is praiseworthy but should be accompanied by equally vigorous results .
No one has a right to their job .
Not the janitor , not the CEO , no one .
It would be like a rationalist having a right to their own opinion .
At some point you 've got to fire the saddle - makers and close down the industry .
If you want to reward loyalty , give them money .
No company has a right to its continued existence .
Change happens .
Investing is risky .
If you do n't like it , do n't invest .
Diversification is one thing , but stay far away from get - rich - quick schemes that offer easy rewards with no risk or hard thinking .
Trying to vote yourself rich falls in this category .
A high standard of living is the just reward of hard work and intelligence .
If other people or other places have lower standards of living , then the problem is the lower standard , not the higher one .
Raise others up , do n't lower yourself .
A high standard of living is a good thing , not a bad one - a universal moral generalization that includes you in particular .
If you 've earned your wealth honestly , enjoy it without regrets .
In all ways , at all times , and with every deed , make the pie larger rather than smaller .
The phrase " making money " is a triumph in itself over previous worldviews that saw wealth as something to steal .
Create value so that you can capture it , but do n't feel obligated to capture all the value you create .
If you capture all your value , your transactions benefit only yourself , and others have no motive to participate .
If you have negotiating leverage , use it to drive a good bargain for yourself , but not a hateful one - someday you 'll be on the other side of the table .
Still , the invisible hand does require that price be sensitive to supply and demand .
Everyone in a company should be pulling together to create value and getting a decent share of the value they create .
The concept of ' class war ' is a lie sold by politicians who think in terms of a fixed pie .
Any person of wealth who actually , seriously tries to exploit those less fortunate is a bully and a heretic ; but offering someone a job is not exploiting them .
( Though bribing politicians to pass laws that transfer wealth , definitely could qualify as exploitation . )
In countries that are lawful and just , it is the privilege and responsibility of a citizen to pay their low taxes .
That said , a good billionaire would n't ask to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary .
People safeguard , nourish , and improve that which they know will not be taken from them .
Tax a little if you must , but at some point you must let people own what they buy .
The fundamental morality of capitalism lies in the voluntary nature of its trades , consented to by all parties , and therefore providing a gain to all .
In countries that are lawful and just , the government is the referee , not a player .
If the referee runs onto the field and kicks the football , things start to get scary .
Unearned gains destroy people , nations , and teenagers .
If you want to help , go into the dark places of the world and open stores that offer lower prices ; or offer employment to people who would n't have gotten a chance otherwise ; or invest capital in worthy recipients who others shun .
Plow your gains back into the operation , if you like ; but if you do n't make at least a little money in the process , how can you be sure that you 're creating value ?
Wise philanthropy is a privilege and responsibility of achieved wealth .
Making money is a virtuous endeavor , despite all the lies that have been told about it , and should properly be found in the company of other virtues .
Those who set out to make money should not think of themselves as fallen , but should rather conduct themselves with honor , pride , and self - respect , as part of the grand pageantry of human civilization rising up from the dirt , and continuing forward into the future .
There was , once upon a time , an editorial in the Wall Street Journal calling Ford a " traitor to his class " because he offered more than the prevailing wages of the time .
Coal miners trying to form a union , once upon a time , were fired upon by rifles .
But I also think that Graham or Barnum or Buffett would regard those folk as the inheritors of mere kings .
" No true Scotsman " fallacy ?
Maybe , but let 's at least be clear what the Scots say about it .
For myself , I would have to say that I 'm an apostate from this moral synthesis - I grew up in this city and remember it fondly , but I no longer live there .
I regard finance as more of a useful tool than an ultimate end of intelligence - I 'm not sure it 's the maximum possible fun we could all be having under optimal conditions .
I 'm more sympathetic than this to people who lose their jobs , because I know that retraining , or changing careers , is n't always easy and fun .
I do n't think the universe is set up to reward hard work ; and I think that it is entirely possible for money to corrupt a person .
But I also admire any virtue clearly stated and synthesized into a moral system .
We need more of those .
Anyone who thinks that capitalism is just about grabbing the banana , is underestimating the number of decent and intelligent people who have put serious thought into the subject .
Those of other Ways may not agree with all these statements - but if you aspire to sanity in debate , you should at least be able to read them without your brain shutting down .
PS : Julian Morrison adds : Trade can act as a connective between people with diverging values .
THE former prime minister Paul Keating has attacked the Western media 's coverage of the Beijing Olympics as condescending , elitist and typical of the developed world 's general disdain for China .
Most of the coverage was seen through the prism of Tibet , Mr Keating told the Melbourne Writers ' Festival at the weekend , and disregarded the " massive leaps " forward in areas such as poverty alleviation and declining infant mortality .
" In a Western and elitist way , we have viewed China 's right to its Olympic Games , to its ' coming out ' , its moment of glory , with condescension and concessional tolerance , " Mr Keating said .
" The Western critic , feeling the epicentre of the world changing but not at all liking it , seeks to put down these vast societies on the basis that their political and value systems do n't match up to theirs . "
In a wide - ranging speech on foreign policy , Mr Keating was critical of the lack of action taken by the world in getting rid of nuclear weapons , saying proliferation was the " single most immediate threat hanging over the world today " .
With her pompom patois and sing - songy jingoism , Palin can bridge contradictory ideas that lead nowhere :
One minute she promises to get “ greater oversight ” by government ; the next , she lectures : “ Government , you know , you ’re not always a solution .
In fact , too often you ’re the problem . ”
Talking at the debate about how she would “ positively affect the impacts ” of the climate change for which she ’s loath to acknowledge human culpability , she did a dizzying verbal loop - de- loop : “ With the impacts of climate change , what we can do about that , as governor , I was the first governor to form a climate change subcabinet to start dealing with the impacts . ”
That was , miraculously , richer with content than an answer she gave Katie Couric : “ You know , there are man ’s activities that can be contributed to the issues that we ’re dealing with now , with these impacts . ”
At another point , she channeled Alicia Silverstone debating in “ Clueless , ” asserting , “ Nuclear weaponry , of course , would be the be-all , end - all of just too many people in too many parts of our planet . ”
( Mostly the end - all . )
A political jukebox , she drowned out Biden ’s specifics , offering lifestyle as substance .
“ In the middle class of America , which is where Todd and I have been , you know , all our lives , ” she said , making the middle class sound like it has its own ZIP code , superior to 90210 because “ real ” rules .
Sometimes , her sentences have a Yoda - like  “ When 900 years old you reach , look as good you will not ”  splendor .
When she was asked by Couric if she ’d ever negotiated with the Russians , the governor replied that when Putin “ rears his head ” he is headed for Alaska .
Then she uttered yet another sentence that defies diagramming : “ It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation , Russia , because they are right there . ”
Reared heads reared themselves again at the debate , when she said that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac “ were starting to really kind of rear the head of abuse . ”
She dangles gerunds , mangles prepositions , randomly exiles nouns and verbs and also  “ also ” is her favorite vamping word  uses verbs better left as nouns , as in , “ If Americans so bless us and privilege us with the opportunity of serving them , ” or how she tried to “ progress the agenda . ”
Poppy Bush dropped personal pronouns and launched straight into verbs because he was minding his mother ’s admonition against “ the big I . ” Palin , by contrast , uses a heck of a lot of language to praise herself as a fresh face with new ideas who has “ joined this team that is a team of mavericks . ”
True mavericks do n’t brand themselves .
With Merb 1.0 right around the corner , we 're buckling down and making sure that Merb is rock - solid by October 11 .
A bunch of features have landed or are landing over the weekend :
Taking advantage of Ruby Enterprise to reduce memory overhead
Simplifying deployment of Merb clusters
Improving the errors that Merb spits out when something goes wrong inside Merb .
Fixing an infrastructure problem that caused Merb 's logger to cause thread - safetiness issues in JRuby .
Also resolve the comingling of logged information for multiple requests in threaded environments .
Fix several bugs in merb_helpers that were driving people nuts when trying to do non-standard things .
More on the first two this Monday .
We 've been doing a lot of work to make deploying Merb apps simple and efficient .
Have a great weekend !
If John McCain is elected president , he will have a lot of people to thank .
Improbably , first on the list will be the man who did n’t want him in the White House , Rush Limbaugh .
Limbaugh vociferously campaigned against McCain throughout the primary season .
He accused the Arizona senator of being a closet liberal and a collaborator with Democratic enemies such as Sens. Russ Feingold and Teddy Kennedy .
This caused a lot of glee in Democratic circles .
Some optimists even predicted a devastating split in the GOP .
This was a false hope .
Limbaugh never had any intention of breaking with his party .
When he saw that he could n’t stop McCain , he swallowed hard and began trying to push McCain to the right .
Limbaugh made it clear that he wanted a vice presidential candidate from the Republican wing of the Republican Party .
He got his way with the choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
Limbaugh now believes , with more than a little justification , that the pick was an effort by McCain to satisfy him and fellow conservatives .
And he is indeed satisfied .
In an e-mail last week , Limbaugh informed me that , post - Palin , his support for the McCain ticket was “ balls to the wall . ”
This is a very big deal .
A satisfied Limbaugh means an enthusiastic Limbaugh , and an enthusiastic Limbaugh could be the difference in a close race .
Between 14 million and 20 million people listen to him every week , by far the largest audience in talk radio .
His show energizes the Republican base , but , even more important , it appeals to a great many conservative Democrats and independents of the kind McCain needs to win swing states .
Senior Republican strategists have seen Limbaugh do this before , especially in the 1994 congressional races that gave the House to the GOP for the first time in decades .
Limbaugh was so important to that victory that the GOP declared him an honorary member of the Republican House of Representatives ’ freshman class .
Fourteen years later , Limbaugh ’s influence is greater than ever .
No single Republican -- not Karl Rove or Roger Ailes , James Dobson or Sean Hannity -- has his reach and clout .
Certainly President Bush does n’t .
Limbaugh is , very simply , the single most influential conservative voice in America .
A lot of Limbaugh ’s critics dismiss him as a buffoon or a fanatic .
These are people who do n’t listen to his show .
Limbaugh is not only a brilliant communicator , he is a smart political strategist .
Other radio hosts and TV commentators ( on both sides ) take their talking points from campaign central -- but the people who write the Republican talking points are getting their ideas , often as not , from Limbaugh .
Listen to him on a daily basis and you know what Republican candidates are likely to be saying in a day or two .
Early last spring , Limbaugh puzzled over the question of how to campaign against the first black presidential candidate .
His decision , as he told me at the time , was to treat Barack Obama with the same contempt and politically incorrect satire he has trained on every Democratic candidate for the last 20 years .
He began referring to the Illinois senator as “ the messiah , ” a nickname that mocks both Obama ’s ethereal rhetoric and the adulatory coverage he receives from the “ drive - by media . ”
Limbaugh began playing wicked musical parodies , including “ Jeremiah was My Pastor ” ( to the tune of “ Jeremiah was a Bullfrog ” ) , in which an Obama sound - alike warns that linking him to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. could get you labeled a racist .
Limbaugh ’s own approach to that charge has been to laugh at it and turn it back on his critics .
During the primary season , he appointed his black call screener , Bo Snerdly , as the Official Obama Criticizer , to point out the absurdity of race - based censorship .
Another tactic has been to frame jabs at Obama by quoting from Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s primary campaign .
On Sept. 19 , for example , while discussing race with a caller , Limbaugh asked , rhetorically , “ All the racism that has been injected into this campaign ’s come from which side ? ”
Caller : “ The Obama camp . ”
Limbaugh : “ That ’s exactly right .
Or the Hillary camp , the Democratic Party . ”
Last week , the Obama campaign fell into a trap when it tried , in Spanish - language ads , to link McCain to Limbaugh and his supposed disdain for Latinos .
The ads sought to make their point with two Limbaugh quotes taken completely out of context .
Limbaugh turned this into political jujitsu , branding it , with high drama , as a lie intended to sow ethnic discord .
“ Rush emboldens Republicans , ” Rove says , and that is certainly true in this campaign .
Limbaugh says the things that McCain ca n’t or wo n’t say , and pushes both McCain and Palin to ever - tougher rhetoric by raising the bar of acceptable campaign discourse .
He also gives permission to his audience to laugh out loud at the Democratic standard - bearer .
These are not small gifts to the Republican ticket .
Especially not from a man who started out the year as John McCain ’s great nemesis .
Zev Chafets most recent book is “ A Match Made in Heaven , ” about the Christian evangelical movement and American Jews .
He is working on a book about Rush Limbaugh .
Hawkings books have made him a world - renowned theoretical physicist
The sum of human knowledge could be massively increased on Wednesday - but Professor Stephen Hawking could find himself $ 100 poorer .
As Cern prepares to switch on the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) below the French - Swiss border , the physicist has a bet that it will not find the Higgs boson - the most highly sought - after particle in physics .
Dubbed the " God particle " because it is so crucial to our understanding of the Universe , it is thought to give everything its mass .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The most powerful physics experiment ever built , the LHC will re-create the conditions present in the Universe just after the Big Bang .
When subatomic particles like protons are smashed together in the LHC , the energies released will create an array of new particles - some of which have not been seen since the big bang itself .
It will give scientists a glimpse into how these building blocks of matter are made .
Both the LHC , and the space programme , are vital if the human race is not to stultify , and eventually die out
Large Hadron Collider Radio 4's Big Bang day " The LHC will increase the energy at which we can study particle interactions , by a factor of four .
According to present thinking , this should be enough to discover the Higgs particle , the particle that gives mass to all the other particles , " Professor Hawking told the Today programme .
Previous particle accelerators have failed to find it , but because the LHC is so much more powerful , there is hope that it will succeed .
Even a failure , Professor Hawking says , would be exciting , because that would pose new questions about the laws of nature .
" I think it will be much more exciting if we do n't find the Higgs .
That will show something is wrong , and we need to think again .
I have a bet of $ 100 that we wo n't find the Higgs . "
He believes another important discovery that the experiment could make is superpartners , or particles that should theoretically exist .
They are " supersymmetric partners " to those particles we already know of at present .
" Their existence would be a key confirmation of string theory , and they could make up the mysterious dark matter that holds galaxies together .
Whatever the LHC finds , or fails to find , the results will tell us a lot about the structure of the Universe , " he says .
The CMS detector will search for the Higgs boson Some fear the experiment may create a black hole that will tear the Earth apart - there have even been two last - minute legal attempts to stop it - but Professor Hawking dismisses the idea that the LHC is in any way dangerous .
" If the collisions in the LHC produced a micro black hole , and this is unlikely , it would just evaporate away again , producing a characteristic pattern of particles .
Collisions at these and greater energies occur millions of times a day in the Earth 's atmosphere , and nothing terrible happens . "
Parallel universe ?
The human race is characterised by an insatiable quest to understand things , and the LHC is an example of our willingness to invest in that quest .
It is however difficult to predict whether it will bring any practical advances in the scale of our lifetime .
But the LHC might reveal something completely unexpected about the workings of our Universe , and that , says Professor Hawking , is what makes physics so satisfying .
" Throughout history , people have studied pure science from a desire to understand the Universe , rather than for practical applications , or commercial gain .
But their discoveries have later turned out to have great practical benefits .
" It is difficult to see an economic return from research at the LHC , but that does n't mean there wo n't be any . "
Asked if he would be able to choose whether the LHC or the space programme is more important in advancing our knowledge of the Universe , Professor Hawking says that would be like " asking which of my children I would choose to sacrifice " .
" Both the LHC , and the space programme , are vital if the human race is not to stultify , and eventually die out .
Together they cost less than one tenth of a percent of world GDP .
If the human race cannot afford that , it does n't deserve the epithet , human , " he added .
Scientists have spoken , if cautiously , of the experiments at Cern venturing into realms long regarded as those of speculative science fiction - multiple universes , parallel worlds , black holes in space linking different levels of existence .
If a black hole is produced , it might look like this in LHC data Professor Hawking says that a parallel universe may be a universe very different to the one we recognise .
" According to the sum over histories idea of Richard Feynman , the Universe does n't just have a single history , as one might think , but it has every possible history , each with its own weight .
A few of the histories will contain creatures like me , doing different things , but the vast majority of histories will be very different . "
In 1974 Professor Hawking argued that due to quantum effects , primordial black holes created during the Big Bang could " evaporate " by a theoretical process now referred to as Hawking Radiation in which particles of matter would be emitted .
Under this theory , the smaller the size of the micro black hole , the faster the evaporation rate , resulting in a sudden burst of particles as the micro black hole suddenly explodes .
In the past Professor Hawking has joked that if the LHC does creates micro black holes - even if they are rather short - lived ones - it could win him the Nobel prize .
However , he now says he does not believe this is something that is imminent .
" If the LHC were to produce little black holes , I do n't think there 's any doubt I would get a Nobel prize , if they showed the properties I predict .
However , I think the probability that the LHC has enough energy to create black holes , is less than 1 % , so I 'm not holding my breath . "

What are these ?
On Monday afternoon , the proposed $ 700 billion bailous bill was defeated in the House of Representatives 207- 226 .
Not surprisingly , it was quickly tried again , this time on Wednesday night in the Senate .
There , a modified version passed by nearly 50 votes .
The House will be voting on the new version later this week , probably on Friday after they ’ve had a chance to look over it .
Here ’s an overview of how what the Senate passed is similar to and different from what the House rejected .
I ’m basing my information on Money ’s coverage of the bailout
Similarities Between Senate Bailout and House Bailout
It ’s still based on the Treasury ’s proposal to buy troubled assets from financial institutions .
Most of these assets would be mortgages , mortgage - backed securities , etc. $ 250 billion would be immediately made available for purchasing assets , leading up to $ 700 billion total .
[ One pauses to ask “ Where are they getting this $ 250 billion ? ” ]
Apparently the president would be required to propose a bill which would require the financial industry to reimburse taxpayers for the program ’s net losses after 5 years .
And in return for buying their assets , the Treasury would get “ ownership stakes ” in the companies .
[ So is that where the money is coming from ?
Will this cause another crisis in 5 years ? ]
The Treasury will set up an insurance program which will guarantee the companies ’ troubled assets purchased before March 14 , 2008 .
It will be funded with risk - based premiums which the industry will pay .
[ Wondering how an industry pays premiums .
Does that mean the companies whose assets are being guaranteed ?
I ’m also curious about the March 14th cutoff … I ’ll have to look into that .
It seems like this is the alternative to selling to the Treasury , you can buy Treasury insurance . ]
Companies selling assets to or buying insurance from the Treasury will have curbs placed on executive pay .
In particular , bonuses or incentives paid to senior executive officer based on meeting targets would have to be repaid if the earnings / profit statements were falsified or otherwise inaccurate .
[ I think shareholders should have been doing this for a long time .
Executives should have high salaries , but not if they crash and burn the company .
If I completely screwed up at a job , you can bet that I would n’t get to leave with a multi-million $ $ bonus . ]
This bill will also set up two oversight committies .
There will be a Financial Stability Board with the chairpeople , directors , and secretaries ( the appointed kind ) of the Federal Reserve , the SEC , the Federal Home Finance Agency [ had n’t heard of that ] , HUD and the Treasury .
It ’ll report to a congressional oversight panel with 5 members appointed by House and Senate leadership .
[ Oversight is better than no oversight .
If there were n’t some sort of oversight provision , I ’d be concerned .
As it is , I ’m not greatly reassured by its existence either . ]
Differences Between the Senate Bailout and House Bailout
The Senate version will temporarily raise the FDIC insurance cap from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
The agency will borrow money from the Treasury to cover any losses .
This would mean that , temporarily , you could have up to $ 250,000 per person with a single bank .
But I would n’t bank on it ( if you even have $ 250,000 in cash to put in a bank ) because it ’s only temporary .
Probably .
[ Would n’t it be great if the Treasury had a surplus instead of a deficit ?
Then borrowing money from the Treasury would mean something . ]
The bill would also extend renewable energy tax breaks for individuals and businesses and continue other expiring tax breaks including R&D development for businesses and deducting state and local taxes from our federal returns .
Also , this will mean another year without the Alternative Minimum Tax , which was a hot topic in the blogosphere earlier this year .
[ I guess this is meant to get more people behind the bill because people want relief anywhere they ( we ) can get it .
As always , this comes down to the question of whether higher or lower taxes are better for the country and the economy .
Not even going to touch this with a snide remark …it ’s more than I want to get into right now . ]
What Does This Mean ?
Nothing is set in stone yet .
If you ’ve watched Schoolhouse Rock , you know that bills get bumped around for a while .
But it ’s possible that this one will go through pretty quickly .
To paraphrase Senator Obama , they could probably figure out a much better bill if given time , but the fear is that the economy wo n’t last that long .
If it passes , I ca n’t tell you what the result will be .
I ’m not an economist and I ’m not even convinced that most economists know .
One of my closest friends in college majored in economics and he said it was no more a science than sociology or psychology .
Some things they ’ve got right , a lot of it is informed guessing .
What I Can Tell You
What I can tell you is that whether or not it passes , whether or not the economy collapses , the groundwork of personal finance will essentially be the same .
Spend less than you earn if at all possible .
Earn more than you spend if at all possible .
Put something away for the future .
Get rid of debt , particularly debt that carries high interest .
These principles held true in the Great Depression , they held true in the tech bubble and in the housing bubble and in decent - but - not - spectacular periods .
Part of what brings us to today is people NOT following these — people buying more house than they could afford , people borrowing against their equity , people generally spending more than they earned .
And businesses and “ experts ” who had no concern for the welfare of their customers or the overall health of the economy but encouraged these people and used their status as bankers and loan trustees and the like to encourage peoples ’ improper financial habits .
Good financial habits , even in bad times , will still lead to relative financial health .
But bad financial habits , even in prosperous times , will ultimately bring about personal and societal poverty .
Once the stuff of ropey science fiction movies , the crime of digital murder may be about to go on the books , following the arrest of a middle - aged piano teacher from southern Japan , who snapped and murdered her virtual husband .
According to the Japanese media , the 43 - year - old woman hacked into the computer of the man she married in an online game and erased his carefully constructed digital character after their relationship curdled .
The messy divorce has sparked a debate among million of online gamers about whether virtual offences should stay in cyberspace , or be punished in the real world .
Police arrested her this week following a complaint by the man , a 33 - year - old office worker who lived on the other side of the country in the northern city of Sapporo , 1000 km away .
The two have apparently never met offline and the woman , reportedly a real - life divorcee , is not suspected of a flesh - and - blood crime , say the police .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
She faces charges of using her digital partner 's password and ID , which she acquired when they were a happily married virtual couple , and using it to illegally access his computer .
The charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison or a fine of about 3,200 pounds .
" It sounds like a strange case but obviously it is illegal to hack into someone else 's computer , " said a spokesman for the Sapporo Police , who discussed the case on condition of anonymity .
" That is why she has been arrested . "
The spokesman said he was " surprised " by the attention the case was getting from around the world .
" For us it is simply a computer crime . "
According to investigators , the woman flew into a rage when the relationship was abruptly terminated .
" I was suddenly divorced , without a word of warning .
That made me so angry , " she was quoted as saying .
The two met while accessing a hugely popular role - playing game called MapleStory , which encourages anonymous users to create online characters that navigate alternative worlds , fight monsters and engage in virtual relationships .
Long - term commitments , marriage , and digital sex are not uncommon among players , who are sometimes not even living in the same country .
Originally from South Korea , Maple Story now reportedly boasts about 50 million subscribers worldwide , including 9 million in Japan .
Japan is a world leader in online role - playing games , which constantly throw up new innovations that have the uninitiated scratching their heads .
A new Japanese service released this year called Virtual Wife allows presumably lonely men to choose from four different partners who nag until them until they lose weight .
The latest case comes amid growing controversy about online crimes .
A Dutch court sentenced two teenagers to a total of 360 hours community service this month for virtually beating up a classmate and stealing his digital goods .
" These virtual goods are goods ( under Dutch law ) , so this is theft , " said the court , which was criticised for going too far .
Online gamers are already debating the implications of the Japanese woman 's arrest , with many bloggers supporting the ' murdered ' husband .
" It takes a lot of time and effort to build up a virtual character .
This could mean other wronged parties may seek real - world justice for people who harm them virtually , " wrote one blogger approving .
" I hope she goes to prison . "
The severed heads of four men have been delivered by a courier service to a police station in northern Mexico , according to the local authorities .
The heads , all of men believed aged between 25 - 35 , arrived last week in an icebox marked as containing vaccines .
Police thought the package was meant for a local hospital - they only opened it on Monday , revealing the four heads .
Police are investigating if the heads belong to any of the 10 local people who were kidnapped last week by gunmen .
The gruesome delivery was made in the town of Ascension , not far from Ciudad Juarez , close to the US border .
Ciudad Juarez has a reputation as one of Mexico 's most violent cities , with more than a quarter of the country 's 3,800 drugs - related murders reported to have taken place there since the start of the year .
The authorities have discounted reports that one of the heads may have been of a police commander who was kidnapped on 18 May this year .
The £ 25 m pop payout - Phil Collins in a mega - divorce ( again )
Having already paid out an estimated £ 17 million to one former wife , you could say Phil Collins should have seen his latest divorce settlement , er , coming in the air .
The 57 - year - old singer and drummer has been forced to hand over an astonishing £ 25 million to his third wife in what is believed to be the largest divorce payment by a British show business star .
The generous payout to Swiss - born Orianne Cevey , 35 , follows seven years of marriage .
Phil Collins has been forced to fork out £ 25 m to his third wife Orianne Cevey in the largest ever divorce settlement by a British showbusiness star
The couple , who were together for 12 years in total , have two children , Nicolas , eight , and Matthew , four .
It means that , after taking into account the millions he paid to second wife Jill Tavelman - whom he famously dumped by fax - he has now paid out more than £ 42 million to his ex partners .
That equates to almost a third of his £ 140 million fortune .
The settlement only came to light following the release of accounts for Collins 's personal management company , Philip Collins Ltd .
It is greater than the £ 24.3 million Paul McCartney recently handed over to Heather Mills .
However it is dwarfed by Britain 's biggest ever divorce payout - the £ 48 million handed over by stockbroker John Chapman to his wife Beverley .
Collins met Miss Cevey on tour in 1994 when she was just 22 and was working as a translator .
Collins , then 43 , was still married to his second wife at the time .
The couple set up home in Geneva and were together for five years before their lavish three - day wedding costing £ 300,000 which hosted guests including Elton John and Eric Clapton .
They bought racing driver Jackie Stewart 's old house in Bugnins , near Geneva , for an estimated £ 20 million before announcing their split in 2006 .
Miss Cevey has remained in the mansion while Mr Collins moved into another home nearby to be close to his sons .
He now divides his time between Switzerland , New York and a home in Norfolk .
Collins was the drummer in Genesis until he stepped up to replace original singer Peter Gabriel .
He has also has a successful solo career .
Orianne has recently set up a luxury jewellery business called The Right Label .
Collins has two children with his first wife actress Andrea Bertorelli , Joely , 33 , and Simon , 28 .
That relationship ended when she ran off with their decorator .
Collins famously appeared on Top Of The Pops singing his 1981 solo hit In The Air Tonight with a pot of paint and paintbrush perched on his piano as a bitter coded message to his wife .
It is not known how much his divorce settlement was that time but is not thought to match the huge sums he has paid out since .
Collins , who also has a daughter , Lily , with second wife Jill , recently suffered hearing loss due to an ear infection .
Earlier this year he announced he was giving up touring for good .
A person who returned the Daily Mail 's call to the office of Tony Smith , Collins ' agent , said : ' I am not going to comment .
It 's not worthy of a comment .
Their separation is an old story . '

ATTEND AN EMERGENCY RALLY , IN YOUR AREA , AGAINST THE BAILOUT
I started monitoring these guys years ago simply because they like to alert members of when congress is going to do something stupid .
Recently I just respond to their advertisements for Obama with a polite , Obama and McCain are both evil speech .
I do n't think anyone reads it , but it makes me feel better about actually being on their damn near communist roster .
Anyways , tonight I got this :
Dear michael ,
Our pressure is working .
Already this week , TrueMajority members have made almost 20,000 calls to tell their Senators " NO " to the Bush corporate bailout .
Now news is beginning to come out that some lawmakers , Republicans and Democrats alike , are having second thoughts about going along with the administration 's plan .
We can put the brakes on this .
Tomorrow , Thursday , September 25th at 5 pm ordinary Americans are organizing Emergency Rallies against the Bailout nationwide .
Other TrueMajority members have already started 75 rallies in their towns , will you join them ?
ATTEND AN EMERGENCY RALLY AGAINST THE BAILOUT
We 're all in this together .
The proposed bailout is a $ 700,000,000,000 dollar check from your bank account , handed over to Wall Street .
This is literally the largest give away of public money to the private sector in history .
We have an historic emergency , and it's on us to step up and lead .
If there is n't already a rally in your community , start one right now .
Once you pick a time and place we 'll help turnout other TrueMajority members to your event and provide signs you can print out and a sample program .
The most important thing is for you to pick a spot where you 'll be seen , and start inviting other people you know right now .
Together we 'll send a clear message that America Says NO to Bush Bailout !
Thanks for leading the way ,
- Ilya
Ilya Sheyman
Online Organizer
America Says NO Bush Bailout !
Attend an emergency rally against the Bush bailout .
I do n't support these guys , but if anyone wants to go with me to hand out literature , just let me know .

Because men can generally put away more food and alcohol , “ men spend more , women spend less , ” said Steve Dublanica , author of the recent best seller “ Waiter Rant . ”
In addition , he said : “ Men eat and leave .
Women eat and stick around . ”
So a server attending to women may have to wait longer “ to turn the table over , get another group , get more tips . ”
“ On a Saturday night , ” he continued , “ you get these two ladies who walk in and say , ‘ We have n’t seen each other in ages , we ’re going to talk and talk and talk , ’ and they ’ll sit for four hours .
Women are more verbal than men .
That ’s a scientific fact .
And I ’m like , ‘ Ladies , I have reservations for these tables .
You ’ve got to go . ’ ”
As a consequence , Mr. Dublanica explained , “ Waiters are guilty of treating female diners as second - class citizens . ”
Ms. Bodie countered that top - notch servers consider it a challenge to do the best for  and thus coax the most from  any table they ’re given , and do n’t see any advantage in showering less enthusiasm on a group of women .
Although many restaurants continue to make distinctions between the sexes , most at least intend to be more sensitive to anything that smacks of gender discrimination than in the past .
And many servers , particularly in restaurants popular with young diners , are less influenced by gender than ever .
“ I ’m seeing a lot more equity at the table , ” said Marci DeLozier , 31 , who has worked at Per Se and Café Gray and is now an event coordinator for the restaurant Frankies 457 Spuntino in Brooklyn .
She was speaking primarily as a diner .
Five years ago , she said , she often had to fight to get servers to let her be the point person for a group of men and women dining together .
Servers had a stubborn tropism toward the men .
But lately , she said , that has n’t been as true , especially downtown , where she has noticed that if she makes the first eye contact with a server and seems the most inquisitive and purposeful , the server notices , and responds to it .
“ Body language is recognized in a way it was n’t before , ” Ms. DeLozier said .
“ I think it ’s possible for a woman to take the lead now . ”
For better or worse , my blog is popular with the Google conspiracy - theorist demographic .
🙂
I knew that as soon as Google Chrome launched , some readers would ask tough questions about privacy and how / when Google Chrome communicates with google.com .
So I decided to tackle this issue head - on .
I talked to the Chrome team to find out if there ’s anything to worry about .
The short answer is no .
For the long answer , read on .
– If you ’re just surfing around the web and clicking on links , that information does not go to google.com .
– If you are typing a search or url in the address bar , Google Chrome will talk to the current search service to try to offer useful query / url suggestions .
I love this feature , but you can turn it off .
Right - click in the Omnibox / address bar and choose “ Edit search engines … ” .
Or click the Chrome menu ( it looks like a wrench ) , then Options -> Basics and then the “ Manage ” button .
Either way , you ’ll see this box :
Uncheck the checkbox at the bottom of the dialog box that says “ Use a suggestion service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar . ”
– By default , crash reports and other anonymous usage statistics ( e.g. which features are used most often ) are not sent to Google .
The Chrome team would love if people opted - in to send crash report data though , because it would improve Chrome for everyone .
To opt in , click on the Chrome menu ( it looks like a wrench ) , then click “ Options . ”
On the “ Under the Hood ” tab , check the box that says “ Help make Google Chrome better by automatically sending usage statistics and crash reports to Google . ”
You can read more about this opt - in option on this support page .
– I believe if Google Chrome sees a very short , stock 404 page ( less than 512 bytes ) , it talks to Google in order to try to suggest other possible pages and options .
My understanding that this is the same underlying technology that I talked about earlier this year .
I think if you have a helpful 404 page (> 512 bytes ) , Google Chrome does n’t modify that ( this 404 page is n’t changed for example ) , but Google Chrome does try to help with very short / unhelpful 404 pages .
If you still do n’t like this feature , you can turn it off .
Go to Chrome / Wrench menu-> Options -> Under the Hood and uncheck the box that says “ Show suggestions for navigation errors . ”
By the way , just as a quick plug : if you as a site owner want to improve your 404 pages , Google offers a nice snippet of JavaScript ( well under 20 lines ) to offer this functionality to site owners .
See this 404 page blog post for more info .
– Google Chrome checks for automatic updates every 25 hours .
Other modern browsers check for updates as well , e.g. to plug security holes .
Given today ’s sometimes - hostile web , I think checking for updates like this is a very smart choice .
– Every 30 minutes , Google Chrome downloads a list of 32 - bit url hashes of urls thought to be dangerous ( malware or phishing ) .
That is a download of data from google.com , not to google .com .
As you surf around the web , if you happen to hit a url whose hash is in the dangerous list , the 32 - bit hash is sent to Google and Google replies with a full 256 - bit hash of the dangerous url in question .
Not only does this happen very rarely , but Google Chrome does n’t send a url to Google , it sends a url hash , so Google does n’t learn the url from this exchange .
By the way , this is essentially the same protocol that Firefox 3 uses to protect its users from malware / phishing urls as well .
Update , September 5th 2008 : A friend pointed me to this nice public description of Google ’s Safe Browsing protocol in case you ’re interested in more details .
– When you choose your language in the user interface , Google Chrome downloads a spellcheck dictionary .
Again , that is a download of data from google.com , not to google.com .
To the best of my knowledge , this is the only communication that happens between Google Chrome and google.com .
I thought it would be better to write down all the communication that happens so that people would n’t invent conspiracy theories .
As Louis Brandeis said , “ Sunlight is the best disinfectant . ”
Luckily , you can double - check me because the browser is open - source .
I hope this helps in case anyone has any privacy - related questions about Google Chrome .
Update : David Pogue writes this of Google Chrome in the New York Times :
Will Google ensure that its own services run better in Chrome than in other browsers ?
Is this part of Google ’s great conspiracy ?
That ’s a no and a no .
Chrome is open - source , meaning that its code is available to everyone for inspection or improvement — even to its rivals .
That ’s a huge , promising twist that ought to shut up the conspiracy theorists .
That ’s a good way to put it .
At least three times last night , Sarah Palin , the adorable , preposterous vice - presidential candidate , winked at the audience .
Had a male candidate with a similar reputation for attractive vapidity made such a brazen attempt to flirt his way into the good graces of the voting public , it would have universally noted , discussed and mocked .
Palin , however , has single - handedly so lowered the standards both for female candidates and American political discourse that , with her newfound ability to speak in more - or - less full sentences , she is now deemed to have performed acceptably last night .
By any normal standard , including the ones applied to male presidential candidates of either party , she did not .
Early on , she made the astonishing announcement that she had no intentions of actually answering the queries put to her .
" I may not answer the questions that either the moderator or you want to hear , but I 'm going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also , " she said .
And so she preceded , with an almost surreal disregard for the subjects she was supposed to be discussing , to unleash fusillades of scripted attack lines , platitudes , lies , gibberish and grating references to her own pseudo - folksy authenticity .
It was an appalling display .
The only reason it was not widely described as such is that too many American pundits do n't even try to judge the truth , wisdom or reasonableness of the political rhetoric they are paid to pronounce upon .
Instead , they imagine themselves as interpreters of a mythical mass of " average Americans " who they both venerate and despise .
In pronouncing upon a debate , they do n't try and determine whether a candidate 's responses correspond to existing reality , or whether he or she is capable of talking about subjects such as the deregulation of the financial markets or the devolution of the war in Afghanistan .
The criteria are far more vaporous .
In this case , it was whether Palin could avoid utterly humiliating herself for 90 minutes , and whether urbane commentators would believe that she had connected to a public that they see as ignorant and sentimental .
For the Alaska governor , mission accomplished .
There is indeed something mesmerising about Palin , with her manic beaming and fulsome confidence in her own charm .
The force of her personality managed to slightly obscure the insulting emptiness of her answers last night .
It 's worth reading the transcript of the encounter , where it becomes clearer how bizarre much of what she said was .
Here , for example , is how she responded to Biden 's comments about how the middle class has been short - changed during the Bush administration , and how McCain will continue Bush 's policies :
Say it ai n't so , Joe , there you go again pointing backwards again .
You preferenced [ sic ] your whole comment with the Bush administration .
Now doggone it , let 's look ahead and tell Americans what we have to plan to do for them in the future .
You mentioned education , and I 'm glad you did .
I know education you are passionate about with your wife being a teacher for 30 years , and god bless her .
Her reward is in heaven , right ? ...
My brother , who I think is the best schoolteacher in the year , and here 's a shout - out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School , you get extra credit for watching the debate .
Evidently , Palin 's pre-debate handlers judged her incapable of speaking on a fairly wide range of subjects , and so instructed to her to simply disregard questions that did not invite memorised talking points or cutesy filibustering .
They probably told her to play up her spunky average - ness , which she did to the point of shtick - and dishonesty .
Asked what her achilles heel is - a question she either did n't understand or chose to ignore - she started in on how McCain chose her because of her " connection to the heartland of America .
Being a mom , one very concerned about a son in the war , about a special needs child , about kids heading off to college , how are we going to pay those tuition bills ? "
None of Palin 's children , it should be noted , is heading off to college .
Her son is on the way to Iraq , and her pregnant 17 - year - old daughter is engaged to be married to a high - school dropout and self - described " fuckin ' redneck " .
Palin is a woman who can't even tell the truth about the most quotidian and public details of her own life , never mind about matters of major public import .
In her only vice - presidential debate , she was shallow , mendacious and phoney .
What kind of maverick , after all , keeps harping on what a maverick she is ?
That her performance was considered anything but a farce does n't show how high Palin has risen , but how low we all have sunk .
Senate Passes $ 700 billion Bailout Bill
As expected , the Senate passed the $ 600 billion bailout bill yesterday 74 to 25 .
Both Barack Obama and John McCain voted for it .
It goes to the House for a vote tomorrow .
The new bill , which is over 400 pages , is full of random tax cuts ( e.g. , property tax deductions for people who do n't itemize ) , which is sure to please some conservative House Republicans and infuriate Democrats who think cutting taxes without cutting spending is irresponsible .
It is also full of pork designed to please both Democrats ( requiring insurance companies to cover mental health ) and Republicans ( $ 3 billion for rural schools ) .
It is likely that the number of Republicans gained in the House vote will exceed the number of Democrats lost by more than 13 and the bill will probably pass the House tomorrow .
Everybody was too busy adding pork to question the basic premise of whether giving former Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson $ 250 billion immediately to help out his friends on Wall St. as he sees fit is a good idea .
Vice - Presidential Debate Tonight Joe Biden and Sarah Palin face off tonight at Washington University in St. Louis .
The moderator is PBS reporter Gwen Ifill .
Conservative bloggers such as Michelle Malkin are already spinning a potential loss by Palin by saying that Ifill , a black woman , wants Biden to win because she wrote a book on Obama , which will no doubt sell more copies if he wins the election .
The LA Times has a story on this controversy .
When asked about Ifill , John McCain said : " Gwen Ifill is a professional , and I think she will do a totally objective job . "
Although Palin really lit up the race when she was first chosen and the incendiary speech she gave at the Republican National Convention fired up the Republican base in a way McCain never did , the bloom is off the rose .
A new poll shows that 60 % of the voters see her as insufficiently experienced to be President .
More independents are now repelled by Palin than attracted by her .
Tonight is her make - or - break chance to get these voters back .
For many people who did n't watch the Republican National Convention , tonight will be the first time they hear Sarah Palin speaking at length .
A question that is likely to arise in their minds is : " What kind of an accent does she have ? "
According to Slate it is your typical Wasillan accent as found all over the Matnuska and Susitna valleys .
Polling the Youth Vote A lot has been made of whether the pollsters are undercounting young voters this year .
There are two issues here : cell phones and turnout .
The first point relates to the fact that pollsters generally do n't call cell phones , and since many 18 - 29 - year olds do n't have a landline , they get missed .
One way to compensate for that is to weight that age group more heavily , which brings us to the second point .
How big a fraction of the electorate are the 18 - 29 - year olds ?
We know how big a fraction of the electorate they were in 2004 and we know what fraction of the total population they represent , but we do n't know how many will vote this year .
Normally , voting is not their thing , but there are many signs that this year will be different and this group favors Barack Obama by a huge margin .
Mark Blumenthal has an article on the subject in the National Journal .
Evidence Is Presented at Stevens Trial
At the corruption trial of indicted senator Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) evidence is being presented .
The photos of Stevens house before and after remodeling are key pieces of evidence .
Bill Allen , the former head of the oil services company VECO , testified yesterday that he had the remodeling done and never billed Stevens for the work -- which amounted to a gift .
Stevens then failed to report the gift on the Senate form where he was required to list gifts .
The prosecution is expected to continue its case for a few more days .
If Stevens is convicted , it is virtually certain that Anchorage mayor Mark Begich ( D ) will win and flip the seat to the Democrats .
National Polls
There are ten national polls to report today !
Obama leads them all .
Here they are .
- Battleground ( Obama +2 )
- CBS ( Obama +9 )
- Diageo ( Obama +5 )
- Gallup ( Obama + 4 )
- GfK / Roper ( Obama +7 )
- Ipsos ( Obama +3 )
- Opinion Research ( Obama +7 )
- Pew ( Obama +6 )
- Rasmussen ( Obama +6 )
- Research 2000 ( Obama +10 )
The mean is an Obama lead of 5.9 % .
With so many polls pointing in the same direction , there can be no doubt that Obama is ahead right now .
Chances are the first debate and the financial meltdown caused people to get a more positive impression of him or a more negative impression of McCain .
The state polls below give the same impression : Obama is starting to break away .
McCain has to stop this movement very fast .
Probably the only thing he can do is go very negative very fast , trying to tie Obama to Rev. Wright , Tony Rezko , and Bill Ayers .
The danger is that either Obama or Democratic 527s will start running ads accusing McCain of taking bribes from convicted felon Charles Keating or start bringing up McCain 's age and health ( malignant melanoma four times ) .
It wo n't be pretty .
Brace yourself ( or just turn off your TV set until election night -- you can watch the debates on YouTube ) .
Today 's Polls
We have 18 presidential polls today .
Obama is now ahead in Florida , Nevada , Ohio , and Virginia .
If he can hold those states plus all the Kerry states , he wins big .

We pushed new code to our production servers last week .
There were a lot of changes , including our upgrade to Django 1.0 .
As soon as the servers restarted , they immediately suffered , with Python processes bloated to 2 Gb or more memory each .
Yikes !
We reverted to the old code , and began the process of finding the leak .
These are details on what we ( Dave , Peter , and I , mostly them ) did to find and fix the problem .
We used Guppy , a very capable Python memory diagnostic tool .
It showed that the Python heap was much smaller than the memory footprint of the server process , so the leak seemed to be in memory managed by C extensions .
We identified these C extensions :
We tried to keep these possibilities in mind as we worked through our next steps .
PIL and PDFlib in particular seemed likely given how heavily we use them , and because they traffic in large data ( high - res images ) .
We had some unit tests that showed fat memory behavior .
We ran valgrind on them hoping they would demonstrate a leak that we could fix .
Valgrind is a very heavy - weight tool , requiring re-compiling the Python interpreter to get good results , and even so , we were overwhelmed with data and noise .
The tests took long enough to run that other techniques proved more productive .
Our staging server had been running the code for over a week , and showed no ill effects .
We tried to reason out what is the important difference between the staging server and the production server ?
We figured the biggest difference is the traffic they each receive .
We tried to load up the staging server with traffic .
An aggressive test downloading many dynamic PDFs quickly ballooned the memory on the staging server , so we suspected PDFlib as the culprit .
Closely reading the relevant code , we realized we had a memory leak if an exception occurred :
p = PDF_new ()
# Lots of stuff , including an exception
PDF_delete ( p ) #
Not called : leak !
We felt pretty good about finding that , and fixed it up with a lot of unfortunate try / finally clauses .
We put the code on our staging server , and it behaved much better .
Lots of PDF downloads would still cause the memory to grow , but when the requests were done , it would settle back down again .
So we liked the theory that this was the fix .
The only flaw in the theory was it did n’t provide a reason why our old code was good and our new code was bad .
We put the fixed code on the production server : boom , the app server processes ballooned immediately .
Apparently as good as this exception fix was for our PDFlib code , it was n’t the real problem .
We tried chopping out functionality to isolate the problem .
Certain subsets of URLs were removed from the URL map to remove the traffic from the server .
We ran the code for short five - minute bursts to see the behavior under real traffic , and it was no better .
To be sure it was n’t still PDFlib somehow , we tried removing PDFlib by raising an exception at the one place in our code where PDF contexts are allocated .
Memory still exploded .
We tried removing PIL by writing a dummy Image .py that raises exceptions unconditionally .
It did n’t help .
We tried logging requests and memory footprints , but correlations elusive .
We tried changing the process architecture to use only one thread per process , no luck .
We tried reverting all the Django 1.0 changes , to move back to the Django version we had been using before .
This changed back the Django code , and the adaptations we ’d made to that code , but ( in theory ) left in place all of the feature work and bug fixes we had done .
We pushed that to the servers , and everything performed beautifully , the server processes used reasonable amounts of memory , and did n’t grow and shrink .
So now we know the leak is either in the Django 1.0 code , or in our botched adaptation to it , or in some combination of the two .
Many people are using Django 1.0 , so it seemed unlikely to be as simple as a Django leak , so we focused on our Django - intensive code .
Now that we ’d narrowed it down to the Django upgrade , how to find it ?
We went back to the request logs , examining them more closely for any clues .
We found one innocuous - seeming URL that appeared near a number of the memory explosions .
We took one app server out of rotation , so that it was n’t serving any live requests .
Our nginx load balancer is configured so that a URL parameter can direct a request to a particular app server .
We used that to hit the isolated app server once with the suspect request .
Sure enough , the process ballooned to 1 Gb , and stayed there .
Then we killed that process , and did it again .
The Python process grew to 1 Gb again .
Yay !
We had a single URL that reproduced the problem !
Now we could review the code that handled that URL , and eyeball everything for suspects .
We found this :
@memoize ()
def getRecentStories ( num = 5 ) :
" " " Return num most recent stories .
Only public stories are returned .
" " "
stories = Story . objects .
published ( access = kAccess . public ) . \
exclude ( type = kStoryType .
personal ) . \
order_by ( '- published_date ' )
if num :
stories = stories [ : num ]
return stories
Our @memoize decorator here caches the result of the function , based on its argument values .
The result of the function is a QuerySet .
Most of the code that calls getRecentStories uses a specific num value , so it returns a QuerySet for a small number of stories , and the caller simply uses that value ( for example , in a template context variable ) .
However , in this case , the getRecentStories function is called like this :
next_story = getRecentStories ( 0 ) . filter ( published_date__lt = the_date ) [ 0 ]
The QuerySet is left unlimited until after it is filtered by published_date , and then the first story is limited off .
Now we ’re getting to the heart of one of our mysteries : why was the old Django code good , and the new Django code bad ?
The Django ORM changed a great deal in 1.0 , and one of the changes was in what happened when you pickle a QuerySet .
To cache a QuerySet , you have to pickle it .
Django ’s QuerySets are lazy : they only actually query the database when they need to .
For as long as possible , they simply collect up the parameters that define the query .
In Django 0.96 , pickling a QuerySet did n’t force the query to execute , you simply got a pickled version of the query parameters .
In Django 1.0 , pickling the query causes it to query the database , and the results of the query are part of the pickle .
Looking at how the getRecentStories function is called , you see that it returns a QuerySet for all the public stories in the database , which is then narrowed by the caller first on the published_date , but more importantly , with the [ 0 ] slice .
In Django 0.96 , the query was n’t executed against the database until the [ 0 ] had been applied , meaning the SQL query had a “ LIMIT 1 ” clause added .
In Django 1.0 , the query is executed when cached , meaning we request a list of all public stories from the database , then cache that result list .
Then the caller further filters the query , and executes it again to get just one result .
So in Django 0.96 , this code resulted in one query to the database , with a LIMIT 1 clause included , but in Django 1.0 , this code resulted in two queries .
The first was executed when the result was cached by the @memoize decorator , the second when that result was further refined in the caller .
The second query is the same one the old code ran , but the first query is new , and it returns a lot of results because it has no LIMIT clause at all .
The fix to reduce the database query was to split getRecentStories into two functions : one that caches its result , and is used when the result will not be filtered further , and another uncached function to use when it will be filtered :
def getRecentStories ( num = 5 ) :
" " " Return num most recent stories .
Only public stories are returned .
Use this function if you want to filter the results yourself .
Otherwise use getCachedRecentStories .
" " "
stories = Story . objects .
published ( access = kAccess . public ) . \
exclude ( type = kStoryType .
personal ) . \
order_by ( '- published_date ' )
if num :
stories = stories [ : num ]
return stories
@memoize ()
def getCachedRecentStories ( num = 5 ) :
" " " Return num most recent stories .
Only public stories are returned .
If you need to filter the results further , use getRecentStories .
" " "
return list ( getRecentStories ( num = num ) )
One last point about the Django change : should we have known this from reading the docs ?
Neither the QuerySet refactoring notes nor the 1.0 backwards incompatible changes pages mention this change , or address the question of pickled QuerySets directly .
Interestingly , an older version of the docs does describe this exact behavior .
This changes was explicitly made and discussed , but seems to have been misplaced in the 1.0 doc refactoring .
Of course , we may not have realized we had this behavior even if we had read about the change .
So we ’ve found a big difference in the queries made using the old code and the new code .
But why the leak ?
The theory is that MySQLdb has a leak which has been fixed on its trunk .
Looking at the MySQLdb code , it ’s pretty clear that they ’ve been developing for a while since releasing version 1.2.2 .
Unfortunately , the MySQLdb trunk does n’t work under Django yet , so we ca n’t verify the theory that MySQLdb is the source of the leak .
Ironically , MySQLdb was not on our list of C extensions to look at .
If it had been , we might have identified it as the culprit with a Google search .
Since the MySQLdb trunk does n’t work under Django , I guess we would have hacked MySQLdb or Django to get them to work together .
We would have run leak - free , but would be unknowingly executing the giant database query .
The last mystery : why did n’t the problem appear on our staging server ?
Because it was running with a much smaller database than our production servers , so the “ all public stories ” query was n’t a big deal .
We learned a lesson there : sometimes subtle difference can make all the difference .
We need to keep the staging server ’s database as current as we can to make sure it ’s replicating the production environment as much as possible .
It ’s impossible to make them identical ( for example , the staging server does n’t get traffic from search bots ) , but at times like this , it ’s important to understand what all the differences are , and minimize them where you can .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Crude - oil futures tumbled Friday to close at their lowest level in 17 months , down 11 % for the week , as a production cut by some of the world 's key oil producers failed to ease concerns over a slowdown in oil demand .
" The market is n't interested in supply issues with world demand the question , " said Darin Newsom , a senior analyst at DTN .
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will slash its oil production quota of 28.8 million barrels per day by 1.5 million barrels , beginning November 1 , as the world 's financial crisis dampened demand for energy , the cartel said Friday at a meeting in Vienna .
Crude for December delivery closed at $ 64.15 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange , down $ 3.69 , or 5.4 % for the session to lose 11.1 % for the week .
That was the lowest closing price for a front - month futures contract since May 31 , 2007 .
In electronic trading on Globex , the contract touched a low of $ 62.65 .
Prices have lost more than $ 80 , or 56 % , from their record high above $ 147 a barrel hit in July .
Crude 's losses came amid broad declines in other commodities and in global stock markets .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % slumped nearly 4 % .
See Market Snapshot .
" In the current environment of a rapidly strengthening dollar and deteriorating economic indicators , the short - term price risk remains skewed to the downside " for oil , analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a research note .
" Oil prices have witnessed a dramatic collapse -- unprecedented in speed and magnitude -- these falling to levels which may put at jeopardy many existing oil projects and lead to the cancellation or delay of others , possibly resulting in a medium - term supply shortage , " OPEC said in its statement .
See full OPEC story .
" They 're trying not to prop up , but stabilize prices , " said Vera de Ladoucette , Cambridge Energy Research Associates ' senior director of Middle East Research .
“ ' They 're trying not to prop up , but stabilize prices . ' ” — Vera de Ladoucette , Cambridge Energy Research Associates
" Demand is collapsing , " she said .
" And actually what dawned on them this time is that demand was not there . "
" What they 're trying to do is prevent inventories from growing in the fourth quarter [ of this year ] and first quarter of next year , " she said .
The slowdown in oil demand is " serving to exacerbate the situation in a market which has been over - supplied with crude for some time , " OPEC said in its statement .
" Forecasts indicate that the fall in demand will deepen , despite the approach of winter in the northern hemisphere . "
OPEC said earlier this month that global oil consumption will grow 550,000 barrels a day this year compared with a year ago , down 330,000 barrels from last month 's forecast .
Total consumption will stand at 86.5 million barrels a day , said the cartel , which controls nearly 40 % of the world 's oil production .
See full story .
Trim down
Although OPEC said it was going to cut its production ceiling , it 's important to note that the cartel 's members often produce more than their quotas , analysts said .
Total OPEC production stood at 32 million barrels a day in September , according to OPEC 's latest monthly report .
The official production quota is currently 28.8 million barrels , and it will be cut by 1.5 million in November .
The quota excludes Iraq and Indonesia , which is suspending its OPEC membership as of Jan. 2009 , according to de Ladoucette .
Bear in mind that " OPEC is producing some 300,000 barrels per day above its target , " said Kate Dourian , Platts ' Middle East editor .
The market " cannot assume 100 % compliance with the new targets , " she said in emailed comments .
" We normally assume compliance of around 60 % . "
De Ladoucette said she expects OPEC members to be 80 % compliant with the production cuts by December .
" I do not think OPEC will live by their new quota , nor is their problem of a sinking oil price over for them , " said Charles Perry , president of energy - consulting firm Perry Management , in emailed comments .
“ ' I do not think OPEC will live by their new quota , nor is their problem of a sinking oil price over for them . ' ” — Charles Perry , Perry Management
Analysts had been expecting a cut between 1 million and 1.5 million barrels a day , though a few observers said the cuts could reach as high as 2 million .
See Commodities Corner .
" There is some evidence that crude - oil buyers are buying less oil , partly because they cannot raise credit and partly because there is no demand , " said Dourian of Platts .
Still , the White House denounced OPEC production cut as an " anti- market " decision .
" It has always been our view that the value of commodities , including oil , should be determined in open , competitive markets , and not by these kinds of anti-market production decisions , " said spokesman Tony Fratto .
OPEC said that the biggest producer , Saudi Arabia , is cutting 466,000 barrels a day , with six - figure declines also coming from Iran , Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela .
Cartel members said they 're going to meet again on Dec. 17 , in Oran , Algeria .
But they did n't give a specific commitment to cut production further .
Neal Ryan , a managing partner at Ryan Oil & Gas Partners , said he believes OPEC will have " another extraordinary meeting next month -- assuming there is any legitimate follow through on this announcement . "
Energy bandwagon
Other energy futures followed oil 's lead , closing sharply lower with reformulated gasoline suffering the most .
" Along with every other asset class , energy is caught in the global selloff , " said Ryan .
" That being said , I think the market was still hoping for more of a cut out of OPEC to really get things moving , and the proof is still going to be down the road when there is actual follow through on their announced cuts . "
November reformulated gasoline fell 10 cents , or 6.3 % , to end at $ 1.4779 a gallon .
Based on a survey of gasoline retailers , prices for regular gasoline at the U.S. pump fell more than 4 cents a gallon from Thursday , hitting a national average of $ 2.781 Friday , according to AAA 's Daily Fuel Gauge Report .
Gas prices are now lower than a year ago .
Among the heating fuels , November heating oil fell 4.1 % , or 8.3 cents , to close at $ 1.9465 a gallon and November natural - gas futures lost 2.8 % , or 18 cents , to finish at $ 6.239 per million British thermal units .
On Friday , analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners LLC lowered their natural - gas and oil - price assumptions for the fourth quarter of this year and for 2009 .
In a research note , they said the cut was " based on slower global GDP growth and our forecast for flattish natural - gas demand in 2009 as increased demand from the power sector is offset by conservation and slower economic growth levels that will impact industrial demand . "
They estimate crude prices of $ 72.50 in the fourth quarter , down from a previous estimate of $ 110 , and a natural - gas price of $ 7 per thousand cubic feet for the fourth quarter , down from the old estimate of $ 10 .
For 2009 , they predict a crude price of $ 75 , down from the previous $ 100 estimate , and natural - gas prices of $ 7.50 , down from the old estimate of $ 9 .
Tracking the commodities market as a whole , the Reuters / Jefferies CRB Index CRB , - 1.01 % , a benchmark gauging the prices of major commodities , fell by 3.2 % .
Gold futures dropped a low of $ 681 an ounce , then recovered to close more than 2 % higher .
They still lost 7.3 % for the week .

Psoriasis , one of humanity ’s oldest known diseases , has also been one of its most misunderstood .
But in a new study that could change researchers ’ perspective of the skin disorder and potentially lead to powerful new drug targets , Rockefeller University scientists have found that the source of psoriasis may be a single population of inflammatory cells that act as instigators by priming the body ’s immune system for self - attack .
Immunity - directing dendritic cells were discovered at Rockefeller in 1973 and , in the years since , researchers have discovered that the cells exist in multiple forms , with different populations residing throughout the body .
Discerning the intricacies of each has proven a tricky business .
But when it comes to dendritic cell populations in the skin , Michelle Lowes — assistant professor of clinical investigation in James Krueger ’s Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology — and her colleagues have been chipping away at and describing them one by one .
Prior work by the researchers had characterized the populations of cells in healthy skin .
By comparing those results with skin from psoriasis patients , Lowes , Krueger and their collaborators have found that psoriasis lesions are characterized by a distinctly different composition of dendritic - cell populations :
Not only do they have the dendritic cells found in normal skin , but they also have an overabundance of a new variety of “ inflammatory dendritic cells ” that produce immune - stimulating proteins called cytokines .
In order to see how this new population of cells interact with other immune cells , the researchers first isolated them and then threw them together with T cells .
Typically , dendritic cells direct the response of T cells , presenting them with foreign molecules that teach them what to seek and attack .
The inflammatory dendritic cells were no different — they triggered activation of the T cells , which promptly began producing more cytokines and other inflammatory proteins .
“ These cytokines may be important for inducing the psoriasis lesions to develop , or amplifying them , ” Lowes says .
The cytokines , and the inflammatory dendritic cells that produce them , all represent possible avenues of exploration for drug designers .
Lowes believes that the inflammatory dendritic cells are being called into the skin and may be an ideal target , as they ’re a discrete population that does n’t appear to be required for normal immune activity .
“ If you could knock them out specifically , you might be able to just treat psoriasis without the unwanted side effects of more general immune suppression , ” she says .
“ And I think that if we could stop the cells from getting into the skin , you may even be able to prevent psoriasis . ”
The work could also extend to other autoimmune diseases .
“ The idea of resident versus inflammatory dendritic cell populations provides a useful model , ” she says .
“ I ’m hoping that other investigators will find this model helpful as they look at dendritic cells in different diseases and different organs . ”
If the cells can be recreated in the lab , they could potentially be used in therapies to boost immunity and increase inflammatory responses against diseases such as cancer .

In proving motivation and intent , timelines often provide the best evidence of why someone acted as they did .
A murderer who insures the life of his victim months before the crime provides the jury with compelling evidence of his motive .
When looking for reasons for government action , it is often more difficult because government and its accomplices are powerful , omnipresent and criminally adept at hiding the real reasons for their actions .
In looking for motivation , one should therefore always follow the money .
One of , if not the primary , undisclosed motivation for the bailout plan before Congress is to provide a financial windfall to the Rockefeller ( Citibank ) and Morgan ( JP Morgan Chase ) banking interests .
In order to see this , one must look beyond the obfuscating din of Wall Street greed , executive pay , HOPE for homeowners , neighborhood revitalization and other such nonsense and look at the concerted actions of the Bush administration , Citicorp and JP Morgan Chase over the last few weeks .
The timeline tells the tale .
On September 25 , 2008 , the FDIC foreclosed on Washington Mutual , one of the most troubled and most at - risk banks and one of the largest holders of subprime mortgages .
The day before , the WaMu CEO had been in negotiations with several suitors , including JP Morgan , HSBC and Wells Fargo .
Although the media reported that JP Morgan directly acquired WaMu , it did not .
JP Morgan purchased WaMu's assets from the FDIC after the FDIC , through the Office of Thrift Supervision , executed what amounts to an overnight foreclosure and repossession .
No bid , no auction and apparently no discussions with WaMu 's other potential suitors .
In short , this gun - to - their - head sale was about the furthest thing from an arms - length " commercially reasonable " transaction .
Not even the WaMu board of directors , who were apparently on a plane at the time of the takeover , knew of the takeover or the preplanned and orchestrated asset sale to JP Morgan .
Immediately after the takeover , JP Morgan paid the FDIC $ 1.9 billion for WaMu 's over $ 307 billion in assets , including deposits and branches .
Although JP Morgan also acquired $ 34 billion in non-performing loans , acquiring WaMu ’s operations in other states was an unequivocal benefit to JP Morgan .
Last year , James Dimon , JP Morgan 's chairman and chief executive , presciently predicted that JP Morgan would find a means to develop a toe - hold in the coveted Florida banking market :
James Dimon , J.P. Morgan ’s chairman and chief executive , has long coveted Florida  as have his customers .
Although WaMu is dominated in Florida by Bank of America and Wachovia , J.P. Morgan is likely to boost WaMu ’s 3 % market share in the state by tapping into its base of New York customers who spend the winter months in Florida .
Last year , one of those New York customers expressed frustration at J.P. Morgan ’s annual meeting , telling Mr. Dimon “ it galls me ” that the bank did n’t have a presence there .
“ It p- me off too , ” Mr. Dimon said , drawing laughter from the audience .
“ Believe me , we would love to be much bigger in Florida and we ’ll find some way to do it .
You will see us there .
The effect of the FDIC takeover and immediate fire sale to JP Morgan significantly impacted the WaMu equity holders , including an investment group that had invested $ 7 billion just six months ago .
They were wiped out .
As stated on the FDIC website :
At this time , the FDIC as Receiver for Washington Mutual Bank does not anticipate that equity and subordinated debt holders will receive any recovery on their claims .
On September 29 , in what at least facially appears to be a somewhat less hostile and aggressive transaction , the FDIC " facilitated " the transfer of Wachovia 's " retail bank , corporate and investment bank and wealth management businesses to Citigroup . "
Wachovia is a large holder of subprime mortgages .
Although details of the deal are incomplete , Citi paid Wachovia $ 2.1 billion directly to acquire some liabilities and most of its assets , including a $ 312 billion pool of loans , $ 42 billion of which are non-performing .
Although Wachovia reported assets of $ 812.4 billion as of June 30 , 2008 , it is unclear how much of these assets will end up in Citi 's hands .
Citi further agreed to tender $ 12 billion in preferred stock and warrants to the FDIC .
Although the deal appears consensual as the Wachovia shell remains and the deal does not close until December 31 , one can just imagine how it went down .
Pointing to the WaMu takedown just five days earlier , the FDIC likely told Wachovia that if it did not submit to the sale to Citi , the FDIC had the power and will to force the transfer anyway .
Although the government 's participation in these nakedly unjust transactions that have violated the property rights of the Washington Mutual and Wachovia equity holders is itself appalling , it is only part of the story .
The real story lies in the fact that two of the biggest and most influential US Banks , with the help of the federal government , have just mugged two of their drunken friends and are now looking to fence part of their ill - gotten loot — a pile of worthless or nearly worthless non-performing real estate loans .
This is what the bailout is all about and why it is so important to the powers that be that it get passed .
Any politician that votes for the bailout violates his oath to protect and defend the Constitution , in particular the Fifth Amendment which prohibits government from taking property without just compensation .
All students of Austrian economics know that those who benefit the most from an inflationary infusion of currency in a central - bank fiat system are those that are first in line at the fiat money trough .
From 2001 to date , this was the no-bid military contractors who were the first - in - line beneficiaries of an irresponsible fiscal policy that spent money the United States did not have .
George W. Bush managed the war and the country according to the philosophy of Judge Reinhold 's character in the Ruthless People : " If we can't afford it , we 'll f*** ing finance it ! "
From 2001 until 2007 this also included homeowners who responded to the Federal Reserve 's soma of artificially low interest rates by refinancing and sapping the equity out of their homes .
The real reason that the bailout is " necessary , " and " essential " is not that credit markets will freeze or that the world will end .
By forcing the takeover of WaMu and Wachovia , the Bush Administration , Citi and JP Morgan have bet that together they can coerce and lobby Congress into passing a law that will allow Citi and JP Morgan to dump their newly acquired subprime loans on the gullible and unsuspecting taxpayer .
If the bailout is successful , Citi and JP Morgan will have scored a two - fer .
Not only will they have vastly increased their market share and asset base in the FDIC orchestrated takeovers , they will also be first in line at the fiat money creation trough as the Fed prints the money that will fund the Treasury 's above - market purchase of their subprime booty .
Nice work if you can get it .
Those that claim that the government will " make money " on the loans or that purchasing these unmarketable securities is a good public investment are either fools or liars .
It is of course possible that Congress through the bailout and the Federal Reserve by printing money can effectively double the money supply and that this can , over a course of time lead to a scenario where a $ 100,000 non-performing loan is satisfied when the underlying property is sold for $ 200,000 .
This , however , is not " making money , " it is devaluing the dollar .
By the time the house sells for $ 200,000 gas will be $ 8.00 a gallon and gold will be $ 1800 an ounce .
The Federal Reserve and the Bush Administration are complicit in the bailout because they do not want to face the sobering reality of a crash on the Bush Administration 's watch and believe that they can inflate their way out of the problem .
Men plan and God laughs .
Bailout advocates have offered two powerful fallacies in support of the bailout .
The first is that credit markets are " frozen " and that only government action can loosen them up .
Although banks generally are apparently now less willing to lend than they were just a year ago , banks are businesses and businesses are profit - seekers .
Banks , like most businesses , are always willing to provide their service or produce their good if the price is right .
Banks will not , however , lend at low rates when they believe that their own borrowing costs or market interest rates will rise in the near future .
When the " market " price of money is consistent with their projections of future costs , banks will lend .
It is important here to note that the Fed Funds rate and the prime rate are rates that are artificially influenced by the Federal Reserve through its purchase and sale of Treasury Securities on the open market .
These rates are therefore only an imperfect reflection of market interest rates .
Real market interest rates , like commercial paper and LIBOR , are beginning to rise .
This is perhaps the best evidence that the banks are beginning to " loosen up . "
Banks will lend , but at a higher rate that accounts for the Federal Reserve 's recent inflationary actions .
Note that the only rate in the LIBOR chart linked above that has gone down in the last 30 days is the Fannie Mae 30 - year mortgage rate .
This is more evidence that government does n't know the price of anything as it is creating an inflationary arbitrage opportunity for homeowners .
The second and somewhat compelling reason for supporting the bailout is that the new " mark to market " accounting rule , FASB 157 , has artificially caused solvent entities to become insolvent and therefore the government must act to correct this artificial situation .
This is wrong because it assumes that the rule is dictating the value of the non-performing loan .
It is not .
FASB 157 just makes formal what the market would ineluctably recognize — a non-performing mortgage loan is worth the value of the underlying asset less the costs of liquidating it .
Although FASB 157 is causing some firms to become insolvent on paper and is giving banks and insurers fits in managing their government - mandated reserve ratios , FASB 157 simply compels that these institutions acknowledge reality — that is always a good thing .
If interest rates are on the rise , very few Americans have sufficient savings to make the 20 % down payment necessary for a mortgage and there are millions of properties encumbered with non-performing loans ( large supply and no demand ) , then these non-performing loans in a high interest rate environment may be worth as little as 40 percent of their face value .
Changing rules or pumping the economy with increasingly worthless paper will do nothing to solve this fundamental problem ; indeed , it will just create more problems , more asset bubbles , and bigger and broader future problems .

The Best of Bill Butler
Dear Mr. Brown ,
( cc : The international press )
Here in Iceland , we are busy dealing with a series of mistakes in government , regulation and banking operations .
As a result of a total collapse of our banking system , customers in the UK have feared for their deposits in Icelandic banks , just like every single Icelander has .
In accordance with international law , the Icelandic government has relatively clearly stated that it will guarantee the minimums required for private citizens .
( They ’re not always good with words – sorry about that … )
Municipalities and organizations – that are by law considered “ professional investors ” – may unfortunately have lost significant amounts .
Up to 1 % of their assets in some cases as I ’ve understood .
It may come as a surprise to you , but professional investors all over the world are losing gigantic amounts these days .
Even 10s of % per day in some cases .
Iceland is not to blame for that .
I know that it ’s considered good domestic politics to find a common enemy in the time of crisis .
It can hide facts about one ’s own failing policies and create a team spirit at home , rallying against the new foe .
Seems like your little scheme worked .
Up here is an entire nation – where most of us citizens are at a real risk of losing pretty much everything we own – we ’re trying to put up a fight .
If you can help even just a tiny bit by clearing up your deliberate misunderstanding – great .
If you can ’t , please stop bullying us , find someone of your own size to pick on and leave us alone while we try to rebuild our society more or less from scratch .
Your lad ,
Hjalmar
According to a pretty legitimate - looking email thread from one of our readers , Steve Jobs may have responded to complaints that , since the pulling of NetShare from the App Store , iPhone - to - laptop tethering is impossible without jailbreaking one 's phone .
From our reader to Steve :
AT&T offers data plans for BlackBerry that include tethering for an additional $ 30 per month ( a total of $ 60 per month for the BlackBerry + tethering plan ) .
It seems ludicrous that the same thing is not offered with the iPhone .
I understand the desire to prevent tethering with the current data plan , but I am willing to pay more money to allow tethering !
With such an advanced device , why can I not do so ?

Bush commencement speech at Furman prompts protest Associated Press

Print This Email This By MEG KINNARD COLUMBIA , S.C. --
Some faculty members at Furman University have suggested they wo n't attend graduation ceremonies because President Bush is scheduled to speak , but a group of conservative students wants the university to step in and block the protest .
Bush is scheduled to give Furman 's graduation speech May 31 at the fairly conservative school of 2,625 undergraduate students with Baptist roots .
More than 500 members of the Furman community signed a letter released Monday asking that administrators refuse to allow faculty members to skip ceremonies in protest of the Bush visit .
The move comes after more than 200 students and faculty members signed a statement earlier this month criticizing the Bush administration 's handling of the Iraq war and environmental issues .
" Some professors seem intent on turning what should be a celebration of their students ' accomplishments into a forum to air their political differences with President Bush , " said the letter , released Monday by Conservative Students for a Better Tomorrow .
Christopher Mills , a junior leading up the Conservative Students effort , said Tuesday that no faculty members had signed the letter , which also asks that the petition opposing the visit be removed from the university 's public Web site .
" Their letter does n't really have anything to do with commencement , " said Mills , 21 , an economics major .
" We were just disappointed that they were putting publicity above professionalism and above the students that they 've taught for four years . "
Judy Grisel , a neuroscience professor who signed the petition opposing Bush 's visit , said she and other faculty members were merely exercising what they see as their obligation to share their viewpoints and ideas .
" At a liberal arts college , we really try to train people to think critically and respect other peoples views , " said Grisel .
" And we have been expressing our views in very civil ways . "
Spokesman Vince Moore said the administration planned to meet with Mills ' group to discuss posting its letter on the university 's Web site .
The faculty letter was removed from Furman 's official website , but a cached copy of the document can be viewed here .
The Furman address is one of three Bush is giving this year .
The president spoke May 4 at a Greensburg , Kan . high school that was ripped to pieces last year by a strong tornado .
He also is scheduled to speak at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs , Colo. , on May 28 .

A new ad released by the Obama campaign today goes after John McCain ’s new mortgage plan .
While the ad is good , Obama should point out the hypocrisy of McCain , who on one hand wants to cut spending , but on the other proposes $ 300 billion in additional spending for something that is already covered by the original $ 700 billion rescue bill .
Here is the ad :
Advertisements
The point of the ad is that McCain puts Wall St. ahead of the taxpayers .
I think a better question is how does McCain plan on paying for this plan when he is going to cut taxes , increase spending in Afghanistan , and keep spending in Iraq ?
There are only two ways that I can think of to pay for this plan .
He can either slash entitlements like Medicare / Medicaid and Social Security , or he can deficit spend .
Despite all of his tough talk on spending , I think that he would probably borrow the money .
More importantly , why is McCain proposing this plan when what is really needed is n’t for the government to take on lenders bad debts , but the ability of homeowners to renegotiate their mortgages .
This plan is n’t necessary , and goes against everything that McCain is running on .
Sec. Paulson said yesterday that there is already a provision is the recently passed rescue plan to address what McCain is proposing , so why is McCain doing this ?
John McCain is doing this because he is a hypocrite .
The slogan of his campaign has been Country First , but time and time again McCain has shown that his real slogan is Election First .
A conservative who cared about his country would not want to spend an additional $ 300 billion of unnecessary spending .
A candidate who put country first would tell us how he plans to pay for this program and cut taxes .
Obama ’s ad does make a point .
John McCain would rather make the government take on lender debt , then make the lenders take a loss .
That ’s not Country First .
It ’s Lenders First .
Once considered a potential McCain running mate , Powell may endorse McCain 's Democratic rival .
Colin Powell might endorse Obama
Retired Gen. Colin Powell , once considered a potential running mate for Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , now may endorse his opponent , Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , according to Republican sources .
But an air of mystery surrounds Powell 's planned live appearance Sunday on NBC 's " Meet the Press , " and no one is sure what he will say .
Powell ’s unassailable national security credentials could sway voters who are vacillating about whether Obama is ready to be commander in chief , and his endorsement of the Illinois senator would make a national security emphasis by McCain in the election 's closing days extremely difficult .

Powell , 71 , a professional soldier for 35 years , has advised the last three Republican presidents .
The general ’s camp is being coy about what he might or might not say on Sunday .
But some McCain advisers suspect , without being sure , that Powell will endorse Obama .
“ It ’s going to make a lot of news , and certainly be personally embarrassing for McCain , " a McCain official said .
" It comes at a time when we need momentum , and it would create momentum against us . ”
Powell , a four - star Army general , was national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan ; chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the 1991 Persian Gulf war , when George H.W. Bush was president ; and President George W. Bush ’s first secretary of State ,
Powell has consulted with both Obama and McCain , and the general ’s camp has indicated in the past that he would not endorse .
On “ Meet the Press ” in June 2007 , Powell said : “ I ’ve met with Sen. Obama twice .
I ’ve been around this town a long time , and I know everybody who is running for office , and I make myself available to talk about foreign policy matters and military matters with whoever wishes to chat with me . "
Asked by moderator Tim Russert if he would come back into government , Powell said : “ I would not rule it out .
I ’m not at all interested in political life , if you mean elected political life .
That is unchanged .
But I always keep my , my eyes open and my ears open to requests for service . ”
Asked about an endorsement , he said : “ It ’s too early . ”
NBC ’s ‘ Andrea Mitchell broke the news of Powell ’s surprise “ Meet the Press ” appearance on the “ Today ” show Friday .
“ In what promises to be a dramatic moment Sunday , Colin Powell — a lion of the Republican establishment , whom McCain and Obama both have courted for months — will finally speak out on a variety of issues , appearing exclusively on ‘ Meet the Press , ’ ” Mitchell said .
“ Of course , years ago , he was talked about as the possible first … African - American nominee of a major party . ”
Last week , Powell appeared as a character witness at Sen. Ted Stevens ’ ( R - Alaska ) corruption trial , telling jurors that Stevens is someone he trusts completely .
" As we say in the infantry , this is a guy you take on a long patrol , " Powell said .

Governments are now turning their focus on integrating electronic medical records to include surveillance into private homes .
The Canadian Home Care Association is urging the government to seize the opportunity for information technology into homes where most health care is delivered .
A report titled “ Integration through Information Communication Technology for Home Care in Canada , ” was sponsored by Canada Health Infoway , a federally - funded nonprofit group working to “ accelerate the use of electronic health information systems and electronic health records across the country . ”
Its members include the country ’s 14 Deputy Ministers of Health .
“ Canadians live , work and access their health care in their communities , and as they age , Canadians want to remain in their communities where they can continue to make meaningful contributions , ” the report says .
No one can argue with this , or that when an illness strikes , home healthcare can help people remain safely in their homes , live independently , and reduce doctor 's visits and strain on hospitals .
But this report is n’t talking about simply providing services to improve the ability of people to communicate with their healthcare provider , electronically sharing information they choose .
Nor is it simply talking about a private service to access emergency assistance or that would notify loved ones when help is needed , as might be desired to protect a frail elderly living alone or someone with the beginnings of dementia .
This is government monitoring and integrating home surveillance data into a federal health database for the government to manage care and supervise compliance .
Home healthcare providers , contracted by you or your doctor , are already given medical record information necessary to provide you needed care .
This initiative expands telemedicine applications into increasingly intrusive monitoring of you and your activities inside your home .
There are no protections in place as to limits on the private information it could collect or how the information could be used .
At the very least , such protections should be in place before a system , with such potentials for abuse , is launched .
Digital data it collects can be stored and transmitted to any entity in the federal health IT system and enable third party interventions , that may or may not be voluntary or requested .
As the report says :
The potential for technology within home care is exciting and captures the imagination of home care leaders across the country .
Being able to have immediate access to a client ’s historical medical record on admission into home care ; and conversely being able to share information about the client ’s functional status and approach to care at home with the broader health care team would increase the efficiency of the system ... and will enable the gathering of objective comparable data on system utilization and outcomes to inform policy development .
The report differentiates between active and passive monitoring .
Active monitoring is where people have to turn on equipment or push a button and voluntarily share information on their health or seek information and help .
While it does n’t negate the need for doctor ’s visits and in - person care , it can provide people with a tool to help them communicate with their care provider and enable care modifications without trips to the hospital .
In contrast , “ a passive system does not require any action by the client to make the system work . ”
As you read the report ’s description , ask yourself if this is a right you want government to assume , under the guise of making sure you eat and take the medications it prescribes for you , to keep you healthy or safe ; if this is a role for federal , integrated government surveillance ; and once such a nationwide system is in place , how it could be misused :
Passive monitoring systems range from video cameras to sensors and motion detectors .
The opportunity is to use the technology to help someone at a distant location determine if there are issues in the home .
Some passive systems put cameras in the ... person ’s home that allow someone somewhere else to see what the camera sees .
Others use sensors that can detect motion to alert others if [ or what ] the elderly person is not eating , has not taken their medication , or has fallen .
These systems may be used to watch over elderly people who might not realize they need help , like someone with early stage Alzheimer ’s who might forget to eat or take medications .
They can also be used to detect falls or other problems as they happen , or to monitor third parties like home health aides and other home help .
It is not known yet how well these types of systems will be accepted by clients as they may object to this level of observation ...
An important application would be in the area of medication management .
Home care typically manages six times the number of medications than the institutional sector on any day .
There are no good systems for tracking medication management and events in the home and community sector ...
Building blocks to an electronic health record system , according to the report , includes digital imaging , drug information , and laboratory information systems .
A comprehensive and effective electronic health record , accessible across the country , “ will not be realized until the key elements of the home care sector contribution are embedded , ” said the report .
Since the home setting is where most health behavior and interventions actually take place , home systems are essential for any electronic health record , it says .
The system is said to increase the number of patients that can be efficiently managed .
“ Telehomecare and administrative data also contain important information that needs to be shared with the broader health care team and linked ...[ to ] the full range of providers / sectors . ”
Effective application of electronic technology in the home care setting will ensure that the system is appropriately and efficiently used and can improve the ability to measure , assess and manage healthcare , the report concludes .
But who is determining those managed care performance measures and what are the ramifications for not complying with ones you or your doctor do n't feel are evidenced - based and best for you , or those that are undesired ?
With telehomecare , these considerations have added importance since they 'll be no escape and your health behaviors will be monitored even inside your own home .
This story took added significance and food for thought today , as Consent of the Governed wrote about how we ’re steadily being de-sensitized to turning over increasingly more of our privacy rights to the government and accepting federal intrusions and oversight , in the name of added security .
Something to think about .
Obama responds : ' It 's like these guys take pride in being ignorant "
Also in Berea , Obama ( defended his remark about inflating tires , a first response to the favorite Republican attack of the moment , which he'd ignored for a few days as the GOP mailed gas gauges to reporters .
( One apparently reached my home in Brooklyn today , producing some puzzlement . )
" They 're lying about what my energy plan is , " he says .
And " they 're making fun of a step that every expert says would reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent .
It 's like these guys take pride in being ignorant . "

Obama hits 50 % mark in Gallup poll
Barack Obama met the 50 percent threshold for the first time Tuesday in the Gallup daily tracking poll , a symbolic hurdle that until now had eluded the Democratic nominee .
The Gallup daily tracking poll has found that since the conclusion of the Democratic convention , Obama has risen 5 percentage points in the polls and now leads John McCain 50 percent to 42 percent .
That represents a positive turn for Obama , after a couple of days in which he appeared to have peaked at the 49 percent mark while McCain was showing slight improvements .

The survey indicates that Obama ’s overall post - Democratic National Convention bounce now appears to be roughly at par with the norm of past conventions .
Though smaller than several of the sizable bounces of recent decades , the new polling suggests that perhaps the Democratic convention bounce has yet to subside .
While an improvement from 49 percent to 50 percent is statistically insignificant , the 50 percent mark holds significance for a party seeking to win its first majority since 1976 , when Jimmy Carter won with 50.1 percent .
Polling will likely remain in flux until early next week , after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention .
On Saturday , Gallup reported Obama was ahead by 8 percentage points .
By Monday , that lead had shrunk to 5 points .
Today it returned to 8 .
Obama and McCain were evenly split at 45 percent prior to the Democratic convention , according to Gallup .
Should Obama maintain a 5 - point bounce in the polls , that would meet the 5 - to 6 - point norm earned by a typical party nominee , by Gallup ’s measure , since 1964 .
That also means , however , that Obama ’s historic acceptance speech before more than 80,000 people at Invesco Field in Denver Thursday night , a political event seen by about 40 million television viewers , has not vaulted him above the norm of past nominees .
But Obama now has his firmest political footing of the campaign , according to the polls .
Daily tracking polls by Gallup and Rasmussen Reports demonstrate that Obama has taken his greatest lead since the beginning of the general election in June when Obama clinched the Democratic nomination .
Rasmussen also recorded an uptick in Obama ’s standing on Tuesday , and he now leads McCain 51 percent to 45 percent .
CBS News reported Monday that Obama is ahead in its poll , 48 percent to 40 percent , a 3 - point increase in Obama ’s standing compared with its poll prior to the Democratic convention .
Your prom dress is perhaps one of the most important choices that you ’ll ever make .
If you ’re going to go to prom and spend the night enjoying yourself with friends , then you need to make sure that absolutely everything is perfect for your needs .
We ’re going to be talking you through the planning of your prom dress , and trying to help you get everything sorted ahead of time .
The Dress Itself
The first thing that you need to do is to work out what kind of dress it is that you want .
You have to ask yourself whether you ’re after a shorter dress or a gown , and the kinds of colours that you want to wear .
You need to have an idea of the kind of dress that you ’re after .
Otherwise , it ’ll become difficult to plan for buying one properly .
The Budget
The next thing that you ’re going to need to do is to think about how much money you ’re willing to spend on this dress .
Now obviously the best prom dresses are going to be a little more expensive , and in a lot of cases , you ’ll find that your parents are prepared to purchase a dress for you .
However , setting a clear budget with them will help to ensure that you stay on good terms with them and that no one is accused of being unreasonable .
You do n’t want to try and plan your prom night while fighting with the family after all .
Location , Location
Now that you ’ve planned out what kind of dress you want , and established a budget with the people who are helping you pay for it , it is time to get out there and look for a prom dress !
This is where it ’s important to check out all of the shops beforehand , so you know where the most likely candidates for your prom dress will be .
It helps to check them out quite early too , as you ’ll be able to get access to all of the potential dresses before anyone else can get them because as you might know , you ’ll lose out if someone else gets it and decides to wear it before you .
Overall , these are just a few of the steps that you can take to make choosing your prom dress that much easier .
Obviously , planning for your prom can be a very challenging task , as you obviously want to make sure that you get it right .
Having a set of steps in place will make dress shopping that bit easier .
You can otherwise find yourself caught up in all of the fuss and drama which comes from dress shopping , and it can seem like a real pain to manage to do .
The important thing to remember is that you ’re not going to get anywhere if you rush around and worry about all of the various things that need to happen .
It is important just to keep working forward until you ’ve got your dress and you ’re ready to go . …

BBC News , Santa Cruz
They have cleaned up the debris from the ransacked government offices in the eastern Bolivian city of Santa Cruz .
The city 's government envoy had to be interviewed at a secret location Religious groups marched through the city centre calling for peace and opposition leaders have been talking to the government about finding a solution to a crisis that last week erupted in violence .
But it is a tense , nervous peace .
Opposition groups control the access road to Santa Cruz 's airport .
Passengers must make their way to the airport perimeter , negotiate a roadblock and take their taxis from there .
There are constant meetings and rumours are rife .
" Government tanks are moving towards Santa Cruz , " said one man in conspiratorial tones .
" There 's been shooting on the other side of the city , " a woman told me .
Graffiti calling for the death of President Evo Morales is on the walls .
Secret location I interviewed the government representative in Santa Cruz , Gabriela Montano , at a secret location as a safety precaution since she has been threatened by opposition groups .
I was picked up at my hotel by some of her aides and driven to a private house .
After a number of furtive mobile phone conversations , I was allowed in .
" The opposition , " she said " has been working on a campaign for months to de-legitimise the government in Santa Cruz . "
She added that it was therefore no surprise to find unauthorised people on the streets requesting documentation and beating people up .
It was the government 's aim , she said , to re-establish its authority in the region .
Ms Montano laid the blame firmly on the Santa Cruz Civic Committee , an unelected group of businessmen which often speaks on behalf of the region and is behind the move for greater autonomy from central government .
City of contrasts Santa Cruz is one of the fastest - growing cities in Latin America .
They do n't want to give up any of their land but the fight for our rights will continue
Maria Savaia
Indigenous rights activist
Its oil and natural gas wealth finances the shiny office blocks and plush shops that line the streets .
The population , many of European descent , drive around in 4x4s and wear modern , designer clothes .
But in one corner of Santa Cruz there is a stark reminder of the other Bolivia , the poor indigenous Bolivia where people still wear traditional clothes and eke out a living on barren land .
Plan 3000 is where many of those who came from the west of the country to find work have settled .
Its streets are unpaved , women in colourful shawls carrying babies serve beans and corn in dark covered markets and posters and graffiti in support of President Morales decorate the walls .
Maria Savaia , who works in the indigenous rights office that was ransacked by opposition supporters , said she believes that the same oligarchy that has always governed Santa Cruz was behind the attack .
" The issue is land , " she said .
" They do n't want to give up any of their land but the fight for our rights will continue . "
' Anti-European discrimination ' Carlos Dabdoub is one of the leaders of the opposition .
They look at my blonde hair and ask me for my papers to prove where I 'm from
Marite Schmitter
Santa Cruz resident
He said the relationship between the central and regional government was fractured .
He laid the blame firmly at the feet of President Morales .
" He refuses to respect the democratic vote in this region for greater autonomy , " he said .
Santa Cruz resident Marite Schmitter said she and her friends felt discriminated against because of their European background .
" They look at my blonde hair and ask me for my papers to prove where I 'm from , " she added .
" I'm Bolivian , from Santa Cruz . "
She said jobs were being unfairly given to indigenous workers .
Most in Bolivia would say that it was only a matter of time before the violence erupted as it did last week , leaving several dead .
Polarised country
The split between President Evo Morales and his supporters among the indigenous community in the mountainous west of the country and the hot and humid oil and gas rich east has been growing wider almost by the day since the president took office in January 2006 .
President Morales has been talking to opposition leaders and says they have reached some agreement .
But he also said he would push ahead with his plans to radically change the Bolivian constitution , giving a greater voice to the large indigenous community and implementing a land reform programme .
The tension will inevitably increase ahead of a national referendum on that constitution scheduled for 7 December .
The governor of Santa Cruz , Ruben Costas , said that if just one opposition supporter died as the government tried to re-establish control in the east of Bolivia then the talks would end .
South American leaders are meeting in Chile on Monday to help find a diplomatic solution to the Bolivian crisis .
But there is so little common ground between the two sides that they do not have very much to work with .

During a campaign swing through Colorado Springs recently , Sarah Palin got on the phone with Focus on the Family founder James Dobson for an interview for Dobson ’s nationally syndicated radio broadcast .
The adoration flowed freely , and amidst the mutual congratulation , a few nuggets uttered by the possible future vice - president stood out :
Palin told Dobson that she would " seek [ God ’s ] perfect will for this nation and to , of course , seek his
wisdom and guidance in putting this nation back on the right track . "
Palin called herself a " hardcore pro-lifer " and said that giving birth to Trig gave her the opportunity to " to really be walking the walk and not just talking the talk " of " pro-life " values .
In a telling exchange , Dobson told Palin that he was moved by watching Piper Palin smooth Trig Palin ’s hair at the Republican National Convention .
Dobson said , " One of the most touching and dramatic moments in the last year for
me was when you were speaking at the Republican National Convention and
little Trig was sitting on Piper ’s lap and she wet her fingers and
mashed down his hair that was sticking up in the back .
I ’m sure that
she has seen you do that many times .
Boy , that really grabbed my heart ,
I ’ll tell you . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
At the Beijing Olympics , China trounced the United States in the contest for gold medals .
In the Caucasus , Russia inflicted a humiliating military defeat on Georgia , America ’s closest ally in the region .
At home , the U.S. economy is in deep trouble .
The misery index , a combination of the rates of inflation and unemployment , stands at its highest in 16 years ( 11.3 percent in July ) and there are forecasts of worse to come .
The Olympics marked China ’s status as a world power and the first time since 1996 that Americans did not win most gold medals .
In the Caucasus , Russia showed that it can do as it sees fit in its own backyard , no matter how loudly Washington protests .
That includes recognizing as independent states the two breakaway provinces , South Ossetia and Abkhazia , that Georgia claims as its own .
In the Great Power game in the region , the score so far is Russia 1 , U.S. nil .
Does all this mean that the oft - predicted end of America ’s role as the world ’s only superpower is near ?
Depends on the definition of “ near . ”
Political power grows from the barrel of a gun , as China ’s Mao Tse Tung observed , and the United States spends more on its armed forces than the rest of the world combined .
There are more than 700 U.S. military bases in some 130 countries .
And despite its current troubles , the U.S. economy is larger than those of the next three countries put together .
Still , the U.S. is no longer number one in all the fields where its dominance was once taken for granted .
The world ’s leading financial center , for example , is no longer New York , it is London .
The world ’s largest investment fund is in Abu Dhabi .
The world ’s tallest building will soon be in Dubai .
Predictions of shrinking ( or rising ) American power have been wrong in the past .
In his book “ the Rise and Fall of Great Powers , ” the Harvard historian Paul Kennedy foresaw the imminent decline of the United States .
The book was published just before the Soviet Union collapsed , a turn of history that left the U.S. as the world ’s only superpower .
On the opposite end of wrong forecasts was Francis Fukuyama ’s famous essay “ The End of History , ” written after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
It argued that mankind ’s “ ideological evolution ” had ended , to be replaced by “ the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government . ”
Things did n’t quite turn out that way .
POST - SCRIPT TO THE END OF HISTORY
In an essay for the Washington Post this month , Fukuyama , a professor at Johns Hopkins University , conceded that “ today , U.S. dominance of the world system is slipping ; Russia and China offer themselves as models , showing off a combination of authoritarianism and modernization that offers a clear challenge to liberal democracy .
They seem to have plenty of imitators . ”
Both Russia and China are members of the world ’s biggest emerging market economies , the so - called BRIC club - Brazil , Russia , India and China .
They account for 40 percent of the world ’s population , sit on vast foreign exchange reserves , and have geopolitical ambitions .
BRIC foreign ministers had their first formal meeting in May , in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg .
Given the perils of crystal - gazing into the future shape of the world , it is not easy to find an expert willing to hazard a guess on how long American supremacy will last .
But there is at least one , Nouriel Roubini , an economics professor at New York University who two years ago correctly forecast the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble and the dismal chain of events that followed .
At the time , many of his fellow economists snickered .
Roubini thinks that it will take a couple of decades for “ U.S. policy mistakes in economic , financial and foreign policies ( to ) ... erode the power of the American empire . ”
That would make it relatively short - lived .
Depending on how you count , the Roman empire lasted more than 500 years , the British 460 or so , the Spanish around 400 .
One of America ’s most serious problems , Roubini writes on his website , is the fact that the U.S. is the world ’s biggest net borrower and net debtor .
The countries financing the American deficits are its rivals , China and Russia , and Middle Eastern oil exporters .
History , he says , provides lessons on the importance of financial prudence .
“ Empires ... tend to be net lenders , i.e. run current account surpluses .
The decline of the British Empire started in World War II when the British fiscal deficits in the war and the current account deficits turned the empire into a net borrower and a net debtor . ”
The British twin deficits were being financed by a rising power that was a net lender and a net creditor - the United States .
Whether it will ever return to that state depends , in part , on the competence , or lack of it , of the next U.S. administration .
President George W. Bush ’s team did not set a good example .

Army : Soldier suicide rate may set record again The Associated Press
Published : Thursday September 4 , 2008
Print This Email This By PAULINE JELINEK
WASHINGTON -- Soldier suicides this year could surpass the record rate of last year , Army officials said Thursday , urging military leaders at all levels to redouble prevention efforts for a force strained by two wars .
So far this year , there are 62 confirmed suicides among active duty soldiers and Guard and Reserve troops called to active duty , officials said .
Another 31 deaths appear to be suicides but are still being investigated .
If all are confirmed , that means that the number for 2008 could eclipse the 115 of last year - and the rate per 100,000 could surpass that of the civilian population , Col. Eddie Stephens , deputy director of human resources policy , said at a Pentagon press conference .
" Army leaders are fully aware that repeated deployments have led to increased distress and anxiety for both soldiers and their families , " Army Secretary Pete Geren said .
" The Army is committed to ensuring that all soldiers and their families receive the behavioral health care they need , " he said in a statement distributed at the press conference .
To try to stem the continuing high number of suicides , the Army continues to increase the number of staff psychiatrists and other mental health staff as well as chaplains , is issuing a new interactive video for troops and will be adding a new program to basic training starting in January , said Brig .
Gen. Rhonda L. Cornum , an assistant Army surgeon general .
" There are no simple problems and there are no simple solutions , " Cornum said .
" There is no program that has been shown to be truly effective at preventing suicides ...
Success will be the sum of a number of smaller steps . "
Semtex has been used by various terrorist groups
French anti-terrorist officers are searching for 28kg ( 61lb ) of Semtex explosive missing from a depot in the suburbs of the city of Lyon .
France 's interior ministry confirmed an investigation was underway , saying the manager of the site had been suspended .
Semtex is a powerful explosive favoured by terrorist groups as it is odourless and difficult to detect .
Police said detonators were also missing and that they are treating the theft " very seriously " .
The depot , in a disused 19th century fort at Corbas , is used for storing explosives by a civil defence unit charged with the job of blowing up bombs and ammunition left over from the two world wars .
Police said the discovery that the Semtex was missing was made on Friday but admitted the explosives could have been taken up to a week ago .
In a statement released late on Friday the interior ministry said there had been " security failings " which had made the theft possible .
Police sources have declined to confirm a newspaper website report which said that the store had been unguarded .
Semtex , which was first made in the Czech Republic , is used in mining and demolition work .
A bomb containing about half a kilogram of the explosive caused the blast which brought down Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , in 1988 , killing 270 people .

Everyone ’s talking about Palin ’s botched Supreme Court response , but I have n’t seen much conversation yet about her answer to Couric ’s question regarding the separation of church and state .
Take a listen :
Katie Couric : Thomas Jefferson wrote about the First Amendment , building a wall of separation between church and state .
Why do you think that ’s so important ?
Sarah Palin :
His intention in expressing that was so that government did not mandate a religion on people .
And Thomas Jefferson also said never underestimate the wisdom of the people .
And the wisdom of the people , I think in this issue is that people have the right and the ability and the desire to express their own religious views , be it a very personal level , which is why I choose to express my faith , or in a more public forum .
And the wisdom of the people , thankfully , engrained in the foundation of our country , is so extremely important .
And Thomas Jefferson wanted to protect that .
Not only does Palin get so twisted up in herself that it ’s tough to remember what the question was in the first place , but I went hunting for the Jefferson quote she references and could n’t find it .
I did dig up this :
“ It is not wisdom alone but public confidence in that wisdom which can support an administration . ”
– Thomas Jefferson to James Monroe , 1824 .
If this is what Palin was going for , she not only took it out of context , but she was n’t even close .
Then I found this interaction on amongst chatters in the Sean Hannity forum , and they came to the same conclusion .
There is no Jefferson quote .
You know you ’re in trouble when the Fox peeps call your bluff .

It 's an enormous understatement to say China is an important market for Coke ( KO ) .
The country is vital to Coke 's global growth plan and could soon rival KO 's sales in the US .
So , it 's no wonder why the global behemoth is sinking $ 400 + million into its Beijing Olympic sponsorship .
The details :
$ 80 million for four - year Olympic sponsorship rights and $ 320 million spent on ads , promotions and other marketing globally
Beating other sponsors to punch :
In 2001 , KO had " Cheer for China " billboards all over Beijing only hours after the city won the right to host the Games
Using basketball star Yao Ming in their advertisements ( for years had represented Pepsi ( PEP ) )
China campaign focused around " shuang " , which is like " awesome " or " cool " , but with more bite to it
So , is it working ?
The early results are very positive :
47 % of Chinese identify Coke as a sponsor of the Olympics , while only 3 % of respondents similarly associate other top - level sponsors with the Games , including McDonald 's ( MCD ) and Adidas .
Coke sales volume was up 18 % in 2007 from the previous year
In 2007 , KO claimed 22 % of the country 's carbonated soft drink market , up 0.5 % from 2006 .
Coke still trailed Pepsi's 22.9 % share , but PEP saw a dip from 23.3 % market share the previous year .
Coca - Cola is only $ 5 off its 52 - week low and a clear victim of the global slowdown .
Add in growth prospects like those in China and it's no wonder KO is one of Wall St. 's most beloved stocks ( which , unfortunately , is often a reason to stay away ) .

LONDON , Sept 12 ( Reuters Life ! ) -
It ’s knives and forks drawn in the well - fed world of restaurant reviewers .

REUTERS / Mike Segar
Two top - selling restaurant guides -- New York - based foodie ’s bible Zagat ’s , and Harden ’s , a Zagat - inspired tome that ’s a force in Britain -- are locked in an unseemly spat over their latest London rankings .
And at the heart of the gastronomic stand - off is Gordon Ramsay , the expletive - spewing , global celebrity - cum - chef who is never far from controversy .
Put simply , Zagat ’s thinks Ramsay is the top dog on the London fine - dining scene , while Harden ’s believes the best days of the motor - mouth chef may be over .
In its 2009 guide , Harden ’s gives top - billing to Petrus , a restaurant whose head chef , Marcus Wareing , is a Gordon Ramsay protege .
Ramsay ’s flagship restaurant , Restaurant Gordon Ramsay , is pushed into second place .
“ Wareing is emerging from Ramsay ’s ‘ shadow ’ as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in London , and he and his team should be congratulated , ” declared Peter Harden , the co-editor of Harden ’s , before adding :
“ The Ramsay empire ’s current performance -- and in particular the poor standard of most of the more recent openings -- raises questions as to its direction , and its ability to maintain its reputation as an operator of the highest quality . ”
It was a stinging rebuke for Ramsay , who had been at the top of the rankings for eight years .
But as far as Harden ’s -- motto “ To tell it how it is ” -- is concerned , it was only a matter of time as Ramsay lent his name to ever more establishments and the quality of some declines .
“ Ramsay ’s not superhuman despite the media myth , ” Richard Harden , Peter ’s brother , told Reuters .
“ Something had to give . ”
But Zagat ’s is not so sure and its founder , Tim Zagat , has been outspoken in his disagreement with Harden ’s decision .
At the launch of the 2009 Zagat London guide this week he told the Evening Standard newspaper :
“ Harden ’s are full of s--- and you can quote me on that .
“ They attack people every year just to get more publicity .
Gordon Ramsay is an easy target for them because of his profile , ” the paper quoted Zagat as saying .
Harden ’s responded by issuing a press release that began : “ Oh dear , bad language seems to be infectious ” , an apparent reference to Ramsay ’s fluency in swearing .
“ We ’re not going to get into a slanging match with a competing publisher , ” Harden ’s wrote , before going on to point out how the competing guides were generally in agreement on some of Ramsay ’s lower - budget eateries if not the flagship one .
Zagat and his wife Tina , who began their guides in New York 30 years ago and have built them into a multi-million dollar global brand , were not immediately available for comment .
Given how competitive the restaurant business in London is , especially at a time when the wealthy are cutting back , the dispute is unlikely to die down quickly .
But for once , and perhaps surprisingly , the only person who has n’t yet stepped into the fray is the man at the heart of the bun-fight : the usually loquacious Ramsay .
It was not immediately clear exactly when Mr. Kilpatrick will cease to be mayor .
His resignation letter says it is effective Sept. 18 , but the city charter calls for immediate removal from office when an elected official is convicted of a felony .
News outlets in Detroit reported that Mr. Kilpatrick would speak to the city on television at 7 o’clock Thursday evening .
Mr. Kilpatrick ’s lawyers tried unsuccessfully in recent days to negotiate plea agreements that would not involve jail time , but prosecutors were adamant .
“ You have to have some consequences to your actions  you do n’t just lose your job and go on your way , ” the Wayne County prosecutor , Kym L. Worthy , said on Thursday .
The plea agreements that were finally reached includes two sentences of 120 days in jail , one for the obstruction charges and one for the assault charge , but they are to be served at the same time .
Prosecutors agreed to sentences that were considerably lighter than Mr. Kilpatrick could have expected if convicted at trial .
“ I made a decision to get this done and move this region forward , ” Ms. Worthy said .
Despite the legal closure for Mr. Kilpatrick , many people in Detroit see his departure as the beginning of a new chapter of challenges for the city .
The council does not have a reputation for working well together , and the F.B.I. is investigating whether illegal payments were made in one of its recent multi-million dollar contract approvals .
How the city will be governed in the immediate future is an open question .
“ It will be a long time before anyone can say we recovered from this crisis and are fully back on track , ” said John R. Chamberlin , a professor at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan .
“ It will be measured in months and years , not weeks . ”
Programme of the NSDAP , 24 February 1920 The 25 points of the NSDAP Program were composed by Adolf Hitler and Anton Drexler .
They were publically presented on 24 February 1920 " to a crowd of almost two thousand and every single point was accepted amid jubilant approval . "
( Mein Kampf , Volume II , Chapter I ) Hitler explained their purpose in the fifth chapter of the second volume of Mein Kampf : [ T ]he program of the new movement was summed up in a few guiding principles , twenty - five in all .
They were devised to give , primarily to the man of the people , a rough picture of the movement 's aims .
They are in a sense a political creed , which on the one hand recruits for the movement and on the other is suited to unite and weld together by a commonly recognized obligation those who have been recruited .
Hitler was intent on having a community of mutual interest that desired mutual success instead of one that was divided over the control of money or differing values .
THE COMMON INTEREST BEFORE SELF -INTEREST -
THAT IS THE SPIRIT OF THE PROGRAM .
BREAKING OF THE THRALDOM OF INTEREST - THAT IS THE KERNEL OF NATIONAL SOCIALISM .
In these straightforward statements of intent , Hitler translated his ideology into a plan of action which would prove its popularity with the German people throughout the coming years .
For many , the abruptness of its departure from the tradition of politics as practiced in the western world was as much of a shock as its liberal nature and foresight of the emerging problems of western democracy .
The Programme of the German Workers ' Party is designed to be of limited duration .
The leaders have no intention , once the aims announced in it have been achieved , of establishing fresh ones , merely in order to increase , artificially , the discontent of the masses and so ensure the continued existence of the Party .
1 . We demand the union of all Germany in a Greater Germany on the basis of the right of national self - determination .
2 . We demand equality of rights for the German people in its dealings with other nations , and the revocation of the peace treaties of Versailles and Saint - Germain .
3 . We demand land and territory ( colonies ) to feed our people and to settle our surplus population .
4 . Only members of the nation may be citizens of the State .
Only those of German blood , whatever be their creed , may be members of the nation .
Accordingly , no Jew may be a member of the nation .
5 . Non-citizens may live in Germany only as guests and must be subject to laws for aliens .
6 . The right to vote on the State 's government and legislation shall be enjoyed by the citizens of the State alone .
We demand therefore that all official appointments , of whatever kind , whether in the Reich , in the states or in the smaller localities , shall be held by none but citizens .
We oppose the corrupting parliamentary custom of filling posts merely in accordance with party considerations , and without reference to character or abilities .
7 . We demand that the State shall make it its primary duty to provide a livelihood for its citizens .
If it should prove impossible to feed the entire population , foreign nationals ( non-citizens ) must be deported from the Reich .
8 . All non-German immigration must be prevented .
We demand that all non-Germans who entered Germany after 2 August 1914 shall be required to leave the Reich forthwith .
9 . All citizens shall have equal rights and duties .
10 .
It must be the first duty of every citizen to perform physical or mental work .
The activities of the individual must not clash with the general interest , but must proceed within the framework of the community and be for the general good .
We demand therefore :
11 . The abolition of incomes unearned by work .
The breaking of the slavery of interest
12 . In view of the enormous sacrifices of life and property demanded of a nation by any war , personal enrichment from war must be regarded as a crime against the nation .
We demand therefore the ruthless confiscation of all war profits .
13 .
We demand the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations ( trusts ) .
14 . We demand profit - sharing in large industrial enterprises .
15 . We demand the extensive development of insurance for old age .
16 .
We demand the creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class , the immediate communalizing of big department stores , and their lease at a cheap rate to small traders , and that the utmost consideration shall be shown to all small traders in the placing of State and municiple orders .
17 .
We demand a land reform suitable to our national requirements , the passing of a law for the expropriation of land for communal purposes without compensation ; the abolition of ground rent , and the prohibition of all speculation in land .
* 18 .
We demand the ruthless prosecution of those whose activities are injurious to the common interest .
Common criminals , usurers , profiteers , etc. , must be punished with death , whatever their creed or race .
19 .
We demand that Roman Law , which serves a materialistic world order , be replaced by a German common law .
20 .
The State must consider a thorough reconstruction of our national system of education ( with the aim of opening up to every able and hard - working German the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement ) .
The curricula of all educational establishments must be brought into line with the requirements of practical life .
The aim of the school must be to give the pupil , beginning with the first sign of intelligence , a grasp of the nation of the State ( through the study of civic affairs ) .
We demand the education of gifted children of poor parents , whatever their class or occupation , at the expense of the State .
21 .
The State must ensure that the nation 's health standards are raised by protecting mothers and infants , by prohibiting child labor , by promoting physical strength through legislation providing for compulsory gymnastics and sports , and by the extensive support of clubs engaged in the physical training of youth .
22 .
We demand the abolition of the mercenary army and the foundation of a people 's army .
23 .
We demand legal warfare on deliberate political mendacity and its dissemination in the press .
To facilitate the creation of a German national press we demand : ( a ) that all editors of , and contributors to newspapers appearing in the German language must be members of the nation ;
( b ) that no non-German newspapers may appear without the express permission of the State .
They must not be printed in the German language ;
( c ) that non-Germans shall be prohibited by law from participating financially in or influencing German newspapers , and that the penalty for contravening such a law shall be the suppression of any such newspaper , and the immediate deportation of the non-Germans involved .
The publishing of papers which are not conducive to the national welfare must be forbidden .
We demand the legal prosecution of all those tendencies in art and literature which corrupt our national life , and the suppression of cultural events which violate this demand .
24 .
We demand freedom for all religious denominations in the State , provided they do not threaten its existence not offend the moral feelings of the German race .
The Party , as such , stands for positive Christianity , but does not commit itself to any particular denomination .
It combats the Jewish - materialistic spirit within and without us , and is convinced that our nation can achieve permanent health only from within on the basis of the principle :
The common interest before self - interest .
25 .
To put the whole of this programme into effect , we demand the creation of a strong central state power for the Reich ; the unconditional authority of the political central Parliament over the entire Reich and its organizations ; and the formation of Corporations based on estate and occupation for the purpose of carrying out the general legislation passed by the Reich in the various German states .
The leaders of the Party promise to work ruthlessly -- if need be to sacrifice their very lives -- to translate this programme into action .
* On April 13 , 1928 , Adolf Hitler clarified section seventeen in the programme in order to stop political mischaracterizations : " Because of the mendacious interpretations on the part of our opponents of Point 17 of the programme of the NSDAP , the following explanation is necessary . :
Since the NSDAP is fundamentally based on the principle of private property , it is obvious that the expression " confiscation without compensation " refers merely to the creation of possible legal means of confiscating when necessary , land illegally acquired , or not administered in accordance with the national welfare .
It is therefore directed in the first instance against the Jewish companies which speculate in land .

I ’ve been reading about Mrs. Palin .
My head did n’t explode until I read this :
She ’s a hit [ Mona Charen ]
I ’m getting tons of mail like this : Sarah is real !!!
What a fabulous contrast with Obama , who is not real .
Sarah is from America .
Obama is not .
If it was meant to bait me , well nom nom nom , I am eating the bait .
I now officially hate these weasel fucks .
And that ’s saying something .
For 20 years , I lived in Indiana , where you ca n’t make a Dan Quayle joke in mixed company , where our right - wing editorial page regularly got complaints that it was n’t conservative enough , where the same thing was said about Rush Limbaugh , blah blah blah .
I developed a mantra , which I ’ve discussed here before , but indulge me .
I ’d say : I have arrived at this point in time on my own path , and so has this person before me .
We have reached different conclusions along the way .
Ommmm .
This kept me from going insane and perhaps even made me a better person .
I should have said it out loud more often .
Hell , I should have screamed it in a few people ’s faces .
I certainly feel like doing so now .
That smelly little excrescence above , that ’s it in a nutshell .
These are the people I want gone .
Not just out of the White House , off the national stage .
I want them out of the country , put on boats and sent to the southern ocean to circle the pole until they break up in the ice and drown .
Mona Charen , daughter of privilege , who went from Livingston , N.J. to Barnard to the White House to the Capital Gang to the Corner , approvingly quoting an anonymous turd - juggler calling Sarah Palin “ from America ” and Barack Obama not from America .
[ Enter : Ghost of Ashley Morris ]
Fuck you , you fucking fucks .
[ Exit : Ghost ]
You are un-American .
You do n’t deserve to live in this country .
You are simply too much , dare I say , of an elitist .
Since the ascendancy of Ronald Reagan , these people have been the self - appointed arbiters of Who Gets to be American .
For nearly 30 years , they ’ve sat in their well - paid jobs typing with their soft little hands , making the world safe for themselves .
They are liars and hypocrites of the worst sort : Divorce is OK for Peggy Noonan , bad for you .
Working mothers named Phyllis Schlafly or Mary Matalin or Mona Charen are good , but your job takes you away from your precious children just so you can be fulfilled , you selfish bitch .
Homosexuals who want to live together under a legal contract will destroy marriage , but homosexuals married to opposite - sex partners ( Hi , Mrs. Craig ! ) wo n’t .
Bill “ Double - down ” Bennett repackages Aesop ’s fables as “ The Book of Virtues ” and gambles his royalty checks in casino VIP rooms , but that ’s OK .
I could go on .
Of course it would be Mona Charen who would do this for me .
Our paper used to run her column , and I ’d read it every so often .
Her big issues were communism and culture , and like most columnists , filed dispatches from the home front once in a while .
She nearly dislocated her shoulder patting herself on the back for staying home with her children — she ’d blushingly describe her child - care arrangements while she penned her deathless prose as “ having help ” — and occasionally would express her simmering resentment that she ’d given up her career ( writing speeches for Nancy Reagan : Wikipedia ) and its financial rewards for her kids , while others had n’t .
One day she wrote that a family with a $ 200,000 annual income could hardly be considered affluent .
In her , ahem , elite circles , this is certainly true .
And yet she claims to be in touch with the “ real ” America , while everyone with a D after their name is n’t .
You could n’t make this shit up on a head of windowpane , folks .
You really could n’t .
And who would n’t be a little resentful ?
She went to Barnard and George Washington University Law School !
All that to write twice a week for Creators Syndicate and be part of the Corner ?
That ’s a waste of a good education .
( I keep wondering how long it ’ll be before these folks come out against educating girls at all , if they ’re just going to stay home with their kids anyway .
In this arena , the FLDS folks are bleeding - edgers . )
You know why “ the base ” loves Palin ?
It comes up time and again , as it ’s about the only really notable thing about her :
She had her last baby , even though she knew ahead of time it had Down Syndrome .
This is a noble act , to be sure , but I do n’t see how it qualifies one for high office .
And so much for women being judged as anything other than a collection of female body parts .
( The fringiest part of the fringe will wonder , if she ’s so pure ‘ n ’ all , why she even had the test in the first place , opposition to all prenatal testing being a big signifier for these folks . )
But back to the culture warriors .
They ’ll snicker behind their hands at the funny names black people give their kids but think Track and Trig and Willow are fine names for , er , white children .
Palin , from the 49th state , is “ from America , ” and Obama , from the 50th , is n’t .
Palin hunts and fishes in exurban Anchorage — good .
Obama works in inner-city Chicago — bad .
They ’re too self - deluded to see the truth before their eyes , that they ’re both “ America , ” an America that can support and elevate people from such divergent backgrounds , who make such different choices .
But they ca n’t see that , because only people who make choices they approve of get to be Americans .
You might say they do n’t matter , these little foot soldiers .
Yes , they do .
They matter now more than ever , because they ’re the amplifiers .
They ’re the bloggers and other chatterers who pick up the talking points and talk them to death .
Later in the day at the Corner :
Not from America [ Mona Charen ]
Did not mean to endorse what one letter writer said about Obama not being from America .
He obviously is — from the furthest left part .
I just loved the guy ’s phrase “ more precious than pearls is a woman who likes to fish and hunt . ”
FWIW , I do neither .
Really , Mona ?
Could ’ve fooled me .
By the way , I fish and have no particular problem with hunting , although I ’ve never done it .
And I ’m voting for Obama .
Vote Oregon ! by jugbo
So , apparently you ca n’t take a picture of your vote if you vote in person in Michigan :
The use of video cameras , still cameras and other recording devices — including cell phone cameras — is banned at Michigan polling places .
I can understand that there should be no way someone could take a photo of someone else ’s vote without permission , but it seems sort of like overkill .
We ’ll be voting absentee , so I suppose we could legally take photos of our votes since we ’ll be at home .

Rand Refinery Ltd. , the world ’s largest gold refinery , ran out of South African Krugerrands after an “ unusually large ” order from a buyer in Switzerland .
The order was for 5,000 ounces and it will take until Sept. 3 for inventories to be replenished , said Johan Botha , a spokesman for Rand Refinery in Germiston , east of Johannesburg .
He declined to identify the buyer .
Coins and bars of precious metals are attracting investors as a haven against a sliding dollar and conflict between Russia and its neighbor Georgia .
The U.S. Mint suspended sales of one - ounce “ American Eagle ” gold coins , Johnson Matthey Plc stopped taking orders for 100 - ounce silver bars at its Salt Lake City refinery and Heraeus Holding GmbH has a delivery waiting list of as long as two weeks for orders of gold bars in Europe .

But if the intermingling of many different kinds of people is what gives Tel Aviv its pulse , it ’s the clash of old and new that still gives this city its surprising and slightly uneven gait .
On trendy Sheinkin Street , a store called SeXso Jeans is cheek - by - jowl with the Kabbalah store ; on the edges of Neve Tzedek  the first neighborhood the Jews started when they left Jaffa in 1887 , and now the loveliest and most villagelike part of town  a 44 - story skyscraper looms like a gangly , unwanted bodyguard .
The modernist feeling you get from walking around what is the largest collection of Bauhaus buildings in the world is unmoored by the realization that you are just a mile or two away from the ancient port of Jaffa , from which Jonah sailed en route to his intimate encounter with a whale .
Or consider Agenda , a restaurant devoted to the age - old practice of skewering meat .
A sign hanging on its facade  “ Agenda : The Shawarma ”  sounds like a Tom Clancy book about some very , very dangerous pita .
Tel Aviv is “ half Iran , half California ; it ’s a synagogue meets a sushi bar , ” says the writer and lifelong Tel Aviv resident Etgar Keret , whose mordant and hilarious short stories in books like “ The Nimrod Flipout ” have often won him the encomium “ the voice of young Israel . ”
The son of Holocaust survivors  his father saved his own life by living in a hole in Russia for two years 
Mr. Keret is party to his own dichotomy : his brother is an extreme left - wing anarchist who is head of the Israel ’s movement to legalize marijuana , and his sister is an ultra-Orthodox mother of 11 who formerly lived in a settlement .
“ This is a country that on the one hand is so conservative that we do n’t have public transportation on Saturdays , but on the other hand is so open that we sent a transsexual to the Eurovision Song Contest , ” says Mr. Keret .
“ Israel is full of contradiction .
In Jerusalem , this contradiction means separation .
But it does n’t in Tel Aviv . ”
For Israelis , the 45 minutes that separate Jerusalem from Tel Aviv are a fitting metaphor for the cultural gulf they see between , on the one hand , the hidebound , pious cradle of world religion and , on the other , the libertine , nightclub - filled Mediterranean idyll .
But for us visitors , the proximity of the two cities is a huge boon  it ’s rare that you can pair a beach vacation with 5,000 years of history .
And while the memories I developed during the course of my weeklong , first - ever trip to Tel Aviv are pleasant and strong , the ones I concurrently made during my eight - hour - long , first - ever trip to Jerusalem are permanently scarred into my brain .
You do n’t have to be devout , or even a believer , to be moved to tears by a visit to Jesus ’ Stations of the Cross or to the Holocaust Museum of Yad Vashem .
At the latter , the Children ’s Memorial is a single room in which five candles are reflected in 500 mirrors , creating the impression of an infinity of candles ; meanwhile a voice slowly intones the individual names and nationalities of the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by Nazis .
The effect is bone - chilling .
Tel Avivans are quick to point out that their city is less suffused with history than Jerusalem , and that that is what makes their city so hospitable to newcomers and to people who do n’t fit in elsewhere .
Perhaps , like others in the Middle East , Tel Avivans must perforce set their gaze on the present .
McCain on divestment
Obama poked McCain today for backing divestment from Iran after not signing on to Obama 's and Brownback 's bill a year ago favoring that course .
McCain aide Randy Scheunemann had no explanation for that , but said Obama should have held hearings on divestment from Iran in his senate subcommittee , despite Iran 's location .
( The Europe subcommittee , Avi points out , has been recently granted the scope to hold hearings on anything John McCain is interested in . )

Banking - Bush style
Advertisement
Regular Brasscheck TV viewers know that throughout its second term , the Bush administration actively interfered with states that attempted to enforce their own state lending laws .
Bush & Co. used the Office of the Controller of the Currency to sue states like New York to stop them from going after predatory lenders .
Bush Jr. is not the first Bush to get " hands on " involved in shaping the lending industry to his will .
Many know that one of this brothers , Neil , was part of a spectacular Savings & Loan failure in the 1980s .
What far fewer people are aware of is how deeply the CIA , organized crime and , George Bush Sr. were involved in the Savings & Loan disaster which caused US taxpayers and estimated trillion dollars plus .
The term of art for these kinds of operations is a " bust out . "
The scam works as follows : an organized crime group takes over a business , borrows as much as it can in the business ' name , fails to pay vendors and then disappears with all the cash .
The Bush family and its associates in organized crime and the CIA have figured out how to run this scam on a multi- hundred billion dollar level using the entire US banking system as its playground .
When you consider that Reagan was probably out of it from Day One of his term and that Bill Clinton is a close associate of George Bush Sr. , the Bush crime syndicate has been influencing when not outright running the executive branch continuously since 1980 , which , perhaps not so coincidentally , marks the earliest days of the credit bubble the economy is now having serious trouble digesting .

WINNIPEG–It 's an unacceptable tragedy that a man waited 34 hours in a Winnipeg hospital emergency room and was dead for several hours before he was finally brought to the attention of medical staff , Premier Gary Doer said today .
Although the 45 - year - old man – who CTV Winnipeg identified as a double amputee named Brian Sinclair – was " a regular " at the emergency room , regional health officials say he was never registered or seen by triage nurses over the weekend until it was too late .
" The bottom line is we are not making an excuse for this , " Doer said Tuesday following a grilling over the incident in the legislature .
" This is a tragic incident and it should n't have happened . "
Sinclair was dropped off at Health Sciences Centre by a taxi Friday afternoon after visiting a downtown health clinic which is part of the regional health authority .
Some hospital staff did speak with the man at some point , but it was not until shortly after midnight on Sunday that he was examined and pronounced dead .
The cause of death has not been released .
CTV Winnipeg quoted a man who did not want to be named as saying he had been in the emergency room on the Friday night and had seen Sinclair sitting in his wheelchair , looking like he was asleep .
But when the man came back the following night , he noticed Sinclair 's position had not changed so he told nurses and security workers , who responded they were too busy to check on Sinclair .
" The nurse said we 'll go and check , ( but ) nobody ever went and checked on him , " said the man , who had been there with his wife .
" We waited another hour or so and we told another nurse twice to go and check . "
The man said he also told a security officer of Sinclair 's condition but the guard told him the case would be " too much paperwork . "
Doer said the province followed the recommendation of an earlier task force and hired re-assessment nurses who are required to check up on registered patients waiting in the emergency department , but Sinclair was never even registered with the triage nurses .
" This system broke down and there were tragic circumstances , " Doer said .
" We 're trying to find out what exactly went wrong and we have n't got all the answers yet . "
The hospital was n't short - staffed at the time and a re-assessment nurse was on duty , he added .
Brock Wright , chief medical officer of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority , said he 's baffled about how Sinclair could have fallen through the cracks .
When the man was finally discovered by emergency room staff , Wright said he " had been dead for some time . "
" It 's hard to imagine how somebody could be in the department for 34 hours and somehow it not be apparent that the individual was waiting for care , " Wright said Tuesday .
" I understand how that 's hard to imagine and yet , it happened . "
On cold nights , Wright said it 's not unusual for homeless people to take shelter in the emergency room .
But he said any potential confusion that may have arisen from that practice does n't explain why Sinclair died without treatment .

" Our staff will provide blankets to homeless people who come in and are looking for some place warm .
They get to know those individuals and will interact with them , " he said .
" It 's not as if the staff is just focused exclusively on the patients and ignoring everything else around them , which makes it all the more puzzling . "
Patients who go into the emergency department are expected to approach the triage desk and register themselves or have someone register them on their behalf , he said .
The emergency department treats 50,000 people each year and there are always nurses on staff to process patients , he said .
Both the chief medical examiner and the regional health authority are investigating to ensure this never happens again , Wright said .
The hospital hopes to have its investigation complete within a month and will make the findings public , he added .
" We view this as a really tragic event , " he said .
" We 've never encountered this before . "
But opposition politicians said the " worst ER failure in Manitoba history " calls for a broad examination of the provincial health care system .
Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen said the government has to take responsibility for the tragedy .
" ( This ) demonstrates there was some kind of culture of neglect and unresponsiveness that needs to be looked into to be sure this is n't a systemic issue , " he said .
Friends of Sinclair told CTV
Winnipeg he was a former solvent abuser who had kicked his addictions .
" We have n't seen him in a year , " said Joseph Severeight .
" He quit using solvents and things like that .
And that 's how I knew him , he cleaned up his life . "
Sinclair 's brother , Bradley , told CTV he did n't know his brother had gone to the emergency room and was told by social workers that Brian had died .
" I feel awful , but I 'm going to pray for him , " he said .

The snow has arrived early in Reykjavik after an unusually long and warm summer .
The freeze has brought out the ghostly green haze of the aurora borealis - the Northern Lights - the shape of which shifts dramatically across the tiny city 's black skies .
The bars and restaurants of Iceland 's capital are packed , the Range Rovers and BMWs are parked nose to tail all along the streets of the central 101 district , and music is pumping from a black stretch Hummer limousine cruising by .
' What can we do ?
Its difficult times but we 've spent all day talking about it , watching the news getting worse and worse .
We had to go out and be with friends .
Maybe it's like the party at the end of the world , ' says Egill Tomasson , 32 , sitting in the Kaffeebarinn bar .
Iceland is on the brink of collapse .
Inflation and interest rates are raging upwards .
The krona , Iceland 's currency , is in freefall and is rated just above those of Zimbabwe and Turkmenistan .
One of the country 's three independent banks has been nationalised , another is asking customers for money , and the discredited government and officials from the central bank have been huddled behind closed doors for three days with still no sign of a plan .
International banks wo n't send any more money and supplies of foreign currency are running out .
People talk about whether a new emergency unity government is needed and if the EU would fast - track the country to membership .
On Friday the queues at the banks were huge , as people moved savings into the most secure accounts .
Yesterday people were buying up supplies of olive oil and pasta after a supermarket spokesman announced on Friday night that they had no means of paying the foreign currency advances needed to import more foodstuffs .
This North Atlantic volcanic island , which is the size of Cuba , with a population of 320,000 - the size of Coventry 's - is an unlikely player on the global financial stage .
It is famous for its fish , geysers and for winning the UN 's 2007 ' best country to live in ' poll .
But Iceland built its extraordinary wealth on the crest of the worldwide credit boom and now the crunch is sweeping it away , bankrupting a people for whom the past eight years have been , for most of them and by their own admission , one long party .
The nation 's celebrated rags - to - riches story began in the Nineties when free market reforms , fish quota cash and a stock market based on stable pension funds allowed Icelandic entrepreneurs to go out and sweep up international credit .
Britain and Denmark were favourite shopping haunts , and in 2004 alone Icelanders spent £ 894 m on shares in British companies .
In just five years , the average Icelandic family saw its wealth increase by 45 per cent .
But , as a result of the international banking crisis , the billionaires who own everything from West Ham United football club to the Somerfield supermarket chain , Hamleys toy shops and the House of Fraser , are in trouble and the country is drowning in debt .
Iceland 's cheap labour force , the Poles and Lithuanians , have left already - there 's little point in sending home such a worthless currency , and the tourist season is over .
Iceland is on its own .
In the Kaffeebarinn , Egill Tomasson is n't drinking because he has a music festival to organise .
Iceland Airwaves takes place in a fortnight , when more than 100 Icelandic bands and 50 foreign ones will play in venues around the city over four days .
Most of the tickets have been sold in krona , but the international acts need to be paid in euros , which is going to cost the organisers dearly .
' People here are going to need this festival , ' says Tomasson .
' This crisis has been a heavy blow .
And many people should have a bad conscience for what has happened .
Someone should be prosecuted , they have sucked Iceland dry , taken the money and ran , and left us totally in the shit .
People I know who have gone to the UK or the US to study have found their grants worthless , they are stranded . '
Like many his age , Tomasson has only a vague memory of harder times , before the boom that brought Iceland the highest per capita wealth in the world .
Older islanders call them the ' Krutt - kynslotin ' - the cuddly generation .
Eco-aware , earnest but pampered , they drift from organic café to bar , listening to the music of Björk and Sigur Rós , islanders who have made it big abroad .
' They will have to get their hands dirty now , ' says chef Siggi Hall , Iceland 's answer to Gordon Ramsay , with an effusive vocabulary to match .
' That 's good though , they are the I - generation ; iPods , iPhones , everything starts with I .
Well , we will have to go back to the basics now .
Icelanders are risk - takers , but hard working , they will have to downsize .
We will have to eat haddock and Icelandic lamb and forget these imports of goose livers and Japanese soy sauce .
When everyone was extremely rich in Iceland - you know , last month , it was with money that they never have earned .
Now those who were extremely rich are just normally rich , but they think they are poor .
They were spoilt , spending billions . '
Hall is due to open his new restaurant on 17 October , but insists the crisis is not worrying him .
' I had been losing customers because people were flying off to Copenhagen and London and New York for the weekend , to eat out .
Now they will stay in Iceland , but they will still eat out .
People need to eat . '
Outside the city 's Hofdahollin car showroom , looking a little rumpled for men trying to sell new and used cars for £ 35,000 and up , owner Runar Olafsson and his top salesman are sharing a Marlboro .
They are not expecting any customers today .
' A few years ago we could n't get enough top - end cars and we started importing them .
We were selling 120 , 140 , a month .
But it turned around so fast , ' says Olafsson .
' It 's so dramatic , just in one month .
We have already seen two dealers go down .
' Customers would come in and we would apply for credit online for them , a 100 per cent loan , and they can drive away in their new Range Rover .
It took ten minutes , it was very easy .
But 60 to 70 per cent of those loans were in foreign currency , Japanese yen or Swiss francs , and they have gone up 90 per cent as the krona burns .
A car worth 5 million krona now has a 9 million loan on it ; how are people going to make those payments ?'
Foreign currency loans are a problem for homeowners , too .
' Loans have been very cheap , house prices rose and there was a lot of good - quality housebuilding .
But the building has halted , nothing is being finished , nothing is selling .
The interest rates are staggering .
What people are doing now is swapping houses if they want to go bigger or smaller .
That is what is keeping us afloat , ' says estate agent Ingolfur Gissurarson .
His mobile goes off - the ringtone is A Hard Day 's Night by the Beatles .
' I changed it to suit the times , ' he smiles .
Blame it on the Vikings .
Icelanders like to hark back to their ancestors , the rebel Vikings who , as the nation 's most revered daughter Björk once explained , ' could n't deal with authority in Norway .
So they flew off in this mad ocean in a wooden boat which is pretty hardcore , North Atlantic in the year 800 .
And they found this island full of snow ... yeeeah !'
' The Icelandic psyche is an important part of all of this , ' says Hellgrimur Helgason , who writes an outspoken newspaper column which exposes feuds between Iceland 's ruling class and its entrepreneurs .
He is also the author of 101 Reykjavik , a popular novel populated by ' Krutt - kynslotin ' characters .
' Before the market reforms the country had stagnated , no one thought Icelanders could be businessmen .
We were poor fishermen or farmers , so it had an incredible effect on confidence when we saw these young men out buying up British and Danish companies .
Everyone grabbed at the new opportunities like children .
Really , it was no surprise that Hamleys toy shop was one of the first purchases . '
Gunnghilder Sveinbjarna and her friend , Anna Lara Magnusdottir , are ordering their second bottle of red wine in the Philippe Starck - designed interior of Reykjavik 's Bar 5 .
Tonight the young women are feeling no pain .
' We come out at the weekend to forget our children and our problems , and this time we will drink extra hard to make sure we forget the economic crisis too , ' says Gunnghilder , raising a glass .
' Tomorrow the sore head . '

In the 1980's we loved Nintendo .
And even better , in the 1980 's Nintendo loved us .
They gave us games , we played them .
They gave us cereal that was basically Kix with fun Nintendo - themed boxes , and we ate it and pretended to like it .
They gave us movies like Super Mario Bros. , widely considered the greatest film in the history of filmmakingcitation needed .
We watched the cartoons , learned how to Do the Mario ( ideal if the Macarena is too complex for you ) , slept in the sheets , memorized the codes , subscribed to Nintendo Power , and hooked up all manner of ridiculous equipment to our TVs .
Lately , though , Nintendo has all but turned its back on us .
Mainstream acceptance of the Wii has resulted in less core games like Pikmin and F - Zero , and more casual games like Big Brain Academy , WiiFit , Babyz Party , and Bob Ross Painting .
And seriously , who wants those ?
I 'm pretty sure the Big Brain Academy is n't accredited , we 're not 40 year old women , parties attended only by babies are just awkward , and Bob Ross ... actually , that game sounds pretty rad .
Still , Nintendo has n't been servicing the core gamer as much as they did in the SNES days , so many of us have moved on to the Xbox 360 and the PStriple .
Hector Martin , however , is more ambitious , and set out to do what any real geek would .
Try to hack the thing !
Now , Nintendo does n't want you hacking your Wii for several reasons .
" Homebrew " is often considered piracy 's cousin , which is why every major console is full of security measures to lock users out of running unauthorized code on them .
And when a console manufacturer catches a whiff of piracy , lawsuits ensue .
Piracy was rampant on the Dreamcast , and Sony is currently feeling the sting of piracy on its PSP platform .
That 's not to say that all console manufacturers want to prevent all user - created code from running on their systems ; far from it .
Microsoft has given the homebrew community a sandbox environment to work in with its XNA initiative .
Still , it 's run in a very locked - down managed environment with very limited resources ( you ca n't access files outside of your individual game 's allocated storage area , and you can't even grant read - only access to those files to other games ) .
You can code on the PS2 if you buy the Linux kit , but for the PS3 there 's no large - scale initiative to give development tools to consumers .
Nintendo is n't courting the hobbyist either — if you want to develop for the Wii , rumors are that you 're looking at $ 1,732.00 .
Not unreasonable for a console dev kit , but well out of reach for most hobbyists .
Breaking In
Hector just wanted to see what he could do with the Wii .
And when he first took a look under the hood , he started with the usual approach — he started poking through Wii game discs .
On every disc he tried , the entire contents were encrypted with secure RSA - 2048 and SHA - 1 .
The second place he looked — game saves — were signed using elliptic curve cryptography .
Nintendo clearly was n't going to make this easy .
It looked hopeless .
That is , until someone looked at the core function via a disassembler that performed the RSA and SHA - 1 verification .
Hector provided this pseudocode for the check function :
bool is_valid_signature ( byte signature [ 256 ] , byte public_key [ 256 ] , byte content_sh a1 [ 256 ] ) { byte decrypted_signature [ 256 ] ; decrypt_rsa( signature , public_key , decrypted_signature ) ; if ( strncmp( content_sha1 , decrypted_signature + 236 , 20 ) == 0 ) return 1 ; else return 0 ; }
This function is used in every piece of security - sensitive code Hector could find .
And rather than use a standard implementation , they rolled their own .
In short , they throw away 236 bytes of the RSA signature , which are typically just a particular constant .
If the signature is n't the expected constant , well , they apparently do n't care .
Furthermore , they 're using a string compare function to compare a binary SHA - 1 hash where they really should 've been using a binary compare function .
Reason being that a zero byte in the hash will cause strncmp to stop comparing , assuming it 's the string terminator .
All it takes is analyzing a few valid signatures ( say , on game discs ) and finding the one with the earliest zero byte , then bruteforcing the preceding bytes .
But there 's still the matter of the first 236 characters ( 1888 bits ) lopped off the signature .
And since RSA is based on exponentiation , if the signature is zero , the result ( and expected SHA - 1 hash ) is also zero .
Once this was discovered , the homebrew community was overjoyed !
It did n't take long before they were running custom code on the system .
Development moved quickly .
The homebrew community took it upon themselves to design their software to be as elegant and Wii - like as possible , and they succeeded .
The Homebrew Channel worked just like any other channel on the system , elegantly integrated into the Wii experience without interfering with existing channels .
Take a look yourself : it almost looks official .
Part of what made their lives easier was the storage of existing channels .
Interestingly , previously installed WiiWare games , Virtual Console games , and other channels are always considered " OK " by the system , and stored completely unencrypted .
Perhaps Nintendo figured that with all the security checks during the boot process , once something was in the system , it had already passed security and should be safe .
Therefore previously installed homebrew apps , and even hacked versions of the security software , are ignored by the system .
Amazingly , Wii Repair Centers have occasionally sent back replacement
Wiis with all of the homebrew apps transferred to the new system .
The Corporate Response
Nintendo is busy .
They 're selling Wiis faster than they can make them , they 've got a lot of internet petitions to ignore ( sure we do n't have EarthBound on the Virtual Console yet , but thanks for China Warrior ) , they have to keep an eye on the Check Mii Out channel and delete miis with genitals for faces , and they have to thwart Hector and crew 's hacks .
They started to fight back with firmware updates .
The Wii is designed such that this security and IO software is essentially duplicated with minor changes in 20 - plus different places .
With updates pushed via WiiConnect24 ( the Wii's automatic update service ) , they 've been slowly patching the holes .
Still , Nintendo has had to tread carefully , as they can't break existing software and risk a mass of bricked consoles clogging up their repair centers .
Out of the 20 - some instances , they 've fixed three so far .
The main impact this has had is that booting from a disc on a modded Wii ( as in , with a mod chip installed ) no longer works .
Exploiting an individual game still works fine , however .
One such exploit involved modifying saved games for The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess .
The hack involved a stack overflow on some of the strings in the game 's savefile .
Two of the strings were the player 's name ( in my case , " Link " ) , and the horse 's name ( in my case , " Horsey " ) .
An exploited save file was made available online , which could be copied onto an SD card , and then copied onto the Wii via its built - in SD card slot .
Then you start up the game , walk backward a step or two , and voilà the homebrew channel is installed off the SD card .
On June 16 , 2008 , Nintendo released a patch , which was timestamped March 6 .
It seemed reasonable that with development , testing , and finally releasing that the cycle would be at least three months .
Among other things , the update included a few functions that raised Hector 's eyebrow .
DeleteSavedata and VerifySavedataZD .
These were designed to thwart the Twilight Princess hack , but like their signature checking algorithm , they did n't quite get it right .
Here 's the condensed version in pseudocode that would run during the boot process :
fileLength = getfilelength ( savefile ) ; fileLength = ( fileLength + 31 ) & ( ~31 ) ; data = malloc( fileLength ) ; fd = fopen ( savefile , " r " ) ; if ( fread ( data , 1 , fileLength , fd ) != fileLength ) { //
The file length is a multiple of 32 return NO_EXPLOIT ; }
In short , it verifies that the save file length is a multiple of 32 , as all legitimate Twilight Princess saves are .
The publicly released hacked file was not .
It went on to check individual save slots , and individual strings within the save file for their lengths .
If the check failed , the file was deleted from the console .
Code was added to prevent the hacked save file from being transferred off an SD card , too .
It did n't take long to figure out a workaround , by exploiting some bugs in the code that Hector disassembled .
One in particular that was useful was that it only checked the first file on the card with the Twilight Princess filename ( zeldaTp.dat ) .
If you had two files with the same name , it'd only check the first one , then the code that copies the save from the SD into the internal memory overwrites it when it gets copied .
Six hours after the firmware update , they 'd figured out a new exploit , and a few days later a new version of the hack was released to the public .
Tug of War
Nintendo is still engaged in a fierce tug - of - war with the homebrew scene , and for every feature they add to enhance security , Hector and crew find a way around it .
Wii hacking for the consumer is n't hard to do , as instructions are readily available online , and the only necessary supplies are an SD card and Twilight Princess .
Homebrew applications include media players ( including DVD playback , not natively supported by the Wii ) , emulators , games ( originals as well as Quake and Doom ) , file system browsers , and a version of Linux ( surprised ? ) .
There 's even a utility to change the Wii's region , which is now being used for buying ( yes , buying ) WiiWare games that have n't been made available to all regions .
For the most part it seems that the homebrew scene caters to the geeks who want to see what they can do with the system .
Sure , there are those that use these powers for evil , but the intentions of the majority of the community are pure .
The Wii is n't just a games console , it 's an interesting challenge that has brought people together for little more than the joy of hacking , experimentation , and creation .
This autumn 's banking panic will take a severe toll on world growth especially in developed economies .
GDP growth in the OECD group of mainly rich countries will slow to 0.4 per cent in 2009 , the weakest since 1982 .
Among the G7 , the American and British economies will contract next year and the best performer among the other five countries will be Canada , with GDP growth of just 0.5 per cent .
The key downside risk is that the bailout packages may not succeed , in which case financial turmoil will persist and the recession will be deeper and more prolonged than we are forecasting .
The financial shock will pull down growth through three main channels .
First , credit will become scarcer for both businesses and households .
Second , firms and consumers have become more cautious , which will also make them cut back .
Third , lower equity prices will reduce consumption and bear down on business investment by making it harder for companies to raise capital .
The world economy
Global growth will weaken from 4.0 per cent this year to 2.8 per cent in 2009 , the slowest since 2002 .
National output will fall in the United States by 0.5 per cent in 2009 , the first full - year decline since 1991 and the largest since 1982 .
The Euro Area and Japan will each grow by only 0.3 per cent next year .
China will act as a growth counterpole as its economy slows only modestly , from 9.9 per cent this year to 8.6 per cent in 2009 .
The crisis in the financial sector will thus spread out to the wider economy mainly by curbing consumer spending and private investment , both of which will fall next year in all the G7 economies except for Japan .
Personal consumption will decline by 1.8 per cent in the US and by 0.5 per cent in the Euro Area .
American business investment will decline by 3.3 per cent while housing investment will fall by 18.8 per cent , only a little less than this year .
Private investment will contract by 5.5 per cent in the Euro Area .
The forecast incorporates the coordinated half - point cut in interest rates on 8 October by several central banks and assumes that the resulting rates are held until mid-2009 , apart from a further half - point reduction in the UK at the turn of this year .
If central banks were to deliver a further coordinated cut of 2.5 percentage points , this would raise annual output growth by a quarter of a percentage point over the next two years in the US and UK , and a little less in the Euro Area .
The scope for alleviating the economic reverse through fiscal policy is relatively limited , but it may become the only effective tool available for economies like the US whose policy rates are already very low .
The causes of and lessons from the financial crisis are examined in six special articles in the Review .
The main message is that while monetary policy should ' lean against the wind ' when asset bubbles are developing , the crucial fault was a lack of macroprudential regulation , partly because of an institutional silo mentality .
Central banks and the BIS had given warning about risks , but the remedies often lay with separate financial regulators , who did not respond adequately to these worries .
Reforms will require those responsible to take a synoptic view of the financial system and should focus on higher capital requirements for banks .
Those expanding their loan book rapidly should have to increase their capital ratios .
Capital reserves should also be linked to reliance on wholesale funding markets .
And complex new products should also require more capital .
Regulators will have to remain vigilant to new developments as these changes to rules are ' fighting the last war ' .
The UK economy
The economy will contract in the second half of 2008 and GDP will fall by 0.9 per cent in 2009 , the first full - year recession since 1991 .
Consumer spending will decline by 3.4 per cent next year .
The other main factor dragging the economy down next year is a big fall in housing and business investment .
Public sector net borrowing will increase from 2.5 per cent of GDP in 2007 𔃆 to 4.5 per cent this year and 5.3 per cent in 2009 - 10 .
The British economy will suffer next year as it experiences the worst setback among the G7 countries .
This reflects an especially pronounced reverse to consumer spending , which will fall by 3.4 per cent in 2009 , easily the biggest decline among the G7 .
The economy will also be dragged down by the collapse in private housing investment , which will fall by 17.1 per cent , and lower business investment , which will decline by 3.8 per cent .
A sizeable contribution from net trade ( mainly reflecting lower imports ) is not sufficient to stave off recession in 2009 .
The forecast assumes a further half - point cut in interest rates in early 2009 , reducing the Bank rate to 4.0 per cent .
The Bank of England has more scope to cut rates now that consumer - price inflation has probably peaked , although it will still be above the 2 per cent target until the end of 2009 .
However , it takes time for rate cuts to stimulate activity in normal times .
And in current conditions the effectiveness of monetary policy is limited by credit rationing by banks and falling demand for loans .
Even a very big cut in the Bank rate would not be sufficient to avoid a recession in the UK .
The UK is especially vulnerable to the credit crisis because of imbalances that had developed in recent years .
The current account balance worsened to 3.8 per cent of GDP in 2007 .
Household debt rose to 170 per cent of income by the end of 2007 and the household saving ratio fell to negligible levels .
The sharp fall in consumer spending next year will occur as the saving ratio rises from 0.7 per cent of disposable income in 2008 to 4.4 per cent in 2009 at a time when real income growth remains paltry .
The outlook for the public finances is poor .
Public sector net borrowing will rise to 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2008 - 09 , and then climb further to 5.3 per cent next year and 6.1 per cent in 2010 - 11 .
Public sector net debt will rise to 50.5 per cent of GDP in 2008 - 9 .
The deterioration in public sector net borrowing reflects the impact of the recession , together with weaker receipts from the financial and property sectors .

RESEARCH ARTICLES
Introduction : The Great Crash of 2008
Ray Barrell
THE EVOLUTION OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2007 - 2008
Ray Barrell and E. Philip Davis
The financial crisis that started in August 2008 has reached a climax in the autumn of 2008 with a wave of bank nationalisations across North America and Europe .
Although banking crises are not uncommon , this is the largest since 1929 - 33 .
This paper discusses the build - up to the crisis , looking at the role of low real interest rates in stimulating an asset price bubble .
That bubble was stocked by financial innovation and increases in lending .
New financial products were not stress tested and have failed in the downturn .
After discussing the bubbles we look at the collapse of the complex asset structure , and then put the crisis in the context of the literature .
The paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications of the crisis , and advocates a significant improvement in the regulatory structure .
RISK MANAGEMENT AND THE COSTS OF THE BANKING CRISIS
Patrick Honohan
The 2007 - 08 banking crisis in the advanced economies has exposed deficiencies in risk management and prudential regulation approaches that rely too heavily on mechanical , albeit sophisticated , risk management models .
These have aggravated private and economic losses .
While fiscal costs were at first limited , it remains to be seen to what extent the taxpayer will be protected .
Policymakers and bankers need to recognise the limitations of rules - based regulation and restore a more discretionary and holistic approach to risk management .
SHOULD MONETARY POLICY RESPOND TO ASSET PRICE BUBBLES ?
REVISITING THE DEBATE
Sushil Wadhwani
Recent events have highlighted the importance of asset prices to central bank decisions .
We argue that , in response to asset price bubbles , central banks should ' lean against the wind ' ( LATW hereafter ) .
Even if the bubbles themselves are not significantly affected by LATW , macroeconomic performance can be improved if monetary policy reacts to asset price misalignments over and above the reaction to fixed horizon inflation forecasts .
In addition , it might reduce the probability of bubbles arising at all .
This article restates the case for LATW , and reviews the debate .
In particular I respond to various criticisms that have been made against LATW and briefly consider alternative policies designed to make the financial system less cyclical .
COULD EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS HAVE HELPED TO PREDICT THE SUB - PRIME CRISIS ?
E. Philip Davis and Dilruba Karim
One of the features of the sub - prime crisis , that began in August 2007 , was its unexpected nature .
It came as a surprise not only to most financial market participants but also in some degree to the policy community .
In this context , we seek to assess whether early warning systems based on the logit and binomial tree approaches on the UK and US economies could have helped to warn about the crisis .
We also consider a ' check list approach ' of indicators based on history .
Although not all of the complementary approaches are successful , we contend that our work suggests that a broadening of approaches to macroprudential analysis is appropriate .
THE BOUNDARY PROBLEM IN FINANCIAL REGULATION
Charles Goodhart
The current financial crisis has raised queries about the adequacy of the present regulatory regime .
Whilst the immediate priority may be to plug the obvious holes in the system , there are some long - term generic problems with almost any system of financial regulation .
This paper explores one such concern , i.e. the boundary problem .
This arises because effective regulation , one that actually bites , is likely to penalise those within the regulated sector , relative to those just outside , causing substitution flows towards the unregulated .
This boundary problem impacts on many proposals , such as ' narrow banking ' and my own , with Avinash Persaud , for state and time - varying capital adequacy requirements .
The question of how and where to set the boundary is considered .
Such boundaries will always be criticised as leading to disintermediation , competitive inequality ( no level - playing - field ) , inefficiency and higher spreads and borrowing rates ; and such criticisms will be valid up to a point .
The paper ends by discussing how best to respond .
FINANCIAL CRISES , REGULATION AND GROWTH
Ray Barrell , Ian Hurst and Simon Kirby
The paper discusses the effects on growth of a systemic banking crisis as a result of debt defaults .
These effects will come from the impact of credit rationing on consumption and credit and from the impacts of a significant rise in the spread between lending and borrowing rates for both producers and consumers .
The analysis uses the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium version of the National Institute global model .
The paper also investigates the impact on output of a permanent , regulation induced , rise in margins in the financial sector , taking into account the impacts of regulation on equity market valuations .

Researchers at the Universiti Malaysia Sarawak have developed a paper recycling process which ditches the chemicals for a more natural approach .
For the few paper products I buy , I look for 100 % post - consumer content — especially for toilet paper , as I like to avoid flushing trees down the can .
But as we ’re sometimes reminded , our recycling technology is not always perfect .
For scrap paper to turn into a new ream or roll , the used product must go through an expensive de-inking process involving chemicals that are n’t too friendly to the environment .
Traditionally the recycling process starts by blending paper to a pulp and then treating it with an array of harmful detergents and alkali to remove any ink , and then later bleaching the product to a bright white .
While this process works well with newsprint , laser - printed office wastepaper does n’t fare quite so well .
To better remove the pigment from laser - printed paper , the Malaysian scientists turned to a natural enzyme called endoglucanase , which is grown in a liquid culture containing palm pith waste and rice husk .
The enzyme removes the ink without changing the final paper product ; in fact , when compared to its chemically - treated counterpart , the researchers found the paper had enhanced “ brightness , air permeability , tensile , and tear . ”
This research could not only reduce the toxicity of the paper recycling process , but also make it more economical to perform .
Once the method catches on , we can all rest assured that recycled post - consumer paper is not only saving trees and energy , but also produced using clean technology .

ON the subject of brunch , the chef Colin Alevras holds inflexible opinions .
For example : “ I love to go to brunch , but I do n’t want to stand in line with the rest of those lunatics .
There ’s no reason you should ever do that .
Ever . ”
And : “ Espresso has no place at brunch .
None . ”
The topic was much on his mind this summer as he drew up plans for Permanent Brunch , a forthcoming East Village spot that will serve eggs , waffles , red flannel hash , bloody marys and silver dollar pancakes , all staples of morning eating .
Mr. Alevras intends to offer them all day , and all night on weekends .
If it seems like a step down in the world for the former chef and co-owner of the Tasting Room , Mr. Alevras says that is fine with him .
What started as a homey little East Village wine bar in 1999 very quickly turned into a restaurant .
The bigger , grander Tasting Room he opened on Elizabeth Street in 2006 was a restaurant , capital R , underlined twice .

Even as the housing bubble took Wall Street down for the first market bottom in the spring , McCain preached “ less regulation ” as the solution .
He did n’t say this five years ago , but just a few months ago while it was all unraveling .
McCain probably even thought he was a clever guy for his snappy answer that pleases the GOP faithful .
Less regulation had worked so far in their minds , so what the hell ?
Even yesterday , Palin talked about making Fannie / Freddie “ smaller ” though it was n’t clear if she meant the actual company or the size of the oversight team .
( That ’s what happens when you do n’t answer questions . )
McCain admits that he knows nothing about the economy and calling for less regulation really reinforces that proud ignorance .
If anyone can actually ask John McCain a question ( or Palin for that matter ) it would be interesting to hear how the McCain plan ( in reality , the Phil Gramm plan ) of less regulation would help in the case of the Freddie / Fannie nationalization or whatever they want to call it .
Obviously McCain is incapable of answering the toughest question facing America right now so we can even let him use his cheat sheet and economic brain , Foreclosure Phil .
Eight years ago , when Erik Ramsey was 16 , a car accident triggered a brain stem stroke that left him paralyzed .
Though fully conscious , Ramsey was completely paralyzed , essentially “ locked in , ” unable to move or talk .
He could communicate only by moving his eyes up or down , thereby answering questions with a yes or a no .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - French scientists have devised a way of using particle accelerators to authenticate vintage wines , one of France ’s top research bodies said this week .
The new method tests the age of the glass in wine bottles by analyzing X - rays emitted when the bottles are placed under ion beams produced by a particle accelerator , the National Centre for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) said in a statement .
“ This enables the age of bottles and their origin to be verified and thus a vintage to be authenticated , a bit like the signature of a painter on a masterpiece , all without opening the bottle and without affecting in any way the content , ” it said .
By comparing the results with a database containing detailed information on 80 bottles from the Bordeaux region from the 19th century to the present day , the tests can help indicate the vintage of many wines .
“ Authentication is possible due to the complexity of the processes of glass manufacture which have evolved over time and to the variety of production centers which give each object a characteristic ‘ signature ’ made up of many elements , ” the CNRS said .
Particle accelerators take a particle , such as an electron , speed it up to near the speed of light and smash it into an atom to discover its internal workings .
The new test extends existing radioactivity tests on the actual wine itself , which are currently incapable of identifying vintages prior to 1950 .
The test was developed in cooperation with London - based wine dealer The Antique Wine Company .
Long - time readers will remember the MMI , or Muddled Metaphor Index , which was basically a long - running gag at the media 's expense .
Now I 've been provoked again , and so I introduce the MTI , or Mortgage Telephone Index .
I 'm sort of hoping this will be the only entrant into the series , but you never know .
The MTI features reporters and editors who apparently spend all their day on bad cell phone connections and do not actually read much about mortgages .
This produces an effect like the old game of " Telephone , " with equally hilarious results .
Today 's Washington Post brings us " Bad Begets Worse , " which is actually the title of this article and did I not make that up .
Freddie Mac , for instance , no longer finances no - money - down mortgages , nor does it continue to buy or guarantee mortgages given to people who have failed to document their finances .
Fannie Mae has withdrawn from the market for all - day loans , which are considered risky because they require less documentation than traditional prime loans .
No , Fannie Mae has not suddenly decided that mortgage loans need to have terms of more than 24 hours to be eligible for purchase .
It appears that someone said " Alt - A " and someone else heard " all - day .
" Presumably we will be able to tell if we have any readers at the Washington Post by how long it takes for that to go away . . . .( Hat tip , Michael ! )

Our American Common Law
by Howard Fisher and Dale Pond
Common Law is a real thing .
It is a real system of laws derived from centuries of work , study and sacrifice of millions of people .
It is not trivial and inconsequential as some would have you think .
It is the Common Law that is most represented within Our Constitution , Declaration of Independence and Our Bill of Rights .
These documents were designed to limit and eliminate the vicious Equity , Maritime or Admiralty Law which was what we revolted against as Our Revolution against the totalitarianism of England .
Did you know the Anglo - American system ( Our system ) of jurisprudence is the only one which developed out of what is called the Common Law , that is , the general law of private property known in the British Isles ?
It is true - Common Law was designed through the centuries to secure the rights of individuals ( you and me ) to property and to make it difficult for property to be taken away from us by a government or governmental structure ( bureaucracy ) without due process of law .
The Common Law was expounded over the years in hundreds of thousands of case decisions as a result of trials in which the Common Law jury acted as the Judges , and in which they exercised the authority to hear and decide questions of both Law and fact .
Common Law deals with legal relationships , powers and liabilities , and types of actions rather than theoretical definitions of abstract legal concepts .
The Common Law was recognized by Our Founding Fathers and is the basis of all law in America today .
The Common Law recognizes the Power of Government lies in the common people and not in an elite group of power brokers .
It is the terrible Equity , Maritime or Admiralty Laws ( laws of contract ) that steals this power from the people and centralizes it into the hands of a few power oriented men .
The Common Law deals in real property whereas the Equity Laws deal in written abstractions of performance ( agreements or contracts ) .
In other words , Masters own their own property , work and destiny .
We are all Masters when we truly own our own property .
Slaves do not own property , they usually rent property of another and are compelled to perform upon or with that rented ( tenured ) property according to some agreement or contract .
It is from such controversies involving property that all of our Rights have come .
Property is known as Substance at the Common Law , and includes hard Money in the form of gold and silver coin as required by Our federal Constitution and every other State Constitution as they were all drafted to be in perfect harmony one with another .
Controversies involving these matters carry with them a Law jurisdiction , a jurisdiction in which all of our Rights are found .
The Judge in a Court of Common Law is an impartial referee of the dispute , and he is bound to protect the Rights of the parties to the dispute , or he will have lost whatever jurisdiction he may have had , or claimed to have had .
It is the Jury who decides whether or not the Facts of the case are valid and they also decide the Law - does it apply ?
Is it correct for this case ? , etc .
Only judges acting under equity law can decide law ...
You know you are in an Equity / Admiralty Court when an American flag is displayed that has a GOLD trim .
The gold trim denotes military jurisdiction and not Common Law or Constitutional jurisdiction .
Wherever this flag is flown the Constitution is NOT .
To see the civilian flag click here .
Gold and silver Coin are the only Things recognized at Law ( within our Constitution ) to be real and lawful money .
Money is Substance in possession and not a Chose ( thing ) in action .
When a debt is paid , at Law , the debt is extinguished ; debt no longer exists ; the debt is paid .
Debt can only be paid with gold and silver Coin , or certificates redeemable on demand , at par , in gold and silver Coins .
This is the legal meaning of the expression " tender in payment of debt " , as found in Article I , Section 10 of the Constitution of the United States .
Federal Reserve Notes are not money - they are bills / notes and / or certificates of indebtedness as each and every one of them are owed back to the Federal Reserve Bank who lent them to Us - plus interest .
Thomas Jefferson placed great emphasis on the concept of Rights .
He said we did not bring the English Common Law , as such , to this continent ; we brought the Rights of Man as evidenced through and by the tried and true ancient system of Common Law .
The Common Law of the States of the United States is the Common Law of England adopted by the original Constitution of the United States , so far as not modified by any alterations made by the Constitution of the State at the time of admission to the Union , and so far as not in direct conflict with the Constitution of the United States of America .
And the Common Law of the States may not be modified , limited nor abrogated either by an act of the legislature ( Congress or State Legislature ) or by a ruling of some judge or by any county board of commissioners or any other servant to the people .
Federal and state bureaucracies are constantly writing and presenting code , rules or statutes in an attempt to circumvent the original Common Law foundation of Our Constitution .
A major part of the problem that we are in is a result of these unlawful attempts by legislatures , judges and bureaucracies to modify or abrogate Common Law and thus Our Constitution .
While , in England , this Law was derived from feudal tenures in real property as held by a pyramid of proprietors ( land owners ) holding their rights given them from the King ( or Crown ) on down the line .
The American Revolution destroyed any and all allegiance to the British Crown , including the rights of property in land , and all feudal tenures and dues were overthrown .
All Rights of property in land in the United States became ALLODIAL TITLES in Allodial Freehold , existing under no lord or overlord whatsoever , including the authority of the Colony or State .
The ties that bound property use or ownership to a higher or superior power were entirely and completed severed , destroyed and made as though they never existed .
This is the reason why our founding fathers considered that they had made every man a " King " on his own property .
They got rid of the controls from the King and ' castle keep ' owners ( feudalism ) within property ownership .
In England , William Pitt summarized the concept of private property under Common Law , as follows :
' The poorest man may , in his cottage , bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown .
It may be frail ; its roof may shake ; the wind may blow through it ; the storms may enter ; the rain may enter ; but the King of England cannot enter ; all his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement . "
As a result of all of this , the Common Law of the States is founded and grounded upon substantive titles in real property .
No mere legislative enactment by Congress or State Legislature nor judicial ruling by Federal or State Courts can operate to deprive the People of their Rights at Law .
This includes their Rights inherent in their Allodial Land Titles and to be Merchants and / or Traders at Law on the cash basis , and their Rights to access to Courts of Law and to a jurisdiction where their Rights are protected .
In the same vein no county or city ordinance , code , rule , policy , regulation or ' law ' can override these same absolute guarantees .
The same applies to corporate or private policies of business conduct which are often used to override Common Law or Constitutional guarantees .
In other words , business or corporate policy cannot supersede Constitution Rights even though nearly every corporation in America ignores Our Constitution in pursuit of ever more bogus Federal Reserve Notes .
As contrasted with the Common Law of England , the system of law as practiced on the Continent of Europe ( European Common Market ) is called Civil Law , or Roman Civil Law , which is derived from the Law of the Ecclesiastical Chancellors .
This is partly the ancient Law of Rhodes , the law of merchant traders upon commercial documents .
The Civil Law is prosecuted by the Chancellor ( the King 's agent ) ; he is not an impartial referee of the dispute .
This Civil Law of Roman origin has never been part of the Laws of England and has been declared not of the Laws of the Realm by the Parliament and by many experts of England in jurisprudence , such as Coke , Blackstone and Sir John Fortescue .
" The Common Law is absolutely distinguished from the Roman or Civil Law systems . "
People v Ballard
155 NYS 2d 59
The Roman Civil Law has always been outside of Common Law , operating on SUMMARY PROCESS , in gross violation of our RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS .
As English society developed over the years , situations were met in the Common Law for which the Courts could provide no relief by any precedent .
The controversies did not involve property , or substance .
The parties thus had no other recourse than to go to the King .
And when they did , he delegated his first minister to solve these problems .
The minister was called a Chancellor ( the same title as used on the Continent ) and the relief granted was called Equity .
This " Equity " meant what would be fair if the Common Law principle were extended and applied to the case at hand , as the Chancellor , in his sole discretionary judgment , chose to do .
This is the so- called " law " we see being applied by " Judge " Wapner in the well known fake TV court program .
He alone decides the law and facts of each case .
There thus developed in England and America two distinct systems of law and courts , each having a peculiar and particular application and jurisdiction .
Equity is a jurisdiction in which the individual does not have any Rights , and one to which the individual can be subjected only if he volunteers or gives his informed consent .
In the Common Law we have recognized inherent rights whereas in the Equity Law we have no rights whatsoever except those which may be bestowed upon us by the graces of the chancellor -( judge ) wholly at his sole discretion .
In Equity there are no jury trials .
The powers of the Common Law jury to hear and decide questions of both Law and Fact are exercised exclusively by the Chancellor .
However , there may be " advisory juries " to advise the Chancellor of certain facts , but they are not permitted to hear any arguments regarding the Law .
( Does this sound familiar today ? )
The controversies are decided by the Chancellor , who , besides being the Chief Prosecutor , ( or Inquisitor , if you will ) , can go to any source he chooses , even to his own " conscience " , to prove or justify his decision .
In Equity , the parties do not have any Rights ; the Constitution is stated by the Chancellor to be " frivolous " ; and any so - called " rights " in his Court are actually " privileges " granted by the Chancellor , which he can also take away .
Today this all powerful person is not called a Chancellor .
She / He is called a Judge and she / he operates in all levels of " courts " throughout Our Land .
During the past century , the Congress of the United States and the Legislatures of the several States , as well as the Judges have presumed to exercise the authority to " merge " the procedures of Law and Equity .
This is authority they do not have , yet this , too , is part of the problem we face today all over Our Land .
When we realize that a Court of Common Law proceeds " according to the course of the Common Law " , and that the parties have a Right to trial by a Common Law jury , where the jury exercises the authority to hear and decide questions of both Law and Fact , we can then know that if we are in a Court where the procedures have been " merged " with Equity , then we can know that we are not in a Court of Common Law !
Such a court does not recognize and refuses , to We The People , our Constitutional Rights to self and property .
For instance , the Constitution of the State of Iowa , Article V , Section 6 , states , in part , as follows :
" The District Court shall be a court of law and equity , which shall be distinct and separate jurisdictions , . . . . "
Obviously , the two court systems have not been lawfully merged , and We The People do not have to accept the idea that they have been merged simply because a ' judge " or bureaucrat says a code , rule , statute or regulation makes it so .
Remember that these lesser rules and regulations MUST be in harmony with the State and federal Constitutions in order to be valid and lawful .
Otherwise they are null and void .
We must realize that the principles of Common Law and of Equity are those as distinguished and defined in England , before the adoption of the Constitution of the United States of America .
Any modifications in definition or practice of either Law or Equity in England since the adoption of the Constitution of the United States of America have no significance , bearing or authority in the United States , since we are no longer under the jurisdiction of either Parliament or the Judges of England .
Yet there are those in this country who claim that Equity jurisdiction ( otherwise known as Chancery jurisdiction ) in this country is the same in nature and extent as Equity jurisdiction in England !
Where the Constitution of the United States of America , or the Constitution of the State of Iowa , or of any State , mentions " law " , it means " Common Law " ; it does not mean any other " kind " of law ! !
In addition to the above mentioned jurisdictions of Law ( meaning Common Law ) and Equity , which are the only Judicial jurisdictions authorized either by the Constitution of the United States of America , or by the Constitution of the State of Iowa , or of any State , as drafted in conformance thereto , and being second thereto , there is also a private , political jurisdiction which is operative only on those who volunteer into it 's private domain , outside of the Constitution .
It is known as Law Merchant ( lex mercatoria ) the private rule of the bankers and merchants .
It is this system of ' legal ' snares that has all of We The People by the throat .... "
Law Merchant is neither Law nor Equity , but is only raw , private , political power , alien and illegal to our Constitution whatsoever , and operates outside of the Constitution .
The Law Merchant is an independent , parallel system of law , like Equity or Admiralty .
The Law Merchant is not even a modification of the Common Law ; it occupies a field over which the Common Law does not and never did extend .
Common Law deals with the Money of Substance belonging to the People ( Gold and Silver Coins ) ; while the Law Merchant deals with the law of Bills , Notes and Checks , ( in other words , with negotiable instruments and commercial paper ) .
The Law Merchant is closely allied to the Equity system of agreements and contracts which it uses extensively because the Constitutions of Our States recognizes Equity law .
Equity Law is the ' back door ' used by Law Merchants ( bankers , etc. ) to gain access to what used to be Allodial Title or absolute ownership previously enjoyed by all Americans .
Our Declaration of Independence charges that America had been progressively subjected to " a jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution " ( meaning the unwritten English Constitution ) ,
This foreign jurisdiction was a jurisdiction of lawless ad hoc equity derived out of the Roman Civil Law under the stark cover of such obscenities as the Writs of Assistance ( which our Courts of today also claim to have the authority to issue ) which allowed summary plundering of the colonists ' wealth and substance TO THE ADVANTAGE OF the East India Company which controlled the Parliament .
( As today , it allows the summary plundering of the American citizens ' wealth and substance TO THE ADVANTAGE OF the banks and other financial ( lending , insurance , etc. ) institutions which control the Congress and State legislatures ) .
It has been recognized and stated for over one hundred years that " we have the best Congress that money can buy " ! !
These Writs , even as only one wrong perpetrated by the commercial interests in the Parliament , were given authority by an Equitable jurisdiction called a debt action in assumpsit .
This action , which gave satisfaction pursuant to the customs of the Law Merchant , ( having been voluntarily entered into ) , had been an old debt action triable in a Court of Common Law ( merely as a courtesy of the Common Law Courts , and not inherently a part of Common Law ) ( and triable by a Common Law Jury , as a protection to the Defendant ) , until lord Mansfield , Chief Justice of the Kings Bench , in 1760 , arbitrarily and on his own authority , denied trial by jury in debt actions in assumpsit AND REMOVED THAT ACTION FROM THE Courts of Common Law into the Courts of Equity , where a trial by jury could not be had , and where there was merely a summary proceeding with no semblance of a " due process of Law " .
In other words , a merchant can , with a flick of his Pen , deprive anyone of their property without due process of Law ( Common Law ) .
Sound familiar ?
This case is known as :
Moses y MacFerian
2 Burroughs 1005
and is the case that sparked the American Revolution and caused Thomas Jefferson to say that English law since that date ( 1760 ) should not ever be used over here as Equity / Merchant laws had become an instrument through which merchants could , from then on , assume power over anyone else 's property solely at their discretion and whim .
It was this Equitable debt action in assumpsit which the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States was specifically meant to outlaw , by specifically providing that
" In suits at Common Law , where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars , the right of trial by jury shall be preserved ... "
The significance of this is pointed up by the fact that any controversy involving Money ( Gold and Silver Coins ) in an amount greater than twenty dollars , or any property such as real estate can only be tried in a Court of Common Law with the right of trial by jury who decides Law as well as the Facts of the case !
This means that any Mortgage Foreclosure action can be tried only in a Court of Common Law , and that the State Legislature has no Constitutional authority to provide , by statute ( statutes are not real Law but are in reality ' color ' of Law only and therefore are only binding on a voluntary or mutually agreed upon basis ) , that mortgage foreclosure actions shall be Equity actions !
This means that Sheriff 's Sales as a result of these Equitable Mortgage Foreclosure actions are null and void ! !
And that the Sheriffs have participated in criminal confiscation of real property in violation of the Constitution and of their oaths of office ! !
So , it can be seen that summary and arbitrary confiscation of income and property is nothing new in American tradition and history out of an illicit ( meaning unlawful and unconstitutional ) Equitable jurisdiction .
It is precisely this Equitable jurisdiction wherein the Chancellor enforces the combination of unconstitutional Executive and Legislative Equity which is the jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution referred to in the Declaration of Independence .
This is precisely what our American Revolution was all about and what our Bill of Rights was designed to prevent .
It is also a measure of the extent that the Bankers ( both foreign and domestic ) and other merchants , and their stooges , the lawyers and Judges , as well as the politicians of both major political parties , have betrayed the Public Trust and have attempted to place us in a Dictatorship of Unelected Rulers ( being the " judges " and bureaucrats ) ! !
Thus it can be seen that there is a direct similarity of our political / legal situation today with what it was in the years immediately preceding the Revolution of 1776 .
Only today we have a written Constitution that spells out our Rights and our freedoms , giving us precedents , whereas two hundred years ago they did not .
The Common Law Jury members ( acting as judges of the Law ) were sworn to " Do equal law , and execution of Right , to all the King 's subjects , rich and poor , without having regard to any person " and that they will deny no man Common Right ; but they were NOT sworn to obey or execute any statute of the King , or of the King and Parliament .
Indeed , they are virtually sworn NOT to obey or execute any statutes that are against " Common Right " , or contrary to the Common Law , or " Law of the Land " ; but to certify the King thereof " ... that is , to notify the King that his statutes are against the Common Law ; .... and then proceed to execute the Common Law , notwithstanding such legislation to the contrary .
The words of the oath on this point are these :
" That we deny no man Common Rights by ( virtue of ) the King 's letters , nor none other mans ' , nor for none other cause ; and in case any letters come to you contrary to the Law , ( that is , the Common Law ) that ye do nothing by such letters , but certify the King thereof , and proceed the execute the Law ( that is , the Common Law ) , notwithstanding the same letters "
In Federalist Papers # 48 , Alexander Hamilton wrote in part , " No legislative act contrary to the Constitution can be valid . "
" The Constitution is , in fact , and must be regarded by judges as a fundamental law . "
The Sheriff is also a servant of the People , elected and paid by and for Them ; upon taking office he takes an oath to uphold the Constitution ( the People 's Law ) and keep the peace .
In American Jurisprudence , on Sheriffs , Police and Constables , we find the following :
Origin of office :
The office of sheriff is an ancient one , dating back to at least the time of Alfred , King of England , and the holder thereof has always been the chief executive officer and conservator of the peace in his shire or county .
He is a county officer representing the executive or administrative power of the state within his county .
In this country , the office is generally an elective one , and anciently in England , sheriffs were elected by freeholders of the county , although gradually , it became the custom for the Crown to appoint the Sheriff . "
Abraham Lincoln stated the following on February 12 , 1865 :
" The people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the Courts .
Not to overthrow the Constitution , but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution . "
The general misconception is that any statute passed by legislators bearing the appearance of law constitutes the law of the land .
The U. S. Constitution is the supreme Law of the Land , and any statute to be valid , must be in agreement .
It is impossible for both the Constitution and a statute violating it to be valid .
In such a dispute , one must prevail , and that is the Constitution .
In Volume 16 , American Jurisprudence , 177 , we find the following :
" The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute , though having the form and name of law , is in reality no law , but is wholly void , and ineffective for any purpose ; since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment , and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it .
An unconstitutional law , in legal contemplation , is as inoperative as if it had never been passed .
Such a statute leaves the question that it purports to settle just as it would be had the statute not been enacted .
" Since an unconstitutional law is void , the general principles follow that it imposes no duties , confers no rights , creates no office , bestows no power or authority on anyone , affords no protection , and justifies no acts performed under it .
. . .
A void act cannot be legally consistent with a valid one .
An unconstitutional law cannot operate to supersede any existing valid law .
Indeed , insofar as a statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the land , it is superseded thereby .
No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it . "
The Constitution guarantees the right of a freeholder to protect his property from Criminal Trespass .
Civil law or equity law is the law of the ruler ;
Common Law is the law of the people .
It is the sworn duty of the Sheriff to obey and uphold the Constitution and to protect the property and Rights of the freeborn , Sovereign American individuals of the County .
County Sheriffs must be advised of the instances where unlawful acts of officials or agencies of government are committed .
It is the duty of the Sheriff to protect the local citizens from such unlawful acts , even when they are committed " under color of law " .
There is no lawful authority for Judges and the Courts to direct the law enforcement activities of a County Sheriff .
The Sheriff is accountable and responsible only to the citizens who are inhabitants of his County .
He is under Oath of Office , and need not receive unlawful Orders from Judges or the Courts .
He is responsible to protect citizens , even from unlawful acts of officials of government .
He should not allow his office to be used as an unlawful " lackey " of the Courts or Federal agents or agencies .
We Are Our Government
Since the formation of our Republic , the local County ( or Parish ) has always been the seat of government for the body politic ( the People ) .
A County ( or Parish ) government is the highest authority of government in our Republic as it is closest to the body politic ( the People ) who are , in fact , THE GOVERNMENT .
The Common Law of the States is founded and grounded upon substantive titles in real property , and no mere legislative enactment by Congress , State legislature or County Commissioners .
Neither can judicial ruling by Federal , State or County Courts operate to deprive the People of their Rights at Law , including the Rights inherent in their Allodial Land Title Rights .
The Constitution of the United States of America , Article III , Section 2 , authorizes Courts of Law and Courts of Equity ; Judicial Equity is authorized ; but nowhere does the Constitution of the United States of America authorize a single bit of either Federal Executive branch of government Equity jurisdiction , or Federal Legislative branch of government Equity jurisdiction .
In other words , the promulgation and enforcement of Presidential / Congressional / Judicial edicts , dictates , rules , regulations or policies whether directly or through any Federal agent or agency such as the FBI , CIA , EPA , OSHA , IRS , etc. or with the aid and assistance of State or local lackeys is unauthorized .
For instance , the Constitution of the State of Iowa , as drafted in conformance to the Constitution of the United States of America , and being second thereto , Article V , Section 6 , authorizes Courts of Law and Courts of Equity ; Judicial Equity is authorized ; but nowhere does the Constitution of the State of Iowa authorize a single bit of either State Executive branch of government Equity jurisdiction or State Legislative branch of government Equity jurisdiction .
The Federal Bill of Rights was drawn and adopted to guarantee an estoppel ( or bar ) to the abhorrent Federal Executive and Legislative Equity jurisdiction , and therefore , the State Bill of Rights is also a guaranteed estoppel against any actual or de facto abhorrent State Executive and Legislative Equity jurisdiction ; this is an abhorrent and oppressive Equity , because it purports to be able to administer , adjust and deny said Common Law Rights without first pursuing the appropriate remedy at Common Law and thus denying due process .
Equity administration is in fact theft of Our Rights and a vicious dictatorship by those who exercise it .
In other words , Federal , Stale and County governments , both Executive branch and Legislative branch , must be at Law working within the Common Law ) , and may not impose any form of Equity jurisdiction upon the People , by compulsion , fraud or otherwise , without their knowledge and informed consent ; otherwise any such enactments become and are nullities and do not exist at Law , because the Rights of freeborn , Sovereign American individuals would be violated if they were to be forced to obey them .
If any agency of the Federal , State or County government , including the court , would act as if it were Principal , and Freeman , against it 's true Principal , the People , this would be an inversion of the legal principle of Sovereignty of the People .
By so acting , any agency of the government , including the court , would be a pretender to the power , and as a pretender , it 's acts would be a nullity and would not exist , at Law ; that is to say , that it would be null and void , and of no force and effect , at Law .
That , in fact , it would not be government at all , but would be a private , criminal operation , imposing a rule of force , fraudulently pretending to be government , since , in this country , the only legitimate function of government is to protect the Rights and freedoms of the People .
Such acts are not unlike the privately owned and operated Mafia who demands our money ( taxes , fees , etc. ) in exchange for them not committing violence against us or our property .
Sound familiar ?
Each freeborn , Sovereign American individual has the authority and the Right to deny and to disavow all Equity jurisdiction , and to refuse to acquiesce to the jurisdiction of Courts of Equity , or to Equity jurisdiction of any Executive or Legislative branch of government agency or agent , State or Federal or County .
The Constitution of the United States of America , Article IV , Section 4 , guarantees a Republican Form of government to every State .
The definition of a " Republic " is as follows :
" Republic : A state in which the sovereign power resides in a certain body of the people ( the electorate ) , and is exercised by representatives elected by , and responsible to , them ; "
Webster 's Collegiate Dictionary , Fifth Edition .
The Courts of Iowa are nullities , and do not exist , either at Law or in Equity , because unelected State Judges have no jurisdiction at Law or in Equity , over any one or any thing , being in direct violation of each freeborn , Sovereign American individual 's Right to a Republican Form of Government ; which in this case is his Right to have an Elected Judge .
This also includes the Right to Separation of Powers , because the Governor , as Chief Executive of the State , has no Judicial Power to delegate to an appointee .
The Governor is of the Executive branch and has ( lawfully ) no say or jurisdiction within or over the Judicial branch .
The Governor of this or any other State is not a Chancellor ( appointed by a King or dictator ) , nor are any officials appointed under him authorized to exercise any Judicial powers .
There can be no delegated power in Chancery law to be executed under the alien , outlawed and illegal Roman Civil Law , unless agreed to by the freeborn , Sovereign American individual .
That evil and alien jurisdiction , the de facto Equity jurisdiction of the Roman Civil Law , allows judges to enforce the unlawful summonses of IRS agents , Highway Patrol Officers , city policemen , building inspectors , OSHA agents , FDA agents , and the agents of all other equally unlawful regulatory bodies of so - called government , who attempt to impose a jurisdiction in which the Rights of freeborn , Sovereign American individuals are unrecognized and violated .
That evil and vicious Roman Civil Law allows the ' judges ' to have We The People arrested , jailed , and property taken away from us , or our property to be criminally trespassed upon and destroyed ; all without a Common Law Trial by Jury , or just compensation , or due process of law .
These violent acts by unelected dictators are committed often over simple idiocies such as " willful failure to file " a paper or failure to properly fill out a form or unknowingly not following some obscure and stupid procedure , rule or regulation .
Under the Common Law ( Our Constitution ) , no bureaucrat can dictate what happens to Our liberty or Our property .
The only entity that can determine punishment ( pass sentence ) upon a freeborn , Sovereign American individual is a lawfully constituted Common Law Jury .
Aiding and abetting the IRS ( foreign agents to the States ) and similar agencies in enforcing their unlawful summonses , fraudulent liens and assessments constitute an enforcement of the alien and evil Roman Civil Law and is in fact fascist totalitarianism .
Compelling a freeborn , Sovereign American individual to do anything , except upon the verdict of a Common Law Jury , constitutes an enforcement of the alien and evil Roman Civil Law and is in fact fascist totalitarianism .
Thomas Jefferson has been credited with the warning how the judicial branch of government would usurp the authority of the Executive and Legislative branches of government and turn the country into a judicial dictatorship .
He was right - it has happened .
They Stole Our Gold ( Money ) !
" All of the confusions and distress in America arise , not from defects in their Constitution , not from want of honor or virtue , so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin , credit [ paper money ] and circulation . "
John Adams ( 1781 )
So began admonishments to us from 200 years ago by one who knew what awaited his countrymen ( us ) .
What has happened to Our money is criminal .
In fact , it is beyond criminal and nearly beyond credibility .
Just after World War II America had nearly one billion ounces of gold coin in circulation and untold millions of ounces of silver coins .
These metals in circulation represented real undiluted debt - free capital .
It was ours and we owed no one anything for it .
This $ 400,000,000,000 pool of liquid capital belonged to private American citizens and represented the wealth of our great nation .
What happened to all this wealth ?
Before most of us were born money was a real thing .
It was gold and silver coin as specified by Our Constitution , the founding law of Our country :
ARTICLE 1 , SECTION 8
" The Congress shall have the power ... to coin Money , regulate the value thereof "
ARTICLE 1 , SECTION 10
" No State shall ... coin Money ; emit Bills of Credit ( paper money ) ; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts . "
In other words no federal or state government was permitted , by law , to mint or issue anything other than gold and silver coins as lawful money .
Neither are they permitted to accept or pay debts with anything other than gold and silver coin .
What ?
Where did all this paper come from and what is it if it is n't Money ?
Listen up - this gets real interesting ...
Well guess what happened ?
If you are lucky enough to have any ' money ' in your pocket take it out and examine it .
On the front ( near the portrait ) of the bill you will find the words : " This note is legal tender for all debts , public and private " .
Across the lop of the bill you will read the words : " Federal Reserve Note " .
Nowhere on this bill are the words : gold , silver or money .
This is because this bill is not money as defined by Our Constitution ( see above ) .
It is not money at all .
It says what it is - it is a note issued by a private , tax - exempt , for profit bank - the Federal Reserve Bank(s ) .
Which are all owned privately by people living outside of America .
A ' note ' is : 'a paper acknowledging a debt or promising to pay ( also called note of hand ) ; also a certificate , as of a government or a bank , passing current as money . '
The portion " passing current as money " means passing from one person to another and generally accepted as money .
This implies that it is not money but is only accepted as money .
It is the Constitution that defines what real money is : it is gold and silver coin .
The bill in your pocket is in actuality an instrument of debt - it is owed to somebody - The Federal Reserve Banks and their foreign owners .
" Money is not only a medium of exchange , but it is a standard of value .
Nothing can be such standard which has not intrinsic value , or which is subject to frequent changes in value . "
Justice Fields ( 1883 )
Now so much for definitions .
What does paper or metal money have to do with anything ?
Are you working harder now and enjoying it less ?
Are you really better off now then when you began working so many years ago ?
Are your children making it better or worse than you did when you started out ?
Why does it take two people working very hard to not make ends meet worse now than when one was working in the 50s and 60s ?
The answer to this question lies in the money .
Our money has become nearly worthless .
Remember back in the late 60s a new Volkswagen bug cost less than $ 2,000 .
Today that same car ( with a different body ) cost about $ 7,000 .
These are the same ' dollars ' you have in your pocket .
A soda pop cost a nickel back then and now how much is the very same item ?
Herein lies the evilness of paper money .
The Federal Reserve Banks ( and their stooges ) can print as much of it as they want whenever they want .
This flooding the market ( your pocket ) with more and more cash is called ' fractional reserve ' banking when coupled with the local bank 's privilege of signing money into existence whenever they want more to lend some to you .
It is a fantasy that Our government prints ( issues ) money .
It really works like this :
The US Congress desires to spend ( that ' s how they stay in office ) more money to buy our votes .
There is a problem here as there is no money because the Congress of 1913 gave their own Constitutional right to coin real money away to a bunch of foreign bankers - the Federal Reserve Banks .
The Congress must request the Federal Reserve to issue and then lend them ( Us ) some Federal Reserve notes .
The privately owned , tax exempt Federal Reserve Bank lends these notes to the U.S. Government ( you and me and our children and neighbors ) .
The tax - exempt Fed only pays the U.S. Treasury about 3 cents per bill for these ( regardless of denomination ) as printing cost .
But when we get these funny pieces of paper we have to pay the full face value back with our blood sweat and tears PLUS ANY INTEREST the thieves think is appropriate for them .
Guess what did n't happen in this transaction ?
The thieving Fed never printed the interest !
So we can maybe pay back 100 % of what we borrowed but there are no more Fed notes to pay the interest !
Every time
Our government employees borrows more from the private
Fed we get further and further into debt - a debt that can never be paid !
" The burden of debt is as destructive to Freedom as subjugation by conquest . "
Benjamin Franklin
In the beginning we paid this bogus and illegal debt with real money - gold - until it was all gone on March 9 , 1933 when Roosevelt literally , willfully and without due process of law took the gold away from the American citizen ( Us ) and gave it to the bunch of thieves at the Fed in exchange for paper .
Paper which could only do one thing - put us further into irretrievable debt .
Why put America into deeper and deeper debt ?
Reread Franklin's quote in the previous paragraph .
The idiotic process continued until 1968 when they took the balance of our silver to pay for even more of these worthless notes .
" If Americans ever allow banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation and then by deflation , the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children will wake up homeless . "
Thomas Jefferson
On June 5 , 1933 , as a result of a prearranged banking crisis , the Congress of the United States passed House Joint Resolution No. 192 , suspending the Gold Standard ( they did not abolish it ) , which means they disestablished the fixed content of the Gold Dollar and took away the Law jurisdiction of the U. S. Standard Dollar Lawful Money .
In effect , the entire country , every State and every freeborn , Sovereign American individual , became insolvent and was effectively put into bankruptcy , making it impossible for each State and each individual to either pay their debts , at Law , or to be paid , at Law .
This was , in actuality , a criminal act of usurpation of the sovereignty of We The People , by Congress .
Merchant Law
Instead of being able to demand payment at Law , or to make payment in Standard Gold Dollars as Lawful money , or the equivalent Treasury currency , redeemable on demand , at Par , We The People were forced on to the credit of the private banks , the Federal Reserve Banks and the commercial banks , and began to pass around their debt instruments , as though it were real money , making use of their debt - claims for the money , and thereby , by the operation of House Joint Resolution No , 192 , into an alien and unlawful Federal Executive Equity Jurisdiction , known as lex mercatoria , or the Law Merchant , which is the private rule of the bankers , and from which jurisdiction our forefathers fought , and won , a revolution to be free , and from which jurisdiction our Constitution and Bill of Rights protects Us .
When you can pay your debts in Standard Gold Dollars , you operate on a cash basis in a Federal Common Law jurisdiction based on Article I , Section 10 , clause 1 , of the Constitution of the United States of America regarding tender in payment of debts .
This is the General Federal Common Law jurisdiction deriving from the Union , which the Bill of Rights was designed to protect , particularly the Seventh Amendment which guarantees the Right of Trial by Common Law Jury in suits at Common Law where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars .
But , when you pass around evidences of debt as if it were the money itself , you are passing around the debt - claims for the money , and you no longer have a jurisdiction at Law , where the individual has access to his Rights , but you are in an entirely different court , or jurisdiction .
You are in an Equity jurisdiction , one in which the individual does not have any Rights .
And this is the practical effect which Congress intended to bring about by passing House Joint Resolution No. 192 .
Even one hundred years ago it was stated that " we have the best Congress that money can buy " .
" Paper Money is Theft ! "
George Washington
By the operation of House Joint Resolution No. 192 , individuals , and States , have been compelled to " perform services " , in order , not to pay ( no one could " pay " anymore because there was no real money with which to " pay " ) , but to " discharge obligations " to pay .
What is called " fractional reserve banking " , with irredeemable paper , creates multiple demands upon a common substance .
That is , banks can issue or create " money " simply by making a ledger entry .
These newly created dollars ( ledger entries ) are " backed " by the same few dollars already held on deposit .
In fact a bank , can " create " 20 dollars for every one on deposit , lend them to you , collect the principle and interest and then simply write the money back into nonexistence .
In other words , you are forced at the point of the Sheriff 's gun to pay for something that was created out of thin air - plus interest .
With multiple demands , no one can ever satisfy all his claims and no one can ever " pay " at Law in substance , that is , with Standard Gold Dollars , but instead , can only " perform services " as evidence of his willingness to " discharge the obligation to pay " .
Payment , as such , is thus forever postponed ; one only promises the payment .
Overnight , the entire country was placed in an entirely new regime of Equity , which never " pays " a thing but only compels services forever to the private banks , and the debts to private bankers constantly increases , the interest obligations , known as " debt service " , constantly compounds and the performance of services in order to " discharge the obligation to pay " this interest are never - ending , being a greater and greater burden upon ourselves and our children , and our children 's ' children .
In other words , a feudalistic real property law , in the guise of Equitable discharge of obligations to tender in Equity and not " pay " at Law , was instituted in violation of our Allodial Property Rights , and compels Sovereign American individuals into a feudalistic peonage , or involuntary servitude to the private banks ( Federal Reserve Banks , National Banks , State Banks ) , in violation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America .
Because of the jurisdiction of the Law Merchant , we are not under Common Law , we do not have access to our Right to a Common Law Jury , and as a result our property can be , and every day is , taken without due process of Law .
If we do not " perform the services " our property is taken from us by Equity courts imposing the Law Merchant .
Compelled performance is in fact slavery .
The Sheriff , in unknowing and unthinking acceptance of this situation , has become the " bag man " for a bunch of private criminals , and thereby is committing crimes himself , and is therefore a criminal .
It is a crime to violate Constitutional Rights and his oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America and the Constitution of his own State , it being drafted in conformance thereto , and being secondary thereto .
The Banks , including the Federal Reserve Banks and the National Banks , are incorporated by the State and operate under Banking Statutes ( you will notice I do not use the word Laws ) ,
These statutes allow , or at least do not prohibit , the creation of " demand deposits " or " checkbook money " , which is not really money , but is actually credit , or debt , created on the spot out of thin air on two levels .
One by the Federal Reserve Banks ( they write checks on themselves , thereby creating Federal Reserve Credit " out of thin air " , in order to " purchase investments " , such as U. S. Government Securities .
These then become part of the National Debt , and provide the banking system with new Reserves ) .
On the strength of these newly purchased Securities , they are able to obtain from the Treasury , newly printed Federal Reserve Notes , to cover the new checks when they are cashed .
They only have to tender about three cents for each new Federal Reserve Note regardless of denomination .
They are practically given the new paper Notes and they still hold the Bonds , which are part of the National Debt , and collect interest on them .
The second level is by the local commercial bank which creates bank credit , denominated " demand deposits " , every time they make a loan .
The Federal Reserve Bank ( is a private Anglo - German - American owned corporation .
It is for - profit , and is tax - exempt ! ) creates public credit ( National Debt ) , while the commercial banks create private credit ( private debt ) when they make a loan .
The Federal Reserve Note , at least the one issued in accordance with Title 12 , United States Code , Section 411 , which requires that they " shall be obligations of the United States and shall be redeemable on demand . . . " , has a double jurisdiction .
It is what you may call a legal tender for an equitable interest .
That means it passes at Law as money , being a legal tender , but the only interest it passes along is a mere demand or promise .
Hence , though it is " legal " or at Law , it never pays the gold because of House Joint Resolution No. 192 , which illegally and criminally prohibited payment of the U. S. Standard Dollar Lawful Money , at par , and thus at Law .
It should be noted that Congress did not ( could not ) take away our Rights to use bank notes at Law , or demand deposits at Law ; they just took away our money .
We have a Right , to take a twenty dollar bill , which means a bill for twenty dollars , into a bank and demand a twenty dollar gold piece .
Congress did not take that Right away ; since we have unalienable Rights which cannot be taken from us or be forced to give them up ; Congress just took away the gold .
This was and is a criminal usurpation of the Sovereignty of We The People on the part of Congress ; and the State of Iowa , and each other State , by allowing it to happen at that time , and by continuing to allow it to happen to this date , has become party to this crime against We The People .
Instead of going into bankruptcy , everyone , including the States , was provided with the opportunity to use the new Federal Reserve Notes , called ( incorrectly ) " lawful money " grounded in perpetual debt of the " eligible paper " which formed the assets of the Federal Reserve and the National Banks ,
These are also known as " units of monetized debt " .
Everyone thus became the creditor / debtor of everyone else , since no one has paid or been paid for anything since that infamous day of June 5 , 1933 when Roosevelt willfully and knowingly stole
Our gold and gave it to a bunch of foreign bankers .
( Lawfully , debts can only be paid with money - money as defined by the Law of the Land - The Constitution - being gold and silver coin .
Anything else is not lawful money and cannot therefore lawfully " pay a debt " . )
Thus , overnight , We The People became liable for specific performance on the basis of a debt action of assumpsit under the private Law Merchant , operating outside of the Constitution and imposing an Equitable jurisdiction .
A jurisdiction in which no one has any rights , where one can be compelled summarily to deliver his property without trial by Common Law jury .
And the debts to the private bankers keep mounting ever higher .
A freeborn , Sovereign American individual cannot be forced into perpetual debtorship and involuntary servitude , that is , feudalistic performance on behalf of , and for the benefit of , any person , real or juristic , against his Thirteenth Article of Amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America .
Nor can
He be compelled , by Law , to accept , or to give informed consent to accept , an Equitable jurisdiction foreign to his Bill of Rights .
Article III , Section 2 of the Constitution of The United States of America , states in part :
" The Judicial Power shall extend .. . . . to all Cases of Admiralty and Maritime jurisdiction ; ... . . "
At the very beginning of government under the Constitution , Congress conferred on the federal district courts exclusive cognizance " of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction , . . . . . . ; saving to suitors , in all cases , the right of a Common Law remedy , where the Common Law is competent to give it ; . . . " ( 1 STAT 77 , Section 9 ( 1789 ) )
As this jurisdiction is held to be exclusive , the power of legislation on the same subject must necessarily be in the national legislature and not in the state legislatures .
Congress enacted the Limited Liability Act on March 3 , 1851 .
It is codified at Title 46 , United States Code , Sections 181-189 , as amended in 1875 , 1877 , 1935 , 1936 and the Act of 1884 .
It intended to cover the entire subject of limitations , and to invest the U. S. District Courts with exclusive original cognizance of all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction , exclusive of the States .
This means that the States do not have any jurisdiction in admiralty and maritime matters , at all .
Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction comprises two types of cases : ( 1 ) those involving acts committed on the high seas or other navigable waters , and ( 2 ) those involving contracts and transactions connected with shipping employed on the seas or navigable waters .
In other words , the second type of case must have a direct connection with maritime commerce .
Suits in admiralty traditionally took the form of a proceeding in rem against the vessel , and , with exceptions to be noted , such proceedings in rem are confined exclusively to federal admiralty courts , because the grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the federal courts by the Judiciary Act of 1789 has been interpreted as referring to the traditional admiralty action , the in rem action , which was unknown to the Common Law .
State courts are forbidden by the Constitution to have Admiralty jurisdiction .
While State courts are permitted to handle and try Admiralty cases if the suitor desires , it must be an Admiralty matter to begin with and it must involve property , otherwise there would not be a Common Law remedy .
In other words , the Common Law courts would not be competent to handle it .
More than this , it would need to be tried in a Common Law court , following Common Law procedures ( not Equity procedures ) with a Trial by a Common Law jury .
Therefore , any attempt by a State court to impose a judgment in rem is in violation of the Constitution and is null and void .
When a sheriff attempts to enforce a judgment in rem he is attempting to impose the alien and unlawful Roman Civil Law , in violation of his oath of office , and he is thereby committing a criminal act .
The Sovereign American people are beginning to catch on to and realize the nature of the Dictatorship of Unelected Rulers that has been set up in this country , and They are no longer quietly accepting such vile treatments .
As the issues become clarified , each public official will need to make a decision : shall he be on the side of the Constitution and protect the Rights and freedoms of We The People ( of which he is one ) , as required by his oath of office ; or shall he be a party to the criminal usurpation of the Sovereignty of We The People ?
The Sheriff is a key person in all of this : he can either be a tool of the evil forces who have set this up and provide the oppressive force that binds the innocent victims to the chains of slavery , all in the name of " doing his duty " , or he can be the instrument of liberation for We The People by preventing the imposition of the unconstitutional Equitable jurisdiction ( the Roman Civil Law ) upon Us , the victims and Our property and protecting Our Rights and freedoms .
Our Individual
Common Law Rights
by Howard Fisher & Dale Pond
Another Constitutional issue that each of us needs to understand is the issue of Individual Common Law Rights of We the People of the United States of America .
This directly concerns the limits of authority of all branches of government over each of us as individuals : the Authority of the Executive , Legislative and Judicial Branches of Government .
As stated in the Declaration of Independence , we are endowed by our Creator with certain Unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness .
Thomas Jefferson placed great emphasis on the concept of Rights .
He said we did not bring the English Common Law , as such , to this continent ; we brought the Rights of Man .
The reason why he said that is that it is from the Common Law controversies , all of which involved property , that all of our Rights have come to be recognized in the Law .
In a legal sense , Property is a bundle of Rights , a bundle of Powers , wherein one claimant to these Rights possesses these Rights to the exclusion of all other claimants to These Rights , as these Rights pertain to The possession , occupancy and use of a specific piece of property .
So , at Common Law , Rights is the name of the game .
The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution of the United States of America because the Founding Fathers believed these Amendments should be added to avoid misconstruction of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States of America by Judges and to avoid an abuse of powers by Judges of The sort that had already , at that time , taken place in England and from which abuse of powers we had just fought , and won , a revolution to be free .
( See the Preamble to the Bill of Rights .
The original Constitution has it , and in some sources which print the Constitution , this Preamble is included . )
This abuse had been committed by Judges who were not tied down by any written Constitution in England , and who had started to whittle away at the Common Law Rights in England and the Colonies , by their decisions , with the cooperation of the statutes passed by the Parliament and enforced by the Crown .
This is precisely the combination of Executive and Legislative Equity ( otherwise known as Roman Civil Law ) which our Bill of Rights prevents and protects us from .
As example , the Constitution of the Iowa has its Bill of Rights , comprising Article I .
The first two sections deserve special emphasis :
Section 1 .
All men are , by nature , free and equal , and have certain inalienable rights -- among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty , acquiring , possessing and protecting property , and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness .
Section 2 . All political power is inherent in the people .
Government is instituted for the protection , security , and benefit of the people , and They have the right , at all times , to alter or reform the same , whenever the public good may require it .
So the Constitution of the State of Iowa for example expressly includes the Right of acquiring , possessing and protecting Property , although it is high on the Priority List of Common Law Rights .
This is an example of a Constitution securing Rights which come from the Common Law .
Back in 1921 someone wrote :
It is not the Right of property which is protected , but the Right to property .
Property , as such , has no rights ; but the individual -- the man -- has three great Rights , equally sacred from interference : the Right to his LIFE ; the Right to his LIBERTY ; the Right to his PROPERTY .
...
The three Rights are so bound together as to be essentially one Right , To give a man his life but deny him his liberty , is to take from him all that makes life worth living .
To give him his liberty but take from him the property which is the fruit and badge of his liberty , is to still leave him a slave .
Thomas Jefferson said :
" Our rulers can have no authority over [ our ] natural rights , only as we have submitted to them .
The rights of conscience we never submitted .
We are answerable for them to our God .
The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others . "
This points up the significance of the requirement of the procedures of the Common Law that there be an injured party , that the injured party make a sworn complaint as to the injury that has been done to him by the alleged Defendant .
That unless this is done , the Court does not have jurisdiction over the Defendant .
We have been told .
from childhood , that we have unalienable Rights , and we do !
Unalienable means that they cannot be taken from us , and that we can not be forced to give them up .
There are those who point out that , strictly speaking , we cannot even give them up voluntarily .
However , if we submit to those who would rule over us , it is true that our Rights were not taken from us -- as Thomas Jefferson said , -- we have submitted to their rule .
We have allowed ourselves to become their slaves .
There is one important fact concerning slavery , of any sort , the institution of slavery depends upon the cooperation of the slaves !
Without the cooperation of the slaves , there can be no slavery .
In Common Law Courts our Rights are protected .
The Rules and Procedures of the Common Law Courts were established to protect our Property Rights -- to make it difficult for Property to be taken from someone without Due Process of Law .
The Right to require
That an injured party swear under oath as to damage or injury that he claims that you caused to him ; the Right to a Corpus Delicti :
The body of the offense : " the essence of the crime . " : Under the Common Law , the Courts do not have an automatic jurisdiction .
The Common Law Rules and Procedures specify certain steps , or procedures , which must be done , and certain things which must not be done -- all as a protection to the Rights of the Accused .
And , as we have pointed out previously , Rights are inherent in Property , and Property is inherent in Rights .
We have the Right to have our controversy , once the Common Law Court has acquired jurisdiction , tried before a Common Law Jury of our Peers , wherein the Jury has the authority to hear and decide questions of both Law and Fact .
There is no monkey business of pretending that arguments involving the Law must be held outside of the hearing of the Jury and that their supposed only function is to hear and decide questions of Fact presented in evidence and that the Judge will tell them what the Law is !
As evidence that the Founding Fathers operated under the Common Law , in addition to the wording of the Constitution of the United States of America , the following was included in the instructions to the Jury in the first case ever tried before the United States Supreme Court , as a court of original jurisdiction , which means that a Trial by Jury was held in front of the Supreme Court , with Chief Justice John Jay presiding :
" It is presumed , that juries are the best judges of facts ; it is , on the other hand , presumably , that the courts are the best judges of law .
But still both objects are within your power of decision .
You have a right to take upon yourselves to judge both , and to determine the law as well as the fact in controversy . "
STATE OF GEORGIA vs. BRAILSFORD .
3 Dall I ( 1794 )
Our Property Rights are inseparable from our individual Rights and our individual Rights are inseparable from our Property Rights .
Both types of Rights are protected in the Procedures and Due Process of the Courts of Common Law .
The Bill of Rights in both Constitutions have to do with matters that the Governments , both of the United States and of the State , have to do with matters that the government , and its agents and agencies , have no authority over at all to enact statutes , or to issue rules and regulations , binding on the individual , dealing with such Rights as are included in the Bill of Rights .
It should be emphasized that the Ninth Amendment includes all of the Common Law Rights which are not listed , or enumerated , anywhere else .
In other words , the Bill of Rights are prohibitions against government at any level over the individual .
The Constitution authorizes Courts of Law and Courts of Equity .
When the Constitution says Law , it means Common Law , because that 's what the Founding Fathers meant when they said Law .
In Courts of Law your Rights are protected by the Constitution and the Rules and Procedures of the Common Law , known as Due Process of Law ; and the Bill of Rights was adopted to avoid misconstruction and abuse of powers , by the Judges ; but in Courts of Equity , by the nature of Equity jurisdiction , you do n't have any Constitutional Rights .
Within the existing Equity Courts the only rights you might acquire for yourself are the terrible so - called Civil Rights or the rights under the Uniform Commercial Code .
These are much lesser rights than those of the Constitution because these latter are Natural God given rights whereas the former are granted privileges from an artificial government of bureaucrats .

The gold trim denotes military jurisdiction and not Common Law or Constitutional jurisdiction .

THE STORY OF THE BUCK ACT
Richard McDonald edited by
Mitch Modeleski
In order for you to understand the full import of what is happening , I must explain certain laws to you .
When passing new statutes , the Federal government always does everything according to the principles of law .
In order for the Federal Government to tax a Citizen of one of the several states , they had to create some sort of contractual nexus .
This contractual nexus is the " Social Security Number " .
In 1935 , the federal government instituted Social Security .
The Social Security Board then created 10 Social Security " Districts " .
The combination of these " Districts " resulted in a " Federal area " which covered all the several states like a clear plastic overlay .
In 1939 , the federal government instituted the " Public Salary Tax Act of 1939 " .
This
Act is a municipal law of the District of Columbia for taxing all federal and state government employees and those who live and work in any " Federal area " .
Now , the government knows it cannot tax those state Citizens who live and work outside the territorial jurisdiction of Article I , Section 8 , Clause 17 ( 1:8:17 ) or Article 4 , Section 3 , Clause 2 ( 4:3:2 ) in the U.S. Constitution .
So , in 1940 , Congress passed the " Buck Act " , 4 U.S.C.S. Sections 105 - 113 .
In Section 110 (e ) , this Act authorized any department of the federal government to create a " Federal area " for imposition of the " Public Salary Tax Act of 1939 " .
This tax is imposed at 4 U.S.C.S. Sec. 111 .
The rest of the taxing law is found in the Internal Revenue Code .
The Social Security Board had already created a " Federal area " overlay .
4 U.S.C.S. Sec. 110(d ) .
The term " State " includes any Territory or possession of the United States .
4 U.S.C.S. Sec. 110(e ) .
The term " Federal area " means any lands or premises held or acquired by or for the use of the United States or any department , establishment , or agency of the United States ; and any Federal area , or any part thereof which is located within the exterior boundaries of any State , shall be deemed to be a Federal area located within such State .
There is no reasonable doubt that the federal " State " is imposing an excise tax under the provisions of 4 U.S.C.S. Section 105 , which states in pertinent part :
Sec. 105 . State , and so forth , taxation affecting Federal areas ; sales or use tax
( a) No person shall be relieved from liability for payment of , collection of , or accounting for any sales or use tax levied by any State , or by any duly constituted taxing authority therein , having jurisdiction to levy such tax , on the ground that the sale or use , with respect to which such tax is levied , occurred in whole or in part within a Federal area ; and such State or taxing authority shall have full jurisdiction and power to levy and collect any such tax in any Federal area within such State to the same extent and with the same effect as though such area was not a Federal area .
Irrespective of what the tax is called , if its purpose is to produce revenue , it is an income tax or a receipts tax under the Buck Act [ 4 U.S.C.A , Secs , 105 - 110 ] .
Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. Calvert , 464 SW 2d. 170 ( 1971 ) , affd ( Tex ) 478 SW 2d. 926 , cert . den. 409 U.S. 967 , 34 L.Ed. 2d . 234 , 93S. Ct. 293 .
Thus , the obvious question arises :
What is a " Federal area " ?
A " Federal area " is any area designated by any agency , department , or establishment of the federal Government .
This includes the Social Security areas designated by the Social Security Administration , any public housing area that has federal funding , a home that has a federal bank loan , a road that has federal funding , and almost everything that the federal government touches through any type of aid .
Springfield v. Kenny , 104 N.E , 2d 65 ( 1951 App. ) .
This " Federal area " attaches to anyone who has a Social Security Number or any personal contact with the federal or state governments .
Through this mechanism , the federal government usurped the Sovereignty of the People , as well as the Sovereignty of the several states , by creating " Federal areas " within the boundaries of the states under the authority of Article 4 , Section 3 , Clause 2 ( 4:3:2 ) in the federal Constitution , which states :
2 . The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States , and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular State .
Therefore , all U.S. citizens [ i.e , citizens of the District of Columbia ] residing in one of the states of the Union , are classified as property , as franchisees of the federal government , and as an " individual entity " .
See Wheeling Steel Corp , v. Fox , 298 U.S. 193 , 80 L.Ed.
1143 , 56 S. Ct , 773 .
Under the " Buck Act " , 4 U.S.C.S. Secs. 105-113 , the federal government has created a " Federal area " within the boundaries of all the several states .
This area is similar to any territory that the federal government acquires through purchase , conquest or treaty , thereby imposing federal territorial law upon all people in this " Federal area " .
Federal territorial law is evidenced by the Executive Branch 's yellow - fringed U.S. flag flying in schools , offices and all courtrooms .
To see the civilian flag click here .
You must live on land in one of the states in the Union of several states , not in any " Federal State " or " Federal area " , nor can you be involved in any activity that would make you subject to " federal laws " .
You cannot have a valid Social Security Number , a " resident " driver 's license , a motor vehicle registered in your name , a " federal " bank account , a Federal Register Account Number relating to Individual persons [ SSN ] , ( see Executive Order Number 9397 , November 1943 ) , or any other known " contract implied in fact " that would place you within any " Federal area " and thus within the territorial jurisdiction of the municipal laws of Congress , Remember , all acts of Congress are territorial in nature and only apply within the territorial jurisdiction of Congress .
( See American Banana Co , v. United Fruit Co. , 213 U.S. 347 , 356-357 ( 1909 ) ; U.S. v. Spelar , 338 U.S. 217 , 222 , 94 L.Ed. 3 , 70 S , Ct. 10 ( 1949 ) ; New York Central R.R. Co , v. Chisholm , 268 U.S. 29 , 31-32 , 69 L.Ed , 828 , 45 S. Ct. 402 ( 1925 ) . )
There has been created a fictional Federal " State within a state " .
See Howard v. Sinking Fund of Louisville , 344 U.S. 624 , 73 S. Ct. 465 , 476 , 97 L.Ed , 617 ( 1953 ) ; Schwartz v. O'Hara TP. School Dist. , 100 A. 2d , 621 , 625 , 375 Pa. 440 , ( Compare also 31 C.F.R. Parts 51.2 and 52.2 , which also identify a fictional State within a state . )
This fictional " State " is identified by the use of two - letter abbreviations like " CA " , " AZ " and " TX " , as distinguished from the authorized abbreviations like " Calif . " , " Ariz . " and " Tex. " , etc .
This fictional State also uses ZIP codes which are within the municipal , exclusive legislative jurisdiction of Congress .
This entire scheme was accomplished by passage of the " Buck Act " , 4 U.S.C.S. Secs. 105-113 , to implement the application of the " Public Salary Tax Act of 1939 " to workers within the private sector .
This subjects all private sector workers who have a Social Security number to all state and federal laws " within this State " , a " fictional Federal area " overlaying the land in California and in all other states in the Union .
In California , this is established by California Form 590 , Revenue and Taxation .
All you have to do is to state that you live in California .
This establishes that you do not live in a " Federal area " and that you are exempt from the Public Salary Tax Act of 1939 and also from the California Income Tax for residents who live " in this State " .
The following definition is used throughout the several states in the application of their municipal laws which require some sort of contract for proper application .
This definition is also included in all the codes of California , Nevada , Arizona , Utah and New York :
" In this State " or " in the State " means within the exterior limits of the State ... and includes all territories within such limits owned or ceded to the United States of America .
This definition concurs with the " Buck Act " supra which states :
110(d ) The term " State " includes any Territory or possession of the United States .
110(e ) The term " Federal area " means any lands or remises held or acquired by or for the use of the United States or any department , establishment , or agency of the United States ; and any Federal area , or any part thereof which is located within the exterior boundaries of any State , shall be deemed to be a Federal area located within such State .
So , do some research .
I have given you all the proper directions in which to look for the jurisdictional nexus that places you within the purview of the federal government .
What can you do ?
Wake up !
Get active !!!!
Do something !!!
Do a little research !
We can all do something - no matter how seemingly insignificant .
We can : pass along pamphlets like this one .
We can attend weekly meetings assembled for no other purpose than to figure out what to do .
We can attend city and county council meetings and see that our servants do n't steal the store .
We can participate in local and state elections .
The federal elections are reported to be totally rigged .
We can have a positive influence on local and state affairs , PTAs and school boards .
It takes little more than writing a letter , sending a FAX or making a phone call to your various servants .
They listen when enough of us take the time to get their attention .
" Hey !
Buddy !
You work for We The People ! not the Japanese , the bankers or Europeans .
You will take care of our business and do it right ! "
If your local servants refuse to obey the Constitution and your neighbors get someone who will to run for their office , Then get out there and make sure they get elected .
This is the only way We The People can take back our government from the special interest groups .
This is happening all over the country .
Counties have been taken back in Indiana , Alabama , New Mexico , Nevada and California .
Why not yours ?
It is a simple thing to do .
Do it !
Millions of Americans are beginning to find out who they really are and who the government really is .
We are the government .
" Compelling a freeborn , Sovereign American individual to do anything , except upon the verdict of a Common Law Jury , constitutes an enforcement of the alien and evil Roman Civil ( Equity ) Law and is in fact fascist totalitarianism . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Gasoline prices fell Sunday , bringing down the nationwide average in a motorist group survey by more than 42 cents overall from a mid-July high .
The price of regular unleaded gasoline at the pump fell four - tenths of a cent to $ 3.688 a gallon , according to the Daily Fuel Gauge Report from motorist advocacy group AAA and the Oil Price Information Service .
The average is based on credit card swipes at 100,000 service stations .
Prices have fallen 10.4 % since hitting a record high of $ 4.114 a gallon on July 17 .
The dip comes after U.S. crude for October delivery saw the largest drop in 17 years , closing down $ 6.59 to settle at $ 114.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Gas prices remain about 99 cents , or 33.7 % , higher than a year ago .
State prices : Gasoline exceeded $ 4 a gallon in two states , Hawaii and Alaska , according to the survey .
Alaska had the highest prices at $ 4.536 a gallon , down a penny from the previous day .
Hawaii prices averaged $ 4.410 , followed by Utah at $ 3.970 , Idaho at $ 3.961 and California at $ 3.960 .
Missouri had the cheapest gas , with prices falling to $ 3.443 a gallon .
Prices in South Carolina were the second lowest at $ 3.457 , followed by Tennessee at $ 3.484 .
Ethanol :
The price of E85 , an 85 % blend of corn - derived ethanol available to some vehicles , rose to $ 3.020 a gallon on average from $ 3.014 , AAA reported .
Ethanol burns cleaner than gasoline but has a lower energy content and burns less efficiently in flex fuel vehicles .
Diesel :
The average price for diesel fuel , which is used in most trucks and commercial vehicles , fell by a penny to $ 4.305 a gallon from $ 4.311 the day before , according to AAA .
The price of diesel has risen 47 % over the past 12 months .
Because of its use in transporting goods , high priced diesel can help drive up the prices of products and services .
Drivers in Hawaii , the state with the most expensive diesel , paid an average of $ 5.308 a gallon for diesel .
Diesel was cheapest in Missouri , where prices fell to an average of $ 4.038 .
Long term trends :
Gas prices have dropped a little more than 15 cents in the past two weeks , the publisher of a national survey said Sunday .
The latest Lundberg Survey , carried out on Friday , found an average price of $ 3.70 for a gallon of self - serve regular .
The survey tallies prices at thousands of gas stations across the nation .
Publisher Trilby Lundberg attributed the fall to the drop in demand and the fact that gas refiners and retailers did not pass on higher expenses to their customers .
Because gas demand typically goes down in September , prices could continue to fall , Lundberg said
The city with the cheapest gas on average in the Lundberg Survey was St. Louis , Missouri , at $ 3.37 .
Drivers in Anchorage , Alaska , where the average price of gas was $ 4.34 , paid the most .
Here are average prices of a gallon of self - serve regular in some other cities :

Liberal radio host Ed Schultz storms off Fox & Friends David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday October 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Liberal talk radio host Ed Schultz voted with his feet on Friday morning and walked away in the middle of a broadcast of Fox and Friends rather than continue being interrupted and mocked by conservative Steve Malzberg .
The discussion was civil until a question was asked about " Joe the Plumber . "
Malzberg led off , insisting that even though the actual Joe Wurzelbacher would do far better under Obama 's tax plans , the real point is that raising taxes on the wealthy to give relief to the middle class removes any incentive for people to get rich .
" That 's Marxism , my friend , " he proclaimed .
Schultz began to reply that his own sons own a construction firm and that " we really like the Obama plan .
We 're going to get some tax credits that we would n't get under the McCain ... "
At that point , Malzberg interrupted to ask , " Do you make more than 250 Ed ?
Does it make more than 250 ? "
" You know , Steve , I did n't interrupt you , " Schultz replied .
As Malzberg continued trying to talk over him , he objected , " This happens every time I go on the air with you .
You always torpedo everybody . "
" Oh , stop complaining , " sneered Malzberg .
A few moments later , as host Brian Kilmeade tried to talk over both of them with another question , Schultz , who was on his own set and not in the Fox studio , got up and walked away from the camera .
The Fox hosts were stunned .
" What , did he leave ? " asked Kilmeade .
" Wow , " added Gretchen Carlson .
" How sensitive do you have to be ? " said Kilmeade .
" One line and he storms out . "
" It was a decent question because he says he 's going to get tax credits , " Malzberg insisted .
He then sneered , " It must be a pretty rotten business . "
" I think he just wants to be on YouTube , " Carlson concluded .

If only the US was the only country experiencing stock market problems .
China ’s Shanghai exchange is about one third of its peak number last November .
Russia had been experiencing a big boom in recent years courtesy of the oil run but they may be coming to an end , which could mean instability in Russia .
Russia halted stock and bond trading on Wednesday amid the worst market falls since the country ’s 1998 financial collapse and the Finance Ministry pledged a total of $ 60 billion of funds to help local banks .
Trading in shares , bonds and mutual funds on Russia ’s MICEX and RTS exchanges was suspended after less than two hours , preventing further selling on top of Tuesday ’s record - breaking falls .
It was not clear when the bourses would reopen .
“ The crisis has a shade of panic to it .
The decision to stop trading was motivated by the desire to remove this panic element , ” said Stanislav Ponomarenko , head of research for Russia at ING bank .
Russian stocks , once touted by the government as a safe haven , have now plunged around 60 percent since May .
Traders say global financial turmoil mixed with falling oil prices and Moscow ’s war with Georgia have formed a lethal cocktail .
“ We do n’t give a damn anymore as to what happens in the West .
The market is falling as people are in dire need for cash , ” said Maxim Gulevich , director of equities trading at UBS .
The Kremlin was silent on the crisis on Wednesday but Deputy Finance Minister Pyotr Kazakevich , announcing new measures to boost liquidity , said there was no fundamental problem .
“ What we have on the market is mainly a confidence crisis and only secondly a liquidity crisis , ” Kazakevich said .

Sen. Carl Levin USA TODAY file
The IRS is pursuing " numerous " investigations of financial institutions that helped foreign investors avoid federal taxes on U.S. stock dividends through allegedly abusive off - shore transactions , the tax agency 's top official told Congress Thursday .
IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman made the disclosure at a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing spotlighting evidence that Lehman Brothers , Morgan Stanley , Deutsche Bank , UBS , Merrill Lynch , Citigroup and other financial firms have marketed the transactions to off - shore hedge funds and other non-U.S. investors .
" The IRS has numerous active investigations of the type of transactions we are discussing today , " Shulman said in response to questions by Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , chairman of the subcommittee .
The tax agency 's investigators will also examine the potentially abusive off - shore transactions the Senate panel uncovered through its examination of scores of e-mails and other documents from major financial firms , Shulman said .
While he declined to discuss specifics of the investigations , Shulman said " when we see transactions that appear to be abusive , under my tenure , we will challenge them . "
Levin welcomed the cooperation pledge .
But he nonetheless contended the IRS and Treasury Department " sat on their hands " over the last decade " even as dividend tax - dodging took hold and became an open secret among market insiders . "
Under the U.S. tax code , foreign investors are required to pay a 30 % federal tax rate on dividends they receive from American companies .
But the Senate report found that financial firms have devised strategies — often equity swaps or stock loans routed through offshore transactions — to duck the tax requirement .
According to the subcommittee , the strategies developed after a 1991 IRS rule that exempted offshore institutions and individuals from federal taxes on payments received via stock swaps .
In what the report called " one of the most blatant " strategies , an offshore hedge fund executes an agreement with a financial institution several days before a U.S. firm pays its stock dividend .
Under the agreement , the hedge fund sells its holdings in that stock to the financial institution while replacing the shares with a swap agreement tied to the stock 's market performance .
After the dividend is issued , the offshore hedge fund gets a " dividend equivalent " equal to the amount paid by the U.S. firm , minus a fee for the financial institution .
The transaction enables the hedge fund to receive as much as 97 % of the dividend , instead of the 70 % it would have received had federal taxes been withheld .
Days after the dividend date , the hedge fund repurchases the stock and terminates the swap .
Levin said many equity swaps and stock loans are legitimate and not linked to tax evasion .
But the Senate report showed that the tax advantages of equity swaps to non-U.S. clients were well - known and lucrative among financial institutions : • Lehman Bros. calculated its Cayman Islands stock - lending operations produced $ 12 million in 2003 profit , and projected $ 25 million in 2004 gains .
When Microsoft announced a $ 3 - a - share special dividend in 2004 , a senior member of Lehman 's Equity Finance Products group outlined an effort to market " dividend enhancement " products to foreign institutions seeking to avoid taxes .
" Good progress so far this morning … I have interest my side for over 30 ( million ) shares … the cash register is opening !!!! " one Lehman employee responded in an e-mail obtained by the subcommittee .
" Let 's drain every last penny out of this ( market ) opportunity , " the senior official wrote in a responding e-mail received by the subcommittee .
Testifying before the Senate panel Thursday , John DeRosa , Lehman Brothers ' Global Tax Director , said the company " made every effort " to ensure that its policies complied with federal tax rules .
• Morgan Stanley estimated $ 25 million in 2004 revenue from dividend transactions .
Reacting to Microsoft 's 2004 special dividend , the head of Morgan Stanley 's equity swaps group urged early action to avoid transactions timed suspiciously close to the dividend date , according to an e-mail cited by the committee .
" Although the special is slated for November , we do NOT want to put on trades close to record date .
Tax risk increases dramatically , " the official wrote in an e-mail cited by the subcommittee .
Matthew Berke , Global Head of Equity Risk Management for Morgan Stanley , told the subcommittee the company 's practices with regard to dividend strategies were " totally compliant " with IRS rules and " on the conservative end of the spectrum . "
• Deutsche Bank reported that its stock loans generated $ 4 million in 2007 profit .
A March 2007 e-mail obtained by the Senate panel showed that Deutsche Bank traders promoted dividend - related swaps : " ( D ) o you want to trade 1,908,100 shares of MO ( Altria Group ) US and 150,000 shares of RAI ( Reynolds American ) ?
We can give you 97.5 % of the dividends on those names ( . ) "
Andrea Leung , Global Head of Synthetic Equity Finance at Deutsche Bank , testified that the company 's practices did not represent a tax dodge and were " entirely legal under existing law . "
Levin , citing ambiguities surrounding IRS rules on equity swaps and stock loans , said Shulman and Treasury officials should clarify the issue .
Shulman agreed to provide a tax agency response by next year .

If you do n't think that the iPhone is the wonder product of the century , then maybe this will convince you .
Citigroup analyst Tony
Wible thinks that the iPhone will not only drive Apple 's stock into the stratosphere but revive the fortunes of struggling Sirius ( SIRI ) .
Sirius ' value , reasons Wible , is tied to the value of its content , which he thinks is superb .
Given this advantage , Wible thinks that iPhones and products like it could enhance the value of Sirius :
Reports of a new internet streaming application that would allow SIRI users to get content on their iPhones and other portable devices are now emerging and highlight that SIRI 's value lies in its content and not its hardware or infrastructure .
We maintain that SIRI will continue to gain share in the audio entertainment industry as it offers long tail content that is proprietary , unique , fresh , and simple .
The fact that about 50 % of new OEM customers still elect to pay for satellite radio despite the challenging macro environment supports this view .
Wible thinks that a partnership with Apple would help Sirius in several key areas .
It would allow SIRI to save on radio costs , generate tons of new subs at low cost , and allow Sirius greater access to Apple 's library of music :
While AAPL is generally perceived as a competitor to satellite radio , the streaming application underscores that it may complement and help satellite radio as the new application would : 1 ) eliminate SIRI radio costs ; 2 ) help generate new subs at a lower cost ( albeit with a higher royalty rate given the internet streaming ) ; and 3 ) likely improve the ability to purchase tracks from AAPL .
Finally ,
Wible thinks that SIRI bears fail to appreciate that satellite radio and Apple products could have considerable synergies :
SIRI bears argue that AAPL 's products will take share from SIRI , but we disagree as both MP3 players and satellite radio have unique advantages that leads us to believe both will co-exist .
New satellite radio plans create a greater opportunity for synergies between the two .
Wible still has a Buy on Sirius , as he thinks the market continues to undervalue merger synergies .
Wible reiterates his $ 6.50 price target .

Shipwrecks on coral reefs appear to increase the invasion of alien species .
A US Geological Survey study finds unwanted species completely overtake the shipwreck and eventually the surrounding reef , eliminating all native corals and dramatically decreasing the diversity of other reef organisms .
Sadly , we ’ve been deliberately sinking ships for decades , imagining they might “ anchor ” healthy new reef communities .
But the new study published in the open access journal PloS One is the first to document how manmade structures rapidly destroy the coral community .
The study was conducted at Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the central Pacific .
This remote area has seen little human activity since WWII .
Scientists began surveying a 1991 shipwreck in 2004 .
Since then , they ’ve observed exponentially increasing populations of a anemonelike animal , Rhodactis howesii , around the wreck .
The densities decrease with distance from the ship .
Although Rhodactis are rare to absent in other parts of the atoll , they ’re also populous around buoys .
The exact relationship between shipwreck and Rhodactis is unknown .
But one possibility is that iron leaching from the ship ( and mooring buoys ’ chains ) somehow promotes the growth of R. howesii .
Given the sheer speed of ecosystem changes , the researchers doubt that even the removal of the shipwreck will halt the alien invasion .
Will this be our epitaph ?
Veering from one tragic phase shift to another .
The ship that sank was a longliner — among the most horrifically destructive technologies ever invented .
. . and still deadly , even in death .

In his epic poem , " The Divine Comedy , " Dante Alighieri outlined -- based on earlier religious writings -- what Christians call the " seven deadly sins , " a classification of vices to educate and instruct followers due to man 's tendency to stray from the righteous path .
Centuries later , these sins -- gluttony , envy , lust , pride , sloth , anger and greed -- still remain front and center in theology and have also been a source of inspiration for writers , artists and filmmakers .
But webmasters as well ?
Over the years , I have seen my fair share of websites , both good and bad .
Interestingly enough , there 's often more to be learned from " sinful " websites -- those that violate clear principles of good website design , create frustrating experiences for visitors , drive customers away and damage their overall brands or businesses .
Although the consequences of website sins may not include eternal damnation , many businesses are committing these same seven deadly sins online , thereby diminishing their ability to connect with prospects and customers .
Let 's take a look at how each sin applies to the fundamental do's and don'ts of website design .
Gluttony
Gluttony is the overindulgence of anything to the point of waste and is often used in the context of eating .
Although web businesses may not have an eating disorder , they often become gluttons of content .
All too often , websites feature too much stuff -- a cluttered design , too many links or a layout that looks like it was designed by committee .
Every page on your website should have a goal -- a purpose .
If you can't clearly articulate that purpose , then maybe you should n't have that page .
Crowded sites usually distract visitors from getting to that goal , which may be reading the most important information , clicking on the essential link , registering for the email newsletter , buying your product and so on .
In most cases , less is more .
Identify the most important value statements , and then layer additional content so that visitors who want extra information can click to access .
Time and time again , multivariable experiments have demonstrated that reducing the amount of copy , reducing the number of required forms in a field or just generally de-cluttering a site can improve conversion rates .
Envy
Envy is about wanting what others have .
In business , this often translates to the temptation to imitate other companies , including competitors .
Certainly , there may be sites that you admire , and online design and marketing practitioners should always seek out best practices .
However , you need to resist the urge to copy or use similar design principles or incorporate every cool new widget that others are employing .
Trying new ideas is always good and should be encouraged , but remember the fundamentals :
Who are your visitors ?
What are they looking for ?
What content and technology helps them walk down a certain path ?
Not all companies need to be on the bleeding edge .
In fact , we 've seen instances where companies have added Web 2.0 functionality , only to see their conversion rates actually drop after implementation .
It is best to keep in mind that what works for other companies , including your competitors , may not work for your audience .
Very often , winning designs and elements are counterintuitive .
For example , my company worked with an online retailer that insisted that its order buttons be a certain color -- not because of branding reasons , but because of assumed best practices .
The company thought green would be the best color because " green means go , and red means stop . "
Well , through an optimization experiment , we indeed learned that the red button actually performed better and increased conversions .
Lust
It 's hard to imagine a website being lustful ( assuming you are not in one of those industries ) .
However , sites often attempt to be " sexy " -- trying really hard to get your attention , perhaps by being overly flashy .
Like the sin of being envious of the next cool technology , we have found that many sites tend to overuse , or improperly use , technologies like Flash and video .
Rich internet applications ( RIAs ) are certainly the wave of the future , and if used well , they can provide a truly engaging and informative experience for your customers .
Unfortunately , more often than not , these " rich " applications can distract visitors from the true goal of the site .
For example , we 've seen companies insert video in the middle of the shopping cart path .
Imagine standing in a check - out line at the grocery store , anxious to get home and cook dinner , and the clerk tells you to " watch this short movie before checking out . "
Before implementing RIAs , ask yourself , " Does this help move the visitor along the intended business path ? "
Like the " less is more " principle outlined in the sin of gluttony , often simpler navigation and simpler presentation of content maximize conversion rates .
Pride
In religious references , pride -- the excessive love of self -- is often considered the most serious of the seven deadly sins .
This is actually consistent with one of the long - time axioms of marketing : understand your customers and speak from their point of view .
Yet despite this axiom , many companies have a self - focused web presence that talks about their own businesses , not about their customers ' issues .
Successful websites are not purely about the company but rather should speak from the visitors ' perspective .
If your mission statement starts with something like , " We strive to be the best at ... , " then you are already off base .
Do n't be in love with what you already have , and do n't assume your customers know what you know .
Many seasoned web designers would be surprised to learn how often customers claim it is difficult to find crucial information on websites -- information that designers always thought was in an obvious location .
Another example of pride is a bit more literal .
Have you visited a website that prominently displays the CEO 's photo on the homepage ?
Fortunately , this is not done often , but when it is , the marketer likely has little political recourse .
( " Hey boss , you 're great , but let 's get your ugly mug off the website . " ) .
However , in multiple experiments that we have conducted with clients , every time the CEO 's picture was removed , visitor conversions went up .
Unless the CEO is famous and recognizable and the association with him or her adds credibility to your business , lose the ego and the photo .
Sloth
Although this sin is my personal favorite -- particularly on a Sunday afternoon during football season -- there are a number of ways sloth manifests itself online and hurts your business .
First and foremost is the technical side of sloth :
Does your site take a long time to load ?
Does the design of the site , including the inclusion of rich applications , create a slow , frustrating experience for your visitors ?
Sloth can also be fairly literal , as in laziness in responding to your customers .
Recently , I sent an email to the customer service department of a big online retail chain through a link on their site ( a link that was difficult to find , by the way ) .
By the time the company responded , four days later , I 'd already deserted its site and purchased my item from one of its competitors .
But perhaps most important -- and certainly most prevalent -- is the lazy tendency of businesses to treat online visitors as if they are all alike .
Today , excellent technologies exist to provide a targeted , relevant experience to visitor segments .
Visitor segments can be defined by a host of criteria ( e.g. , how they got to your site , demographics , location , time , day , etc. ) .
It is frankly just slothful not to take the relatively small amount of time , energy and money required to provide the best experience for all of your visitors .
Improving customer targeting and engagement alone will make a dramatic improvement in your online business .
Anger
While it is fairly self - evident that a company should not show anger toward its customers , we sometimes see companies patronizing or scaring their visitors .
The former often manifests when a company 's site is too pushy or tries to hard - sell its visitors .
For example , the website of Lenox Financial Mortgage proudly states , " It 's the biggest no brainer in the history of mankind . "
Really ?
I 'd hardly call a mortgage the biggest no brainer in the history of mankind .
Even before the current financial meltdown , this was a ridiculous statement .
Never talk down to your customer .
Once a visitor sees a headline like this , the company immediately loses credibility , and the visitor goes elsewhere .
In the context of scaring customers , website optimization experiments have shown that negative assurance language ( e.g. , " no spam " or " no spyware " ) often decreases conversion rates .
This negative assurance language may only inform visitors of a problem they did n't know they had and make them think twice before buying .
By the way , our website optimization tests show that positive assurance language like " satisfaction guaranteed " tends to work .
Greed
In the movie " Wall Street , " Gordon Gekko famously declared , " Greed is good . "
The impact of this mindset may be particularly acute in the context of the current financial crisis , and as you can imagine , greed is often " bad " on the web .
This may manifest itself in websites asking their visitors for too much information .
For example , we 've seen many website forms asking for a fax number .
Do you really need a visitor 's fax number ?
If you can cut down on the information you require the visitor to provide , conversion rates will almost always go up .
For example , Delta Air Lines made some simple changes to a web form on its site , including removal of the " suffix " name field , and those changes drove a dramatic increase in revenue .
Always ask yourself if you are requiring visitors to commit too much before being allowed to work with you .
For example , do they really need to register before viewing some of your content ?
Another way that businesses demonstrate greed online is the obsessive pursuit of search engine optimization ( SEO ) .
Although a strong SEO strategy should be a cornerstone of your web presence , very often businesses load up their site with content for SEO purposes .
Greed for the Google spider often creates a bad experience for the humans visiting your site .
The path to heaven
Most companies that step back and honestly evaluate their websites quickly discover that they are bigger sinners than they had realized .
Redemption is often only achieved by a comprehensive program of website optimization through multivariable testing and content targeting .
This helps you discover what works for each of your customer segments , provides an engaging experience for all visitors and supports your online business goals .
Whether you are a religious person or not , walking the righteous road and avoiding these deadly -- yet common -- sins will ultimately lead to website design salvation .

Michiganders will vote next week on two hot - button health - care topics : medical marijuana and stem cell research .
Here 's a link to the text of both ballot initiatives .
The medical marijuana measure would allow marijuana use , when approved by a physician , for " debilitating medical conditions " such as AIDS , cancer and glaucoma .
A patient or the patient 's registered primary caregiver would be allowed to grow up to 12 plants .
And the patient would be allowed to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana .

More details
The team , led by researchers from Princeton University , found that the insects are capable of flying up to 85 miles ( 137 km ) in a day .
Writing in the journal Biology Letters , the group describes how it tracked the movements by attaching tiny radio transmitters to the insects .
A scientific posse followed the signals from a receiving aeroplane .
Other researchers monitored the insects ' progress from the ground .
Tricks of the trade
The dragonflies ' route took them along the east coast of America towards the warmer south .
The data revealed that the dragonflies ' migration patterns are strikingly similar to those of songbirds , suggesting there is a strong evolutionary link to their behaviours .

" It is just possible what we are seeing here are the basic primitive rules of migration and that birds converged on the tricks of the trade , " he told Science In Action on the BBC World Service .
Billions of common green darner dragonflies ( Anax junius ) migrate every year but until now hardly anything was known about their routes or strategy .
The new research shows there is method behind the insects ' flight behaviour .
For example , the dragonflies tended to only move after two nights of cooler temperatures , indicating a cold front was approaching with favourable north - westerly winds .
They also tended to change direction when they met a large body of water , ensuring they never became stranded out over the sea .
Two insects were recorded flying out over the ocean before reversing and skirting down the coastline .
The detailed flight path information was made possible by tiny radio transmitters developed by the team .
Final destination
Each transmitter weighed about a third of a gram and had enough battery life to track an individual for 10 days ; but tagging such small creatures is far from easy .
" The challenge is first catching the dragonfly , " said Professor Wilcove .
Once caught , each transmitter was attached with a couple of drops of superglue and some eye - lash adhesive .
However , the final destination of the green darners is still not known because of the power restraints of the transmitter set - up ; and some individuals simply flew out of range of the scientists .
In the future , the team hopes to refine its techniques and make the tracking even more hi-tech .
" The dream scenario would be to get a satellite to pick up the signals from these transmitters , " said Professor Wilcove .
" If you had a satellite like that you could [ follow the migration of ] all kinds of birds , dragonflies , and locusts ; and , I think , it would shed tremendous light on the movements of these organisms . "
